00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:19,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright thanks everyone for coming</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

2
00:00:14,309 --> 00:00:21,990
our talk I hope you<font color="#E5E5E5"> enjoy our talk he is</font>

3
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:23,880
a bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> weird sometimes because you know</font>

4
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:26,609
besides<font color="#E5E5E5"> this purely security conference</font>

5
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:28,919
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> our talk is actually mix between a</font>

6
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:31,080
bit of business we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't date science in</font>

7
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:33,059
a bit of security I think you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys will</font>

8
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:36,780
find<font color="#E5E5E5"> it interesting but hey give us some</font>

9
00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:38,578
<font color="#CCCCCC">feedback idea so our agenda for today is</font>

10
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:40,260
this one we're going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> swing to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

11
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:43,410
guys who we are and why we're talking

12
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:45,809
<font color="#CCCCCC">about this where we use machine learning</font>

13
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:47,010
and data science in<font color="#E5E5E5"> cyber security we're</font>

14
00:00:45,809 --> 00:00:49,169
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about something called</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

15
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:51,718
image workflow which my colleagues<font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font>

16
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:53,610
explain after what it is we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk a</font>

17
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:55,440
little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about what it takes to</font>

18
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:57,449
analyze an image in an automated form

19
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,910
and also talk a little bit about data

20
00:00:57,449 --> 00:01:01,949
visualization when I said you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know just</font>

21
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:03,839
now<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we're gonna</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk business did</font>

22
00:01:01,949 --> 00:01:06,179
science in security it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly those</font>

23
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,130
topics so security in general because

24
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:11,100
the data were playing with<font color="#E5E5E5"> it security</font>

25
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:12,780
related data science because image

26
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:14,429
analysis in the business part because

27
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:16,140
you guys can have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the best dates in the</font>

28
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:17,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">world but if you don't have a proper way</font>

29
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:21,960
to show you to your clients it's not

30
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:24,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">really worth much so my name is genetic</font>

31
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:26,100
I'm CEO of binary edge and the team

32
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:30,329
that's presenting here today all belongs

33
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:32,309
to binary edge yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> Florentino is our</font>

34
00:01:30,329 --> 00:01:33,839
date engineer he takes<font color="#E5E5E5"> care of all the</font>

35
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:36,479
plumbing that involves between us

36
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,610
getting the data and sending it from 15

37
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:42,750
to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other two one place to the other</font>

38
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:45,509
he takes<font color="#E5E5E5"> care of all that philippa she</font>

39
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:47,909
does a proper part of this size in

40
00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:49,590
machine learning it at spider eh she

41
00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:52,649
works with models of machine learning

42
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:54,899
she does data quality and<font color="#CCCCCC"> elijah said</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> no</font>

43
00:01:52,649 --> 00:01:56,430
we're not losing some results or that we

44
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:59,520
can optimize algorithms in scanning

45
00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:00,930
things like that and<font color="#CCCCCC"> anna and receives</font>

46
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,908
all of these data from us and then

47
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:04,409
transforms it in a way that is<font color="#CCCCCC"> useful</font>

48
00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:07,200
for our clients<font color="#E5E5E5"> and people who have</font>

49
00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:09,119
already<font color="#E5E5E5"> stated and they're all going to</font>

50
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,280
talk about their different areas as a

51
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:13,020
whole it might seem<font color="#CCCCCC"> like four different</font>

52
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,690
talks but it hasn't understand that this

53
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:17,250
is a pipeline there is me telling them i

54
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:19,379
want this data I'm the business

55
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:21,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">requirement</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they're sorrentinos and</font>

56
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:22,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">filippo working making sure we get that</font>

57
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:24,989
data correctly<font color="#CCCCCC"> we transport and data</font>

58
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:26,369
correctly then there's Anna transforming

59
00:02:24,989 --> 00:02:29,180
my requirements into something<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can</font>

60
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:32,400
indeed to the people that<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask that of me</font>

61
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:34,530
if I had to describe binary edge this is

62
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,790
the perfect image to describe it we play

63
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:38,459
with machine learning we have some

64
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:41,370
hacking skills security these are domain

65
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:43,560
expertise lots of statistics because you

66
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:45,180
know you can put it in fancy way but

67
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:50,220
machine learning the<font color="#E5E5E5"> device is just you</font>

68
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:52,200
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> diversity so happy exactly did we</font>

69
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:55,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">get here to mix data science</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

70
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:58,429
security right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now binary edge scans 200</font>

71
00:02:55,590 --> 00:03:01,500
ports of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the entire ipv4 space per month</font>

72
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:04,440
that's about 1.4 billion of events a

73
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:06,599
month and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then we also do torrent</font>

74
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:08,760
monitoring right now that number is way

75
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:11,488
way bigger were monitoring way more than

76
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:13,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">700 46,000 and this keeps increasing</font>

77
00:03:11,489 --> 00:03:14,940
every month and it also generates a lot

78
00:03:13,409 --> 00:03:17,790
of effects so as<font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys can imagine</font>

79
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:21,239
we've got is huge using a buzzword later

80
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:22,769
like and we did it away not only<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you</font>

81
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:24,720
know make it useful<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our clients but</font>

82
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:26,909
also for us do some exploratory data

83
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,109
analysis which brings us to interesting

84
00:03:26,909 --> 00:03:32,129
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll show you guys in a</font>

85
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:34,560
little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit uh when I say we scan the</font>

86
00:03:32,129 --> 00:03:36,149
entire ipv4 space he leads to things

87
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:39,450
like this this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is one way of</font>

88
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:41,430
representing our scans each of those

89
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:43,200
dots if you guys actually see the map

90
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:45,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">doesn't actually have any lies it's all</font>

91
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:48,480
based on geolocation and these are all

92
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:51,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">each dot is an IP address where</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we found</font>

93
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:53,010
some service running another way<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font>

94
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:55,319
also showing the same image it's like

95
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:57,540
this if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you see some color on the</font>

96
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:59,099
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> asm's its services that have</font>

97
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:00,870
been found<font color="#CCCCCC"> on IP addresses associated</font>

98
00:03:59,099 --> 00:04:02,609
with those a essence and essentially

99
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:04,650
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at different types of</font>

100
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:07,019
coverage that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have inside the</font>

101
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:11,700
geolocation coverage or coverage on

102
00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:13,709
differently SS associated with this type

103
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:16,019
of data<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this quantity of data as I</font>

104
00:04:13,709 --> 00:04:18,298
said many questions appear how many IP

105
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:21,329
addresses<font color="#CCCCCC"> did we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> find in job x versus</font>

106
00:04:18,298 --> 00:04:23,820
job why what's the most common service

107
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:25,000
on port 80 how many ssl certificates are

108
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:27,159
expired in

109
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,710
the entire world you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> and all of</font>

110
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:31,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">these questions led to a combination</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

111
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:33,520
two<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was the answer the</font>

112
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:36,040
exercise machine learning and that's how

113
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:39,250
we decide to create the team that now is

114
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:40,660
the day exciting so<font color="#CCCCCC"> the sites is</font>

115
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:42,640
actually pretty cool there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> different</font>

116
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:44,050
areas<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're separate</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things sometimes</font>

117
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:46,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">sometimes people confuse them a little</font>

118
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:48,430
bit so for the desire<font color="#CCCCCC"> to use it a lot</font>

119
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:50,680
for doing the initial analysis and

120
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:52,690
cleanup of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the data exploratory data</font>

121
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:53,680
analysis so you know actually extracting

122
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:55,630
some knowledge from this data

123
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,490
understanding you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know some correlations</font>

124
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:59,260
things like that did the visualization

125
00:04:57,490 --> 00:05:00,760
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will show</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you in a little bit and</font>

126
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:02,620
knowledge discovery as well which I'll

127
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:03,550
talk a little bit further machine

128
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:05,980
learning<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've got things like</font>

129
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:07,380
classification closing so joining things

130
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:09,790
together<font color="#E5E5E5"> in smaller groups</font>

131
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:12,219
identification similarity matching which

132
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:14,080
as well you guys see<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> being used on</font>

133
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:16,300
our image workflow which still show in a

134
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:18,609
little bit and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I've got a note on</font>

135
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:20,650
regression regression is usually used

136
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:23,110
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> things like forecasting and</font>

137
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:25,000
prediction it is my personal opinion and

138
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:27,210
do not make<font color="#CCCCCC"> it minor axis of inner this</font>

139
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,190
is my personal opinion<font color="#CCCCCC"> garrix that</font>

140
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:32,710
regression is not doesn't work<font color="#CCCCCC"> that well</font>

141
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:35,020
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> security and the reason for that or</font>

142
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:37,630
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the reasons is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these things</font>

143
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:39,130
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> now machine learning scenarios are</font>

145
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:42,790
opinion you've got lots of other style

146
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:44,290
scenarios so not even<font color="#CCCCCC"> the classifiers</font>

147
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:46,540
are working with people that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

148
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:50,260
are amicable and want them to be good

149
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:51,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">sometimes for prediction the scenarios</font>

150
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:54,130
and data are too volatile and you don't

151
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:55,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> proper sources of the chief data</font>

152
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:58,510
that you can use<font color="#CCCCCC"> to train your models</font>

153
00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:00,190
and of course the same thing for lack of

154
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:02,110
depth in quantity<font color="#CCCCCC"> and quality two</font>

155

of<font color="#E5E5E5"> work to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> done to actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> properly</font>

157
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:08,890
use machine learning in security what

158
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:10,690
I'm saying with this is it that machine

159
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:12,340
learning is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> useful in security no</font>

160
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:14,410
I'm just saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not a silver</font>

161
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:16,119
bullet you have to grab your problems

162
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:18,490
that you have insecurities break them

163
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:20,800
into smaller problems and about ten

164
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:22,419
percent of those small problems can be

165
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,530
solved with some technique in its<font color="#E5E5E5"> size</font>

166
00:06:22,419 --> 00:06:25,659
and machine learning but it's definitely

167
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:27,219
not a silver bullet and if anyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

168
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:31,390
trying to sell the product s as it is

they're lying<font color="#CCCCCC"> t um there are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some good</font>

170
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:35,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">cases of machine learning being news</font>

171
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:38,050
things like antivirus

172
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:39,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">10 detection</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ids is IPS</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just for source</font>

173
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:40,600
code analysis there are lots of people

174
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:43,150
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> done some really good progress</font>

175
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:45,700
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> that area and also for sentiment</font>

176
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:47,349
analysis of like emails tweets social

177
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:49,510
network of employees so you guys have

178
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:51,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">got a company and you know the twitter</font>

179

handles of their employees<font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys can</font>

180
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:54,220
collect some of the twin stick with

181
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:55,750
about the employee do some sentiment

182
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:58,330
analysis understand how they feel about

183
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:59,650
the employee and it's possible<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font>

184
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:01,570
can detect<font color="#E5E5E5"> some outliers that can</font>

185
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:04,150
possibly be some internal attackers but

186
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:09,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">again it's all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a bit of oak Oh spoken</font>

187
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:11,830
still but parts of it also work<font color="#E5E5E5"> um I</font>

188
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:13,630
could stay here all day<font color="#E5E5E5"> and talk to you</font>

189
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:17,320
guys about the link of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it collection</font>

190
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:21,280
this image<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know shows you what we</font>

191
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:22,840
currently acquired but I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

192
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,940
do that today I am showing you this

193
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:27,310
image however because I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just want to run</font>

194
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:30,880
to some use cases of why having all this

195
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:33,460
data is important and interesting anyone

196
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:37,230
knows what this image is representing or

197
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:41,650
anyone can guess let's do it that anyone

198
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:43,990
ok so the tree big balls that you see

199
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:46,630
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the three big circles the white the</font>

200
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:49,060
purple<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the blue where the three</font>

201
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:51,550
biggest data leaks that is actin this

202
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:53,440
year and that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was shared via torrent and</font>

203
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:55,330
essentially what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do is we grab these</font>

204
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:57,610
torrents we had our system monetary

205
00:07:55,330 --> 00:08:00,159
which means you can see which IPS are

206
00:07:57,610 --> 00:08:01,570
sharing that data and which ones are

207
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:04,030
sitting issues that are downloading it

208
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:06,159
all of that and the fun fact is then

209
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:07,799
when we cross the data we got from all

210
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:10,660
those three turrets as you guys can see

211
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:13,750
there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> some that downloaded you know</font>

212
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:15,460
two of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them we then cross this with</font>

213
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:18,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">trying to identify who those I he</font>

214
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:21,489
belongs to and fun fact all those IPS

215
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:24,370
and I don't belong to China or from

216
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:26,229
military institutions and you know this

217
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:28,060
is what it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting because all of</font>

218
00:08:26,229 --> 00:08:29,469
these data leaks were<font color="#E5E5E5"> of private</font>

219
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:31,390
governmental data from Turkey

220
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:33,849
Philippines and us if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I remember</font>

221
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:35,530
correctly so you know states are also

222
00:08:33,849 --> 00:08:37,089
monitoring<font color="#E5E5E5"> these type of stuff they're</font>

223
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:41,348
also not loading these like they are

224
00:08:37,089 --> 00:08:43,479
using<font color="#E5E5E5"> it for something another case this</font>

225
00:08:41,349 --> 00:08:48,360
one anyone wants to try and<font color="#CCCCCC"> guess what</font>

226
00:08:43,479 --> 00:08:51,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">it is again</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the ball</font>

227
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:57,360
an appointment so the red circle<font color="#E5E5E5"> down</font>

228
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:59,399
here was the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Turkish torrent that was</font>

229
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,779
leaked and we were quite lucky because

230
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:02,370
when this started was announced we were

231
00:09:00,779 --> 00:09:04,500
awake and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just start monitoring</font>

232
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:07,709
from the beginning<font color="#E5E5E5"> and there was what I</font>

233
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:10,110
few address this one right here<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was</font>

234
00:09:07,709 --> 00:09:12,479
sharing this data for a really long time

235
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:14,730
and straight from the beginning so it's

236
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:17,430
possible again this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> all interesting</font>

237
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:20,550
correlations right that there was the

238
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:23,790
initial seeds of that data from that we

239
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:25,859
triggered a query<font color="#E5E5E5"> on our other platform</font>

240
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:28,890
of port scanning and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then we found that</font>

241
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:31,470
that IP address belonged<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a Turkish</font>

242
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:34,649
government institution and add rdp

243
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:37,019
opening hard EP screenshot had an email

244
00:09:34,649 --> 00:09:39,420
on it that<font color="#E5E5E5"> email had a facebook account</font>

245
00:09:37,019 --> 00:09:41,880
associated with<font color="#E5E5E5"> it which was from a</font>

246
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:45,180
system administrator that<font color="#CCCCCC"> belonged to</font>

247
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:48,720
the same government institution that the

248
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:49,949
data leaked belonged to so again it's an

249
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,410
interesting correlation my<font color="#CCCCCC"> mommy</font>

250
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:54,600
anything maybe it does but there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the</font>

251
00:09:52,410 --> 00:10:01,860
possibility that the initial liquor of

252
00:09:54,600 --> 00:10:03,420
this was an internal person so as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

253
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:05,640
mentioned you know we've got lots of

254
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:07,829
types of data but today on this<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font>

255
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:13,019
we're just going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to focus on that tiny</font>

256
00:10:07,829 --> 00:10:14,519
tiny tiny piece over there why that

257
00:10:13,019 --> 00:10:16,949
piece is interesting because we<font color="#CCCCCC"> usually</font>

258
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:18,839
come to situations like these where we

259
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:22,949
get millions and millions of screenshots

260
00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:24,899
from VNC x11 rdp of the entire internet

261
00:10:22,949 --> 00:10:26,819
and we<font color="#CCCCCC"> needed a fast</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> way to search</font>

262
00:10:24,899 --> 00:10:28,320
through them because I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

263
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:29,670
waste<font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> time looking at with those lock</font>

264
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,320
screens I don't want to waste<font color="#CCCCCC"> my time</font>

265
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:34,319
looking at linda's consoles that are

266
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:37,589
locked I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see useful stuff and so</font>

267
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:40,589
did our clients so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> work on them</font>

268
00:10:37,589 --> 00:10:46,640
building this and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I let's hope the</font>

269
00:10:40,589 --> 00:10:51,959
internet works let's see does it work

270
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:54,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">cool so images as you guys can see these</font>

271
00:10:51,959 --> 00:10:58,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">are all screenshots that we take of the</font>

272
00:10:54,600 --> 00:11:04,589
entire internet and this is quite boring

273
00:10:58,709 --> 00:11:07,399
who<font color="#E5E5E5"> agrees cool so what if we wanted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

274
00:11:04,589 --> 00:11:09,810
look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> some really cool stuff like</font>

275
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:11,760
scallop anyone doesn't know who Scott

276
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:14,040
wats Holly's critical systems right

277
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,630
stuff that runs the water pipes the

278
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:19,319
stuff that runs your electricity to your

279
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:22,380
home things like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we want to search</font>

280
00:11:19,319 --> 00:11:24,959
for example for alarm in reality watch

281
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:28,529
this happens here<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did a search on the</font>

282
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:30,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">text that's inside these images I am not</font>

283
00:11:28,529 --> 00:11:34,680
searching<font color="#CCCCCC"> vendors I'm searching the text</font>

284
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:37,319
that's inside these images let's see i

285
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:41,399
typed alarm and as you can see right

286
00:11:37,319 --> 00:11:45,689

00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:08,800
similar images to that original image

330
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:10,120
what this allows is that if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> find</font>

00:14:52,670 --> 00:15:00,170
going back to our John Donnelly guy<font color="#E5E5E5"> um</font>

350
00:14:56,410 --> 00:15:02,120
he's got an email right here we extract

351
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:04,339
all these emails from these things and

352
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:05,960
we throw it against an API we have

353
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:08,750
internally that collects all data leaves

354
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:10,460
we find in forums if you guys have heard

355
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:12,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">of have I been</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bumped we've got a copy</font>

356
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:15,200
of her by me pond internally so we

357
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:17,360
automatically know there's this set of

358
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:19,730
IP addresses a local company they have

359
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:21,650
our vp open they have this user this

360
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:24,560
usually after<font color="#E5E5E5"> facebook profiles linkedin</font>

361
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:27,020
profiles there's they've got this email

362
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:29,089
that we extract from our DB and there

363
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:32,390
are present in these data leaks so it's

364
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:34,520
a lot a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of information and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm now</font>

374
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:18,740

<font color="#E5E5E5">fall to be within the loft so and that's</font>

376

where my privacy is a sunset essential

377
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:24,110
so as<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know then I just go lawyers</font>

caught our teepees and things like that

382
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:36,470
open because people still get protected

<font color="#CCCCCC">has been</font>

00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:46,220
I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> you see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a really long</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time</font>

388
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:47,480
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> now I'll pass over to Florentino who</font>

389
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:51,579
will actually talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you guys about</font>

390
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:55,040
some details on things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we do so now</font>

391
00:16:51,579 --> 00:16:59,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you have scared of love you I'm</font>

392
00:16:55,040 --> 00:17:04,099
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get really technical so you</font>

393
00:16:59,449 --> 00:17:06,199
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> saw a portal which is maybe the</font>

394
00:17:04,099 --> 00:17:08,329
best thing we have and it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

395
00:17:06,199 --> 00:17:11,299
interesting to take a look at what<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

396
00:17:08,329 --> 00:17:14,059
behind that portal so we gathered a lot

397
00:17:11,299 --> 00:17:16,490
of data about<font color="#E5E5E5"> these images and the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way</font>

398
00:17:14,059 --> 00:17:18,799
we provide that later and other sources

399
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:22,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">of data to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the portal is through my crap</font>

400
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:25,839
microservices right click yes we found

401
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:28,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">that this was a really simple way of</font>

402
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:31,549
creating an architecture that can deal

403
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:35,690
with several types of data and it's

404
00:17:31,549 --> 00:17:41,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">really lightweight so how do you get</font>

405
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:45,460
this thing when we scan the internet any

406
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:49,940
target there are types of scans those

407
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:54,350
for the ncrb pix11 that can or cannot

408
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:58,040
generate a spin shot and if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> get</font>

409
00:17:54,350 --> 00:18:00,860
screenshots we create a few of work that

410
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:04,909
we then sent to what we internally call

411
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:08,299
our image or foe now what is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this with</font>

412
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:10,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">the site that we wanted a robust way of</font>

413
00:18:08,299 --> 00:18:14,900
processing all these images and<font color="#E5E5E5"> a view</font>

414
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:18,559
as you might guess finding law was the

415
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:20,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">Technic faces running OCR this is kind</font>

416
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:24,889
of heavy so you needed to create

417
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:27,678
<font color="#CCCCCC">something that scale so there are</font>

418
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:30,320
options on the market to create things

419
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:33,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">that are distributed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and schedule but we</font>

420
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:35,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">did if we found that reading like any of</font>

421
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:38,809
them so we build our own and we did this

422
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:42,760
by creating simple<font color="#E5E5E5"> Python modules each</font>

423
00:18:38,809 --> 00:18:48,918
one responsible for a certain task and

424
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:53,000
blinking all of them and we have on the

425
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:54,230
cloud let's call it the<font color="#CCCCCC"> cube and we</font>

426
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,440
could work there and

427
00:18:54,230 --> 00:19:00,230
the modules just go there and pick work

428
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:02,929
what this<font color="#E5E5E5"> allows</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> us is that if you need</font>

429
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:05,480
more power for certain task you just

430
00:19:02,929 --> 00:19:09,770
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to know process equal</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to the others</font>

431
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:11,840
and it just needs<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go get more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

432
00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:14,929
you and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> start the data do it</font>

433
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:18,678
<font color="#E5E5E5">collects in the database this way you</font>

434
00:19:14,929 --> 00:19:21,260
can easily distribute and scale there

435
00:19:18,679 --> 00:19:24,710
are some concerns you have to do a lot

436
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:26,600
of error handling and stuff like that

437
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:28,850
and when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you work with the cloud they</font>

438
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:30,949
are lost lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of errors that you don't</font>

439
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:33,590
know that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to get so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

440
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:39,100
kind of an iterative<font color="#CCCCCC"> process and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

441
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:39,100
not perfect yet but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it works pretty good</font>

442
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:46,730
if you can afford using cloud services

443
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:50,270
do it because it takes a lot of work to

444
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:52,640
maintain a lot of aces and all of that

445
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:57,740
there are errors everywhere so if you

446
00:19:52,640 --> 00:20:02,660
can avoid that overhead please do so

447
00:19:57,740 --> 00:20:05,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">what exactly do we do when one of them</font>

448
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:07,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm going to talk about the workflow as</font>

449
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:10,460
a whole and not each module but

450
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:14,350
essentially we generate a notification

451
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:17,720
each time we get moving a screenshot and

452
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:20,750
we take<font color="#E5E5E5"> that image and we start by</font>

453
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:23,330
extracting the target metadata and then

454
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:25,460
we create<font color="#E5E5E5"> this signature in this</font>

455
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:29,120
signature you can think<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font>

456
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:32,510
including the whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> image extreme</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as you</font>

457
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:35,600
might<font color="#E5E5E5"> have guessed you lose detail but</font>

458
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:40,299
this allows for<font color="#CCCCCC"> fast comparison so how</font>

459
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:44,059
this works this is really a hash now for

460
00:20:40,299 --> 00:20:46,250
pretty much<font color="#E5E5E5"> most of you here when we</font>

461
00:20:44,059 --> 00:20:48,168
talk about ash even idiot we think about

462
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:51,620
cryptographic hashes and this is

463
00:20:48,169 --> 00:20:53,150
different cryptographic hashes and there

464
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:56,209
are more about the properties of the

465
00:20:53,150 --> 00:21:01,250
file<font color="#E5E5E5"> itself and this type of ash is</font>

466
00:20:56,210 --> 00:21:03,470
called a perceptual hash really takes

467
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:06,140
the properties of the image itself so

468
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:07,910
this allows<font color="#CCCCCC"> for an image that is</font>

469
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:11,840
slightly rotate the different color

470
00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:13,970
to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> classified as the same so when we</font>

471
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:17,179
receive an image we just generate that

472
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:20,270
small string the signature which is very

473
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:24,050
quick and then we generate small partial

474
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:26,000
substring we then in the light of ice we

475
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:27,980
index all of these small streams and

476
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:31,610
then we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to search for similar</font>

477
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:34,460
images we go to that index reducing

478
00:21:31,610 --> 00:21:36,439
gases and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> get partial results partial</font>

479
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:40,520
matches and then we only have to compare

480
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:42,650
a small<font color="#E5E5E5"> subset of images this way we can</font>

481
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:45,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">obtained as you have seen the same</font>

482
00:21:42,650 --> 00:21:48,350
similar images on the fly and very

483
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:50,810
quickly it wouldn't be scalable to

484
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:55,550
compare every imagery every other images

485
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:59,540
over afterwards we perform a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> test</font>

486
00:21:55,550 --> 00:22:02,990
on the images as you might guess I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

487
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:04,909
think people<font color="#E5E5E5"> see before a a lot of the</font>

488
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:07,220
images<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really black</font>

489
00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:10,610
screens and that's knowledge we're not

490
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:12,950
going to run run OCR against that it's

491
00:22:10,610 --> 00:22:15,199
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to be s nothin so we perform a</font>

492
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:16,840
label test that my colleague flip is

493
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:20,720
going to talk more in detail afterwards

494
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:23,090
to check if the image has<font color="#E5E5E5"> any relevant</font>

495
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:24,740
information or not and<font color="#E5E5E5"> if it does we</font>

496
00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:28,580
then perform some more interesting stuff

497
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:31,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">on we have several tasks logo detection</font>

498
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:34,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">text detection OCR you can pour in</font>

499
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:37,129
detection if you want and we enhance the

500
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:40,250
image for each one of these<font color="#CCCCCC"> tasks and</font>

501
00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:42,650
when we say<font color="#E5E5E5"> enhance we say applying</font>

502
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:45,950
certain filters like for instance race

503
00:22:42,650 --> 00:22:49,490
game then we perform these tasks and

504
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:52,550
then with the results we can do well if

505
00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:55,370
we have anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> else we lose this is</font>

506
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:58,730
when we do it instance when we get the

507
00:22:55,370 --> 00:23:01,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">results from ASEAN you might want to run</font>

508
00:22:58,730 --> 00:23:06,320
the emails against our little weak API

509
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:08,240
and so on and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so forth</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ah now I'm going</font>

510
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:11,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">to pass</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> over the few people that's my</font>

511
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:15,809
talk more in detail<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the algorithms</font>

512
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:18,909
that we use of those steps

513
00:23:15,809 --> 00:23:21,249
so is one of you said the first<font color="#CCCCCC"> tip of</font>

514
00:23:18,909 --> 00:23:23,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">horror even work for is filtering we</font>

515
00:23:21,249 --> 00:23:25,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">tried</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to just remove all the images they</font>

516
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:28,689
do not contain relevant information for

517
00:23:25,659 --> 00:23:30,940
our case and like completely<font color="#E5E5E5"> blank</font>

518
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:33,159
screen shots so one very obvious way of

519
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:35,499
doing this type of filtering is just to

520
00:23:33,159 --> 00:23:37,840
check how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> colors and image contains</font>

521
00:23:35,499 --> 00:23:40,389
and if you content on what color we can

522
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:42,639
you start it but if I have something

523
00:23:40,389 --> 00:23:45,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">like a completely blank screen shot with</font>

524
00:23:42,639 --> 00:23:47,469
the white pixel somewhere well this type

525
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:50,230
of limit also doesn't give me any useful

526
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:52,659
information and if i apply this rule of

527
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:54,940
also discarding images that contains

528
00:23:52,659 --> 00:23:56,470
only few cold colors<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to lose</font>

529
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:59,619
very interesting information like

530
00:23:56,470 --> 00:24:01,600
comment lines so a more flexible way of

531
00:23:59,619 --> 00:24:03,220
doing this type of filtering is using

532
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:05,469
the concepts of entropy more

533
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:08,259
specifically channels<font color="#E5E5E5"> enter key there is</font>

534
00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:10,570
given by<font color="#E5E5E5"> this equation and for images it</font>

535
00:24:08,259 --> 00:24:13,539
give us like a measure of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> complexity</font>

536
00:24:10,570 --> 00:24:15,759
so I entropy values correspond to a

537
00:24:13,539 --> 00:24:26,710
great information content or two more

538
00:24:15,759 --> 00:24:29,049
complex images for example so if i have

539
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:30,999
<font color="#CCCCCC">a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> completely blank screen shot all the</font>

540
00:24:29,049 --> 00:24:33,158
pixels are like<font color="#CCCCCC"> Sonia it will be 0</font>

541
00:24:30,999 --> 00:24:35,830
because I really don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> any type of</font>

542
00:24:33,159 --> 00:24:38,590
information in this image but if I have

543
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:40,509
like a common line they can feel your

544
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:42,789
record and<font color="#E5E5E5"> 0 because I have a little bit</font>

545
00:24:40,509 --> 00:24:45,190
of information and in the last case I

546
00:24:42,789 --> 00:24:47,950
have a highly complex structure so get

547
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:51,789
hope you will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be much better to okay</font>

548
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:53,739
nothing ah so with this<font color="#E5E5E5"> in mind can then</font>

549
00:24:51,789 --> 00:24:55,720
defy the threshold very cute only the

550
00:24:53,739 --> 00:24:58,359
images containing a certain degree<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

551
00:24:55,720 --> 00:25:01,600
information so now<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to show</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

552
00:24:58,359 --> 00:25:05,649
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> note imitating prepare for this</font>

553
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:12,789
presentation where i'm going to show you

554
00:25:05,649 --> 00:25:15,449
all so i'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to show you all can use</font>

555
00:25:12,789 --> 00:25:18,609
very very simple libraries in python up

556
00:25:15,450 --> 00:25:20,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can use to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> detect the faces to</font>

557
00:25:18,609 --> 00:25:23,379
detect the logos in to extract all the

558
00:25:20,649 --> 00:25:24,969
texts so the first thing I'm doing in

559
00:25:23,379 --> 00:25:27,129
the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> line is just importing the</font>

560
00:25:24,970 --> 00:25:27,710
opencv in few libraries there are you

561
00:25:27,129 --> 00:25:31,340
much

562
00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:33,440
tools and here is an example of the type

563
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:36,289
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you much we find a lot so of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> course</font>

564
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:38,419
this is a image created by us for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

565
00:25:36,289 --> 00:25:40,279
presentation but the truth is to find a

566
00:25:38,419 --> 00:25:43,669
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this type of Windows 10</font>

567
00:25:40,279 --> 00:25:47,000
screenshots Mary have the users photo

568
00:25:43,669 --> 00:25:48,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">The Green Mile the name so our goal is</font>

569
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,860
to detect that this type of image

570
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:54,229
contains a face to extract the email<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

573
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:04,970
let me<font color="#CCCCCC"> start by the face detection Mon</font>

574
00:26:02,419 --> 00:26:07,460
the most user process attacked by cities

575
00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:09,559
of course to build a model with<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of</font>

576
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:12,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">images containing places and image</font>

577
00:26:09,559 --> 00:26:15,200
without faces and you can train your own

589
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:43,399
it's fast it works<font color="#E5E5E5"> really well most</font>

00:26:43,399 --> 00:26:48,320
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> details behind of these really</font>

Fergus presentation I'm going to show

598
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:06,740
you all can use this framework in Python

599
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:08,539
so the first thing to do here is to load

600
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:11,049
your image in grayscale because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

601
00:27:08,539 --> 00:27:14,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">simplifies the process a lot and then</font>

602
00:27:11,049 --> 00:27:16,908
you have this the<font color="#CCCCCC"> volatile framework</font>

603
00:27:14,179 --> 00:27:19,220
available in opencv in the class<font color="#CCCCCC"> call to</font>

604
00:27:16,909 --> 00:27:21,260
skype classifier<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you have to learn</font>

605
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:23,510
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> XML file that contains the pre</font>

606
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:26,440
classifiers in this case for frontal

607
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:30,020
faces you also have available other

608
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:32,750
classifiers for a small profit

609
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:34,580
upper body of our body so just have to

610
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:37,250
load xml file of the things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

611
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:40,669
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> fight in your image and then</font>

612
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:43,730
just have to apply<font color="#E5E5E5"> the pacifier to your</font>

613
00:27:40,670 --> 00:27:46,190
image and as you can see we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a set</font>

614
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:48,620
of parameters that must be<font color="#CCCCCC"> too</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> depending</font>

615
00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:50,690
on the type of image you have and if

616
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:53,419
faces are detected it will return the

617
00:27:50,690 --> 00:27:55,130
positions here and then you can grow

618
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:57,950
like a box or a square around the face

619
00:27:55,130 --> 00:28:01,310
to see where the faces were detected so

620
00:27:57,950 --> 00:28:03,200
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> I just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> apply this in our army p</font>

621
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:06,379
screenshot<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can see that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> both faces</font>

622
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:08,150
are detected but<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i change just a</font>

623
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:10,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">little bit this val your ear these</font>

624
00:28:08,150 --> 00:28:14,210
parameters very related with the scale

625
00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:16,880
of delay image you can see now that the

626
00:28:14,210 --> 00:28:19,730
smaller face is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not detected and if i</font>

627
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:21,860
increase in just a little bit more what

628
00:28:19,730 --> 00:28:24,410
ways are not detected right so this

629
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:26,510
tells us that<font color="#E5E5E5"> these parameters are</font>

630
00:28:24,410 --> 00:28:30,290
really sensitive and you should know

631
00:28:26,510 --> 00:28:32,480
what they<font color="#E5E5E5"> need because the success of</font>

632
00:28:30,290 --> 00:28:34,760
this algorithm will depend only<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the</font>

633
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:37,280
type of the image you have and so you

634
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:39,470
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to to optimize these dead</font>

635
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:41,270
parameters and you can find all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

636
00:28:39,470 --> 00:28:45,170
details again in the biology framework

637
00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:48,250
and also in the opencv documentation so

638
00:28:45,170 --> 00:28:51,140
now let's move to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the longer detection</font>

639
00:28:48,250 --> 00:28:53,000
the really<font color="#E5E5E5"> most simple approach to the</font>

640
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:54,800
tech blog which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use this concept</font>

641
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:57,110
of template matching so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have a</font>

642
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:59,210
template and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i have an image and i want</font>

643
00:28:57,110 --> 00:29:02,689
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know if their template exists</font>

644
00:28:59,210 --> 00:29:05,090
somewhere in my image so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i what i can do</font>

645
00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:08,120
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> just slide the template over my image</font>

646
00:29:05,090 --> 00:29:12,290
and compare the net part of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> image or</font>

647
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:16,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">in 715 pledge and in in Python in opencv</font>

648
00:29:12,290 --> 00:29:19,159
you have class polls your match tonight

649
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:20,780
that compares<font color="#CCCCCC"> two images</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and return the</font>

650
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:22,700
metric for example the correlation

651
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:25,760
coefficient and you know if the

652
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:27,980
correlation is very strong most images

653
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:29,810
are really similar and then you can

654
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:33,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">create a function like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this one to slide</font>

655
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:37,399
the template over the image so for this

656
00:29:33,770 --> 00:29:40,840
example my template is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a Windows 10 logo</font>

657
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:42,760
and you can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it can file</font>

658
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:44,559
in your right place so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a really</font>

659
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:47,020
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple approach and there are two</font>

660
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:50,678
major problems do that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> first thing</font>

661
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:52,629
is if the North template is much smaller

662
00:29:50,679 --> 00:29:54,909
or much bigger than<font color="#CCCCCC"> the template that</font>

663
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:57,880
existing<font color="#CCCCCC"> your image you won't be able to</font>

664
00:29:54,909 --> 00:29:59,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">find it and second if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we have a lot of</font>

665
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:02,590
interactions in this first cycle of

666
00:29:59,799 --> 00:30:04,690
course it will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a very slow process so</font>

667
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:06,850
depending<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the type of human to help I</font>

668
00:30:04,690 --> 00:30:08,770
depending on your goal you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can use more</font>

669
00:30:06,850 --> 00:30:11,350
sophisticated things for<font color="#CCCCCC"> example you can</font>

670
00:30:08,770 --> 00:30:14,350
train a model that learns to recognize

671
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:16,149
certainly logos in your<font color="#E5E5E5"> image but for</font>

672
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:17,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">there you have to have reasonable number</font>

673
00:30:16,149 --> 00:30:20,199
of image for training it sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

674
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:24,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">really difficult to to get such a little</font>

675
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:27,549
set and finally try to extract all the

676
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:30,879
texts so in Python you have this OCR

677
00:30:27,549 --> 00:30:33,429
engine<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is called pipette</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> iraq and</font>

678
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:35,740
you may think that applying OCR tool is

679
00:30:33,429 --> 00:30:37,390
a very straightforward process but it

680
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:40,090
can be a real challenge because the

681
00:30:37,390 --> 00:30:42,100
ideal scenario final starting<font color="#CCCCCC"> forward is</font>

682
00:30:40,090 --> 00:30:45,158
to have an image with white background

683
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:48,850
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the letters in black so if I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

684
00:30:45,159 --> 00:30:50,980
apply this to our original image you can

685
00:30:48,850 --> 00:30:55,178
see the results<font color="#E5E5E5"> and its really bad right</font>

686
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:58,240
I don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so now if i</font>

687
00:30:55,179 --> 00:31:02,230
convert you see much to grayscale and

688
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:04,480
apply again the OCR as you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can see it's</font>

689
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:06,190
a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit better but it's not perfect</font>

690
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:08,610
because my goal is to extract all the

691
00:31:06,190 --> 00:31:11,860
texts are at least two email and the net

692
00:31:08,610 --> 00:31:15,219
so let me<font color="#E5E5E5"> show</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you what our results that</font>

693
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:17,709
we are obtaining run your<font color="#CCCCCC"> age so as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

694
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:20,409
can see we are able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to extract all the</font>

695
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:22,990
text but it's not perfect because<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have</font>

696
00:31:20,409 --> 00:31:24,610
some lies there but at least we are

697
00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:27,460
meeting our primary goal then is to

698
00:31:24,610 --> 00:31:29,620
detect all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> text so the trick here to</font>

699
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:31,539
apply an OCR to list just to apply

700
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:34,090
filters through our image before you

701
00:31:31,539 --> 00:31:36,100
apply the OCR cool because your goal is

702
00:31:34,090 --> 00:31:39,100
to just erase the background and keep

703
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:42,399
the leopard anyone to recognize so

704
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:47,559
summarizing from our<font color="#CCCCCC"> rdp screenshots we</font>

705
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:50,809
are we detected the face both faces we

706
00:31:47,559 --> 00:31:53,629
expect<font color="#E5E5E5"> the email and the lamb and also</font>

707
00:31:50,809 --> 00:31:55,158
we found the windows 10 so we can pacify

708
00:31:53,629 --> 00:31:58,070
the signal<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the window stainless</font>

709
00:31:55,159 --> 00:32:03,950
screenshot and now i'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pass</font>

710
00:31:58,070 --> 00:32:10,129
over<font color="#CCCCCC"> to Tiago yes alright so back to me</font>

711
00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:14,269
for closing this up as i mentioned to

712
00:32:10,129 --> 00:32:16,219
you guys we do you know we've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> his</font>

713

714
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:20,809
to one of the reason why<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing small</font>

715
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:22,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">very you know that second devil is that</font>

716
00:32:20,809 --> 00:32:23,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">she's going to show you lots of</font>

717
00:32:22,370 --> 00:32:25,699
different object types of date and how

718
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:27,230
to visualize him so I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk to</font>

719
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:30,470
show you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys enough that dated before</font>

720
00:32:27,230 --> 00:32:34,369
she talks about how people so let's try

721
00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:38,330
and do something here ah<font color="#CCCCCC"> here's a stream</font>

722
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:41,418
let's see if we can pull this off<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell</font>

723
00:32:38,330 --> 00:32:43,908
me now<font color="#CCCCCC"> so what you guys are going to see</font>

724
00:32:41,419 --> 00:32:45,440
here on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> left it's going to be my</font>

725
00:32:43,909 --> 00:32:48,019
user stream and my user stream is

726
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:52,340
essentially the stream where the results

727
00:32:48,019 --> 00:32:58,029
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> ask for in a job get delivered and now</font>

728
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:58,029
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> try and request a scan</font>

729
00:32:59,830 --> 00:33:11,509
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so can you guys tell me pick a</font>

730
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:15,830
country please<font color="#CCCCCC"> Russia a nice country I</font>

731
00:33:11,509 --> 00:33:17,450
don't do you know friends sure let's go

732
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:22,789
as friends anyone knows the country code

733
00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:25,009
for us to eat at harvest yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so</font>

734
00:33:22,789 --> 00:33:28,129
does anyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> not understand what I'm</font>

735
00:33:25,009 --> 00:33:33,409
writing on the left you can see you

736
00:33:28,129 --> 00:33:38,539
can't see it oh this<font color="#E5E5E5"> one anyone knows</font>

737
00:33:33,409 --> 00:33:45,220
how to create the false s so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would</font>

738
00:33:38,539 --> 00:33:47,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">just go essentially what I wrote here I</font>

739
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:58,200
know I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really increase font size</font>

740
00:33:47,690 --> 00:34:06,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">ah yeah</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> confuses</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my text bigger</font>

741
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:13,340
as you like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> Memphis to know not</font>

742
00:34:06,810 --> 00:34:15,659
with colum<font color="#E5E5E5"> lures a calm common much yes</font>

743
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:18,920
the problem is to see the mac and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

744
00:34:15,659 --> 00:34:18,920
don't even<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a plus because it's just</font>

745
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:38,670
good that was good<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay let</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me know when</font>

746
00:34:32,489 --> 00:34:40,949
<font color="#CCCCCC">you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually see nothing I'll just</font>

747
00:34:38,670 --> 00:34:42,659
point it out you'll be fine so we're

748
00:34:40,949 --> 00:34:45,899
drinking a job we're essentially telling

749
00:34:42,659 --> 00:34:50,670
the platform please scantrons on the

750
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:52,290
port 5900 using our VNC module<font color="#E5E5E5"> right an</font>

751
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:55,080
RV NC module is the one that takes

752
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:57,540
screenshots on VNC and what you guys are

753
00:34:55,080 --> 00:35:00,480
seeing here is a real-time scan of all

754
00:34:57,540 --> 00:35:03,330
the ip's in France<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's detecting which</font>

755
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:05,310
ones have port 5900 open and hopefully

756
00:35:03,330 --> 00:35:08,520
in a second we'll start seeing some

757
00:35:05,310 --> 00:35:10,200
screenshots mokena i'll link that

758
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:17,700
running for a second and<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the meantime</font>

759
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:20,040
ah public yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> as goes this so we've got</font>

760
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:21,990
modules for all sorts of stuff we've got

761
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:24,570
modules for SS age with both modules for

762
00:35:21,990 --> 00:35:26,459
amputees EU but loves for rdp and i'm

763
00:35:24,570 --> 00:35:28,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to show you Frank up press sh so</font>

764
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:31,500
that means if you ask scan<font color="#CCCCCC"> France with</font>

765
00:35:28,830 --> 00:35:33,770
the ssh module this is all the data will

766
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:37,320
return to you guys so yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> read the port</font>

767
00:35:33,770 --> 00:35:39,690
all the ciphers all the algorithms all

768
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:42,030
the public keys that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> eyes the server</font>

769
00:35:39,690 --> 00:35:44,640
returns we return all of<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

770
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:45,840
information and we<font color="#CCCCCC"> return all these sort</font>

771
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:47,190
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> information for all the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> different</font>

772
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:49,620
modules<font color="#E5E5E5"> for all different protocols</font>

773
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:50,910
which means it's different types of

774
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:52,380
information therefore they need

775
00:35:50,910 --> 00:35:53,759
different visualizations and this is

776
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:55,920
what Anna's like to talk about let me

777
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:57,810
just see if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> start well i'll leave</font>

778
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">this running and maybe we'll start to</font>

779
00:35:57,810 --> 00:36:00,990
get some<font color="#E5E5E5"> screenshots because france</font>

780
00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:03,609
actually has quite a large IP range so

781
00:36:00,990 --> 00:36:09,490
we also have you

782
00:36:03,610 --> 00:36:12,320
original plan ah<font color="#E5E5E5"> because we have the GOI</font>

783
00:36:09,490 --> 00:36:13,790
p5 database thing that essentially tells

784
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:16,370
us these ranges are assigned to<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

785
00:36:13,790 --> 00:36:19,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">countries and they get updated every 24</font>

786
00:36:16,370 --> 00:36:20,810
hours next time max my name is some

787
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:22,960
others there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are some other database so</font>

788
00:36:20,810 --> 00:36:32,509
exhausted formation across<font color="#CCCCCC"> two uep</font>

789
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:37,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">devices yes and also motivated or not</font>

790
00:36:32,510 --> 00:36:38,810
not right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> um so I'll just pass over</font>

791
00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:42,370
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you for a second and you can do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

792
00:36:38,810 --> 00:36:42,370
part in the new maybe we'll look at this

793
00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:49,850
so I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk about later</font>

794
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:52,910
visualization and just I want to show

795
00:36:49,850 --> 00:36:55,250
you the pipeline or the workflow we use

796
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:58,450
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> data be so legit visualization for</font>

797
00:36:55,250 --> 00:37:01,610
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> four types of data so first when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

798
00:36:58,450 --> 00:37:04,970
receive the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> data like in the</font>

799
00:37:01,610 --> 00:37:07,010
formative saw in the black screen I<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font>

800
00:37:04,970 --> 00:37:08,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">to see the variables and what's</font>

801
00:37:07,010 --> 00:37:11,810
interesting and think about the audience

802
00:37:08,930 --> 00:37:15,109
and one representative and then I'm

803
00:37:11,810 --> 00:37:17,450
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to think about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the presentation I</font>

804
00:37:15,110 --> 00:37:20,090
want to show the details the tools to

805
00:37:17,450 --> 00:37:23,509
use in a fishy just finishing<font color="#E5E5E5"> up but</font>

806
00:37:20,090 --> 00:37:25,940
i'll show you this in detail so first

807
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:27,920
before showing all the types of three

808
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:29,930
types of<font color="#CCCCCC"> this relation</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i want to tell</font>

809
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:33,920
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> that for me it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really important to</font>

810
00:37:29,930 --> 00:37:36,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">experiment and spend some time some good</font>

811
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:39,890
time testing different visualizations

812
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:42,770
try it with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the team or friends</font>

813
00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:46,460
colleagues and see what works this year

814
00:37:42,770 --> 00:37:49,430
it's really bad example we wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

815
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:52,610
show<font color="#E5E5E5"> the two how many</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> open parks as an</font>

816
00:37:49,430 --> 00:37:54,830
IP half and we ended up not using it

817
00:37:52,610 --> 00:37:59,830
because it was really over complicating

818
00:37:54,830 --> 00:38:04,069
the idea was to to trust me so next um

819
00:37:59,830 --> 00:38:06,259
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the results we have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here I I had to</font>

820
00:38:04,070 --> 00:38:08,829
predict a little bit because it was

821
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:11,920
really a huge amount of latent

822
00:38:08,829 --> 00:38:14,680
you wouldn't be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see but a simple</font>

823
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:16,599
visualization is this Venn diagram not

824
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:21,190
all visualizations need to be complex

825
00:38:16,599 --> 00:38:24,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">just need to be understandable next we</font>

826
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:28,690
have the top<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 web service for the web</font>

827
00:38:24,519 --> 00:38:31,269
and here i want to mention<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's</font>

828
00:38:28,690 --> 00:38:33,339
really important to pay attention to the

829
00:38:31,269 --> 00:38:36,008
details and be precise when creating a

830
00:38:33,339 --> 00:38:39,880
visualization for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i didn't</font>

831
00:38:36,009 --> 00:38:44,709
have if I hadn't truncated<font color="#E5E5E5"> the x-axis on</font>

832
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:50,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">0 it will distort the way we look at the</font>

833
00:38:44,709 --> 00:38:52,868
data and consider the the calculations

834
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:55,930
that you need to do to to be precise in

835
00:38:52,869 --> 00:38:57,880
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> lengths or areas or whatever you you</font>

836
00:38:55,930 --> 00:39:00,910
are showing to to give the right

00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:05,709
information not give the wrong

838
00:39:00,910 --> 00:39:10,149
perception here we have relational that

839
00:39:05,709 --> 00:39:13,558
you have on the top the six email

840

856
00:40:06,599 --> 00:40:14,979
i'm going to show you this this data in

in two ways this one I<font color="#E5E5E5"> added a legend</font>

visualization but doing done differently

863
00:40:26,469 --> 00:40:31,839
that's going to highlight the importance

864
00:40:29,229 --> 00:40:35,859
of spending some time in the details

865
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:39,578
here you can see with the different

00:40:54,009 --> 00:40:59,140
it makes a difference<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you're</font>

presenting these declines and just to to

872
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:05,709
finish up these parts colorful it's a

873
00:41:02,170 --> 00:41:08,769
great way to to give emphasis to some

874
00:41:05,709 --> 00:41:12,729
data you can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the first two</font>

877
00:41:15,339 --> 00:41:22,239
<font color="#CCCCCC">feelings and then one thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we</font>

878
00:41:19,390 --> 00:41:24,910
always discuss at the binary it is of

00:41:22,239 --> 00:41:27,729
course comparing automation meet

880
00:41:24,910 --> 00:41:31,118
originality because those visualizations

881
00:41:27,729 --> 00:41:34,930
were created in Illustrator or could be

882
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:37,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">any other tool but it took a while so it</font>

883
00:41:34,930 --> 00:41:39,788
<font color="#E5E5E5">would be much faster to do it with a</font>

programming language<font color="#CCCCCC"> heightened or are</font>

885
00:41:39,789 --> 00:41:46,599
and just do the fine tuning in

00:41:42,910 --> 00:41:49,479
<font color="#CCCCCC">Illustrator but of course it doesn't</font>

have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same effect ins loses a little</font>

888
00:41:49,479 --> 00:41:55,538
bit of the original so it's important to

889
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:58,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">find a good balance between two and then</font>

890
00:41:55,539 --> 00:42:00,489
just finish up it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> important</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

891
00:41:58,420 --> 00:42:03,190
document every step of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> process like</font>

00:42:00,489 --> 00:42:05,259
the calculations for areas every choice

893
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:08,709
of literally the visualization according

894
00:42:05,259 --> 00:42:10,779
to the type of that you have review

895
00:42:08,709 --> 00:42:12,759
everything in for the future consider

896
00:42:10,779 --> 00:42:14,769
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> could</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have been would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> done</font>

differently what could be<font color="#CCCCCC"> better</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

898
00:42:14,769 --> 00:42:19,899
course and take constructive feedback

899
00:42:16,959 --> 00:42:22,209
even<font color="#CCCCCC"> if it means to let go of it for</font>

900
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:26,799
visualization like a showing the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first</font>

901
00:42:22,209 --> 00:42:31,149
slide no geographies so to finish up our

902
00:42:26,799 --> 00:42:33,489
top ah just two more slides first one we

903
00:42:31,150 --> 00:42:35,500
published the study of the entire ipv4

904
00:42:33,489 --> 00:42:37,420
space publicly available

905
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:39,970
I see the binary at i/o we looked at a

906
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:41,860
couple protocols we<font color="#E5E5E5"> publish you know a</font>

907
00:42:39,970 --> 00:42:43,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">couple of some of the slides you seem</font>

908
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:46,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">today are extracted from these reports</font>

909
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:48,040
so feel free<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have a look the other</font>

910
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:49,270
thing as well we've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> to lose</font>

911
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:52,150
something for you guys we've created

912
00:42:49,270 --> 00:42:54,340
actually a small comic that explains how

913
00:42:52,150 --> 00:42:56,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">we came together as data science team</font>

914
00:42:54,340 --> 00:43:01,060
anyone<font color="#CCCCCC"> that wants one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> feel free to come</font>

915
00:42:56,500 --> 00:43:21,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">and get one and any questions that's it</font>

916
00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:26,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">from us yeah ask away oh sorry</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> prior go</font>

917
00:43:21,940 --> 00:43:29,280
on to questions if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you go and more a</font>

918
00:43:26,860 --> 00:43:33,220
database to use<font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> section 3 results</font>

919
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:35,380
depends so right now we've got about

920
00:43:33,220 --> 00:43:37,209
Alice a time different technologies just

921
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:38,830
for databases because depending on the

922
00:43:37,210 --> 00:43:41,650
type of query you're doing depending on

923
00:43:38,830 --> 00:43:44,100
the type of lakeview storage started you

924
00:43:41,650 --> 00:43:47,500
want different types of databases and

925
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:51,160
what happens if the internet was highly

926
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:53,380
few secs we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> already scanning at 36</font>

927
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:54,220
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> definitely not going to do it you</font>

928
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:56,500
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way we'd watch it before</font>

929
00:43:54,220 --> 00:43:58,060
because it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> impossible but essentially</font>

930
00:43:56,500 --> 00:44:00,010
what we do right now is with torrent

931
00:43:58,060 --> 00:44:01,570
stuff and we've got a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of service</font>

932
00:44:00,010 --> 00:44:04,600
on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> IT people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we're starting to</font>

933
00:44:01,570 --> 00:44:06,580
collect these lists of ipv6<font color="#E5E5E5"> addresses</font>

934
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:08,319
that already allocated and instead of

935
00:44:06,580 --> 00:44:09,880
brute forcing it the way we ended with

936
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:11,560
type II before we're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to start</font>

937
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:15,540
scanning those until you guess the same

938
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:15,540
level<font color="#CCCCCC"> of scanning</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we have ID before</font>

939
00:44:17,550 --> 00:44:23,470
mattress which question<font color="#E5E5E5"> was about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a 86</font>

940
00:44:20,230 --> 00:44:24,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">but I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> saw other one is a lot special</font>

941
00:44:23,470 --> 00:44:28,029
working machine are you doing it

942
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:30,700
actively<font color="#E5E5E5"> and comparing with other with</font>

943
00:44:28,030 --> 00:44:34,360
other type of of tools like OC tools to

944
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:36,910
correlation between that all the social

945
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:40,360
media<font color="#E5E5E5"> plus the information you are</font>

946
00:44:36,910 --> 00:44:42,609
gathering about two devices so as<font color="#CCCCCC"> Lady</font>

947
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:44,200
of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mentioned before that's kind</font>

948
00:44:42,610 --> 00:44:45,640
of the line of where we stop these whole

949
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:47,990
relations have to do with the torrents

950
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:49,250
was five private for us and you

951
00:44:47,990 --> 00:44:50,810
would never provide our finest the

952
00:44:49,250 --> 00:44:52,670
ability to let on our platform we're

953
00:44:50,810 --> 00:44:54,590
data gathering and eggs sound company

954
00:44:52,670 --> 00:44:56,090
yes happy to say that the data

955
00:44:54,590 --> 00:44:58,070
correlations<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to do for our studies</font>

956
00:44:56,090 --> 00:44:59,630
its private its internal and we wouldn't

957
00:44:58,070 --> 00:45:01,430
do that if you find the source stated

958
00:44:59,630 --> 00:45:02,630
but you and you do whatever you want to

959
00:45:01,430 --> 00:45:04,100
get the start state by the way it's not

960
00:45:02,630 --> 00:45:05,810
really whatever you do because we do

961
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:07,670
that our clients we don't just sell to

962
00:45:05,810 --> 00:45:09,110
anyone you know you guys you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe</font>

963
00:45:07,670 --> 00:45:11,450
some of you work for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Russian mafia</font>

964
00:45:09,110 --> 00:45:13,130
if you come up<font color="#CCCCCC"> to binary edge and we're</font>

965
00:45:11,450 --> 00:45:15,680
not able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to vet your background we will</font>

966
00:45:13,130 --> 00:45:21,260
not sell to you so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> good do you</font>

967
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:23,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">sell for governments stop okay nevermind</font>

968
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:25,640
it about two devices are you extracted

969
00:45:23,540 --> 00:45:27,619
<font color="#CCCCCC">meta data</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like this the screen size and</font>

970
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:30,230
comparing different devices so you can

971
00:45:27,619 --> 00:45:31,790
grab<font color="#E5E5E5"> the banner so that is that's why I</font>

972
00:45:30,230 --> 00:45:35,050
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> flash it you know if you</font>

973
00:45:31,790 --> 00:45:43,310
reconnect with your ex parte again<font color="#CCCCCC"> Oh</font>

974
00:45:35,050 --> 00:45:45,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">Chinese it let me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just see because if i</font>

975
00:45:43,310 --> 00:45:48,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">can get this running up again</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this will</font>

976
00:45:45,050 --> 00:45:51,650
answer your question so essentially we

977
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:53,330
extract as much with metadata if you try

978
00:45:51,650 --> 00:45:56,000
to identify the service will extract<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

979
00:45:53,330 --> 00:45:57,470
banner we you know extract which version

980
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:59,840
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the service is running in there and</font>

981
00:45:57,470 --> 00:46:03,589
that correlates with an<font color="#E5E5E5"> internal cv</font>

982
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:06,410
database that we have so yeah we extract

983
00:46:03,590 --> 00:46:09,440
as much line after the expiry the screen

984
00:46:06,410 --> 00:46:10,700
yes if the list comes back up again and

985
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:14,500
hopefully is taking screenshots let's

986
00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:17,210
see come on give me just one<font color="#E5E5E5"> come</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

987
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:19,070
let's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just see what if anyone sees a</font>

988
00:46:17,210 --> 00:46:21,880
link to pop up in there please let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font>

989
00:46:19,070 --> 00:46:25,400
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> uh and the meantime more questions</font>

990
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:27,109
yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> love you hold on day six months</font>

991
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:34,430
maximum that were legally allowed to do

992
00:46:27,109 --> 00:46:36,080
it next question we take the quality we

00:46:34,430 --> 00:46:38,359
used to in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the beginning and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's why</font>

994
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:40,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">we created the data science team um one</font>

995
00:46:38,359 --> 00:46:44,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you know we've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> got</font>

996
00:46:40,580 --> 00:46:45,319
this reply of it cool so we've got these

997
00:46:44,030 --> 00:46:46,940
really big client<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm not a lot of</font>

998
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:48,560
saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> their name for NDA reasons they</font>

999
00:46:46,940 --> 00:46:50,180
really really picky about their data

1000
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:52,310
client they're awesome and it's great

1001
00:46:50,180 --> 00:46:54,589
and mixes work really really really hard

1002
00:46:52,310 --> 00:46:56,180
but our data quality and this is by the

1003
00:46:54,590 --> 00:46:57,619
way one of the differentiating factors

1004
00:46:56,180 --> 00:46:59,839
that we have versus our competition if

1005
00:46:57,619 --> 00:47:00,859
you go to sense each show them you know

1006
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:02,630
whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> bullsh</font>

1007
00:47:00,859 --> 00:47:05,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">as our scanning the internet children</font>

1008
00:47:02,630 --> 00:47:07,339
for example they've got 2.5 million IP

1009
00:47:05,630 --> 00:47:09,019
addresses that have an ftp server

1010
00:47:07,339 --> 00:47:11,480
running on it we've got 16 million

1011
00:47:09,019 --> 00:47:13,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">reason for that data quality improving</font>

1012
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:15,259
our algorithms on scanning and all that

1013
00:47:13,609 --> 00:47:20,420
a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the work that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we do is I'm</font>

1014
00:47:15,259 --> 00:47:24,339
laser quality what else yeah you can do

1015
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:30,259
oh yeah so uh where was the screenshot I

1016
00:47:24,339 --> 00:47:31,940
see there we go so<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay let's just go</font>

1017
00:47:30,259 --> 00:47:34,309
down here for a second first can you<font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font>

1018
00:47:31,940 --> 00:47:36,710
that that's a part of metadata that we

1019
00:47:34,309 --> 00:47:38,630
extract so we have essentially<font color="#CCCCCC"> the title</font>

1020
00:47:36,710 --> 00:47:40,400
of the computer and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> screenshot</font>

1021
00:47:38,630 --> 00:47:46,039
hopefully I won't get in trouble let's

1022
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:47,749
see what we got<font color="#CCCCCC"> here well thanks thanks</font>

1023
00:47:46,039 --> 00:47:49,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">always just a lock doing this gospel but</font>

1024
00:47:47,749 --> 00:47:52,220
this was a real I'm screenshot do please

1025
00:47:49,430 --> 00:47:54,980
do not go to our history database you

1026
00:47:52,220 --> 00:47:56,749
know it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> really taken right now for</font>

1027
00:47:54,980 --> 00:47:59,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">Portugal we get lots of things like</font>

1030
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:09,529
pop up<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll see any more questions for</font>

1031
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:13,089
me yes we're gonna do protection I have

1032
00:48:09,529 --> 00:48:16,390
to say explicitly if i can give you that

1033
00:48:13,089 --> 00:48:19,609
but you are fetching over that recession

1034
00:48:16,390 --> 00:48:20,749
where do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you stand so if i remember</font>

1035
00:48:19,609 --> 00:48:22,759
correctly you're talking about the<font color="#E5E5E5"> new</font>

1036
00:48:20,749 --> 00:48:25,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">fee use data protection all right yeah</font>

1037
00:48:22,759 --> 00:48:27,470
worse this company we're not detected by

1038
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:28,700
right now<font color="#CCCCCC"> at least</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from what result</font>

1039
00:48:27,470 --> 00:48:33,049
we're not really affected by the youth

1040
00:48:28,700 --> 00:48:37,578
protection I have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> question</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> rivers yes</font>

1041
00:48:33,049 --> 00:48:41,150
is there any way for an ISP say to you

1042
00:48:37,579 --> 00:48:44,749
or other<font color="#CCCCCC"> scanning out there I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font>

1043
00:48:41,150 --> 00:48:46,430
to be scanned<font color="#E5E5E5"> five percent we one of the</font>

1044
00:48:44,749 --> 00:48:48,410
controversy for lawyers we need to have

1045
00:48:46,430 --> 00:48:50,480
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> blacklist send us an email 25 mine</font>

1046
00:48:48,410 --> 00:48:51,680
area with your ranges come in a way of

1047
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:53,569
proving that you are the owner or

1048
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:54,649
responsible for those ranges<font color="#CCCCCC"> will put</font>

1049
00:48:53,569 --> 00:48:58,839
them on the blacklist you'll never hear

1050
00:48:54,650 --> 00:48:58,839
from us again yes

1051
00:49:08,050 --> 00:49:14,750
so uh huh so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna risk playing a</font>

1052
00:49:13,490 --> 00:49:18,500
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit with the devil here again</font>

1053
00:49:14,750 --> 00:49:20,330
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> let's see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what happens um you're</font>

1054
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:23,900
CTO are you back there how they help i

1055
00:49:20,330 --> 00:49:29,110
do a free text search you writes text

1056
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:35,960
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok so just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that are you sure and</font>

1057
00:49:29,110 --> 00:49:37,910
now how I see white associated so

1058
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:39,710
essentially you got free text on every

1059
00:49:37,910 --> 00:49:42,649
single<font color="#E5E5E5"> field of data that we collect the</font>

1060
00:49:39,710 --> 00:49:44,570
smile so no correlation but you're able

1061
00:49:42,650 --> 00:49:46,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do text search across all of these</font>

1062
00:49:44,570 --> 00:49:48,680
things as well again the correlations

1063
00:49:46,730 --> 00:49:50,330
that we do is more on level<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok we've got</font>

1064
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:52,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">this IP address which seemeth here we</font>

1065
00:49:50,330 --> 00:49:53,480
sit there you sit there and explore a

1066
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:57,379
little bit about you know what services

1067
00:49:53,480 --> 00:50:01,940
are running on acting as a test um more

1068
00:49:57,380 --> 00:50:03,980
oh I would like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go to the same</font>

1069
00:50:01,940 --> 00:50:06,440
subject because 3 mar switch the

1070
00:50:03,980 --> 00:50:09,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">switching price let you sell matter for</font>

1071
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:13,490
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can can't describe sorry you shall</font>

1072
00:50:09,050 --> 00:50:15,320
data for european countries<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok if you</font>

1073
00:50:13,490 --> 00:50:24,379
sell not to put your event continue to

1074
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:26,630
follow the so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> are much</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok yeah sure</font>

1075
00:50:24,380 --> 00:50:28,070
now in regards to the to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> european</font>

1076
00:50:26,630 --> 00:50:30,350
law it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually something that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> got out</font>

1077
00:50:28,070 --> 00:50:31,700
quite recent we've got a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of thing</font>

1078
00:50:30,350 --> 00:50:33,259
that essentially enough they'll look at

1079
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:35,000
it they'll try to understand how it

1080
00:50:33,260 --> 00:50:36,350
works because<font color="#E5E5E5"> again this is probably</font>

1081
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:38,630
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> the one important thing is that we</font>

1082
00:50:36,350 --> 00:50:40,670
don't try and even default user names

1083
00:50:38,630 --> 00:50:42,200
and passwords we do not try them this is

1084
00:50:40,670 --> 00:50:43,730
things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are completely open on the</font>

1085
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:47,509
internet without<font color="#E5E5E5"> any type of</font>

1086
00:50:43,730 --> 00:50:54,380
authentication<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok yes what's your</font>

1087
00:50:47,510 --> 00:50:55,610
standard text scanner stack so you've

1088
00:50:54,380 --> 00:50:57,170
got<font color="#E5E5E5"> different phases as i explained</font>

1089
00:50:55,610 --> 00:50:58,850
first thing we do is check with ports

1090
00:50:57,170 --> 00:51:01,070
are open and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> you've followed this</font>

1091
00:50:58,850 --> 00:51:02,330
pipeline as well on words are open we've

1092
00:51:01,070 --> 00:51:04,100
got the custom scan their that we've

1093
00:51:02,330 --> 00:51:05,779
rolled for<font color="#E5E5E5"> tcp and for you to beat their</font>

1094
00:51:04,100 --> 00:51:06,860
separate scanners just<font color="#CCCCCC"> something custom</font>

1095
00:51:05,780 --> 00:51:08,570
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> wrote you know it's not very hard</font>

1096
00:51:06,860 --> 00:51:10,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing scanning on the entire internet</font>

1097
00:51:08,570 --> 00:51:12,590
software hard mask and got<font color="#CCCCCC"> zima what's</font>

1098
00:51:10,850 --> 00:51:13,310
hard is actually no game with the buds

1099
00:51:12,590 --> 00:51:15,290
both

1100
00:51:13,310 --> 00:51:16,790
well known scanners have and being able

1101
00:51:15,290 --> 00:51:19,009
to know receive all those messages at

1102
00:51:16,790 --> 00:51:22,009
the same time so our<font color="#E5E5E5"> scanners are really</font>

1103
00:51:19,010 --> 00:51:25,130
common you know written in c tcp UDP

1104
00:51:22,010 --> 00:51:27,170
scanners we then have a custom greeting

1105
00:51:25,130 --> 00:51:29,300
service identification scanner and

1106
00:51:27,170 --> 00:51:31,490
that's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> hundred percent compatible as</font>

1107
00:51:29,300 --> 00:51:33,260
well the lights of animal and a couple

1108
00:51:31,490 --> 00:51:34,729
of other scanners and identify services

1109
00:51:33,260 --> 00:51:36,410
that were<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to know how compatible</font>

1110
00:51:34,730 --> 00:51:38,420
probes because we do have clients that

1111
00:51:36,410 --> 00:51:40,220
like to send us the probes that they've

1112
00:51:38,420 --> 00:51:42,230
written and make it compatible on our

1113
00:51:40,220 --> 00:51:44,750
platform so to custom written scattered

1114
00:51:42,230 --> 00:51:49,370
by us to be able to identify services

1115
00:51:44,750 --> 00:51:51,050
really fast oh you're scanning notes I

1116
00:51:49,370 --> 00:51:53,480
assume probably get blocked and shut

1117
00:51:51,050 --> 00:51:56,240
down<font color="#CCCCCC"> every once in awhile</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

1118
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:58,850
dealt with that so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> essentially I</font>

1119
00:51:56,240 --> 00:52:01,700
would say fifty sixty percent of

1120
00:51:58,850 --> 00:52:04,220
follicular job she has these really cool

1121
00:52:01,700 --> 00:52:06,020
dashboard<font color="#CCCCCC"> yes she's not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really cool</font>

1122
00:52:04,220 --> 00:52:07,399
dashboard where she can compare all the

1123
00:52:06,020 --> 00:52:09,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">different jobs that have the same</font>

1124
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:10,910
targets over time and we essentially try

1125
00:52:09,290 --> 00:52:12,410
to monitor what's the quality of the IP

1126
00:52:10,910 --> 00:52:13,819
is looking like are<font color="#E5E5E5"> we losing something</font>

1127
00:52:12,410 --> 00:52:15,259
because sometimes it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not even about</font>

1128
00:52:13,820 --> 00:52:17,090
being blocked sometimes you know one of

1129
00:52:15,260 --> 00:52:18,710
our<font color="#E5E5E5"> provide data providers verminion as</font>

1130
00:52:17,090 --> 00:52:20,420
we call them provide this goes<font color="#E5E5E5"> down and</font>

1131
00:52:18,710 --> 00:52:22,130
we're losing<font color="#E5E5E5"> data from there and the</font>

1132
00:52:20,420 --> 00:52:24,080
system needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be able to think you</font>

1133
00:52:22,130 --> 00:52:25,400
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the tasks i sent there they're</font>

1134
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:27,020
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be lost trying to send them</font>

1135
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:29,030
somewhere else<font color="#E5E5E5"> and a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the work</font>

1136
00:52:27,020 --> 00:52:30,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you know TR back there has done</font>

1137
00:52:29,030 --> 00:52:32,330
he's focusing on building a<font color="#E5E5E5"> really good</font>

1138
00:52:30,740 --> 00:52:34,759
job manager that can handle<font color="#E5E5E5"> all that</font>

1139
00:52:32,330 --> 00:52:39,590
stuff yeah i'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure this original story</font>

1140
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:41,600
as well<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you like prefer over color we</font>

1141
00:52:39,590 --> 00:52:43,130
try playing around with different<font color="#E5E5E5"> types</font>

1142
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:44,210
of orchestrations framers and we

1143
00:52:43,130 --> 00:52:48,290
essentially just ended<font color="#E5E5E5"> up building our</font>

1144
00:52:44,210 --> 00:52:49,670
own because it's it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> really crazy you</font>

1145
00:52:48,290 --> 00:52:51,290
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's something that i would have</font>

1146
00:52:49,670 --> 00:52:53,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">thought ensure that involved a little</font>

1147
00:52:51,290 --> 00:52:55,250
bit better<font color="#E5E5E5"> but you go to these guys that</font>

1148
00:52:53,300 --> 00:52:56,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">do task management</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> job</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> distribution</font>

1149
00:52:55,250 --> 00:52:59,090
inside yeah you guys can<font color="#CCCCCC"> have this task</font>

1150
00:52:56,960 --> 00:53:00,800
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then you can code it that the next</font>

1151
00:52:59,090 --> 00:53:02,360
assholes<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i want to dynamic</font>

1152
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:04,100
task I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> that each this gets detected</font>

1153
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:06,290
automatically generates a new task yeah

1154
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:10,640
we don't do that so we ended up building

1155
00:53:06,290 --> 00:53:13,100
a row oh yes are you doing some kind of

1156
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:15,109
inspection too fast like necessary<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1157
00:53:13,100 --> 00:53:18,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">continued inspection so you cannot go</font>

1158
00:53:15,110 --> 00:53:21,890
the lock file such as extract metadata

1159
00:53:18,770 --> 00:53:23,750
the content itself<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've got what we</font>

1160
00:53:21,890 --> 00:53:27,129
call a recon platform which<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

1161
00:53:23,750 --> 00:53:29,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">showing here nope and essentially that</font>

1162
00:53:27,130 --> 00:53:32,390
allows us<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do things like the other</font>

1163
00:53:29,660 --> 00:53:33,980
way<font color="#CCCCCC"> around we put in a domain and it</font>

1164
00:53:32,390 --> 00:53:36,020
will go and get all of those<font color="#E5E5E5"> files</font>

1165
00:53:33,980 --> 00:53:37,460
extract names from those files because

1166
00:53:36,020 --> 00:53:40,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">in the opposite direction instead of a</font>

1167
00:53:37,460 --> 00:53:42,770
starry night for marital pochemy look

1168
00:53:40,460 --> 00:53:44,540
just pulling the files extracting me

1169
00:53:42,770 --> 00:53:50,480
today top of battling extracting like

1170
00:53:44,540 --> 00:53:52,490
creature yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay yes like friends or</font>

1171
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:55,040
things that you come<font color="#E5E5E5"> across through your</font>

1172
00:53:52,490 --> 00:53:57,850
date analysis that weren't so like ever

1173
00:53:55,040 --> 00:54:01,880
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> your imagination across yes ah</font>

1174
00:53:57,850 --> 00:54:03,680
absolutely so VNC<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's scary stuff right</font>

1175
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:06,650
you find your factory open to the

1176
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:09,500
internet we found and all sorts heaters

1177
00:54:06,650 --> 00:54:11,870
things like that but then we went in

1178
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:13,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">scan tramp utt and that's when it became</font>

1179
00:54:11,870 --> 00:54:16,220
real fun so we found presents online

1180
00:54:13,580 --> 00:54:18,799
like the jail controls of the doors of

1181
00:54:16,220 --> 00:54:21,350
the jail on an empty TV broker open with

1182
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:22,850
authentication we found nuclear research

1183
00:54:21,350 --> 00:54:24,890
facilities that have the sensors that

1184
00:54:22,850 --> 00:54:26,720
are measuring the nuclear reactors or

1185
00:54:24,890 --> 00:54:29,029
something like that sharing that data in

1186
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:30,950
there we found have a look at the

1187
00:54:29,030 --> 00:54:32,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">reporter published we've got them PTT</font>

1188
00:54:30,950 --> 00:54:34,609
stuff in there and for me in my<font color="#E5E5E5"> opinion</font>

1189
00:54:32,630 --> 00:54:37,010
personally scariest chapter of the

1190
00:54:34,610 --> 00:54:40,640
entire<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing another funny thing that we</font>

1191
00:54:37,010 --> 00:54:43,070
found we found that there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was actually</font>

1192
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:45,230
under<font color="#E5E5E5"> showed it in the side we found</font>

1193
00:54:43,070 --> 00:54:49,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">that there was a break here I just dug</font>

1194
00:54:45,230 --> 00:54:52,880
in I still have time two minutes cope um

1195
00:54:49,270 --> 00:54:55,880
this thing right<font color="#E5E5E5"> here ready if you check</font>

1196
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:58,880
here that was a huge drop from august to

1197
00:54:55,880 --> 00:55:01,190
generates the yellow stuff and from<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

1198
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:03,290
side we saw that drop but we didn't

1199
00:55:01,190 --> 00:55:05,240
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> much of it fun fact the guys from</font>

1200
00:55:03,290 --> 00:55:06,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">do all apps came in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> topless</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i know if</font>

1201
00:55:05,240 --> 00:55:08,720
you guys heard of them really cool

1202
00:55:06,680 --> 00:55:10,339
people do some really good products they

1203
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:11,689
can't talk to us and actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> they found</font>

1204
00:55:10,340 --> 00:55:13,340
out the same thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> but they found out</font>

1205
00:55:11,690 --> 00:55:14,990
why there was some guy that went on

1206
00:55:13,340 --> 00:55:17,270
children extracted all the readies list

1207
00:55:14,990 --> 00:55:19,430
and was logging into the<font color="#CCCCCC"> readies</font>

1208
00:55:17,270 --> 00:55:20,990
encrypting all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the data leaving the URL</font>

1209
00:55:19,430 --> 00:55:22,759
and locking the red is actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> making</font>

1210
00:55:20,990 --> 00:55:24,799
it secure because the<font color="#CCCCCC"> litter</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was not all</font>

1211
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:26,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're exposed and that's why we see that</font>

1212
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:28,280
drop<font color="#E5E5E5"> over days when the guy decided on</font>

1213
00:55:26,390 --> 00:55:29,819
these rapid changes lock all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> red is</font>

1214
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:34,769
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the internets</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> well</font>

1215
00:55:29,819 --> 00:55:40,319
I wear this yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> I promise wise watch</font>

1216
00:55:34,769 --> 00:55:44,459
Mean Time discovery to attractions

1217
00:55:40,319 --> 00:55:47,308
classification of all the no car

1218
00:55:44,459 --> 00:55:49,140
discover okay so yeah I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

1219
00:55:47,309 --> 00:55:51,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">know the into that until when i'll just</font>

1220
00:55:49,140 --> 00:55:53,308
give you a metric we can do entire

1221
00:55:51,150 --> 00:55:55,829
country of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Portugal which is 5.2 million</font>

1222
00:55:53,309 --> 00:55:58,259
IP addresses in about five minutes for

1223
00:55:55,829 --> 00:56:00,749
one more so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you know the thing is</font>

1224
00:55:58,259 --> 00:56:02,699
the way we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have our place on prepared</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

1225
00:56:00,749 --> 00:56:05,218
customer<font color="#E5E5E5"> is willing to pay we just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> raise</font>

1226
00:56:02,699 --> 00:56:08,430
our scanners from 100 sensor to 200<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

1227
00:56:05,219 --> 00:56:10,049
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> time gets all so it depends I can't</font>

1228
00:56:08,430 --> 00:56:11,430
give<font color="#CCCCCC"> you an exact match it because there</font>

1229
00:56:10,049 --> 00:56:13,199
isn't an exact match there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just the</font>

1230
00:56:11,430 --> 00:56:17,299
one who<font color="#CCCCCC"> used regularly which is usually</font>

1231
00:56:13,199 --> 00:56:23,249
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 50 to 60 sensors scary</font>

1232
00:56:17,299 --> 00:56:27,209
what else<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay oh come</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on just to follow</font>

1233
00:56:23,249 --> 00:56:31,319
that was largest give it a client to use

1234
00:56:27,209 --> 00:56:33,029
oh yeah usually if it's really really

1235
00:56:31,319 --> 00:56:34,680
large scans they just<font color="#E5E5E5"> consume more fire</font>

1236
00:56:33,029 --> 00:56:37,799
hose so we've got two<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

1237
00:56:34,680 --> 00:56:39,509
sell we either sell we've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to fire</font>

1238
00:56:37,799 --> 00:56:41,670
hose is one of torrent data one of

1239
00:56:39,509 --> 00:56:43,259
scanning data which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a 242 per month</font>

1240
00:56:41,670 --> 00:56:44,549
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> if it's really large cans he</font>

1241
00:56:43,259 --> 00:56:45,749
compensates<font color="#E5E5E5"> in trying to just consume</font>

1242
00:56:44,549 --> 00:56:47,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">their spirals unless they want some</font>

1243
00:56:45,749 --> 00:56:49,198
really custom else they just do on

1244
00:56:47,940 --> 00:56:50,759
demand scanning and then it's usually

1245
00:56:49,199 --> 00:56:52,529
smaller scans because it's for their

1246
00:56:50,759 --> 00:56:53,699
<font color="#CCCCCC">lines or four smaller infrastructure</font>

1247
00:56:52,529 --> 00:56:55,859
things like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I like to tell so for</font>

1248
00:56:53,699 --> 00:56:58,349
example that just want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to scan the socks</font>

1249
00:56:55,859 --> 00:57:04,529
the day either<font color="#E5E5E5"> soft is monitoring things</font>

1250
00:56:58,349 --> 00:57:12,349
like that I actually like sugar but no

1251
00:57:04,529 --> 00:57:12,349
not book a report oh<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay yes do you do</font>

1252
00:57:12,499 --> 00:57:19,379
as in eternal either so<font color="#E5E5E5"> really cool</font>

1253
00:57:15,989 --> 00:57:22,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">stuff we've got a met an app on the app</font>

1254
00:57:19,380 --> 00:57:25,039
store apple TV iOS that essential you

1255
00:57:22,890 --> 00:57:27,900
guys can scan your internal network and

1256
00:57:25,039 --> 00:57:29,459
it acts has to say as a minion<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font>

1257
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:32,699
would on<font color="#E5E5E5"> this normal infrastructure</font>

1258
00:57:29,459 --> 00:57:34,410
reason for this two reasons<font color="#E5E5E5"> we want to</font>

1259
00:57:32,699 --> 00:57:35,999
start<font color="#E5E5E5"> working out you know what we can</font>

1260
00:57:34,410 --> 00:57:38,098
get internally and how to<font color="#CCCCCC"> do we internal</font>

1261
00:57:35,999 --> 00:57:40,948
data second<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing I want these guys have</font>

1262
00:57:38,099 --> 00:57:42,060
axes yeah you're able to categorize the

1263
00:57:40,949 --> 00:57:43,710
different devices on your

1264
00:57:42,060 --> 00:57:45,810
an<font color="#E5E5E5"> effort I want these guys in a couple</font>

1265
00:57:43,710 --> 00:57:47,700
of months to write a not making model to

1266
00:57:45,810 --> 00:57:49,380
categorize devices live underneath good

1267
00:57:47,700 --> 00:57:56,069
data for that we're gonna do some of the

1268
00:57:49,380 --> 00:57:57,870
data from DIA said it sorry this is the

1269
00:57:56,070 --> 00:58:01,800
