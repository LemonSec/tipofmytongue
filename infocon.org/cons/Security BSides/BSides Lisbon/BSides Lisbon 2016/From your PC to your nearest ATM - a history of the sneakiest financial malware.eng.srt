1
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:12,750
so you guys knew that there is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> TMO</font>

2
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:17,130
right like malware specifically created

3
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:21,920
for ATM machines who here was aware of

4
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:26,130
this kind of malware right everybody and

5
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:29,609
my first hint was<font color="#E5E5E5"> I moved back to</font>

6
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:32,159
Ireland like 2006 and when I lived in

7
00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:34,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">Spain all of those terminals were like</font>

8
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:36,809
the old kind of terminals like a<font color="#CCCCCC"> s400</font>

9
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:40,050
mainframe kind of ATMs you remember

10
00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:42,718
those in green you look really really

11
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:45,480
old and when<font color="#E5E5E5"> i move to ireland suddenly</font>

12
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:47,129
I saw you know like Windows environments

13
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:49,620
in the ATM<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you could suspect that</font>

14
00:00:47,129 --> 00:00:50,760
there was a ATM with windows because you

15
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:53,489
could see<font color="#E5E5E5"> every now and then these</font>

16
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:55,620
errors<font color="#E5E5E5"> no and all of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the security</font>

17
00:00:53,489 --> 00:00:59,399
specialists back then and I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking</font>

18
00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:01,410
about 2005-2006 we all said wow this

19
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:05,549
this is going to spell doom this is just

20
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:08,970
going to be a disaster<font color="#CCCCCC"> any time and yet</font>

21
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:12,060
we started seeing the disaster happening

22
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:13,619
like a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> years ago not before so</font>

23
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:15,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">for me is we were surprising you know</font>

24
00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:17,159
from 2006 I've been expecting it's like

25
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:18,570
it's going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to happen is going to happen</font>

26
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:21,270
is going to happen there's going to be

27
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:25,169
something big and only now we're seeing

28
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:28,500
it and yeah it is really becoming

29
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:30,750
mainstream is it something<font color="#E5E5E5"> to worry yet</font>

30
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:32,549
I mean do you guys need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be worried</font>

31
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:36,030
when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you go to the next itm to retrieve</font>

32
00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:40,409
money that the fearing that your data is

33
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:43,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to be picked up probably not yet</font>

34
00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:47,180
right Ben it happens often body when it

35
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:50,520
happens well I'm space neither<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right</font>

36
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:52,740
so but when it<font color="#CCCCCC"> happens it makes it to</font>

37
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:55,408
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> media and now I'll show examples of</font>

38
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:57,179
instances when attacks of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this have</font>

39
00:01:55,409 --> 00:01:59,490
happened and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> really hear it I mean</font>

40
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:02,210
they happen every now and then I wonder

41
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:04,439
when they happen boo everybody knows

42
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:05,850
this is another<font color="#E5E5E5"> example this is a more</font>

43
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:09,720
recent<font color="#E5E5E5"> one this one I love it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

44
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:11,190
it's just system from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> UK you know if</font>

45
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:13,740
you don't see<font color="#E5E5E5"> it there it says your</font>

46
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:18,450
password has expired please change it

47
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:21,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay yeah how do i change that and verse</font>

48
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:23,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">three</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> reasons we believe that this trend</font>

49
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:27,120
has been picking up lately these three

50
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:30,980
reasons I we believe that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a that</font>

51
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:35,430
the main core of the question<font color="#CCCCCC"> right the</font>

52
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:37,679
y1 is that the bad guys they have no

53
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:40,050
problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> attacking exotic platforms and I</font>

54
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,120
mean exotic with quotes right because it

55
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:44,220
this is not really<font color="#E5E5E5"> excited we're talking</font>

56
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:47,250
windows right but windows with different

57
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:49,080
hardware with different stuff they have

58
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:50,340
no problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> like 10 years ago you</font>

59
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:52,860
wouldn't see that many attacks on

60
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:56,520
strange platforms right now they're

61
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:59,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">taking on like POS that's points of sale</font>

62
00:02:56,520 --> 00:03:02,760
those that's strange the special devices

63
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:04,770
we're seeing mobile hardware being

64
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:07,079
attacked wissing all sorts of how we're

65
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:08,970
being attacked now ATM is a bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

66
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:10,890
difficult right because you know if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

67
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:13,230
want to attack an Android I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a</font>

68
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:15,600
hold on Android and it studied what do

69
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:18,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">they do with their ATMs well they're</font>

70
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:20,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing that precisely that they just take</font>

71
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:22,770
an ATM steal it still the whole thing

72
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:24,330
all we see in that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know i'll tell</font>

73
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:27,120
you later about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the story of an arrest</font>

74
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:28,700
and when they took over<font color="#E5E5E5"> the guys you</font>

75
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">know they went</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the house the police</font>

76
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:33,269
arrested them<font color="#CCCCCC"> the house and the house of</font>

77
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:36,179
course it had all sorts of development

78
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:38,550
devices and stuff and then to ATMs 280

79
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:40,290
digits picked up the<font color="#CCCCCC"> athens bring them</font>

80
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:41,880
home and start analyzing and seeing

81
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:43,470
what's in there what the protections are

82
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:45,329
what they look like what kind of

83
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:47,580
architecture they're using their doing

84
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:49,020
that so right now this is one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

85
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:51,510
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the bad</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> guys are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing is</font>

86
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:53,640
just you know they're very bold<font color="#E5E5E5"> i need</font>

87
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:56,489
to attack that Oh pick it up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and study</font>

88
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:58,619
it so they're very bold the second one

89
00:03:56,490 --> 00:04:02,940
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they're dealing with windows XP</font>

90
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:06,800
mean XP it's from 2001 so we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking</font>

91
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:10,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">about a 15 year old more than that</font>

92
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:12,600
almost 16 year old operating system so

93
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:14,970
the guys at this point of very skilled

94
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:18,149
are doing everything with our windows XP

95
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:21,298
that that's pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> good for them and the</font>

96
00:04:18,149 --> 00:04:22,979
third reason is that Microsoft and I'm

97
00:04:21,298 --> 00:04:24,810
not pointing that fingers I think

98
00:04:22,979 --> 00:04:26,669
Microsoft did<font color="#E5E5E5"> a good thing microsoft</font>

99
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:29,670
created something called the

100
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:32,580
extended financial services which is

101
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:34,950
some sort of middleware API that makes

102
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:37,320
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bank's lives much easier it means</font>

103
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:40,860
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> order for a bank to develop</font>

104
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:43,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">hardware not software for the ATM and</font>

105
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:45,270
communicate with the special devices

106
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:46,800
that ATMs are they just need to

107
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:48,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">communicate with that middleware and</font>

108
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,000
that middleware communicates directly

109
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:54,000
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the hardware so the bank needs to</font>

110
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,840
just when you configure an ATM install

111
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:00,090
this XFS layer so that it communicates

112
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:02,159
up rapidly with with a card reader with

113
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:04,310
the cassettes and then the money with a

114
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:07,170
camera<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the alarms if it has</font>

115
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:09,600
everything is abstracted if there is an

116
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:11,760
abstraction layer so that the program

117
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">only needs to use those api's it's like</font>

118
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:15,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay retrieve the pin code that's it</font>

119
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:18,570
that's great right because the

120
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:20,969
developers for them is just calling an

121
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:23,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">API and they don't care if the if the</font>

122
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:25,380
brand of the ATM is a or b or c they

123
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:29,120
just don't care they just make a one

124
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:32,570
single API call now the developers a

125
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:35,460
boon they're very happy the bad guys

126
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:37,349
super happy<font color="#E5E5E5"> because they better need to</font>

127
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:42,150
care about what the underlying hardware

128
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:46,110
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok give me the give me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that whole</font>

129
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:49,409
track to data from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the car that</font>

130
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:52,500
the user just plugged in all in great

131
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:55,860
just you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know really really good XFS has</font>

132
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:58,290
been great advance for developers for

133
00:05:55,860 --> 00:06:00,720
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> banks greater than for developers of</font>

134
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:03,990
of malware and now we're at that point

135
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:06,150
at a dud junction where everybody is

136
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:08,700
very happy except<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the banks because</font>

137
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:10,739
they're seeing these attacks massively I

138
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:13,620
mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> not very optimal would they happen</font>

139
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:17,630
they are amazing and you'll see examples

140
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:22,470
of that later so as shocking as it is

141
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:26,159
the way in to an ATM is usually this so

142
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:28,350
the guy walks near an ATM normally it's

143
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,930
going to be one<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is not in the bank</font>

144
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:33,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">right in a mall or some isolated area</font>

145
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:36,760
some sort of 7-eleven in the back

146
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:40,270
they just open with a special key those

147
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:42,550
keys are usually not not unique so it's

148
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:44,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">the same key that opens the whole bunch</font>

149
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:47,979
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> ATMs for the whole network they just</font>

150
00:06:44,919 --> 00:06:50,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">open access the main board and then they</font>

151
00:06:47,979 --> 00:06:54,340
access either the USB or they access the

152
00:06:50,979 --> 00:06:57,669
CD reader so they put a CD boot the

153
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:59,710
machine and boot into a special<font color="#E5E5E5"> XP or in</font>

154
00:06:57,669 --> 00:07:03,430
a special windows environment then they

155
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:05,919
mount the whole system as a unit and

156
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:08,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">then they modify it because you know</font>

157
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:11,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">that the windows</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> XP the original windows</font>

158
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:15,310
XP from the machine is not running<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

159
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:17,080
another separate machine which means

160
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:19,479
that they can modify it will they can

161
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:22,960
just add staff so that the next<font color="#CCCCCC"> time it</font>

162
00:07:19,479 --> 00:07:25,570
reboots the machine is infected so I CCS

163
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:28,180
that we're seeing that with CDs DVDs and

164
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:30,690
we're seeing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> USBS so they just</font>

165
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:33,910
plug in a pendrive reboot the machine

166
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:35,979
infected that nothing it looks super

167
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:39,039
complicated right but of course the guys

168
00:07:35,979 --> 00:07:41,289
are you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know minimally good at this so</font>

169
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:43,650
they have managed to script this so the

170
00:07:41,289 --> 00:07:47,050
whole operation takes about five<font color="#CCCCCC"> minutes</font>

171
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:51,130
so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> need to just open plug-in</font>

172
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:54,070
reboot the scripts run<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay reboot again</font>

173
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:55,419
close the machine<font color="#CCCCCC"> is infected now we'll</font>

174
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:57,340
see what<font color="#E5E5E5"> happens with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the machine is</font>

175
00:07:55,419 --> 00:07:59,710
infected which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty unusual but</font>

176
00:07:57,340 --> 00:08:01,090
this is the way I mean amazing<font color="#E5E5E5"> now of</font>

177
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:03,638
<font color="#CCCCCC">course</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I have to tell you that there's</font>

178
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:05,830
another way in another possible way in

179
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:09,010
which is if you manage to take over<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

180
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:11,440
network of the bank then you could jump

181
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:13,479
into the special network normally

182
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:15,760
they're protected by VPS right so you

183
00:08:13,479 --> 00:08:17,729
could<font color="#E5E5E5"> manage to if you have the right</font>

184
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:21,490
credentials to jump through the network

185
00:08:17,729 --> 00:08:23,800
it has happened but<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is much easier</font>

186
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:25,930
I mean if the guy is at the right key

187
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:28,150
and normally<font color="#E5E5E5"> the keys are just the round</font>

188
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:31,539
kind that just open and and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

189
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:34,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">right then and what the guys do is they</font>

190
00:08:31,539 --> 00:08:37,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">look at banks that have this protection</font>

191
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:39,849
and they just<font color="#E5E5E5"> open one jackpot the whole</font>

192
00:08:37,659 --> 00:08:42,039
<font color="#CCCCCC">machine go to the next one in the same</font>

193
00:08:39,849 --> 00:08:43,690
neighborhood do it again do it again do

194
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:47,020
it again they spend the whole weekend

195
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:49,420
doing this millions<font color="#E5E5E5"> of pounds you</font>

196
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:53,020
dollars whatever and then they<font color="#CCCCCC"> go home</font>

197
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:56,349
so super<font color="#CCCCCC"> easy for from their point of</font>

198
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:57,670
view now what they want it's already

199
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:59,440
mentioned you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know that parting the</font>

200
00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:01,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">machine just you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know machine give me</font>

201
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,220
everything they check all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the cassettes</font>

202
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:05,200
the money cassettes and they manage to

203
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:07,810
empty the whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> machine that's the most</font>

204
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:11,560
obvious<font color="#CCCCCC"> one but it's not the only</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

205
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:13,660
why because this one it's a one-off you

206
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:16,150
only get<font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> chance you empty the</font>

207
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:20,079
<font color="#CCCCCC">machine whatever normally these machines</font>

208
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:22,689
will have between 100 150 thousand euros

209
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:26,800
a pop which is see these in the money

210
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:29,440
money right not bad now the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

211
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:31,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's a virtual skimming you know what</font>

212
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:34,510
skimming is right skimming is putting a

213
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:38,020
device<font color="#E5E5E5"> on top of the ATM so that when</font>

214
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:41,470
the user puts in the pain and the card

215
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:43,390
then those devices pick up the track

216
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:46,420
data and pick up the pin code because

217
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:51,220
the the user is skiing ring over the

218
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:54,160
fake keyboard now if you have control

219
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:56,290
over the whole system then you might<font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font>

220
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:58,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">well put a keylogger that does all that</font>

221
00:09:56,290 --> 00:10:00,819
and the advantage<font color="#CCCCCC"> the advantage of that</font>

222
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:03,310
is that the bank is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to notice</font>

223
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:05,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">because of course if I jackpot the</font>

224
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:07,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">Machine the bank notices it was like wow</font>

225
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:09,430
a machine<font color="#CCCCCC"> is empty and i have no</font>

226
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:10,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">transactions something's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wrong they send</font>

227
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:13,150
a technician they put that machine off

228
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:15,850
the network<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they probably destroy</font>

229
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:19,120
the machine it lasts<font color="#E5E5E5"> for one day it's a</font>

230
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:21,250
one it's a one one trick and that's it

231
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:23,500
now if you manage to the virtual

232
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:27,910
skimming to put a keylogger that that

233
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:30,040
locks every single transaction then the

234
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:32,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">bank doesn't know you can have these</font>

235
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:35,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">things going on forever and then every</font>

236
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:38,199
every day every week or every month the

237
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:40,300
guy<font color="#CCCCCC"> just gets the machine</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay these are</font>

238
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:43,540
the logs from the latest transactions

239
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:45,400
then he clones those credit cards and

240
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:48,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">then sells them away this is happening</font>

241
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:50,949
<font color="#CCCCCC">so both we have Jack potting and we have</font>

242
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:54,430
virtual skimming both going on at the

243
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:56,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">same time and I'll go for the families</font>

244
00:10:54,430 --> 00:11:00,420
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> aren't that many so this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not a</font>

245
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:05,050
not a major issue

246
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:08,349
right number one is this the<font color="#E5E5E5"> granddaddy</font>

247
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:11,560
this is the oldest<font color="#CCCCCC"> one so when I said</font>

248
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:16,420
2006 we didn't think actually from 2009

249
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:19,479
sky mer came along sky mer is a it was

250
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:21,670
Jack<font color="#CCCCCC"> boring back then and it was it was</font>

251
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:24,100
found in Russia and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Ukraine so you</font>

252
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:26,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">think this probably in eastern european</font>

253
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:29,200
origin right that's what we thought

254
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:32,109
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's just attacking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> debolt this</font>

255
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:34,470
was way before XFS before the extent of

256
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:37,720
financial services<font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> microsoft and</font>

257
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:40,870
and of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course it had to target this</font>

258
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:42,610
specific API from one vendor the vendor

259
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:45,430
that was attacked and this time is

260
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:47,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">debolt so only diebold ATMs</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> were</font>

261
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:50,140
affected and are affected by this thing

262
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:52,540
this is the granddaddy but still alive

263
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:54,490
and kicking we are seeing still this

264
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:56,800
stuff in the wild with different

265
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:58,900
modifications a little bit more

266
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:01,900
developed but this<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing is out there</font>

267
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:05,949
still and you'd think ok this is Eastern

268
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:10,420
European right not so much in 2011 then

269
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:12,790
we saw<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same code base but instead of</font>

270
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:15,430
just doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jack potting it's doing</font>

271
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:17,829
virtual skimming it stays there it waits

272
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:21,099
for the bad<font color="#CCCCCC"> guy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to come with a special</font>

273
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:23,500
card he inserts the card and then he

274
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:25,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">gets</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> special menu and among the</font>

275
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:28,420
things in the menu<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's put everything</font>

276
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:32,320
you have locked into the car it dumps

277
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:34,390
all of the credit cards into the card

278
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:37,480
and then the guy steps away with a card

279
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:39,130
that card has a dump of everything every

280
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:41,170
transaction that has happened from than

281
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:43,060
80 m then the guy of course sells those

282
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:47,760
credit card numbers in the in the

283
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:51,790
underground and so we have to code bases

284
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:54,880
2009 clearly clearly jackpot in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Russia</font>

285
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:57,130
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ukraine 2011 only virtual</font>

286
00:12:54,880 --> 00:13:00,520
skimming but this was found in Brazil

287
00:12:57,130 --> 00:13:02,080
and Brazilian in Mexico so it's very

288
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:04,300
South American why is it very South

289
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:07,840
American because in the installation

290
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:10,390
routines all those special strings like

291
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:11,860
name you don't have privileges you have

292
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:13,720
you need the root privileges to install

293
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:16,959
everything is in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Spanish</font>

294
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:19,480
everything so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think Ukrainians</font>

295
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:23,290
haven't made this so you might<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

296
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:27,100
mainly some code base originally from

297
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:28,839
the Ukraine made it into you know

298
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:30,490
somehow somewhere in Latin America and

299
00:13:28,839 --> 00:13:33,790
the Latin Americans have started have

300
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:36,699
continued development maybe it's to

301
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:38,139
anyone's guess I have no<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

302
00:13:36,699 --> 00:13:41,199
believe right now is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a being developed</font>

303
00:13:38,139 --> 00:13:42,850
in Latin America but we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have no idea and</font>

304
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:45,399
we're seeing<font color="#E5E5E5"> it to this day in fact I</font>

305
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:47,230
have some some samples<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are received</font>

306
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:48,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">that I need to check out and i think</font>

307
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:51,730
that there's more stuff like the latest

308
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:55,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">ones they're using alternate data</font>

309
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:57,699
streams which is you know to hide files

310
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:59,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">i have no idea</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> why i guess that they're</font>

311
00:13:57,699 --> 00:14:01,449
fearing that the banks are seeing it but

312
00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:04,360
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> banks they have a hard time because</font>

313
00:14:01,449 --> 00:14:06,490
a normal bank will have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a network of</font>

314
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:08,980
thousands and thousands of ATM so they

315
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:10,689
cannot send a technician even once a

316
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:12,850
month even once a year just to check if

317
00:14:10,689 --> 00:14:16,389
something's up unless<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's an alarm</font>

318
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:19,000
they don't check those machines so but

319
00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:22,360
it's being developed so<font color="#CCCCCC"> number two we</font>

320
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:25,509
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> Protus and this is again found in</font>

321
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:28,689
2013 imagine the leap 2009 2011 then

322
00:14:25,509 --> 00:14:31,629
2013 no work from 2009 from the

323
00:14:28,689 --> 00:14:34,540
granddaddy we're only seeing the second

324
00:14:31,629 --> 00:14:37,930
one pretty recently 2013 so this is

325
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:39,670
picking up now plotters the only

326
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:41,739
objective is Jack potting so it only

327
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:44,979
takes cash no virtual skimming no

328
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:49,709
logging anything and again since this is

329
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:53,829
from before the API the XFS API it aims

330
00:14:49,709 --> 00:14:56,709
only at one vendor which is NCR now<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

331
00:14:53,829 --> 00:14:59,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">would not be amazed if something</font>

332
00:14:56,709 --> 00:15:02,170
surfaces that is<font color="#CCCCCC"> FLOTUS for Diebold or</font>

333
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:04,269
<font color="#CCCCCC">pluto's for any other window it may be</font>

334
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:05,800
we only have seen this and what we have

335
00:15:04,269 --> 00:15:08,009
bear in mind that we have a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard</font>

336
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:10,719
time getting those samples because

337
00:15:08,009 --> 00:15:12,850
either they delete themselves at some

338
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:14,769
point and then you can get to them or if

339
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:16,389
the bank is lucky enough to get those

340
00:15:14,769 --> 00:15:18,490
samples they don't necessarily share it

341
00:15:16,389 --> 00:15:21,819
with us so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have a hard time seeing</font>

342
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:23,679
samples<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm only seeing sample from NCR</font>

343
00:15:21,819 --> 00:15:26,889
so I have to assume that<font color="#CCCCCC"> these guys are</font>

344
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:27,540
only targeting NCR why probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

345
00:15:26,889 --> 00:15:30,300
it's very calm

346
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:32,550
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Latin America Latin America and CR</font>

347
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:36,029
and evil apparently in Mexico at least

348
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:38,490
the very common clearly Latin American

349
00:15:36,029 --> 00:15:39,959
and the nice thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> about this one I</font>

350
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:44,160
don't know how they<font color="#E5E5E5"> came with this idea</font>

351
00:15:39,959 --> 00:15:47,008
right but it supports not only a menu

352
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:49,319
which when it's infected the bad guy

353
00:15:47,009 --> 00:15:51,690
gets a menu right and on screen he can

354
00:15:49,319 --> 00:15:54,120
take retrieve all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the money give me</font>

355
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:56,970
everything he hears everything but it

356
00:15:54,120 --> 00:16:00,449
also supports commands<font color="#E5E5E5"> through SMS which</font>

357
00:15:56,970 --> 00:16:05,130
means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the bad guys have to hook and</font>

358
00:16:00,449 --> 00:16:07,199
a phone into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the into the machine put it</font>

359
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:09,600
in close the<font color="#E5E5E5"> machine and then at some</font>

360
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:11,339
point text so that it gets<font color="#CCCCCC"> some money</font>

361
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,470
now<font color="#CCCCCC"> the bad guys probably thought okay</font>

362
00:16:11,339 --> 00:16:16,680
this is great<font color="#E5E5E5"> because we can reuse and</font>

363
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:18,420
reuse and reuse every time by sending

364
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:21,359
text and then tomorrow they fill it up

365
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:24,089
and then we empty it again doesn't

366
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:27,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">happen I mean the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bank see this is like</font>

367
00:16:24,089 --> 00:16:31,170
out how this ATM is out of the network

368
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:32,899
and they bring it home so of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> even</font>

369
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:35,399
though<font color="#E5E5E5"> it might seem like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a good idea</font>

370
00:16:32,899 --> 00:16:37,050
it's actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> giving more hints to the</font>

371
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:39,649
police as to who's behind right because

372
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:42,930
you're leaving behind more stuff with

373
00:16:39,649 --> 00:16:45,569
fingerprints and with stuff so mmm it's

374
00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:47,310
a nice idea you should goes to show that

375
00:16:45,569 --> 00:16:49,439
the guys are developing and their

376
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:52,349
creative but nothing much more I mean

377
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:56,040
it's interesting not really useful for

378
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:57,959
them number three and again South

379
00:16:56,040 --> 00:17:00,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">America we know it's South America</font>

380
00:16:57,959 --> 00:17:02,819
because we're seeing it in South America

381
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:04,140
it might come<font color="#CCCCCC"> from somewhere else but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

382
00:17:02,819 --> 00:17:06,059
think it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> South America it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font>

383
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:09,150
dispenser I don't know who names these

384
00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:11,459
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> bring this Minister so this one</font>

385
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:14,400
was first found in 2015 you're seeing

386
00:17:11,459 --> 00:17:18,209
how most of them have been found 2015 on

387
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:20,459
your 3 2016<font color="#E5E5E5"> too so it's picking up speed</font>

388
00:17:18,209 --> 00:17:22,079
right now in this in this last few

389
00:17:20,459 --> 00:17:24,000
months<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we expect the future to be</font>

390
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:25,379
like women much more because the guys

391
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,059
are seeing that this is relatively

392
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:29,970
simple it's not that difficult and

393
00:17:27,059 --> 00:17:32,970
they're starting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to develop this so the</font>

394
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:36,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">banks need really to spruce up here this</font>

395
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:38,760
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very similar cash but with a big</font>

396
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,040
difference this one uses XFS because

397
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:41,779
this is relatively recent the sample

398
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:44,989
that we

399
00:17:41,779 --> 00:17:48,200
ah it seems to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be targeting only wincor</font>

400
00:17:44,989 --> 00:17:51,529
nixdorf which is another ATM vendor but

401
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:54,349
through XFS it means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it uses those</font>

402
00:17:51,529 --> 00:17:58,759
parts of XFS that are specific to wink

403
00:17:54,349 --> 00:18:00,468
or installations so you know it's it's

404
00:17:58,759 --> 00:18:03,229
different we're seeing that there's more

405
00:18:00,469 --> 00:18:05,149
development here like the guys to me

406
00:18:03,229 --> 00:18:07,279
even<font color="#CCCCCC"> though</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it uses a different</font>

407
00:18:05,149 --> 00:18:10,518
programming language than the previous

408
00:18:07,279 --> 00:18:13,700
dump<font color="#E5E5E5"> Lotus it looks similar so it's not</font>

409
00:18:10,519 --> 00:18:18,289
crazy to think that it's either a span

410
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:20,779
of subgroup from the previous one or

411
00:18:18,289 --> 00:18:22,099
perhaps a rival gang you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know the</font>

412
00:18:20,779 --> 00:18:23,479
another gang there's all these ones are

413
00:18:22,099 --> 00:18:26,320
doing it I'm doing it too because it

414
00:18:23,479 --> 00:18:28,789
brings a lot of money it may be and

415
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:32,178
clearly Latin America somewhere<font color="#CCCCCC"> in Latin</font>

416
00:18:28,789 --> 00:18:33,769
America so I'm I said South America but

417
00:18:32,179 --> 00:18:37,279
I should have<font color="#E5E5E5"> said Latin America because</font>

418
00:18:33,769 --> 00:18:39,919
a lot of them are in Mexico so Mexico

419
00:18:37,279 --> 00:18:43,570
technically<font color="#E5E5E5"> is North America but Latin</font>

420
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:46,039
America and we understand each other now

421
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:47,928
<font color="#E5E5E5">these are this is for the Latin American</font>

422
00:18:46,039 --> 00:18:50,719
part you can see a thing going<font color="#CCCCCC"> on there</font>

423
00:18:47,929 --> 00:18:52,789
right there must be a few gangs there

424
00:18:50,719 --> 00:18:54,289
there are operating pretty much in the

425
00:18:52,789 --> 00:18:57,200
same way it might be the same gang

426
00:18:54,289 --> 00:18:59,929
developing three branches<font color="#CCCCCC"> diebold for</font>

427
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:02,299
NCR m4 wincor nixdorf it might be rival

428
00:18:59,929 --> 00:19:05,029
gangs they might not<font color="#E5E5E5"> not even know each</font>

429
00:19:02,299 --> 00:19:08,119
other we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have no idea the fourth one</font>

430
00:19:05,029 --> 00:19:11,210
it's a departure from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the from these</font>

431
00:19:08,119 --> 00:19:14,389
ones the fourth one they call the<font color="#CCCCCC"> neo</font>

432
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:17,210
pocket was found by a consultancy firm

433
00:19:14,389 --> 00:19:18,949
in Spain because they have a lot of

434
00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:20,659
customers in Latin America and it was

435
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:23,869
found in Central America of all places

436
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:26,479
and it was this is very<font color="#CCCCCC"> specific so this</font>

437
00:19:23,869 --> 00:19:28,999
thing only<font color="#E5E5E5"> attacked debo machines</font>

438
00:19:26,479 --> 00:19:31,219
because that's what we found it but it

439
00:19:28,999 --> 00:19:33,440
knew exactly the protection software

440
00:19:31,219 --> 00:19:36,729
that the machine had so the ATM was

441
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:41,059
protected by a wide listing application

442
00:19:36,729 --> 00:19:43,190
so it knew how to accept make an

443
00:19:41,059 --> 00:19:46,549
exception of itself of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

444
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:49,399
malware into the internet<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

445
00:19:46,549 --> 00:19:52,389
particular knowing the path knowing

446
00:19:49,399 --> 00:19:54,959
everything of this specific machine

447
00:19:52,389 --> 00:19:57,449
these guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> who found it a very</font>

448
00:19:54,960 --> 00:20:00,450
find it because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it had an expiration</font>

449
00:19:57,450 --> 00:20:02,070
date so this thing had like a campaign a

450
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:04,380
particular amount of time I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it was</font>

451
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:06,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">like six months and after six months you</font>

452
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:09,149
would delete itself so it was super

453
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:11,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">targeted even knew exactly what kind of</font>

454
00:20:09,149 --> 00:20:13,529
ATM they were going to what kind of

455
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:16,678
<font color="#CCCCCC">protection software it was running</font>

456
00:20:13,529 --> 00:20:18,990
everything and it was also limited in

457
00:20:16,679 --> 00:20:20,909
time and this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just purely virtual</font>

458
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:23,760
skimming so he was just gathering data

459
00:20:20,909 --> 00:20:25,559
only there was no<font color="#E5E5E5"> money involved so this</font>

460
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:27,990
thing could have lived there it probably

461
00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:31,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">did live there for the full</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> amount of</font>

462
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:33,600
time imagine<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of those ATMs from this</font>

463
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:36,750
particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bank for the full six months</font>

464
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:40,678
living there and you know gig getting

465
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:43,770
getting getting data you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> anybody is</font>

466
00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:46,529
subject to that we think that it<font color="#E5E5E5"> had</font>

467
00:20:43,770 --> 00:20:49,590
some some amount of insider knowledge

468
00:20:46,529 --> 00:20:53,429
right it<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't happen by chance either</font>

469
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:56,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">they the bad guys paid somebody to know</font>

470
00:20:53,429 --> 00:20:59,730
all the exact protection and all the

471
00:20:56,190 --> 00:21:01,950
installation or some insider did it

472
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:06,600
itself himself you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> it may be it may</font>

473
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:08,669
be and in any case this is a this pretty

474
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:12,658
scary because if you tell this to banks

475
00:21:08,669 --> 00:21:14,909
it dawns on them the notion that they

476
00:21:12,659 --> 00:21:16,200
could have<font color="#E5E5E5"> any amount of ATMs infected</font>

477
00:21:14,909 --> 00:21:18,360
by this kind of things and they would

478
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:20,669
have no idea no idea and no way<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

479
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:23,189
knowing other than<font color="#E5E5E5"> just stepping into</font>

480
00:21:20,669 --> 00:21:25,110
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ATM and and checking if there's</font>

481
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:28,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">something else something strange running</font>

482
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:30,330
which is really<font color="#E5E5E5"> not not doable right if</font>

483
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:32,279
you have like five thousand ATMs

484
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:34,350
throughout the country you cannot send a

485
00:21:32,279 --> 00:21:36,899
technician to<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of them</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just to run</font>

486
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:41,240
some process<font color="#E5E5E5"> and let's see if process</font>

487
00:21:36,899 --> 00:21:47,850
explorer find something<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not doable</font>

488
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:49,890
again<font color="#E5E5E5"> Latin America now number five we</font>

489
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:52,889
call it Pat pin most of them called it

pat pat pin pin pad the other way around

491

492
00:21:54,659 --> 00:22:02,450

493
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:05,429
Russia isolated parts of Russia

494
00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:08,010
objective is purely cash it's only<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:16,620
also<font color="#CCCCCC"> aims there's versions way Matt</font>

498
00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:19,470
other at other vendors but the ones

499
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:23,129
we've seen it say NCR purely Eastern

500
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:25,380
Europe now there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> another name for this</font>

501
00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:27,029
out there we<font color="#CCCCCC"> called tube Caen now the</font>

502
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:29,820
interesting thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> about this one if you</font>

503
00:22:27,029 --> 00:22:32,639
notice this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the only one that hints</font>

504
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:34,168
at Eastern European origin right but the

505
00:22:32,639 --> 00:22:37,500
interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> didn't think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about this one</font>

506
00:22:34,169 --> 00:22:40,169
is that the arrests that have been made

507
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:42,710
by<font color="#E5E5E5"> law</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> enforcement agencies I've been</font>

508
00:22:40,169 --> 00:22:45,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">here right and you see that the bad guys</font>

509
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:48,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">are actually actually licensing the</font>

510
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:50,730
software to gangs the gangs are taking

511
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:53,520
the money risking themselves getting

512
00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:55,409
arrested in the process some of them but

513
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:57,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">the developer is nowhere to be seen we</font>

514
00:22:55,409 --> 00:23:00,059
have no idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> who the developer is but</font>

515
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:02,039
it's clearly Eastern European because<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

516
00:23:00,059 --> 00:23:03,928
you know there's stuff in Cyrillic

517
00:23:02,039 --> 00:23:09,720
inside and we started seeing it in

518
00:23:03,929 --> 00:23:12,049
Russia way way in 2014 and funny thing

519
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:15,389
is that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know that the developer it's</font>

520
00:23:12,049 --> 00:23:18,690
selling it or licensing it to others now

521
00:23:15,389 --> 00:23:23,370
how do how do the developers know Hank

522
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:25,529
how can they control the spreading of

523
00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:27,479
this thing right that these guys don't

524
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:31,380
give it to somebody else<font color="#E5E5E5"> now the</font>

525
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:33,750
licensing there you go the licensing

526
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:36,840
works this way and this is this is a

527
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:39,299
tendency among all of them so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> web</font>

528
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:42,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">works is the guy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in front of the Machine</font>

529
00:23:39,299 --> 00:23:43,740
opens the machine in facts closest and

530
00:23:42,149 --> 00:23:45,479
then they have a special menu and then

531
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:47,789
the first thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the malware does is</font>

532
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:49,409
say okay give me a<font color="#E5E5E5"> special key now the</font>

533
00:23:47,789 --> 00:23:50,940
guy has no<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea what the special key</font>

534
00:23:49,409 --> 00:23:54,090
because it's time based its time

535
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:56,190
dependent so the guy has<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go the boss</font>

536
00:23:54,090 --> 00:23:58,379
of the gang and say hey what's the time

537
00:23:56,190 --> 00:24:00,929
what the one was that was the<font color="#E5E5E5"> key</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

538
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:03,389
the key right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now it's black give him a</font>

539
00:24:00,929 --> 00:24:06,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">small little string and then only then</font>

540
00:24:03,389 --> 00:24:08,789
they can take the money so the guy

541
00:24:06,389 --> 00:24:10,290
controls exactly who's retrieving the

542
00:24:08,789 --> 00:24:12,300
money and how much money

543
00:24:10,290 --> 00:24:15,750
that's the way they control it so it's

544
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:17,639
some sort of licensing scheme that these

545
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:19,200
guys have which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is kind of funny if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

546
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:22,590
think about I mean even the bad guys

547
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:27,300
don't trust each other which honor among

548
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:29,040
pirates right here so<font color="#CCCCCC"> em I'll put</font>

549
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:32,040
examples of a pattern because this is

550
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:34,530
the one that<font color="#E5E5E5"> has been not technically</font>

551
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:36,629
research technically<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not super</font>

552
00:24:34,530 --> 00:24:39,870
complex other than that you need an ATM

553
00:24:36,630 --> 00:24:41,820
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> really want to run things with</font>

554
00:24:39,870 --> 00:24:45,020
the ex FS and everything we don't have

555
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:47,399
an ATM then it just doesn't run right

556
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:49,620
but you can suspect you look at the code

557
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:51,710
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can suspect it technically you</font>

558
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:55,709
can get a look at the code without

559
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:58,920
without much problem now law enforcement

560
00:24:55,710 --> 00:25:01,380
have have<font color="#CCCCCC"> been able to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get these guys</font>

561
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:03,780
and I'll show examples later it's really

562
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:07,530
really cool now number<font color="#CCCCCC"> six it's from</font>

563
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:09,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">August 2016 and this one we have no idea</font>

564
00:25:07,530 --> 00:25:12,810
it's it's pretty new so it's just cash

565
00:25:09,690 --> 00:25:15,390
it was a one attack one big attack in in

566
00:25:12,810 --> 00:25:17,070
Thailand back in August if you're if you

567
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:19,710
want to New the news<font color="#CCCCCC"> this kind of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> news</font>

568
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:23,100
it was pretty pretty big back then the

569
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:26,520
guys just<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know sweet a lot of ATMs</font>

570
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:29,310
in in one weekend and managed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get a</font>

571
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:31,800
lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> money no idea there's no hints</font>

572
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:33,480
inside the only thing that I of course

573
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:36,600
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not tight I would not believe that</font>

574
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:38,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's ty by the model I'd say Eastern</font>

575
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:42,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">European and i'll tell you why later in</font>

576
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:44,990
the next slide but as the only<font color="#E5E5E5"> hint that</font>

577
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:48,090
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have here is that in the code it's</font>

578
00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:50,010
one misspelling cassette you see that

579
00:25:48,090 --> 00:25:51,959
it's missing<font color="#CCCCCC"> a tee normally cassette</font>

580
00:25:50,010 --> 00:25:55,520
should have to tease so either the by

581
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:58,530
the guy is very<font color="#E5E5E5"> bad speller or he's</font>

582
00:25:55,520 --> 00:26:02,010
portuguese exactly portuguese or

583
00:25:58,530 --> 00:26:04,440
brazilian so that's the only hint it<font color="#E5E5E5"> may</font>

584
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:06,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">be we have no idea now the model this</font>

585
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:10,320
model that that were hinting here are

586
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:13,350
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to one country sweeping a bunch of</font>

587
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:15,030
ATMs and going back home a country

588
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:19,199
totally unrelated to your own country

589
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:20,730
it's been used in pat pin and this is

590
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:23,389
the example this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the guy that was a</font>

591
00:26:20,730 --> 00:26:26,209
that was arrested right so

592
00:26:23,389 --> 00:26:28,519
oh this was an attack in the to the UK

593
00:26:26,209 --> 00:26:31,429
it was one weekend it was one holiday

594
00:26:28,519 --> 00:26:33,709

595
00:26:31,429 --> 00:26:35,719
holiday they move it to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Monday's they</font>

596
00:26:33,709 --> 00:26:37,219
don't have you know just to allowed not

597
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:41,629
to allow<font color="#CCCCCC"> people to have very long</font>

598
00:26:37,219 --> 00:26:45,320
weekends they're nasty that way so on a

601
00:26:49,759 --> 00:26:56,059
went over London and around London so a

602
00:26:53,809 --> 00:26:58,879
couple of neighborhoods around London so

603
00:26:56,059 --> 00:27:02,539
1.6 millions in a weekend of pounds

604
00:26:58,879 --> 00:27:07,699
another pound 2016 2014 was more than

605
00:27:02,539 --> 00:27:09,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's worth today just you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font>

606
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:12,859
money<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> money in one single</font>

607
00:27:09,529 --> 00:27:14,959
weekend now the soca does the law

608
00:27:12,859 --> 00:27:16,639
enforcement agency in the UK they were

609
00:27:14,959 --> 00:27:18,440
investigating this stuff they had no

610
00:27:16,639 --> 00:27:21,529
idea you know how to go about it they

611
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:24,829
got a hint and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this guy was was on</font>

612
00:27:21,529 --> 00:27:28,729
to it they followed<font color="#CCCCCC"> him they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> arrested</font>

613
00:27:24,829 --> 00:27:31,519
the guy and the guy just<font color="#E5E5E5"> entered the UK</font>

614
00:27:28,729 --> 00:27:34,129
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> somewhere else he was not even from</font>

615
00:27:31,519 --> 00:27:37,989
the UK so that was the first hint no

616
00:27:34,129 --> 00:27:40,728
somebody's licensing<font color="#E5E5E5"> this pad pin thing</font>

617
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:44,719
they were teaching<font color="#CCCCCC"> them how to do it so</font>

618
00:27:40,729 --> 00:27:47,809
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> were like some sort of no</font>

619
00:27:44,719 --> 00:27:52,489
instructions or training or whatever and

620
00:27:47,809 --> 00:27:56,119
then the little gang would go to one

621
00:27:52,489 --> 00:27:58,700
unrelated completely unrelated country

622
00:27:56,119 --> 00:28:01,099
and you just attack get all the money

623
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:05,359
get into the night plane and go back

624
00:28:01,099 --> 00:28:07,189
home this guy I think he was<font color="#CCCCCC"> a his</font>

625
00:28:05,359 --> 00:28:09,228
George<font color="#CCCCCC"> n but he was based in Romania or</font>

626
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:13,129
moldova or somewhere<font color="#CCCCCC"> in Eastern Europe</font>

627
00:28:09,229 --> 00:28:14,539
not not Russia on the Ukraine so that

628
00:28:13,129 --> 00:28:18,369
was the model that was the first hint of

629
00:28:14,539 --> 00:28:22,190
the model now the same thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> happened in</font>

630
00:28:18,369 --> 00:28:23,629
Malaysia again same kind of like

631
00:28:22,190 --> 00:28:26,509
Thailand<font color="#CCCCCC"> ah I was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> telling you earlier</font>

632
00:28:23,629 --> 00:28:30,678
right this was verified that this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> pat</font>

633
00:28:26,509 --> 00:28:34,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">ping so they went to Malaysia they took</font>

634
00:28:30,679 --> 00:28:36,780
a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of money</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and went back home now we</font>

635
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:40,740
were not<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure who it was but I</font>

636
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:45,720
heard<font color="#E5E5E5"> this data this this fact right the</font>

637
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:48,210
same guy here Grigori Pilate was in

638
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:51,390
Malaysia<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same weekend that the</font>

639
00:28:48,210 --> 00:28:53,730
attack up it's not demonstrated that

640
00:28:51,390 --> 00:28:57,540
it's him but you know it looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> likely</font>

641
00:28:53,730 --> 00:28:59,640
and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> Kuala Lumpur that's uh that's the</font>

642
00:28:57,540 --> 00:29:01,649
police Malaysian police is telling you

643
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:03,840
this stuff is<font color="#E5E5E5"> very small so I'm going to</font>

644
00:29:01,650 --> 00:29:06,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">blow it up a bit we believe that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> he</font>

645
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:07,919
continued his crime spree he the

646
00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:10,200
criminal in several countries before

647
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:14,370
fleeing to London he went<font color="#E5E5E5"> to London of</font>

648
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:16,350
course and morphed like this has

649
00:29:14,370 --> 00:29:18,780
happened in United Kingdom Russia

650
00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:22,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">Malaysia Germany and Canada so none of</font>

651
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:24,960
these attacks<font color="#E5E5E5"> and having made it to the</font>

652
00:29:22,050 --> 00:29:27,090
news but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know Malaysian police is</font>

653
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:28,440
telling us<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they have happened so i</font>

654
00:29:27,090 --> 00:29:30,570
don't know if<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have happen but</font>

655
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:32,910
apparently they have so these guys are

656
00:29:30,570 --> 00:29:35,189
acting exactly in that way the same

657
00:29:32,910 --> 00:29:38,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">people is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to one country</font>

658
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:39,960
sweeping money going back home that's

659
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:42,930
what i was saying that even though i

660
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:46,590
have no<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea who the Ripper number six</font>

661
00:29:42,930 --> 00:29:48,720
the author was or or the<font color="#CCCCCC"> gang behind was</font>

662
00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:50,970
but it looks<font color="#CCCCCC"> very much in line with this</font>

663
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:53,640
kind of strategy so i would say it looks

664
00:29:50,970 --> 00:29:59,370
Eastern European<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can't say but it</font>

665
00:29:53,640 --> 00:30:03,390
looks now january 2016 the romanian

666
00:29:59,370 --> 00:30:06,000
police arrested the whole gang one whole

667
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:08,820
gang that was doing this in romania that

668
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,470
was in january so they went to the house

669
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:13,110
and they saw the whole thing and

670
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:15,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">everything and they arrested the whole</font>

671
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:19,020
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> whole gang it was like seven people</font>

672
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:21,270
in both<font color="#E5E5E5"> i seem to believe and the whole</font>

673
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:25,379
gang there was no developer there was no

674
00:30:21,270 --> 00:30:28,290
development here happening at all<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

675
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:29,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">right and so there was no development</font>

676
00:30:28,290 --> 00:30:31,710
the guys were just licensing the

677
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:35,100
software they were just getting it from

678
00:30:31,710 --> 00:30:37,290
somewhere the doing getting the training

679
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:39,300
knowing how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to attack performing the</font>

680
00:30:37,290 --> 00:30:41,909
attack<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> back home so that was</font>

681
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:44,070
another hint now as many arrests as we

682
00:30:41,910 --> 00:30:46,140
can get here we see that these guys are

683
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:47,879
moving a lot they're moving through the

684
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:49,040
Russian underground of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Russian</font>

685
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:50,720
speaking on the ground

686
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:52,399
but they are not<font color="#E5E5E5"> the developers</font>

687
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:56,890
themselves the developers themselves are

688
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:56,890
not exposing or not getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> exposed</font>

689
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:09,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">and I'm actually was with that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all right</font>

690
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:29,350
all right I'm actually worse with this

691
00:31:24,610 --> 00:31:38,620
because I move a lot so I usually finish

692
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:46,289
this one giving recommendations maybe

693
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:50,340
it's me I track the waves here all right

694
00:31:46,289 --> 00:31:52,929
giving recommendations to<font color="#CCCCCC"> to others</font>

695
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:54,820
normally the recommendations are pretty

696
00:31:52,929 --> 00:31:57,370
straightforward right everybody in the

697
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:59,500
security industry the first thing you

698
00:31:57,370 --> 00:32:02,408
you you notice about this is physical

699
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:04,570
security don't use those keys that one

700
00:32:02,409 --> 00:32:07,360
single key can open the whole network it

701
00:32:04,570 --> 00:32:10,330
just doesn't make sense now it might

702
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:13,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">seem obvious to us but it's not so</font>

703
00:32:10,330 --> 00:32:16,570
obvious to banks why because if it's

704
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:19,390
difficult to have one guy go to the

705
00:32:16,570 --> 00:32:22,360
middle<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you know whatever countryside</font>

706
00:32:19,390 --> 00:32:25,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">location and open imagine how difficult</font>

707
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:27,100
you would be if every single one of

708
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:29,679
those ATM had a different ones a

709
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:31,209
different key it would mean that they

710
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:35,049
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to go to a central location</font>

711
00:32:31,210 --> 00:32:38,049
where all the keys are go to the ok pick

712
00:32:35,049 --> 00:32:40,120
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> this for the street a and then go to</font>

713
00:32:38,049 --> 00:32:41,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">a three day open it and then go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> back to</font>

714
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:43,719
the potential location and put it there

715
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:45,428
and with central locations we're talking

716
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:48,010
about different<font color="#E5E5E5"> countries I'm in</font>

717
00:32:45,429 --> 00:32:50,679
different cities and in the same country

718
00:32:48,010 --> 00:32:53,230
so it would<font color="#CCCCCC"> make their logistically</font>

719
00:32:50,679 --> 00:32:55,150
their work that<font color="#E5E5E5"> much more difficult so I</font>

720
00:32:53,230 --> 00:32:58,840
understand that<font color="#CCCCCC"> but still insists it's</font>

721
00:32:55,150 --> 00:33:03,480
not very good<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> physical security I</font>

722
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:06,549
would say also if you don't need a USB

723
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:08,360
USB port in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the main board don't pull</font>

724
00:33:06,549 --> 00:33:11,470
will USB port just you know

725
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:13,939
it's not it honestly is not needed

726
00:33:11,470 --> 00:33:15,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">cd-dvd do you really need that you need</font>

727
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:18,650
to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it bootable probably not right</font>

728
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:20,260
offline security refers to exactly that

729
00:33:18,650 --> 00:33:24,440
all those measures that can be taken

730
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:28,520
offline right the firmware you know

731
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:32,590
don't make don't make the bios

732
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:36,440
accessible don't make any external

733
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:40,070
devices bootable pretty obvious to<font color="#E5E5E5"> us</font>

734
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:42,980
right for them you would mean if you

735
00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:44,360
have a 10,000 or<font color="#CCCCCC"> 5,000 ATM network going</font>

736
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:46,370
to each<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of them and established</font>

737
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:49,100
policies that takes money that takes

738
00:33:46,370 --> 00:33:51,020
effort so until it happens more and

739
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:53,360
their width in the bought a couple of

740
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:55,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">times and like oh I lost 1.6 millions</font>

741
00:33:53,360 --> 00:34:00,229
actually I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to start a new policy</font>

742
00:33:55,730 --> 00:34:02,919
here it will<font color="#E5E5E5"> start happening and of</font>

743
00:34:00,230 --> 00:34:06,100
course online security you know put your

744
00:34:02,919 --> 00:34:10,460
VPNs which are probably already there

745
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:13,159
firewalls you name it anything that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

746
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:15,230
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> top of the operating</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> system once the</font>

747
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:17,270
operating system has booted whitelisting

748
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:20,359
solutions they're there they're being

749
00:34:17,270 --> 00:34:22,100
used there's no guarantee because if you

750
00:34:20,359 --> 00:34:23,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">can boot from a separate operating</font>

751
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:27,290
system then it doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> matter how many</font>

752
00:34:23,899 --> 00:34:28,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">firewalls and I TAS and I pas and it</font>

753
00:34:27,290 --> 00:34:31,820
doesn't matter<font color="#CCCCCC"> because you own the</font>

754
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:34,429
system so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is for by ordinal of</font>

755
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:38,629
importance<font color="#CCCCCC"> I would go first for physical</font>

756
00:34:34,429 --> 00:34:40,850
then offline and then online<font color="#E5E5E5"> a big one</font>

757
00:34:38,629 --> 00:34:42,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">for instance would be to have the</font>

758
00:34:40,850 --> 00:34:44,629
operating system or the whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> disk</font>

759
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:46,609
encrypted so that even if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you boot from</font>

760
00:34:44,629 --> 00:34:49,819
outside then you won't<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> able to mount</font>

761
00:34:46,609 --> 00:34:52,159
it and modify stuff so there'll be a big

00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:54,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">one I understand it's a huge pain in the</font>

763
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:57,640
ass<font color="#CCCCCC"> for them but I think it would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be you</font>

764
00:34:54,230 --> 00:35:00,650
bring a lot of very<font color="#CCCCCC"> good security and</font>

765
00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:04,940
and this is pretty much my message you

766
00:35:00,650 --> 00:35:07,160
know ADM our exists so do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we need to be</font>

767
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:09,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">concerned about it we as users not so</font>

768
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:14,060
much you know we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> security industry</font>

769
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:16,010
as a curiosity so far the financial

770
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:18,080
industry definitely you bet they near

771
00:35:16,010 --> 00:35:20,210
ially need to be in double this<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

772
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:21,980
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> really do that's pretty much it</font>

773
00:35:20,210 --> 00:35:33,670
thanks very much

774
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:33,670
I do have<font color="#E5E5E5"> time for questions right sure</font>

775
00:35:39,910 --> 00:35:48,770
scarier so um at the end of the day that

776
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:51,259
the vendor they just create the case<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

777
00:35:48,770 --> 00:35:53,600
put the hardware<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's up to the bank</font>

778
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:56,440
to do all that<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff so you could you</font>

779
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:59,839
can't do it that<font color="#E5E5E5"> way definitely you can</font>

780
00:35:56,440 --> 00:36:02,720
but even<font color="#E5E5E5"> though those those things exist</font>

781
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:05,780
for practical purposes they're not going

782
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:07,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">to be implemented in every case why I'll</font>

783
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:10,700
tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> you why because when you have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font>

784
00:36:07,550 --> 00:36:13,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">ATM in house in the bank then normally</font>

785
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:16,368
it has a camera the alarm and everything

786
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:18,970
but when you set up<font color="#E5E5E5"> an ATM which is</font>

787
00:36:16,369 --> 00:36:22,040
isolated in the middle of a mall or

788
00:36:18,970 --> 00:36:24,350
better known in some vendor in some

789
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:26,380
7-eleven somewhere if you put an alarm

790
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:30,430
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> 7-eleven guy is going to be like</font>

791
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:34,010
what happened I have no idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> what to do</font>

792
00:36:30,430 --> 00:36:39,529
it doesn't matter<font color="#CCCCCC"> what would it do I</font>

793
00:36:34,010 --> 00:36:41,869
mean in five minutes that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> precisely I</font>

794
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:44,240
mean it's not impossible and in fact a

795
00:36:41,869 --> 00:36:46,130
lot of times it is implemented but

796
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:49,040
precisely the<font color="#CCCCCC"> atms that they're</font>

797
00:36:46,130 --> 00:36:51,800
targeting are the ones who are most

798
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:53,990
likely to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be unattended so even if there</font>

799
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:55,940
was such an alarm in those remote

800
00:36:53,990 --> 00:36:59,419
locations they would<font color="#E5E5E5"> never reach in time</font>

801
00:36:55,940 --> 00:37:01,910
like five minutes I get to my menu<font color="#E5E5E5"> Cole</font>

802
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:03,440
what's the number here's a number how

803
00:37:01,910 --> 00:37:06,589
many<font color="#E5E5E5"> cassettes how many how much money</font>

804
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:09,020
give me<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything i set a everything</font>

805
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:15,859
does that<font color="#E5E5E5"> be everything is etsy grab the</font>

806
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:17,950
money out yeah and they<font color="#E5E5E5"> even have in</font>

807
00:37:15,859 --> 00:37:21,980
those menus they have an option of

808
00:37:17,950 --> 00:37:24,710
secure deletion so delete everything so

809
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:27,650
it deletes itself and it leaves no

810
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:30,530
remnants so the bad guys I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

811
00:37:27,650 --> 00:37:32,450
bank knows that something has happened

812
00:37:30,530 --> 00:37:33,930
they go there they try to do some

813
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:35,490
forensics

814
00:37:33,930 --> 00:37:38,220
they don't see anything they<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't get</font>

815
00:37:35,490 --> 00:37:40,020
any samples so that's why<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> rare</font>

816
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:42,808
for me to get samples I'm really

817
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:45,660
struggling sometimes I suspect that

818
00:37:42,809 --> 00:37:47,460
there are samples like those Pluto's I

819
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:50,339
would suspect very strongly that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's</font>

820
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:52,920
a version of Pluto's that attacks wincor

821
00:37:50,339 --> 00:37:56,099
nixdorf or or any other vendor<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I'm</font>

822
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:58,970
not seeing no but yeah definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

823
00:37:56,099 --> 00:38:02,700
hardware definitely supported

824
00:37:58,970 --> 00:38:08,848
implementation down to the bank yeah

825
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:10,890
there was a question<font color="#E5E5E5"> over there right he</font>

826
00:38:08,849 --> 00:38:13,410
talked about the virtual<font color="#CCCCCC"> skimming style</font>

827
00:38:10,890 --> 00:38:15,569
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a technique and I want to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know to</font>

828
00:38:13,410 --> 00:38:18,149
call if clarify something the target

829
00:38:15,569 --> 00:38:22,160
there is just a<font color="#CCCCCC"> great car numbers right</font>

830
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:25,770
because when you dial your your<font color="#E5E5E5"> PIN the</font>

831
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:28,379
key is exempted in hardware so it's

832
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:33,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">impossible to get the pin for EMV yes</font>

833
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:36,450
for EMV it's the encrypted be a<font color="#CCCCCC"> PIN pad</font>

834
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:39,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">I say so many times bad pain that's</font>

835
00:38:36,450 --> 00:38:42,328
something pin pad it is then create pin

836
00:38:39,299 --> 00:38:43,950
pad so what happens is that there's an

837
00:38:42,329 --> 00:38:46,440
encrypted version of it so you enter

838
00:38:43,950 --> 00:38:50,040
your PIN and that's a that's encrypted

839
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:52,230
so the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Pad encrypts it sends it</font>

840
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:54,569
somewhere to the to a central location

841
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:56,670
in a database and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then it says yes or no</font>

842
00:38:54,569 --> 00:38:58,558
yes so you cannot pick it up yes you

843
00:38:56,670 --> 00:39:01,380
would only get the whole track one track

844
00:38:58,559 --> 00:39:03,930
track<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2 and tracked yes so this is the</font>

845
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:06,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">target is it's the credit card numbers</font>

846
00:39:03,930 --> 00:39:09,509
there's no EMV so<font color="#E5E5E5"> imagine in the US then</font>

847
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:13,380
that might anything that is encoded in

848
00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:15,809
might be so the pin is okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay you're</font>

849
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:17,730
right you can think<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've seen that that</font>

850
00:39:15,809 --> 00:39:23,760
question<font color="#E5E5E5"> before you Tori right okay</font>

851
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:27,180
thank you hello I got a very specific

852
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:30,480
question you said the developers

853
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:36,259
themselves for licensing the software to

854
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:40,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">the to the Rings right so I would they</font>

855
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:42,510
what did<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use them as a password so</font>

856
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:44,329
was it something like<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google</font>

857
00:39:42,510 --> 00:39:47,340
Authenticator that will generate a

858
00:39:44,329 --> 00:39:51,060
one-time password or<font color="#E5E5E5"> something like that</font>

859
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:53,640
you see I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know why this didn't</font>

860
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:57,509
come up right do you see this this the

861
00:39:53,640 --> 00:40:00,240
licensing it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> this on a site right and</font>

862
00:39:57,510 --> 00:40:03,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">on that story this is a this has been</font>

863
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:05,850
seen by some consultant in Russia in a

864
00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:07,620
Russian underground is this is the the

865
00:40:05,850 --> 00:40:10,920
advertisement from whoever selling tube

866
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:12,810
tube keypad people yet I thought you is

867
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:15,180
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> five thousand dollars to encrypt I</font>

868
00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:18,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">thought you were able to take a look at</font>

869
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:20,970
the sample of that code so that was like

870
00:40:18,390 --> 00:40:22,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">well licensing we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't really know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how</font>

871
00:40:20,970 --> 00:40:26,700
their life<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay which one of the guys</font>

872
00:40:22,830 --> 00:40:29,549
what we know<font color="#CCCCCC"> is how each gang is able to</font>

873
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:33,210
control the food soldiers in front of

874
00:40:29,550 --> 00:40:38,310
the Adrian so those are those codes are

875
00:40:33,210 --> 00:40:40,230
usually completely random ish kind of

876
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:43,710
like time-based let me show you an

877
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:45,780
example of one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them yeah that will</font>

878
00:40:43,710 --> 00:40:47,460
they would think a secret with the

879
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:50,280
computer and generated through the

880
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:57,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">machines local time is not very pretty</font>

881
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:57,470
but it's some sort of base base64 thing

882
00:40:58,730 --> 00:41:05,790
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that guy would see that that's a QR</font>

883
00:41:02,310 --> 00:41:09,660
code that QR code the codes to this

884
00:41:05,790 --> 00:41:11,970
thing this thing if it's a if you do

885
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:14,370
base64 straight it doesn't work<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean</font>

886
00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:18,450
it's just bites it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably not that</font>

887
00:41:14,370 --> 00:41:20,549
so I think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's uh either custom</font>

888
00:41:18,450 --> 00:41:23,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">base 62</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> force or the alphabet has been</font>

889
00:41:20,550 --> 00:41:26,430
scrambled or maybe its bits and bytes I

890
00:41:23,250 --> 00:41:29,880
have no idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> but the guy the guy just</font>

891
00:41:26,430 --> 00:41:32,730
gives a screenshot this is what I'm

892
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:35,670
seeing is the input so you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> leave</font>

893
00:41:32,730 --> 00:41:37,680
him<font color="#CCCCCC"> there cuz you know stuff</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that to me</font>

894
00:41:35,670 --> 00:41:41,640
doesn't make sense yeah there has to be

895
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:44,250
some sort of special app on the phone

896
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:46,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">that they use they pick this up and then</font>

897
00:41:44,250 --> 00:41:49,790
the other guy returns<font color="#E5E5E5"> sometime base coat</font>

898
00:41:46,830 --> 00:41:51,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay right fix by the way this</font>

899
00:41:49,790 --> 00:41:56,300
originally is not there just<font color="#E5E5E5"> put</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

900
00:41:51,930 --> 00:42:00,839
there just to show what it decodes to

901
00:41:56,300 --> 00:42:02,970
okay you mentioned<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> banks can't</font>

902
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:04,860
go to every single<font color="#E5E5E5"> ATM to check what</font>

903
00:42:02,970 --> 00:42:07,680
what is<font color="#CCCCCC"> running their process explorer</font>

904
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:09,330
and the like but<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't they aren't ATMs</font>

905
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:12,390
connected to network and the bank

906
00:42:09,330 --> 00:42:14,160
connects to the atms and somehow i'm

907
00:42:12,390 --> 00:42:16,680
assuming they aren't rootkits that can

908
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:21,060
intercept the things that they can<font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font>

909
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:23,640
but are the<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are these banks trying</font>

910
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:25,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">to read remotely deformation of TTM so I</font>

911
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:28,319
don't work for a<font color="#CCCCCC"> bank so i can't really</font>

912
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:30,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">know so this is absolutely bank specific</font>

913
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:33,450
some banks<font color="#CCCCCC"> I know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for a fact that they</font>

914
00:42:30,450 --> 00:42:37,589
have very complex systems of managing

915
00:42:33,450 --> 00:42:41,279
ATMs down to even seeing whether they've

916
00:42:37,590 --> 00:42:43,290
been compromised or the if the disk

917
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:46,650
encryption is still running and running

918
00:42:43,290 --> 00:42:50,130
fine and there are some completely<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

919
00:42:46,650 --> 00:42:52,470
managed so it comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> down to the budget</font>

920
00:42:50,130 --> 00:42:54,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">on back if they have more budget and</font>

921
00:42:52,470 --> 00:42:57,390
they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to spend they are products</font>

922
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:59,400
some smaller banks they might not<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

923
00:42:57,390 --> 00:43:02,339
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> money or they you know they haven't</font>

924
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:04,170
seen themselves as likely targets<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

925
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:06,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">this kind of theft so they're not</font>

926
00:43:04,170 --> 00:43:07,920
spending it so the possibilities are

927
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:10,350
there all of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> are using them</font>

928
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:12,570
definitely not that's why when you see

929
00:43:10,350 --> 00:43:16,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">one of these attacks happening it</font>

930
00:43:12,570 --> 00:43:21,120
happens<font color="#E5E5E5"> to normally the the weakest</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

931
00:43:16,650 --> 00:43:30,090
weakest protected back mm-hmm I think

932
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:31,930
there was<font color="#CCCCCC"> some more than all right thank</font>

933
00:43:30,090 --> 00:43:33,990
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys</font>

934
00:43:31,930 --> 00:43:33,990
you
