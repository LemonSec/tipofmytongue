point<font color="#CCCCCC"> my happen with monster is that</font>

11
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:13,890
what I say is this where the<font color="#E5E5E5"> patient is</font>

12
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:17,330
my opinion and not mine and clip so what

13
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:20,400
it is I'm sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> also be repairable videos</font>

14
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:24,840
but I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do somewhere quick hate</font>

15
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:27,659
introduction thank you so what exactly

16
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:31,890
is a little is it when I of service

17
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:36,630
attack at the entity stop or deny access

18
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:40,220
to any resource or service so unlike

19
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:40,220
other type of the times that try to

20
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:49,189
insert a other part<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that try to</font>

21
00:01:45,619 --> 00:01:51,630
steal some information those tags try to

22
00:01:49,189 --> 00:01:56,309
drop your<font color="#E5E5E5"> service and the night for</font>

23
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:59,219
hottest for legitimate users so let's

24
00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:02,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">look for difference between</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> does</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and yes</font>

25
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:05,298
I understand mostly attacker try to use

26
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:09,179
some exploit or mobility in software

27
00:02:05,299 --> 00:02:11,770
design service of your service<font color="#CCCCCC"> or your</font>

28
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:15,580
system indeed<font color="#E5E5E5"> us attacks</font>

29
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:19,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">exod distributed so this is what's</font>

30
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:21,720
coming amount of traveling and mostly<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

31
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:25,540
flew for your system or<font color="#E5E5E5"> mini request</font>

32
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:28,270
high bandwidth or<font color="#E5E5E5"> changing so to try to</font>

33
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:33,420
exhaust any resource<font color="#E5E5E5"> you use for your</font>

34
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:36,580
sister so if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and give us attacks</font>

35
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:38,290
we never actually two main type of

36
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:43,230
videos hard first one is<font color="#E5E5E5"> volumetric</font>

37
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:46,750
attacked voltammetric<font color="#CCCCCC"> sharks try to</font>

38
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:50,019
exhaust research for infrastructure for

39
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:55,390
example memories you have a then<font color="#E5E5E5"> give</font>

40
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:57,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">babies try to send more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> than give your</font>

widget users will<font color="#CCCCCC"> have some levin see</font>

42
00:02:57,490 --> 00:03:05,830
and another touch of the type of magic

43
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:07,900
attack is texas-based<font color="#E5E5E5"> tax so the type of</font>

44
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:13,360
tribes resource of your any machines

45
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:15,310
like firewalls or out so this how they

46
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:18,280
take a look and our systems example only

47
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:22,090
one side you can see a<font color="#CCCCCC"> family's attached</font>

48
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:25,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">with 300 gigabit per second even huge</font>

49
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:28,959
company can be heated by such a drag

50
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:32,980
it's very<font color="#E5E5E5"> messy actually the biggest one</font>

51
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:38,560
is obscene is 470 jigga be so<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is just</font>

52
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:41,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">amazing how big he is and on other side</font>

53
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:44,410
you can see there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a packet per second</font>

54
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:46,959
<font color="#CCCCCC">of that so reach 200 and few can</font>

55
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:49,990
remember matte medium packet per second

56
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:53,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">book so we may and your router or</font>

bleep it<font color="#CCCCCC"> six all the resources and the</font>

59
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:05,140
other type of the DDoS attacks is well

seven times for application<font color="#E5E5E5"> text this</font>

67
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:30,190
it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little crash mostly of trucks try</font>

to do to a<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2 x database attacks try to</font>

76
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:58,479
stir the example from all season how

00:04:54,550 --> 00:05:03,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">application layer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that look like you can</font>

78
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:05,920
see a blue line is just a human's so

79
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:08,560
it's the difference between a human

80
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:11,830
named amount of traffic and boss there

00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:21,609
a request and it's enough to crash in

83
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:26,350
very<font color="#CCCCCC"> very strong bigger 87 so what what</font>

84
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:28,270
we do good and distinguish between both

85
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:30,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">of human smell different classification</font>

86

fingers between<font color="#CCCCCC"> from time so when you</font>

87
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:37,990
can stop the attack on balls and<font color="#E5E5E5"> let</font>

88
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:40,870
human to access the set the interesting

89
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:45,100
statistic have very important record

90
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:49,660
that almost in water of attacks are

91
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:52,720
faltering multi-vector means if I could

92
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:55,150
try to hit your summer do not only<font color="#E5E5E5"> using</font>

93
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:57,910
application layer dark<font color="#E5E5E5"> alright then with</font>

94
00:05:55,150 --> 00:06:00,940
the attack through different<font color="#CCCCCC"> levels try</font>

95
00:05:57,910 --> 00:06:04,660
to find which spot here infrastructure

96
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:07,480
of your system on the other hand you can

97
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:11,070
see there are 75 percent or practical

98
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:15,100
only one letter means any script video

101
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:27,460
interesting statistic that they're

almost the 50 / of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sam was even more</font>

103
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:31,979
than once this report from our customers

104
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:34,170
behind

105
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:36,600
protection service so the attackers know

106
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:39,540
that they are protected and they still

107
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:42,990
continue to try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to attempt to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> find</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font>

109
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:49,350
it at once probably will more and more

110
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:55,560
and more till they succeed will<font color="#E5E5E5"> crush</font>

111
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:57,090
yourself so why to do videos attack<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

112
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:59,400
can descend why to do a skilled

113
00:06:57,090 --> 00:07:01,140
objection you can steal some credit card

114
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:03,659
information why to the remote code

115
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:07,289
execution you want to take<font color="#E5E5E5"> control of</font>

116
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:24,620
the server<font color="#CCCCCC"> slotek</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> success so any ideas</font>

117
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:24,620
why do you do<font color="#E5E5E5"> something oh she's ripped</font>

118
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:33,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">services it is Harper is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> down all right</font>

119
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:41,430
get conference down gen consoles robot

120
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:43,859
ok so i summarize the reasons let's stay

121
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:47,760
talk about so first one is business to

122
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:50,820
valor if you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a conference the</font>

123
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:53,490
concept of a shop ecommerce shop that

124
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:59,340
sells some tools and you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> take</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> down</font>

125
00:07:53,490 --> 00:08:01,950
your way<font color="#CCCCCC"> peters so you can purchase use</font>

126
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:05,820
for half is very cheap<font color="#E5E5E5"> from 20 to 50</font>

127
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:08,099
years dollars for one<font color="#E5E5E5"> hour and just get</font>

128
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:10,170
down your computer so all the customers

129
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:15,180
will come to you<font color="#E5E5E5"> or steal your other</font>

website but not another resonance nation

131
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:21,150
disick social it's very powerful some

132
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:24,810
nails sent to different a web server

133
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:28,020
wanna see<font color="#E5E5E5"> the day if the dotted if you</font>

139
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:45,720
they can do this give us attack in many

140
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:48,509
cases they count on

141
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:52,350
maybe groups like anonymous say that

142
00:08:48,509 --> 00:08:56,550
they have to say this power but the mail

143

happen to install a couple hospital when

people they run to the money goes to

185

understand what happened and try to

186
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:20,680
figure out this issue but actually it

187
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:22,780
was just a small<font color="#E5E5E5"> screen to reach it back</font>

to steal some confidential information

this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> news from the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> last month so what</font>

is just a charter from my age of easy so

225
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:50,540
what interesting about<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mirabal is he it</font>

226
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:52,790
is very simple technique to infect

open it you some social engineering you

230
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:04,550
just scan all the internet all there is

231
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:06,469
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> look for talent and assay with</font>

238
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:30,380
close any default username password so

239
00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:32,480
you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> just tell them equal the</font>

00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:37,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">problem we'll look inside how it does it</font>

259
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:43,220
works for example<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's do a sec and TCP</font>

260

00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:50,390
dms as well as HTTP what is not

262
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:53,480
interesting is<font color="#E5E5E5"> lou gehrig's jury is</font>

encapsulate your package send it to the

have to know whom to follow this packet

267
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:06,050
so if you do give us attack<font color="#CCCCCC"> from the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> GRE</font>

291
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:27,109

equinox<font color="#E5E5E5"> lead us for how a little smaller</font>

293
00:17:27,109 --> 00:17:34,149
this part of the code from cnc so you

294
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:36,459
can see those a SQL query that say a

00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:54,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">no just based on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bitcoins and you have a</font>

TCP and UDP flood shark on port 53 said

00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:16,480
I'm is the main<font color="#CCCCCC"> holster for DNS so</font>

305
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:22,540
mostly used by useful cord injury and

306
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:26,470
they send it packet packet rate rose 40

307

308
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:32,980
traffic so even such big company like

309
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:36,900
dying twitter and github post their

310
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:42,030
domains using time can be<font color="#CCCCCC"> heated by</font>

312
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:49,690
so let's understand how how we can do a

313
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:52,780
leader stack first of all let's talk

314
00:18:49,690 --> 00:18:55,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">about application past let's do some way</font>

315
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:57,760
i briefed a<font color="#CCCCCC"> pick up about the</font>

316
00:18:55,570 --> 00:19:00,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">application layer we have HD so for</font>

317
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:05,500
example this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a post request you have</font>

318
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:07,899
a URL path also<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted to reach</font>

319
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:11,740
different method updating HTTP headers

320
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:15,580
about a client user agent<font color="#CCCCCC"> accept</font>

321
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:17,320
language etc and post data so what we do

322
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:21,100
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> just send this information to our web</font>

323
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:25,950
host the<font color="#CCCCCC"> rebels resolve it and send</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> us</font>

324
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:28,750
off so what type of loop the sand is

325
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:32,410
common to the botnet for example me

326
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:36,340
right please reach victim server so if

327
00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:39,880
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can handle some capacity of fair</font>

328
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:44,230
quest<font color="#CCCCCC"> on current you have button if it</font>

329
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:48,510
contains 100 thousands<font color="#E5E5E5"> of balls probably</font>

330
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:48,510
even meet server can help

331
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:55,340
another thing that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Tucker's Dupree</font>

332
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:58,010
oh they try to<font color="#CCCCCC"> affect the seven</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> dots for</font>

333
00:19:55,340 --> 00:20:02,120
weak spots in your web page for example

334
00:19:58,010 --> 00:20:05,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">this page contains a large image so if</font>

335
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:08,209
you if it's not cache and try to get

336
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:12,260
more and more from this in HD if you're

337
00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:14,059
up play up stick traffic so as I

338
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:17,179
mentioned before you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> searched you</font>

339
00:20:14,059 --> 00:20:21,158
need some SQL queries so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can make</font>

340
00:20:17,179 --> 00:20:25,010
off searches to be database resource and

341
00:20:21,159 --> 00:20:26,990
museum impossible game CPU resources so

342
00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:32,149
all these can be used by<font color="#CCCCCC"> their check</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

343
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:35,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">to get yourself another type of attack</font>

344
00:20:32,149 --> 00:20:37,370
is volumetric<font color="#E5E5E5"> attention so let you quick</font>

345
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:41,210
recap of all the layers will not talk

346
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:44,018
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> their 141 to talk about the 34</font>

347
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:47,600
network layer<font color="#E5E5E5"> skyteam protocol and</font>

348
00:20:44,019 --> 00:20:54,409
transport layer so it's mostly tcp and

349
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:58,580
UDP so how a<font color="#E5E5E5"> packers do work on his list</font>

350
00:20:54,409 --> 00:21:00,169
first of all sinful all the time for

351
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:03,230
example attacker won't do sinful attack

352
00:21:00,169 --> 00:21:06,730
is sent back it hi I'm one on one<font color="#E5E5E5"> point</font>

353
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:09,500
one but this book is The Associated

354
00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:11,539
because this is the first packet that

355
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:15,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">send in three great handshake use</font>

356
00:21:11,539 --> 00:21:18,110
participe<font color="#E5E5E5"> sodium stood</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> let be the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> packet</font>

357
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:21,649
sent to the victim division I need to

358
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:24,830
store all the connections keep the state

359
00:21:21,649 --> 00:21:27,610
of them in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> table so you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> open the</font>

360
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:30,860
connection and send the response to a

361
00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:34,580
real one point one point one bit have no

362
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:39,080
idea what would ease of you<font color="#E5E5E5"> on put later</font>

363
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:41,360
that occurs and flood of this same

364
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:42,830
connections solve the table open

365
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:46,189
connection in the victim several girl

366
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:49,809
and growing volatile their<font color="#CCCCCC"> run you're</font>

367
00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:53,630
exhausted and probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> machine will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> try</font>

368
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:56,408
<font color="#E5E5E5">another type of attack is actual very</font>

369
00:21:53,630 --> 00:21:59,810
simple you just switch between sing f

370
00:21:56,409 --> 00:22:01,760
signal flag tcp<font color="#E5E5E5"> blackwell</font>

371
00:21:59,810 --> 00:22:07,760
and you send a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of attacks this the</font>

372
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:10,310
way all a that all requests based tax

373
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:12,890
time they send a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a key to a</font>

374
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:14,810
practice because small type of level we

375
00:22:12,890 --> 00:22:17,780
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> sever</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to understand if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's legit</font>

376
00:22:14,810 --> 00:22:22,550
or not would you take it before<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> drop</font>

377
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:26,570
it so if he'd say the resources of the

378
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:29,060
issue also our club can be done this

379
00:22:26,570 --> 00:22:31,610
reflection so inflection what we do we

380
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:34,879
take a syn packet send it through

381
00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:39,260
someone else then we send it the hook up

382
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:42,440
our source is spoofer for example<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font>

383
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:46,100
the weekly and i am<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to to to</font>

384
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:48,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">co-host so all the host response we seem</font>

385
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:50,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">act to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the week and the week we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

386
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:53,000
distinguish<font color="#E5E5E5"> between the jeep and not</font>

387
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:54,830
legit users because they came from

388
00:22:53,000 --> 00:23:02,450
distributed network from distributed

389
00:22:54,830 --> 00:23:04,970
sources one more attack is DM

390
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:09,250
certifications very very common its heat

391
00:23:04,970 --> 00:23:15,500
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> pantries</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and also a market</font>

392
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:19,010
hypothesis so what on this tag titles

393
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:24,380
and dns work with some requests about

394
00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:28,250
the domain to dns server and he s ever

395
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:30,530
respond with a result to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> beginning</font>

396
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:32,180
so what<font color="#CCCCCC"> happened here just amplified</font>

397
00:23:30,530 --> 00:23:34,820
because the request is very small you're

398
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:38,120
just ask you need information<font color="#CCCCCC"> about some</font>

399
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:41,090
domain but response can can be<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten times</font>

400
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:43,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">bigger because contains the information</font>

401
00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:49,159
develop and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> server's mail servers</font>

402
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:51,320
and IP a in<font color="#CCCCCC"> 48 so if you send small</font>

403
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:54,650
package the response will be much much

404
00:23:51,320 --> 00:24:00,050
bigger<font color="#E5E5E5"> and Bentley's as well as a</font>

405
00:23:54,650 --> 00:24:02,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">packaging so I want to show some way</font>

406
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:05,270
then small<font color="#CCCCCC"> demo about the DNS</font>

407
00:24:02,810 --> 00:24:08,270
amplification how easily can be done

408
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:12,620
using<font color="#E5E5E5"> cubicles and all we need to do is</font>

409
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:15,110
a workshop it's Swiss 94

410
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:17,090
for the whole network hair and security

411
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:19,159
researchers if you capture the<font color="#E5E5E5"> packets</font>

412
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:22,100
and see what's going on inside and

413
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:26,930
another<font color="#E5E5E5"> two is kept using Python so it's</font>

414
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:30,260
multi-platform and sketchy you can make

415
00:24:26,930 --> 00:24:32,390
your own packet it put the to kill the

416
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:36,860
fields inside the whatever you want I

417
00:24:32,390 --> 00:25:02,780
just send<font color="#E5E5E5"> over a order so I'll switch</font>

418
00:24:36,860 --> 00:25:07,250
today<font color="#CCCCCC"> chili we need three machines</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

419
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:10,300
one shady say check<font color="#E5E5E5"> out so use the cali</font>

420
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:27,400
another machine will be the winning

421
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:27,399
numbers and some she is a our dns server

422
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:31,030
so

423
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:52,240
look

424
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:14,640
so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the hour a dns a chainsaw we</font>

425
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:22,650
have here simple and fine silver so that

426
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:25,140
was information about the<font color="#E5E5E5"> foot back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

427
00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:29,360
you can see all<font color="#E5E5E5"> these there is formation</font>

428
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:38,460
left a vm server<font color="#E5E5E5"> storm about some domain</font>

429
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:41,159
so we use it for our publication now

430
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:53,670
that machine is windows and just check

431
00:26:41,160 --> 00:27:02,070
that e then 40 2.4<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and we have your</font>

432
00:26:53,670 --> 00:27:06,200
wireshark so of capture<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and fulfill</font>

433
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:06,200
the traffic that came from a<font color="#E5E5E5"> our a</font>

434
00:27:07,730 --> 00:27:25,280
coupon so it's 10.0 point two point five

435
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:30,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay silver truck there's no</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> charge and</font>

436
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:30,889
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the attacker cut it so</font>

437
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:41,750
it's IP is 10.0 Point to Point C so

438
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:47,230
let's talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> Chevy first of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all we need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

439
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:47,230
create a<font color="#E5E5E5"> different type of packets AIP</font>

440
00:27:50,080 --> 00:28:09,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">the EMS business boy so if you don't</font>

441
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:12,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">remember what the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what he feels</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font>

442
00:28:09,019 --> 00:28:16,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">feel in a side packet you get right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

443
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:20,779
example I p display so as<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can see</font>

444
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:23,029
those version 4 and a source and

445
00:28:20,779 --> 00:28:26,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">destination IP is by default they are</font>

446
00:28:23,029 --> 00:28:31,929
all right so first of all want access

447
00:28:26,809 --> 00:28:45,500
our are a<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS cell is so the try type ii</font>

448
00:28:31,929 --> 00:28:47,799
c standard 2.5 and let's fill out the NS

449
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:47,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">quarry</font>

450
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:56,980
okay so we need to write a yes

451
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:17,410
and we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to ask for not only for a</font>

452
00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:29,170
record but also for all records so right

453
00:29:17,410 --> 00:29:38,850
D&S you tied 55 so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll get all the</font>

454
00:29:29,170 --> 00:29:38,850
records and we want to do a recursive so

455
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:46,710
one and those on 14 saltiness

456
00:29:56,050 --> 00:30:02,980
so now we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a DNS oil and put it</font>

457
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:02,980
inside out a<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS Tekkit</font>

458
00:30:17,330 --> 00:30:24,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay and try to send it to our to the</font>

459
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:40,290
dns server to see what each

460
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:42,929
responsibility right 90 which happening

461
00:30:40,290 --> 00:31:24,210
their demos oh my god<font color="#CCCCCC"> but when you come</font>

462
00:30:42,930 --> 00:31:28,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">will remember it stopped working</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so</font>

463
00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:30,990
we have a response from<font color="#E5E5E5"> you from dns</font>

464
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:33,300
server<font color="#E5E5E5"> all information so let's let's</font>

465
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:37,550
see<font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the difference inside</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is so if</font>

466
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:37,550
I check the size of play our request

467
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:56,520
it's 58<font color="#CCCCCC"> 56 very small but the size of</font>

468
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:59,820
where the response it's 639 so it's more

469
00:31:56,520 --> 00:32:03,120
than<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 times bigger so if you if we</font>

470
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:06,780
switched from a source IP with school

471
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:09,989
they peel far waiting always 339 binds

477
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:43,100
packets and so let's check the windows

478
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:46,610
machine okay as you can see windows

479
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:49,669
machine received all the response from

480
00:32:46,610 --> 00:32:51,679
our<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS so because on top of UDP and no</font>

481
00:32:49,670 --> 00:32:55,130
one cares about<font color="#CCCCCC"> a three-way handshake</font>

482
00:32:51,680 --> 00:33:02,510
you can spoof your IP is the victim and

483
00:32:55,130 --> 00:33:08,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">the responsibility of attention so let's</font>

484
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:11,960
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> it acid promises sand</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay this way</font>

485
00:33:08,450 --> 00:33:17,420
we can send many many requests it is an

486
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:22,970
also reach the machine so I after is

487
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:26,330
small Leslie do it exactly the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same I've</font>

488
00:33:22,970 --> 00:33:30,800
showed you but then we have y lo why

489
00:33:26,330 --> 00:33:37,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">look so do we will send 1,000 requests</font>

490
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:39,950
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the machine so let's see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

491
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:43,970
happened to our windows machine try to

492
00:33:39,950 --> 00:33:46,160
stop receive blood a lot of traffic<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

493
00:33:43,970 --> 00:33:49,930
and discuss my people so they are

494
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:49,930
negotiations very very<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy</font>

495
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:28,750
so I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to say obrigada Gordon and if</font>

496
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:28,750
you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> any questions responsibility</font>

502
00:34:43,489 --> 00:34:53,658
excellent how much done deal with it

503
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:57,590
wrong i said if i get within here with

504
00:34:53,659 --> 00:35:00,500
the region prohibition it depends on

505
00:34:57,590 --> 00:35:02,750
your contract what most of the ice caves

506
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:05,210
that said if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have one gigabit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> deal</font>

507
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:07,850
that's when gob they will<font color="#E5E5E5"> not filter</font>

508
00:35:05,210 --> 00:35:22,700
your traffic and all the amount the<font color="#CCCCCC"> pop</font>

509
00:35:07,850 --> 00:35:25,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">the 10 video just gigabytes per second</font>

510
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:29,720
yes then there<font color="#CCCCCC"> was another smoke eh</font>

511
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:32,720
syncope about<font color="#E5E5E5"> one terabyte per second so</font>

512
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:34,850
moving this and weaknesses of the

513
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:38,290
protocols<font color="#CCCCCC"> but the NS induce be that you</font>

514
00:35:34,850 --> 00:35:42,110
referred well what<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your opinion about</font>

tnx digit erosion protection in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

516
00:35:42,110 --> 00:35:48,410
future how to say my opinion because I

00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:50,870
happen is company that good he does

518
00:35:48,410 --> 00:35:54,080
perfections of this kind of advertising

519
00:35:50,870 --> 00:35:57,890
I mean if you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do this protection</font>

520
00:35:54,080 --> 00:36:00,230
first of all<font color="#CCCCCC"> you need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to remember and</font>

521
00:35:57,890 --> 00:36:02,870
understand what is what's your weak

522
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:05,060
spots<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so if you need to protect</font>

523
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:06,000
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> infrastructure you need to care</font>

524
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:10,410
about

525
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:13,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">protection maybe some v GP and on demand</font>

526
00:36:10,410 --> 00:36:14,879
protection if you have web server you

527
00:36:13,110 --> 00:36:19,230
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to think about application layer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

528
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:22,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">that ok and right I'm sure you can try</font>

529
00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:25,350
speed you need to validate what are your

530
00:36:22,050 --> 00:36:30,390
contract to include yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> the question was</font>

531
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:32,940
marked in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same steps even the DDoS</font>

532
00:36:30,390 --> 00:36:36,900
protection company necklace protecting

533
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:39,360
Brian Krebs and website told him<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

534
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:42,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">can't protect</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> anymore so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll we'll</font>

535
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:44,580
compromise<font color="#E5E5E5"> other other customers so you</font>

536
00:36:42,090 --> 00:36:47,880
are out you have to say<font color="#E5E5E5"> another butt in</font>

537
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:50,810
case with Krebs yeah he was a free

538
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:53,820
customer hakama so cost a lot of money

539
00:36:50,810 --> 00:36:56,820
to handle this attack that's why they

540
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:58,560
talkin off but if you purchase<font color="#CCCCCC"> leaders</font>

541
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:59,940
protection for example unlimited leaders

542
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:03,620
protection so you get unlimited

543
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:07,680
installation and you say virtual systems

544
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:10,650
on-premise or cloud they can handle<font color="#CCCCCC"> such</font>

545
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:13,859
amount traffic for example up we can

546
00:37:10,650 --> 00:37:18,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">handle more than</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 200 feets</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> play off</font>

547
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:20,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">freeway traffic any moment to take that</font>

548
00:37:18,330 --> 00:37:23,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">sample is your question that's a check</font>

549
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:24,779
that we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> hand write most of the most</font>

550
00:37:23,430 --> 00:37:27,000
of the companies<font color="#E5E5E5"> can handle it that's</font>

551
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:30,960
why they need to purchase the hitters

552
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:33,300
perfection so question let's suppose

553
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:36,090
that curves will actually purchasing the

554
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:39,840
service but there's still the problem

555
00:37:36,090 --> 00:37:45,390
that the via the<font color="#CCCCCC"> US back is compromising</font>

556
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:46,860
the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> clients and from purely</font>

557
00:37:45,390 --> 00:37:48,600
economic perspectives they're actually

558
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:50,010
losing money or their actual problem

559
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:52,620
lies in the business I keep in that

560
00:37:50,010 --> 00:37:54,540
client that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not putting them in</font>

561
00:37:52,620 --> 00:38:01,140
proportion to the amount their music

562
00:37:54,540 --> 00:38:03,090
Horace's to up to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Pat points I they</font>

563
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:05,400
expect you to keep that service running

564
00:38:03,090 --> 00:38:07,290
and not just stop the<font color="#CCCCCC"> quiet even</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> though</font>

there's always more clients there's

00:39:23,830 --> 00:39:29,710
always more bandwidth thank you so let's

<font color="#E5E5E5">assume you actually reach the limit in</font>

599
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:47,230
there then the<font color="#E5E5E5"> biggest attacks okay so</font>

603
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:56,590
will see that that we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font>

604

bandwidth with the mobile is you find

more equipment we have very<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

around hardware and software so we all

the time look forward to<font color="#E5E5E5"> handle even</font>

609
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:15,700
basically nombre an average so with the

proliferation of these recent the master

611

00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:39,578
eventually surpass the ones available

00:40:35,079 --> 00:40:41,230
Wilson so let's<font color="#CCCCCC"> assume that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they have</font>

619
00:40:39,579 --> 00:40:44,380

00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:47,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">do some pipes to send this traffic</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Avery</font>

we use the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same eyes to receive this job</font>

so the bank is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a problem</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so if</font>

there is let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's say isolate it for</font>

advise people i don't have amount of

00:41:00,339 --> 00:41:06,279
traffic and<font color="#E5E5E5"> sam is some bad news we also</font>

627
00:41:03,490 --> 00:41:09,279
connect our system to this IC or stretch

628
00:41:06,279 --> 00:41:15,130
service to the top to what point will<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

629
00:41:09,279 --> 00:41:17,740
will an ASB for instance black black

00:41:23,650 --> 00:41:28,180
source software distributed the US

634
00:41:25,809 --> 00:41:30,970
attack and we're talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about a huge</font>

635
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:33,730
amount of bandwidth its considerable you

636
00:41:30,970 --> 00:41:37,868
have to have a lot in server management

637
00:41:33,730 --> 00:41:41,259
/ have to stop at etc will there ever be

638
00:41:37,869 --> 00:41:45,309
a limit at which you actually black hole

639
00:41:41,259 --> 00:41:48,579
the desire is<font color="#CCCCCC"> key we don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like home and</font>

640
00:41:45,309 --> 00:41:51,549
it's not important I don't know it's a

641
00:41:48,579 --> 00:41:55,900
friends like this way the icy shell and

642
00:41:51,549 --> 00:42:01,690
exchange the traffic but you think about

643
00:41:55,900 --> 00:42:05,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">it if if Tucker na resources to send</font>

644
00:42:01,690 --> 00:42:09,160
this traffic<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay yeah even if it's</font>

645
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:12,250
amplification okay so dns server office

646
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:16,210
apply this request and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we now then is to</font>

647
00:42:12,250 --> 00:42:18,730
reply<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so on the other side we can</font>

648
00:42:16,210 --> 00:42:22,259
get all<font color="#CCCCCC"> this stuff you because you can</font>

649
00:42:18,730 --> 00:42:22,259
we can have same amount of<font color="#E5E5E5"> letters</font>

650
00:42:23,550 --> 00:42:34,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay I'm actually one of your customers</font>

651
00:42:27,490 --> 00:42:36,040
found so far happier happy my question

652
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:39,130
is more about what can we do when we are

653
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:40,930
not targeted but the underlying<font color="#CCCCCC"> issue</font>

654
00:42:39,130 --> 00:42:43,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">structure is which was the case with</font>

655
00:42:40,930 --> 00:42:47,560
integrity<font color="#E5E5E5"> and all the side effects will</font>

656
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:49,960
affect this do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have any advice to</font>

657
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:53,680
lose our skills test understand you are

imagine that like this<font color="#CCCCCC"> da pms initial</font>

662
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:07,810
attack yeah so you do not defend us

663
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:10,990
against that we it's just<font color="#CCCCCC"> a side effect</font>

as the ultimate tips or suggestions when

666
00:43:14,290 --> 00:43:19,270
we are not directly targeted which we

667
00:43:16,930 --> 00:43:21,600
pay<font color="#CCCCCC"> for those direct attacks but we</font>

668
00:43:19,270 --> 00:43:24,790
don't pay to be protected for those um

669
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:28,118
let's say side effects of<font color="#E5E5E5"> big attacks on</font>

00:44:13,510 --> 00:44:20,050
the big pipe serving my country or

686
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:22,089
something so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not actually your job</font>
