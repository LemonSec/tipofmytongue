1
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:12,240
got audio<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right well</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as we said</font>

2
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:14,149
we'll be<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about lessons learned</font>

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:17,609
from a bug bounty operator today a

4
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:21,300
little bit about me first i joined

5
00:00:17,609 --> 00:00:25,289
<font color="#CCCCCC">Mozilla about a year ago I hit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my one</font>

6
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:27,750
year anniversary about<font color="#CCCCCC"> one month ago so</font>

7
00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:29,730
a little over a year and I've been in

8
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:33,149
the IT and security space for about 15

9
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:34,620
years doing mostly offensive work but

10
00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:37,320
I've also done some defensive work as

11
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:40,110
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> appends has sort of been a</font>

12
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:43,890
specialty of mine and it's been an

13
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:45,390
exciting time for that at Mozilla I'm

14
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:47,489
the product owner for security

15
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:50,730
assessment so I spent a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of my time</font>

16
00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:53,399
doing risk<font color="#CCCCCC"> assessment vulnerability</font>

17
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:56,089
assessment throughout modeling exercises

18
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:59,100
and most importantly penetration testing

19
00:00:56,090 --> 00:01:00,899
so those keep me pretty busy but when

20
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:04,040
I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing those things I'm working</font>

21
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:07,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">on the Mozilla bug bounty program</font>

22
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:09,960
working with security researchers day in

23
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:11,520
day out file fielding bugs that are

24
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:13,740
coming in for our products<font color="#E5E5E5"> and services</font>

25
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,840
working with development teams try and

26
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:19,610
fix those vulnerabilities and getting

27
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,610
researchers paid for their contributions

28
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:25,340
yeah I think that's about it for that

29
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:27,390
piece what I want to talk about today

30
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:29,460
there's really two main things that I

31
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:31,979
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hit home two things I'd like to</font>

32
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:34,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">leave you with one is if you're going to</font>

33
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:36,119
be operating a bug bounty program what

34
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:37,798
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> some good techniques that you can do</font>

35
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:41,009
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> really make your program work well</font>

36
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:43,649
and then also if you're considering as

37
00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:46,590
like a security<font color="#E5E5E5"> researcher wanting to</font>

38
00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:48,780
participate<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a program as a bounty</font>

39
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:50,250
hunter here are some strategies for you

40
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:51,750
to do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> better at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> least what am</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

41
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:54,750
seeing from bounty hunters that are

42
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:56,880
really successful in<font color="#E5E5E5"> our program there's</font>

43
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:58,320
a couple background bits of information

44
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,908
that i'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> be sharing with you before we</font>

45
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:04,320
get to that<font color="#CCCCCC"> point but that's what i'd</font>

46
00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:07,770
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to leave you today so fundamentally</font>

47
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:10,470
what is a bug bounty program what is the

48
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:12,870
bug bounty when<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think about this topic</font>

49
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:14,190
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about how I want to explain this</font>

50
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:16,390
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> my parents</font>

51
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:19,450
they don't understand anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I do</font>

52
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:20,799
when it comes to security so I have to

53
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:22,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">think about how I'm going to relate</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

54
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,099
them and how am I going to bridge the

55
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:26,650
gap to help them understand<font color="#CCCCCC"> what this</font>

56
00:02:24,099 --> 00:02:28,750
thing is can I<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a quick raising hands</font>

57
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:30,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">for those of you that know what a bug</font>

58
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:35,739
bounty is or participated in a bug

59
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:37,510
bounty okay how about half well the way

60
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:39,069
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about it is they just go to the</font>

61
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:43,510
root of the word you know what is a

62
00:02:39,069 --> 00:02:45,819
bounty in this case I think about it is

63
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:48,880
when you were a child you have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> pat a</font>

64
00:02:45,819 --> 00:02:51,760
dog cat whatever and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> pat runs away</font>

65
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:53,140
or you get that pet is lost you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

66
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:56,828
<font color="#CCCCCC">about one of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the things that you would</font>

67
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:59,529
do when you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to retrieve that animal</font>

68
00:02:56,829 --> 00:03:01,840
you would go to the community to ask

69
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:03,549
them for help right because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you only</font>

70
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:06,370
have yourself you can only be in so many

71
00:03:03,549 --> 00:03:09,370
places but<font color="#CCCCCC"> your dog or pet might be you</font>

72
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:13,900
know miles away so what you do is you

73
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:16,540
write<font color="#CCCCCC"> up this reward and you say my pets</font>

74
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:17,680
loss I need help<font color="#CCCCCC"> here here's what the</font>

75
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:19,209
pet looks like here are the details

76
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:22,150
about the fact is how you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> in touch</font>

77
00:03:19,209 --> 00:03:25,420
with me here's how you let me know<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

78
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:26,650
help me retrieve that animal well when I

79
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:29,380
think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> in terms of bug bounty</font>

80
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:31,359
programs in this case the puppy in this

81
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:33,160
case is security vulnerability we're

82
00:03:31,359 --> 00:03:35,260
asking other people to help<font color="#E5E5E5"> us find</font>

83
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:37,150
something or engage in the community to

84
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:39,910
get help finding something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we</font>

85
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:41,950
couldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> find on our own and the way</font>

86
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:44,889
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> organizations do that is by</font>

87
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:47,230
describing public intent to pay security

88
00:03:44,889 --> 00:03:49,389
researchers running security bugs in

89
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:51,518
their platforms it's not an engagement

90
00:03:49,389 --> 00:03:54,430
it's not a consulting engagement where

91
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:57,310
have a very clear task this is an open

92
00:03:54,430 --> 00:04:00,370
challenge to the world to say please

93
00:03:57,310 --> 00:04:02,470
come<font color="#E5E5E5"> back on our stuff we'll pay you for</font>

94
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:04,359
security vulnerabilities that you find

95
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:07,060
that are impactful for our products<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

96
00:04:04,359 --> 00:04:09,880
services and the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we do that at</font>

97
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:13,299
Mozilla much like other organizations

98
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:16,089
instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of providing that piece of paper</font>

99
00:04:13,299 --> 00:04:20,380
that we would nail to like a telephone

100
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:22,000
pole or plaster all around town we put

101
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:23,000
out a public website the basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> says</font>

102
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,100
here

103
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,360
the here is our intent here are the

104
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:28,370
guidelines for how someone would

105
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:29,810
participate in our program and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

106
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:36,950
reason why we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do am I getting</font>

107
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:38,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">feedback</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so one of the reasons why</font>

108
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:41,390
we describe the program<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the way that</font>

109
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:44,239
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> do is that if we relate back to the</font>

110
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:46,099
puppy scenario with your lost pet we

111
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,750
don't exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what these bugs look</font>

112
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:50,140
like we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't exactly know what the bugs</font>

113
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:53,270
are if we knew we'd fix them ourselves

114
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:55,820
so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> reason the goal for the bounty</font>

115
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:57,950
program is to ensure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we provided</font>

116
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:59,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">enough guidance to get people involved</font>

117
00:04:57,950 --> 00:05:01,820
to know that they are actually finding

118
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:03,350
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we care about and also give</font>

119
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:04,790
them some sort of sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they're</font>

120
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:06,890
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to get paid the end of it</font>

121
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:11,180
is actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be some reward for</font>

122
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:12,680
participating in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the program so i want</font>

123
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:14,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">to touch a little bit on history when we</font>

124
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:17,720
grab some<font color="#E5E5E5"> water first because i'm being</font>

125
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:22,000
dry so a little bit about bug bounty

126
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:24,440
history if we think back to 1995 and

127
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,600
netscape was one of the first bug bounty

128
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:29,350
programs out there providing bug

129
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:32,600
bounties for bugs found in netscape and

130
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:35,450
when<font color="#CCCCCC"> that organization ceased to exist</font>

131
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:38,740
and was purchased by AOL the browser

132
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:41,390
source code was open sourced and

133
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:44,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">translated into mozilla organization</font>

134
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:48,440
eventually became<font color="#CCCCCC"> Firefox but at that</font>

135
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:52,180
time<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mozilla was basically one of the</font>

136
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:54,890
early bounty programs at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> time and</font>

137
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:57,560
Mozilla sorta sees itself as one of the

138
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:59,750
early pioneers about bug bounty programs

139
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:01,280
that's at that time there really weren't

140
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:03,740
a lot of other bug bounty programs out

141
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:05,599
there and what we've seen is over the

142
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:07,250
years we're getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> more and more people</font>

143
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,290
participating in bug<font color="#E5E5E5"> bounty programs</font>

144
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:11,210
more organizations creating their own

145
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:12,830
bug bounty programs to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get help on</font>

146
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:14,870
security issues that they couldn't solve

147
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:16,700
on their own we even<font color="#CCCCCC"> have it</font>

148
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:19,360
organizations out there like bugcrowd

149
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:21,760
the organization actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> created this</font>

150
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:24,380
diagram I<font color="#E5E5E5"> slit from their website in</font>

151
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:29,590
hacker one that are more or less like

152
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:32,210
facilitation engines my phone is ringing

153
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:34,489
there are facilitation engines for

154
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:36,710
helping organizations that don't have

155
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:37,400
the resources of the set up to create

156
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:39,620
their own bug

157
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:41,929
program on their own so these

158
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:43,880
organizations specifically bugcrowd and

159
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:45,500
hacker one and<font color="#E5E5E5"> those alike are really</font>

160
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:47,780
helping make bug bounty programs

161
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:50,120
extremely main straight so a lot of

162
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:51,830
organizations are running their own bug

163
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:54,320
bounty programs working<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the</font>

164
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:56,389
community helping reefs are getting help

165
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:59,780
getting help from research researchers

166
00:06:56,389 --> 00:07:04,669
that they get paid for finding

167
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:11,690
vulnerabilities in their products<font color="#E5E5E5"> I turn</font>

168
00:07:04,669 --> 00:07:17,750
this off<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I just go no audio you okay</font>

169
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:22,960
well it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> irritating</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I step on</font>

170
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:22,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">you guys to all right</font>

171
00:07:25,289 --> 00:07:32,500
this one all right well I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

172
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:35,799
continue on I just was hoping<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe</font>

173
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:37,389
we could solve that so why<font color="#E5E5E5"> would an</font>

174
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:39,550
organization run a bug bounty program

175
00:07:37,389 --> 00:07:41,650
why is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it becoming much more popular for</font>

176
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:43,150
people to<font color="#CCCCCC"> start participating and</font>

177
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:46,929
creating their own body programs to get

178
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:48,969
researchers engaged for me it's it's

179
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:50,620
pretty simple but some organizations

180
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:52,509
might say well I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want to run a</font>

181
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:53,729
body program because I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to put</font>

182
00:07:52,509 --> 00:07:55,960
myself out there I<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to put my</font>

183
00:07:53,729 --> 00:07:58,539
software and in the meat in the

184
00:07:55,960 --> 00:08:00,489
limelight and have it the risk of

185
00:07:58,539 --> 00:08:02,860
finding vulnerabilities in being an

186
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:05,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">embarrassment so I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think a lot of</font>

187
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:07,960
organizations think that way but there

188
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,819
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> reasons why organizations are</font>

189
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:11,680
successfully getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> bounty programs and</font>

190
00:08:09,819 --> 00:08:14,889
using them within their within their

191
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:18,069
security program so the first thing at

192
00:08:14,889 --> 00:08:19,840
least<font color="#E5E5E5"> for me at Mozilla one of the one</font>

193
00:08:18,069 --> 00:08:22,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the most important things to us are</font>

194
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:24,880
securing our users so when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

195
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:26,319
about the<font color="#CCCCCC"> value of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a bug bounty program</font>

196
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:29,860
I think about how is it going to protect

197
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:32,709
my users and eliminate security risks

198
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:36,039
within my product in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular</font>

199
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:38,078
case we find<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it really does</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> help</font>

200
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:40,630
reduce some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the zero-day risks that</font>

201
00:08:38,078 --> 00:08:42,309
we have within products so we if a

202
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:43,899
security researcher is going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> find a</font>

203
00:08:42,309 --> 00:08:45,310
bug in our product and they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna</font>

204
00:08:43,899 --> 00:08:46,660
they're most likely going to find bugs

205
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:47,890
and products like software

206
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:50,140
vulnerabilities we're going to a gurney

207
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:52,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">exists at least we're providing them an</font>

208
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:55,180
avenue to work with<font color="#CCCCCC"> us and get rewarded</font>

209
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:58,060
and paid through an approved approved

210
00:08:55,180 --> 00:09:00,189
channel and if we do that we provide

211
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:01,599
that Avenue we really do reduce our risk

212
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:05,440
of someone going out there<font color="#CCCCCC"> and just</font>

213
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:08,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">going for publicity stunts on a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> blog the</font>

214
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:11,079
next one is<font color="#E5E5E5"> community Mozilla is really</font>

215
00:09:08,709 --> 00:09:12,579
keen on creating communities and getting

216
00:09:11,079 --> 00:09:15,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">people engaged in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our products and</font>

217
00:09:12,579 --> 00:09:18,579
services so as part of the bug bounty

218
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:21,070
program we get to tap this huge pool of

219
00:09:18,579 --> 00:09:22,390
resources of security researchers that

220
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:23,770
are interested in<font color="#E5E5E5"> our products and</font>

221
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:27,399
willing to<font color="#E5E5E5"> help us find vulnerabilities</font>

222
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:28,990
in those products<font color="#CCCCCC"> and in a way everyone</font>

223
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:31,060
sort of brings their own piece to the

224
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:34,720
puzzle like everyone has their own

225
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:36,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">experiences and background and having</font>

226
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,670
all this put together<font color="#E5E5E5"> it really does</font>

227
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:39,470
help<font color="#E5E5E5"> us find security vulnerable</font>

228
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:40,729
using<font color="#E5E5E5"> our products and resolve them</font>

229
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:44,080
quicker than we would<font color="#CCCCCC"> have been able to</font>

230
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:46,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">do if we didn't have a bounty program</font>

231
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:49,610
the other aspect of this is confidence

232
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:51,650
it's twofold it's the confidence that

233
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:53,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">you have in your product and showing</font>

234
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:55,040
that you feel you've done as much as you

235
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:57,319
possibly can with the resources that you

236
00:09:55,040 --> 00:10:00,319
have to fix find and fix vulnerabilities

237
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:02,840
in the product but there's more<font color="#CCCCCC"> to that</font>

238
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:05,060
it's also like a maturity thing in the

239
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:07,280
sense that you feel comfortable enough

240
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:09,290
to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to put yourself out there and</font>

241
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:11,810
say as an organization that you're

242
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:14,150
mature enough and willing to compensate

243
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:15,680
security researchers to help you find

244
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:17,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">and fix bugs and you're open to that</font>

245
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:20,439
discussion and you're willing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

246
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:23,690
participate<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can tell you that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as a</font>

247
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:25,460
person at Mozilla that evaluates

248
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:27,950
products and services<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we would use</font>

249
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:31,310
within our organization the other aspect

250
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:35,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">to this is confidence in other people's</font>

251
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:35,949
products that I'm purchasing and using

252
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:43,910
is there any way to kill the sound<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

253
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:46,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">right okay I can see you guys all</font>

254
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:51,709
wincing in the end the head back right

255
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:52,880
background so we'll keep going so why

256
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:54,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">would you want to participate in the</font>

257
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:57,200
bounty<font color="#E5E5E5"> program so this is the other side</font>

258
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:58,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">of it we have we have a program we've</font>

259
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,290
decided there's a reason to do a bounty

260
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:02,360
program<font color="#E5E5E5"> but what about the people that</font>

261
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:04,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to participate in our program why</font>

262
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:06,800
do they participate in our program one

263
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:08,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the motives for them and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one of them</font>

264
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:11,540
I don't know if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> would all guess this</font>

265
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:14,060
but for me this<font color="#E5E5E5"> really hits home for me</font>

266
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:16,040
as like a as a hat as a self-defined

267
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:17,479
hacker a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> participate in</font>

268
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:19,880
our program just because they're curious

269
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:22,160
they want to look in those dark spaces

270
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:23,990
they want to take something put it on

271
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:26,150
the bench take it apart take all the

272
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:28,730
screws out of it lay it on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the table and</font>

273
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:30,199
understand how it<font color="#CCCCCC"> works so we get a lot</font>

274
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:31,790
of people<font color="#CCCCCC"> that participate in our bug</font>

275
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:34,670
bounty program they submit security

276
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:36,620
vulnerabilities to us but those<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

277
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:38,540
aren't seeking bounties so a lot of

278
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:39,860
cases they're surprised when they

279
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:41,959
receive a bounty you know that they're

280
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:43,340
being engaged<font color="#E5E5E5"> to provide payment for</font>

281
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:46,730
something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they didn't think they</font>

282
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:49,700
were otherwise gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> get paid for so</font>

283
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:51,379
that's one big one the next one I think

284
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:54,499
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to be pretty obvious</font>

285
00:11:51,379 --> 00:11:57,549
is money a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people start making a</font>

286
00:11:54,499 --> 00:11:59,809
lot of money<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing bug bounty programs</font>

287
00:11:57,549 --> 00:12:02,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">bookbinding programs started off as like</font>

288
00:11:59,809 --> 00:12:04,039
single dollar amounts small dollar

289
00:12:02,149 --> 00:12:07,129
amounts hundred dollars thousand dollars

290
00:12:04,039 --> 00:12:09,559
and nowadays you can pull easily not

291
00:12:07,129 --> 00:12:12,079
easily<font color="#E5E5E5"> but you can pull bounty numbers</font>

292
00:12:09,559 --> 00:12:14,598
as the high is hundreds of thousands of

293
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:18,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">dollars so people are making full time</font>

294
00:12:14,599 --> 00:12:20,989
living making submitting bugs to these

295
00:12:18,049 --> 00:12:23,179
bounty programs and it's become a big

296
00:12:20,989 --> 00:12:24,589
business and I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> over at least in</font>

297
00:12:23,179 --> 00:12:26,209
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> last couple years we've seen</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot</font>

298
00:12:24,589 --> 00:12:29,509
more people coming and working with us

299
00:12:26,209 --> 00:12:32,089
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are full time values the other</font>

300
00:12:29,509 --> 00:12:34,970
aspect of that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> Fame a lot of</font>

301
00:12:32,089 --> 00:12:37,519
organizations provide Hall of Fame pages

302
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:38,869
to indicate those researchers that

303
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:40,249
they've worked with that<font color="#CCCCCC"> have really</font>

304
00:12:38,869 --> 00:12:43,609
helped them and done a lot for the

00:12:40,249 --> 00:12:45,909
program<font color="#E5E5E5"> and researcher</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the gamma</font>

306
00:12:43,609 --> 00:12:48,919
fication of that like making it a game

307
00:12:45,909 --> 00:12:51,019
to try and be<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the top like to be the</font>

308
00:12:48,919 --> 00:12:53,119
best security researchers really

309
00:12:51,019 --> 00:12:54,739
identify with that and they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

310
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:58,159
on the top they want to be the top ten

311
00:12:54,739 --> 00:13:01,369
on that particular program and that also

312
00:12:58,159 --> 00:13:03,639
translates to career development if you

313
00:13:01,369 --> 00:13:07,100
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> the top on that particular program</font>

314
00:13:03,639 --> 00:13:10,249
you can you you have something on your

315
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:12,679
resume on your<font color="#CCCCCC"> CV that really</font>

316
00:13:10,249 --> 00:13:16,519
differentiates you from other people in

00:13:12,679 --> 00:13:18,379
the market and as far<font color="#CCCCCC"> as it also to</font>

318
00:13:16,519 --> 00:13:20,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">career development we have a number of</font>

00:13:18,379 --> 00:13:22,249
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> that work in our program that are</font>

320
00:13:20,179 --> 00:13:24,999
college students so they're people<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

321
00:13:22,249 --> 00:13:28,909
are just starting to<font color="#E5E5E5"> enter the market</font>

00:13:24,999 --> 00:13:31,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">and they don't have these skills yet so</font>

323
00:13:28,909 --> 00:13:33,889
they they have their classroom

324
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:35,600
activities but in addition<font color="#E5E5E5"> to that they</font>

325
00:13:33,889 --> 00:13:37,399
using<font color="#CCCCCC"> the bug bounty program to really</font>

326
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:40,879
cut their teeth and start to learn<font color="#CCCCCC"> how</font>

327
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:42,529
to operate on a on a scale that major

328
00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:45,859
organizations want to compensate them

329
00:13:42,529 --> 00:13:47,689
for so in some ways we use the program

330
00:13:45,859 --> 00:13:49,729
<font color="#CCCCCC">to identify top talent that we want to</font>

331
00:13:47,689 --> 00:13:51,969
<font color="#CCCCCC">bring onto our team</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and want to bring in</font>

332
00:13:49,729 --> 00:13:55,770
to bring bring in house and<font color="#CCCCCC"> full-time</font>

333
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:58,840
full-time make them part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of our team</font>

334
00:13:55,770 --> 00:14:01,900
so that's just a kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the beginning</font>

335
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:03,460
stage here to get us<font color="#CCCCCC"> started some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

336
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:05,350
reasons why someone would run a bounty

337
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:08,290
program why bug bounty programs are

338
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:14,560
important this is my indicate to segue

339
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:17,050
to the next section into how do we run<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

340
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:18,579
good bounty program and I feel like

341
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:21,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's something that we do well at</font>

342
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:24,700
Mozilla so I feel like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I feel pretty</font>

343
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:26,790
good that we've got a lot of those

344
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:29,410
aspects within our program today and

345
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:30,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's always times where we're really</font>

346
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:31,990
trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> improve on the program we're</font>

347
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:33,700
trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at it from a bunch of</font>

348
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:35,590
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> angles to make sure that we're</font>

349
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:37,450
being competitive part of this is

350
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:39,280
getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> mindshare from security</font>

351
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:40,900
researchers if we can be an interesting

352
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:42,850
program to them we provide enough

353
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:44,590
interesting targets for them we've got

354
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:47,980
their time and interest to come play on

355
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:50,080
the program so one of the big<font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font>

356
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:53,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">that I think is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really important about</font>

357
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:54,640
having a good bounty program is working

358
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:56,560
with a bounty committee or hot

359
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:59,650
establishing a committee within that

360
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:01,719
your team<font color="#CCCCCC"> that would help govern that</font>

361
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:03,310
program and we do that at Mozilla we

362
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:05,710
have a group<font color="#E5E5E5"> of about five or six people</font>

363
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:08,680
that meet every week and we discuss all

364
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:10,900
the existing open bounties what the risk

365
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:12,729
levels are and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> the risk levels are</font>

366
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:15,010
high enough whether that<font color="#E5E5E5"> person is going</font>

367
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:17,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">to receive a bounty so these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people are</font>

368
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:18,640
like your mind shares so if you want you

369
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:19,870
want highly technical people and you

370
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:21,760
also want people that are going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

371
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:23,020
part of the organization<font color="#E5E5E5"> so they</font>

372
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:25,930
understand the products and<font color="#E5E5E5"> services</font>

373
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:27,699
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you're offering and they understand</font>

374
00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:29,410
the impact if one of those products<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

375
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:31,300
services have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> critical vulnerability</font>

376
00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:33,490
that would impact the its abilities to

377
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:36,699
deliver to a customer so that's one

378
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:40,330
aspect of it the other aspect of that is

379
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:42,340
doing bounty triage it's really

380
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:44,500
important to<font color="#E5E5E5"> one have a bounty program</font>

381
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:46,740
but it's really detrimental if you don't

382
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:50,530
respond<font color="#CCCCCC"> to researchers in a timely way</font>

383
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:52,150
so in this regard the important aspect

384
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:54,699
here is to get to that researcher as

385
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:56,980
soon as possible so<font color="#CCCCCC"> they submit to us we</font>

386
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:59,680
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to maintain an SLA to work with</font>

387
00:15:56,980 --> 00:16:01,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">that researcher within 24 hours so</font>

388
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:03,010
they're not submitting a bug to us it

389
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:04,720
goes into<font color="#E5E5E5"> a black hole and then they</font>

390
00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:07,689
hear from us from six<font color="#E5E5E5"> months and say hey</font>

391
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:08,649
here's a bounty doesn't work<font color="#E5E5E5"> that way in</font>

392
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:11,199
our bounty

393
00:16:08,649 --> 00:16:12,910
the way we operate it<font color="#E5E5E5"> were responding</font>

394
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:14,378
<font color="#E5E5E5">people within one business day in some</font>

395
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:17,559
case for responding them within minutes

396
00:16:14,379 --> 00:16:18,970
of submitting that generally depends on

397
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:21,999
availability of the person<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's doing</font>

398
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:24,369
the triage but the important thing as do

399
00:16:21,999 --> 00:16:25,749
in doing triage is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> necessarily for</font>

400
00:16:24,369 --> 00:16:27,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">you to fix the vulnerability and get</font>

401
00:16:25,749 --> 00:16:30,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">that person paid immediately immediately</font>

402
00:16:27,459 --> 00:16:32,199
the issue is for us to assess the<font color="#E5E5E5"> impact</font>

403
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:34,149
of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular vulnerability to the</font>

404
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:35,439
organization because if the impact is

405
00:16:34,149 --> 00:16:37,329
really high it means that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to</font>

406
00:16:35,439 --> 00:16:39,279
rally the troops we need to get people

407
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:41,498
involved and we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be part of that</font>

408
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:43,360
discussion immediately and start getting

409
00:16:41,499 --> 00:16:45,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">all the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people in there to fix the vixa</font>

410
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:47,980
vulnerability and get that<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing sorted</font>

411
00:16:45,369 --> 00:16:49,629
out you'll see<font color="#CCCCCC"> on some of the slides</font>

412
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:51,519
here as we go through that I've

413
00:16:49,629 --> 00:16:52,869
including examples one of the things

414
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:55,179
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we do at Mozilla</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is that were</font>

415
00:16:52,869 --> 00:16:57,939
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> open organization so whenever we</font>

416
00:16:55,179 --> 00:16:59,860
have a process<font color="#E5E5E5"> or a technique or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a thing</font>

417
00:16:57,939 --> 00:17:01,868
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we do you try to share that openly</font>

418
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:04,120
with community so that you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at</font>

419
00:17:01,869 --> 00:17:06,279
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can critique it you can help us</font>

420
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:08,369
improve it or you could<font color="#CCCCCC"> use it for</font>

421
00:17:06,279 --> 00:17:11,109
yourself if you're operating your own

422
00:17:08,369 --> 00:17:12,609
bug bounty program here are some tips

423
00:17:11,109 --> 00:17:15,609
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> things and how we do it we do a</font>

424
00:17:12,609 --> 00:17:17,770
daily rotation so there's a single

425
00:17:15,609 --> 00:17:20,319
person like myself that might be on any

426
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:22,209
given day when a vulnerability comes in

427
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:24,428
I'd retreat eyes that vulnerability and

428
00:17:22,209 --> 00:17:25,929
work it to its completion and then the

429
00:17:24,429 --> 00:17:28,120
next<font color="#E5E5E5"> day we switch off to another person</font>

430
00:17:25,929 --> 00:17:30,270
and the reason why we do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is because</font>

431
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:32,590
bugs can come in at<font color="#CCCCCC"> any time of the day</font>

432
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:34,870
so we don't want it we want some that

433
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:36,760
tree<font color="#CCCCCC"> has person to be fresh ready to go</font>

434
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:39,070
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that when that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> vulnerability comes in</font>

435
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:42,940
they're ready to<font color="#E5E5E5"> rock and start working</font>

436
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:45,309
the issue the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing that's really</font>

437
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:47,649
really helpful and having a bug bounty

438
00:17:45,309 --> 00:17:50,710
program is establishing a severity level

439
00:17:47,649 --> 00:17:52,600
or severity levels a ranking scale if

440
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:55,840
you will for how you're going to assess

441
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:58,959
vulnerabilities it can be as simple<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

442
00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:01,149
this just high medium low you can have

443
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,830
interim levels you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can even have it</font>

444
00:18:01,149 --> 00:18:04,629
matched your existing wrist process

445
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:05,770
within your organization if you talk to

446
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:07,840
someone your organization the risk

447
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:10,750
organization they might already have an

448
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:12,760
established set of criteria it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

449
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:15,159
important to standardize those and in

450
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:17,470
the sense that when it comes to the

451
00:18:15,159 --> 00:18:19,270
bounty committee assessing given

452
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:21,299
vulnerability for its impact the

453
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:23,009
organization housing or house

454
00:18:21,299 --> 00:18:25,830
that person going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to eventually get paid</font>

455
00:18:23,009 --> 00:18:27,269
we're doing it in a pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> stable way so</font>

456
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:30,330
like remote code execution this

457
00:18:27,269 --> 00:18:31,950
particular piece of<font color="#E5E5E5"> code equals this it</font>

458
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:33,090
makes those conversations with the

459
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:35,700
bounty committee when they're assessing

460
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:37,918
whether or not a boner ability is going

461
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:39,269
to be paid it makes that process move a

462
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:43,080
little bit smoother so it adds grease

463
00:18:39,269 --> 00:18:44,669
the wheels if you will i also have an

464
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:46,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">example of our severity ratings here</font>

your own<font color="#E5E5E5"> see what we're using I think</font>

467
00:18:49,739 --> 00:18:53,609
it's not so much an important that you

468
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:55,408
use our scale because even this slide

469
00:18:53,609 --> 00:18:56,939
right here is not our own it's just<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

470
00:18:55,409 --> 00:19:00,570
you establish<font color="#CCCCCC"> the scale so that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font>

471
00:18:56,940 --> 00:19:02,580
set a bar for payment and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> set our</font>

472

money another thing that's important

479
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:21,239
about running a bounty program is an

480
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:22,850
operator is that you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to acknowledge</font>

481

the people<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are participate</font>

00:19:24,659 --> 00:19:28,889
someone submits a bug you want to always

00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:30,480
thank them regardless<font color="#CCCCCC"> of whether</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or not</font>

485
00:19:28,889 --> 00:19:32,399

00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:34,470
whether<font color="#CCCCCC"> that bugs a duplicate or whether</font>

487
00:19:32,399 --> 00:19:35,609
it's not even a bug at all it's

488
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:37,409
important to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure that we're</font>

489
00:19:35,609 --> 00:19:39,029
validating the folks that are coming in

490
00:19:37,409 --> 00:19:41,999
and participating in the program so they

491
00:19:39,029 --> 00:19:44,879
even if they struck out that they can

492
00:19:41,999 --> 00:19:46,289
come<font color="#E5E5E5"> back and they save some dignity</font>

493
00:19:44,879 --> 00:19:47,939
they're not feeling<font color="#E5E5E5"> embarrassed that</font>

494
00:19:46,289 --> 00:19:49,679
they submit something that didn't matter

495
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:52,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">to us if it wasn't really important to</font>

00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:54,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">us because we do value their</font>

497
00:19:52,139 --> 00:19:55,949
contribution and it's important that you

498
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:57,119
do that because those are the<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:58,710
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are going to come</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> back and</font>

participate in the program<font color="#E5E5E5"> and probably</font>

501
00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:06,239
find the most interesting bugs<font color="#CCCCCC"> and a</font>

502
00:20:01,739 --> 00:20:08,190
case<font color="#CCCCCC"> where a bug is awarded a bounty I'm</font>

503
00:20:06,239 --> 00:20:10,769
a firm believer that it needs to be paid

504
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:13,289
out as soon as possible and when we do

505
00:20:10,769 --> 00:20:15,179
that we really we start a feedback

506
00:20:13,289 --> 00:20:16,379
engine with that that individual and

507
00:20:15,179 --> 00:20:18,179
they get an indication<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we're</font>

508
00:20:16,379 --> 00:20:20,879
serious about security vulnerabilities

509
00:20:18,179 --> 00:20:23,700
in our products and what ends up

510
00:20:20,879 --> 00:20:25,980
happening is when we do this and we we

511
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:28,379
execute on this quickly we end up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

512
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:30,059
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a flurry of that that person if</font>

513
00:20:28,379 --> 00:20:32,269
they're new to the program they tend to

514
00:20:30,059 --> 00:20:34,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">really work with this a lot so it's like</font>

515
00:20:32,269 --> 00:20:34,950
someone's first time in the program they

516
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:37,110
say

517
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:38,820
meta bug to us we immediately pay them

518
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:40,709
and then it's like six or seven more

519
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:42,750
bugs right after that so you can really

520
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:45,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">really dry participation by getting a</font>

521
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:46,680
successful result<font color="#CCCCCC"> under the table that</font>

522
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:51,629
person knows you you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> running a</font>

523
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:54,020
serious program so<font color="#CCCCCC"> patience so this is</font>

524
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:56,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not-so-great part</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of a program</font>

525
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:58,080
sometimes when you're operating a

526
00:20:56,310 --> 00:21:00,330
program you get these great bugs and

527
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:02,600
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> perfectly documented and you</font>

528
00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:07,199
have exact<font color="#CCCCCC"> POCs and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> everything's perfect</font>

529
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:09,209
this is not that case so there's take

530
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:11,280
cases when we get offensive language we

531
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:17,010
get misunderstandings about the

532
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:21,330
circumstances of<font color="#CCCCCC"> a given bug and i'll</font>

533
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:24,690
gather speaker going on<font color="#CCCCCC"> scroll again we</font>

534
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:26,699
get ransom videos of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to</font>

535
00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:28,530
explain the bug<font color="#CCCCCC"> to us and it takes you</font>

536
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:31,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">to like the 29th minute before you</font>

537
00:21:28,530 --> 00:21:33,870
actually see the bug that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> always</font>

538
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:36,950
exciting we have demands for payment and

539
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:39,659
<font color="#CCCCCC">just straight up like disrespect and</font>

540
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:43,020
I'll get into one or two more examples

541
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:45,060
of that later as we go I think it's

542
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:46,590
important as your if you're operating in

543
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:48,990
a bug bounty program that you keep your

544
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:50,520
patients are<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I'm sorry that you</font>

545
00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:52,470
keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> your cool and you keep it</font>

546
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:54,210
professional there's people have thrown

547
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:57,450
all kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of terrible things my way and</font>

548
00:21:54,210 --> 00:22:00,030
operating the bounty program in some of

549
00:21:57,450 --> 00:22:02,460
the bad submissions and it's important

550
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:04,590
for us<font color="#E5E5E5"> to just sort of keep cool work</font>

551
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:06,540
through<font color="#E5E5E5"> it try to stay professional</font>

552
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:08,610
because there's times where<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've taken</font>

553
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:10,260
someone that was like a really<font color="#E5E5E5"> bad</font>

554
00:22:08,610 --> 00:22:12,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">submitter like someone that's just</font>

555
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:14,820
driven us nuts and in the bounty<font color="#E5E5E5"> program</font>

556
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:16,800
it's like 50 bugs in one day they're all

557
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:19,590
low risk and they<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't matter to us</font>

558
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:21,270
particularly and we've been able to

559
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:23,159
convert those people just by being nice

560
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:24,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">and staying patient with them and</font>

561
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:26,580
working for the process and educating

562
00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:27,290
them about the things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we're looking</font>

563
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:29,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">for</font>

564
00:22:27,290 --> 00:22:33,950
so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a really critical</font>

565
00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:37,340
aspect for operating<font color="#CCCCCC"> county transparency</font>

566
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:39,380
and openness I think as Mozilla this

567
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:40,970
comes really<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for us because we</font>

568
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:44,890
operate in the open on a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

569
00:22:40,970 --> 00:22:48,680
stuff that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we work on I think the</font>

570
00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:50,870
important part here is to have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> process</font>

571
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:53,000
where you can communicate<font color="#E5E5E5"> what the</font>

572
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:55,159
program is and how it works but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

573
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,230
it's also important<font color="#CCCCCC"> to involve security</font>

574
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:59,960
researchers as part of the workflow<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

575
00:22:57,230 --> 00:23:01,580
solving the problem so what we do at

576
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:04,280
Mozilla is we use this system couple of

577
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:07,040
zila it's just a ticketing system when a

578
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:09,800
bug comes in we obviously have to keep

579
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:11,750
it private until we fix that

580
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:13,250
vulnerability but while we're working

581
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:15,830
through<font color="#E5E5E5"> that vulnerability the</font>

582
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:18,350
researchers<font color="#E5E5E5"> engaged with us we have the</font>

583
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:20,389
developer engaged we have myself or one

584
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:21,889
of the other triage people involved so

585
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:23,330
we're all working together trying to

586
00:23:21,890 --> 00:23:26,420
solve the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem in the same</font>

587
00:23:23,330 --> 00:23:28,399
workspace so there's no additional

588
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:29,630
communication there's no I tell this guy

589
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:31,940
and then I got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go work with this guy</font>

590
00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:33,920
it all happens in the same bug the

591
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:36,020
security reach<font color="#CCCCCC"> a researcher sees that</font>

592
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:38,060
we're actively working on it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it</font>

593
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:39,920
really helps in a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> ways to prevent</font>

594
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:41,750
that sort of case where someone saying

595
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:44,630
where<font color="#CCCCCC"> is this bug like where is it in</font>

596
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:46,460
your process are you<font color="#CCCCCC"> working on this is</font>

597
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:47,750
this important to you in a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ways</font>

598
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:50,060
it just says right up from the get-go

599
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:51,800
that that it is important to us we are

600
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:56,240
actively working through the issue and

601
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:59,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're part of the solution and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we all</font>

602
00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:00,770
we also do is we take<font color="#E5E5E5"> that full</font>

603
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,300
conversation like everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font>

604
00:24:00,770 --> 00:24:04,340
communicated about when we're done with

605
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:06,740
the bug and it's fixed<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll open</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> source</font>

606
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:08,449
that buck so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can see the full</font>

607
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:10,460
discussion you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> see what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

608
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:12,380
development side you can see what<font color="#CCCCCC"> I said</font>

609
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:14,810
you can see with the security research

610
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:17,480
you said and for me that that really

611
00:24:14,810 --> 00:24:19,520
really helps show other security

612
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:21,650
researchers how we work and it also

613
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:23,900
gives<font color="#E5E5E5"> them indications as to where we</font>

614
00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:25,760
might have other problems in other parts

615
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:27,770
of our software that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they can go and</font>

616
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:29,270
attack and get bounties for so in a way

617
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:30,590
it's like little<font color="#CCCCCC"> breadcrumbs we're</font>

618
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:33,260
sprinkling around about where our

619
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:36,169
problems are which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> which is bad right</font>

620
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:36,980
we have problems<font color="#E5E5E5"> but the other aspects</font>

621
00:24:36,170 --> 00:24:38,570
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is the</font>

622
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:40,610
it gives other people good indications

623
00:24:38,570 --> 00:24:42,559
as to if we didn't solve the problem

624
00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:44,870
completely here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> another place where</font>

625
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:46,790
you can look<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we have in cases where</font>

626
00:24:44,870 --> 00:24:49,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">we thought we thought we had solved an</font>

627
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:51,320
issue security researchers saw a public

628
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:53,299
a bug that had been recently publicized

629
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:55,970
and said what about over here what about

630
00:24:53,299 --> 00:24:58,720
this application and it really keeps us

631
00:24:55,970 --> 00:25:01,490
honest in a way I feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> like that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

632
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:08,030
really helpful part of running<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

00:25:01,490 --> 00:25:10,100
program this if there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is anything that I</font>

634
00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:13,790
say today<font color="#E5E5E5"> about running good operate</font>

635
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:16,189
operating a good bug bounty program this

636
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:18,440
to me<font color="#E5E5E5"> is one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> most important thing</font>

637
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:20,480
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not the public aspects of it</font>

638
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:22,970
it's about<font color="#E5E5E5"> taking the feedback that you</font>

639
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:24,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">get from security researchers looking at</font>

640
00:25:22,970 --> 00:25:27,230
them at a higher level and trying to

641
00:25:24,770 --> 00:25:29,809
identify<font color="#CCCCCC"> friends</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of bugs and why your</font>

642
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:32,540
wire faced<font color="#CCCCCC"> with these certain bugs and</font>

643
00:25:29,809 --> 00:25:34,610
trying to develop guidelines and

00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:36,918
procedures to really start to catch

645
00:25:34,610 --> 00:25:39,620
those bugs and knock out entire class<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

646
00:25:36,919 --> 00:25:40,880
vulnerabilities and we've done<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I've</font>

647
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:43,520
got a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> links here I don't think</font>

648
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:46,910
it's showing up very well but we've

649
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:49,490
developed TLS guidelines for<font color="#E5E5E5"> SSL we've</font>

650
00:25:46,910 --> 00:25:53,210
got developed<font color="#E5E5E5"> guidelines open for</font>

651
00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:55,460
openssh as well as our web count our web

652
00:25:53,210 --> 00:25:57,950
security guidelines so those<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

653
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:59,480
really helped us take entire

654
00:25:57,950 --> 00:26:02,710
vulnerabilities or classes

655
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:02,710
vulnerabilities off the map

656
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:24,240
sorry guys<font color="#CCCCCC"> uh it stopped when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you open</font>

657
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:25,770
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> door thank you yeah so developing</font>

658
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:27,720
these programs are developing these

659
00:26:25,770 --> 00:26:30,000
guidelines really helped us make our

660
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:31,560
program better and<font color="#E5E5E5"> anytime you're</font>

661
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,810
operating in program if you're not

662
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:36,179
looking at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the issues that are coming in</font>

663
00:26:33,810 --> 00:26:37,919
<font color="#CCCCCC">and trying to identify trends and common</font>

664
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:39,540
issues that come back to you over and

665
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:41,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">over and over again and trying to fix</font>

666
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:45,110
them at a higher level you're missing

667
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:48,180
value in the program like you're leaving

668
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:50,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're missing stuff that would be</font>

669
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:52,920
really really important to to advance

670
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:55,860
the program and what we see with our

671
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:57,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">program is that by doing this we're not</font>

672
00:26:55,860 --> 00:27:01,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">dealing with the same bugs year over</font>

673
00:26:57,930 --> 00:27:03,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">year we tend</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to have like a wave where</font>

674
00:27:01,290 --> 00:27:04,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if cross-site scripting was</font>

675
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:06,690
important earlier this year we've

676
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:09,300
addressed it with CSP and specific

677
00:27:06,690 --> 00:27:11,220
technologies we're basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> that bug</font>

678
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:13,139
classes<font color="#CCCCCC"> guns so now we're off on to some</font>

679
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:15,510
other tangent I'll talk a little bit

680
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:16,920
about that in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the later slides as far as</font>

681
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:19,230
like how to do a good bounty hunter

682
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:21,630
bounty hunter on how you can sort of

683
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:24,900
chase along with us and make<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

684
00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:27,480
effective for yourself I guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a</font>

685
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:28,620
good segue into that aspect of it let's

686
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:31,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk a little bit about what we're</font>

687
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:33,600
seeing with good bounty hunters what are

688
00:27:31,290 --> 00:27:35,190
they doing what what are they doing

689
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:37,290
that's so different that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

690
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:40,230
differentiates a good bounty hunter from

691
00:27:37,290 --> 00:27:41,639
a bad bounty hunter and I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

692
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:43,200
say that there's any bad bounty hunters

693
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:44,910
but there's certainly levels of

694
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,230
experience and quality that we

695
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:49,070
experience in the program<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

696
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:51,360
highlight the ones that we really enjoy

697
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:53,370
the first one I think is pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> obvious</font>

698
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:55,229
if you're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> submit a bug to a bug</font>

699
00:27:53,370 --> 00:27:56,850
bounty program you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a POC</font>

700
00:27:55,230 --> 00:28:01,890
you need to have a proof of concept that

701
00:27:56,850 --> 00:28:04,110
demonstrates the bug I we get<font color="#E5E5E5"> these i</font>

702
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:07,020
would say on most<font color="#E5E5E5"> submissions</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font>

703
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:09,719
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is pretty obvious what we don't see</font>

704
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:11,970
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> some submissions is safe reproduction</font>

705
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:14,100
steps which i think is really important

706
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:16,620
for for when you're submitting those

707
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:19,740
bugs to the bounty program you know if

708
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:22,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">your if your pocs throws a shell to your</font>

709
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:23,610
remote machine it doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really bode a</font>

710
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:24,540
lot of like goodwill

711
00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:27,449
the people<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are operating the</font>

712
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:30,928
program like okay you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to throw</font>

713
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:33,350
shell on my machine great so these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

714
00:28:30,929 --> 00:28:37,309
the sort of things that are interesting

715
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:40,469
I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think people consider them as</font>

716
00:28:37,309 --> 00:28:41,940
issues but for me it's important that

717
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:43,620
we're providing a safe way<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

718
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:45,600
communicating so in a lot of ways if

719
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:48,030
you're giving me some proprietary format

720
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:49,559
as additional steps that I need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do so</font>

721
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:52,139
if you can give me something as tax and

722
00:28:49,559 --> 00:28:54,030
make it<font color="#E5E5E5"> clear and you can demonstrate</font>

723
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:56,580
the bug with and just<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a picture</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

724
00:28:54,030 --> 00:29:00,270
show it<font color="#CCCCCC"> to me usually it helps sort of</font>

725
00:28:56,580 --> 00:29:02,760
move things along quickly what up what<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

726
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:04,500
think is also important here is that you

727
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:06,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">also want to describe why it's an issue</font>

728
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:09,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of times when we're doing</font>

729
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:11,610
technical security exploit<font color="#CCCCCC"> words we</font>

730
00:29:09,390 --> 00:29:12,990
think about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the class of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

731
00:29:11,610 --> 00:29:15,540
vulnerability and why that class is

732
00:29:12,990 --> 00:29:17,160
important but it's really important to

733
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:19,320
understand the<font color="#E5E5E5"> potential impact of that</font>

734
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:21,299
vulnerability to the organization if you

735
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:23,760
can connect as a bounty hunter with an

736
00:29:21,299 --> 00:29:25,770
organization's impact and in back to

737
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:27,540
their bottom<font color="#E5E5E5"> line you are going to get</font>

738
00:29:25,770 --> 00:29:30,030
better bounty out of that out of that

739
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:32,129
program<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can draw that connection for</font>

740
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:34,500
them that they wouldn't otherwise been

741
00:29:32,130 --> 00:29:39,150
able to draw on their own you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

742
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:40,200
do a lot of crazy things the yeah and it

743
00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:41,880
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> does help with an impact</font>

744
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:43,650
assessment if that organizations doing

745
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:45,150
like full-blown risk management they

746
00:29:43,650 --> 00:29:46,980
plug it into their risk process and they

747
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:49,440
see that<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is like the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> highest risk</font>

748
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:52,830
on the radar

749
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:52,830
the other thing

750
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:05,070
you

751
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:24,830
back to the bounty program and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then also</font>

752
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:27,250
write a blog post and put it on<font color="#E5E5E5"> Twitter</font>

753
00:30:24,830 --> 00:30:29,539
the same day so these are sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like</font>

754
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:30,649
expectation building things that you

755
00:30:29,539 --> 00:30:33,080
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> program and</font>

756
00:30:30,649 --> 00:30:35,479
understand like what's acceptable for

757
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:37,220
the program<font color="#CCCCCC"> vuze when you open source</font>

758
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:39,080
open source that buggy in submit to the

759
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:41,390
bug bounty and maybe same exact<font color="#CCCCCC"> day</font>

760
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:45,889
before the issues<font color="#E5E5E5"> triage basically zero</font>

761
00:30:41,390 --> 00:30:48,139
dings so it doesn't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> help us I</font>

762
00:30:45,889 --> 00:30:49,459
mean it helps us let me know but we're a

763
00:30:48,139 --> 00:30:50,809
little bit i'm eight ball at that time

764
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:55,070
so it's really helpful to sort of be up

765
00:30:50,809 --> 00:30:58,070
front ah the other thing pay attention

766
00:30:55,070 --> 00:31:01,250
to eligible sites get a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> sniff</font>

767
00:30:58,070 --> 00:31:03,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">folks to us in like custom code</font>

768
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:04,909
application that's listed on like

769
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:07,850
someone's personal blog and their

770
00:31:04,909 --> 00:31:09,889
wordpress blog or whatever and it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

771
00:31:07,850 --> 00:31:12,408
part of our program so you love<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

772
00:31:09,889 --> 00:31:15,250
exhaust a lot of effort a lot of time

773
00:31:12,409 --> 00:31:17,929
without reading instructions and the

774
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:20,029
pine bugs but they find bugs and things

775
00:31:17,929 --> 00:31:22,639
that were not<font color="#E5E5E5"> once pay on that are part</font>

776
00:31:20,029 --> 00:31:24,049
of our program so if there's one thing

777
00:31:22,639 --> 00:31:25,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you think about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what far as</font>

778
00:31:24,049 --> 00:31:27,860
instructions make sure that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at</font>

779
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:30,199
eligible eligible sites or eligible

780
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:31,549
properties and in most organizations and

781
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:36,260
most program programs going to make that

782
00:31:31,549 --> 00:31:38,330
clear the other thing to consider is the

783
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:40,639
book classes that organizations care

784
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:43,189
about there's some bug bounty programs

785
00:31:40,639 --> 00:31:45,740
don't care about like entire classes of

786
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:47,059
certain vulnerabilities and we have we

787
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:48,860
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> pieces where we've seen where</font>

788
00:31:47,059 --> 00:31:50,720
people will like exhaust as much ever

789
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:53,449
they possibly can on a very specific

790
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:56,450
type of exploit and like yeah that's

791
00:31:53,450 --> 00:31:58,850
definitely yeah it's a wiki you can

792
00:31:56,450 --> 00:32:02,480
improv it so those are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the sort of</font>

793
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:05,000
things that we see out we do have a fact

794
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:06,649
for our web bounty for when people are

795
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,539
trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> learn this things like the</font>

796
00:32:06,649 --> 00:32:10,399
image<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I linked to you in the</font>

797
00:32:08,539 --> 00:32:12,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">earlier slides there's a link to it</font>

798
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:13,699
later if you want to check<font color="#CCCCCC"> it out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

799
00:32:12,169 --> 00:32:18,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">see what guidelines we have with our</font>

800
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:21,080
program<font color="#E5E5E5"> uh this is an underrated one as</font>

801
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:22,639
well a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of times we get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people to</font>

802
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:26,629
participate in the bug bounty programs

803
00:32:22,639 --> 00:32:28,370
and they feel like they

804
00:32:26,630 --> 00:32:31,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">should ask questions or just simply</font>

805
00:32:28,370 --> 00:32:33,830
don't this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a really good way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to get</font>

806
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:38,899
good information about what's important

807
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:41,270
to us and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think the big part here is</font>

808
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:43,820
context if you can understand that<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

809
00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:46,550
rce<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> particular application is</font>

810
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:48,500
extremely important<font color="#CCCCCC"> to us and our CES</font>

811
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:50,690
other application means nothing to us

812
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:52,040
because it's completely isolated<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

813
00:32:50,690 --> 00:32:53,630
completely segmented from our

814
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:55,040
infrastructure that's important

815
00:32:53,630 --> 00:32:56,630
information to<font color="#CCCCCC"> know and it might help</font>

816
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:58,909
you as a bounty hunter target some of

817
00:32:56,630 --> 00:33:00,650
the work and some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the sites that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

818
00:32:58,910 --> 00:33:03,890
really sweat<font color="#E5E5E5"> your pie</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mom's time is</font>

819
00:33:00,650 --> 00:33:05,690
precious<font color="#CCCCCC"> so you can find ways to save</font>

820
00:33:03,890 --> 00:33:08,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">time and really target your efforts</font>

821
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:15,470
keeping you can get more success powder

822
00:33:08,450 --> 00:33:17,900
ah see Oh in addition to this one of the

823
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:20,510
things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we find a lot a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of good</font>

824
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:22,190
bounty hunters work with us on is that

825
00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:23,629
they find a vulnerability or they're

826
00:33:22,190 --> 00:33:26,420
looking at a public bug that we've

827
00:33:23,630 --> 00:33:29,240
already disclosed and publicly disclosed

828
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:31,820
in figs and they find other classes<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

829
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:34,220
bugs in the same place so in case<font color="#CCCCCC"> were</font>

830
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:37,129
like there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a input validation mug and</font>

831
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:39,650
we didn't do a good job of actually

832
00:33:37,130 --> 00:33:41,240
solving that issue we solved for the

833
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:44,210
problems that that was that was

834
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:45,890
presented<font color="#CCCCCC"> in bug a and good bounty good</font>

835
00:33:44,210 --> 00:33:48,200
bounty hunters me look at that<font color="#E5E5E5"> bug and</font>

836
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:50,120
said I wonder<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they did this or I</font>

837
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:52,720
wonder if<font color="#E5E5E5"> they look at this this aspect</font>

838
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:55,969
of it so if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think about of it like</font>

839
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:58,550
incomplete hatches really interesting

840
00:33:55,970 --> 00:34:00,710
space we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of money on us that</font>

841
00:33:58,550 --> 00:34:02,930
do very very well just by looking at

842
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:07,490
bugs that we fixed and maybe not

843
00:34:02,930 --> 00:34:11,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">completely fixed ah so fine s be very</font>

844
00:34:07,490 --> 00:34:14,770
interesting category ahhh so scared both

845
00:34:11,449 --> 00:34:16,609
classes this one's a fun one for me

846
00:34:14,770 --> 00:34:19,940
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it makes my job more</font>

847
00:34:16,610 --> 00:34:21,590
entertaining uh you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know I've seen</font>

848
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:22,940
dozens and dozens and dozens of

849
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:25,580
cross-site scripting vulnerabilities

850
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:28,510
they're great and will pay for I'm

851
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:31,009
totally then I'm not interesting to me

852
00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:33,560
but they're interesting the organization

853
00:34:31,010 --> 00:34:37,310
they're interesting to search properties

854
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:38,909
than they have in this particular space

855
00:34:37,310 --> 00:34:40,230
we find where

856
00:34:38,909 --> 00:34:42,359
but bounty hunters can be like

857
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:45,149
specialists in a very specific type of

858
00:34:42,359 --> 00:34:47,549
vulnerability and especially in cases

859
00:34:45,149 --> 00:34:49,679
where that vulnerability is just not

860
00:34:47,549 --> 00:34:52,379
really well understood it's now well

861
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:56,700
document it's not a bug class that other

862
00:34:52,379 --> 00:34:58,740
people are looking for and we see bug

863
00:34:56,699 --> 00:35:01,049
hunters develop entire tool sets around

864
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:02,788
these obscure vulnerabilities there's

865
00:35:01,049 --> 00:35:05,730
like a really<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard for organizations to</font>

866
00:35:02,789 --> 00:35:08,220
really get the<font color="#E5E5E5"> hands off hands on and</font>

867
00:35:05,730 --> 00:35:11,069
because of that they do very very well

868
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:13,649
on the bug bounty program and one

869
00:35:11,069 --> 00:35:16,380
example<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I'll actually do a little</font>

870
00:35:13,650 --> 00:35:18,319
bit more in a bit what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> Hospital</font>

871
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:21,210
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> may take over vulnerabilities</font>

872
00:35:18,319 --> 00:35:23,069
sounds really<font color="#E5E5E5"> bad I've region have you</font>

873
00:35:21,210 --> 00:35:25,799
heard of hostile subdomain takeover

00:35:23,069 --> 00:35:28,619
vulnerabilities<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so like for it this</font>

875
00:35:25,799 --> 00:35:32,160
is good so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually a really</font>

876
00:35:28,619 --> 00:35:35,460
simple own ability basically what it

877
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:38,399
means is you you've taken DNS for a

878
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:41,520
given web property you've pointed it at

879
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:43,890
a shared hosting provider but you

880
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:45,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">haven't claimed the V hosts on the</font>

881
00:35:43,890 --> 00:35:48,359
shared hosting provider meaning<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

882
00:35:45,990 --> 00:35:50,700
anyone<font color="#CCCCCC"> that wants to show up on that</font>

883
00:35:48,359 --> 00:35:52,558
vemos provider can claim that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the main</font>

884
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:55,200
arbitrarily<font color="#E5E5E5"> and just take over all the</font>

885
00:35:52,559 --> 00:35:58,559
content<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that particular domain so</font>

886
00:35:55,200 --> 00:36:01,740
the impacts really bad especially<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font>

887
00:35:58,559 --> 00:36:04,319
that pioneer provides SSL as well so not

single to me that's one to me this<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind</font>

978
00:39:47,550 --> 00:39:53,520
of found did he of them if<font color="#E5E5E5"> he amazed</font>

979
00:39:50,550 --> 00:39:55,650
that we had<font color="#CCCCCC"> dns pointing to be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> health</font>

980
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:57,509
provider we're in the process of setting

981
00:39:55,650 --> 00:40:01,530
something up<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we had it completed</font>

982
00:39:57,510 --> 00:40:03,960
the sad yeah and this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> basically</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

983
00:40:01,530 --> 00:40:05,790
the bug its public bugs you can go<font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font>

984
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:08,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">punch that mug in and see the full</font>

985
00:40:05,790 --> 00:40:10,140
details of how that dog is free out how

986
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:12,420
we worked with them how we were able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

987
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:15,299
solve it and you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what the end</font>

988
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:18,150
result was even the domains that were

989
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:21,930
affected in this case what was happening

990
00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:23,460
is we were building an app framework it

991
00:40:21,930 --> 00:40:26,669
was going to be based on github<font color="#CCCCCC"> dada i</font>

992
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:29,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">oh you're not familiar get hugged iOS</font>

993
00:40:26,670 --> 00:40:30,930
basically github pages so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea was</font>

994
00:40:29,250 --> 00:40:33,150
is that you would host the application

995
00:40:30,930 --> 00:40:35,819
on yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then we would be able to</font>

996
00:40:33,150 --> 00:40:38,000
deliver that education to<font color="#CCCCCC"> Firefox OS</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

997
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:40,680
you know everything just sort of for it

998
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:42,690
well that was an idea or something<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

999
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:45,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">prototyping and b7 the DNS names in</font>

1000
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:48,630
advance to sort of get things going what

1001
00:40:45,630 --> 00:40:51,000
Brandis realize is that our different

1002
00:40:48,630 --> 00:40:53,610
found was that we missed a very

1003
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:56,970
important step of setting up that which

1004
00:40:53,610 --> 00:40:59,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">is the establishment of the cname in an</font>

1005
00:40:56,970 --> 00:41:03,629
ISA github though this is how you claim

1006
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:07,050
of ye hose so get up<font color="#E5E5E5"> Diana they have a</font>

1007
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:09,190
single server our own money servers but

1008
00:41:07,050 --> 00:41:12,010
like a single bit

1009
00:41:09,190 --> 00:41:14,349
stood up and then when it comes<font color="#CCCCCC"> in it</font>

1010
00:41:12,010 --> 00:41:16,569
looks at all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the repositories it looks</font>

1011
00:41:14,349 --> 00:41:18,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">to see who playing I give it to me and</font>

1012
00:41:16,569 --> 00:41:21,490
that's how<font color="#E5E5E5"> they would serve content so</font>

1013
00:41:18,910 --> 00:41:24,460
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have this file what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ends up</font>

1014
00:41:21,490 --> 00:41:26,589
happening is our boundaries that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are in</font>

1015
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:29,200
this case was able to go in and clean

1016
00:41:26,589 --> 00:41:31,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">all those domains and stand up scenes</font>

1017
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:34,149
and make his own projects under that

1018
00:41:31,210 --> 00:41:36,730
name so what happens is<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that when you</font>

1019
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:39,640
resolve one of these domains above any

1020
00:41:36,730 --> 00:41:41,800
of the domain to be shared with<font color="#E5E5E5"> us he</font>

1021
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:45,240
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> fully control that content and all</font>

1022
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:48,819
he has to be is a github user um so

1023
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:51,879
again but<font color="#CCCCCC"> families are interesting in</font>

1024
00:41:48,819 --> 00:41:52,900
the sense that you handle traditional

1025
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:55,390
vulnerabilities cross-site scripting

1026
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:57,640
sequel injection all the sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of basic</font>

1027
00:41:55,390 --> 00:41:59,348
stuff but when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into tight</font>

1028
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:01,000
obscure vulnerabilities it's really

1029
00:41:59,349 --> 00:42:03,220
interesting space because organizations

1030
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:05,050
just aren't prepared<font color="#E5E5E5"> for it they don't</font>

1031
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:06,490
know all the nooks and crannies of all

1032
00:42:05,050 --> 00:42:08,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">these different obscure vulnerabilities</font>

1033
00:42:06,490 --> 00:42:11,169
there's generally not a lot of tooling

1034
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:12,910
around it in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> case of something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we take</font>

1035
00:42:11,170 --> 00:42:15,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">over there's really poor tooling around</font>

1036
00:42:12,910 --> 00:42:20,290
all this stuff meals providers generally

1037
00:42:15,369 --> 00:42:23,349
don't do any verification of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the media</font>

1038
00:42:20,290 --> 00:42:25,990
claiming so what was<font color="#E5E5E5"> really great about</font>

1039
00:42:23,349 --> 00:42:28,900
this is that this was the first bug and

1040
00:42:25,990 --> 00:42:30,009
up many that we work through to try and

1041
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:32,859
draw<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the addresses within</font>

1042
00:42:30,010 --> 00:42:36,069
organization I'm sure if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you do any sort</font>

1043
00:42:32,859 --> 00:42:37,480
of like any sort of virtual hosting or

1044
00:42:36,069 --> 00:42:39,160
shared hosting providers within your

1045
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:41,260
organization this might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be something to</font>

1046
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:42,910
take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a look in to see if you have old</font>

1047
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:45,670
dns records that are pointing to those

1048
00:42:42,910 --> 00:42:48,310
deals providers or if you have dns

1049
00:42:45,670 --> 00:42:49,930
that's pointing to wild<font color="#E5E5E5"> part sir that's</font>

1050
00:42:48,310 --> 00:42:51,730
a if you're interested in<font color="#E5E5E5"> that sort of</font>

1051
00:42:49,930 --> 00:42:54,879
stuff talk to me after i can tell you

1052
00:42:51,730 --> 00:42:58,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">also it supports covers about wild part</font>

1053
00:42:54,880 --> 00:43:00,069
search at any<font color="#CCCCCC"> rate what I feel the</font>

1054
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:02,050
reason why I<font color="#CCCCCC"> chose this example example</font>

1055
00:43:00,069 --> 00:43:04,029
is this is just one example of the

1056
00:43:02,050 --> 00:43:06,190
beginning<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a conversation that we have</font>

1057
00:43:04,030 --> 00:43:07,780
at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the security researcher and from</font>

1058
00:43:06,190 --> 00:43:09,339
there we found tons of tons<font color="#E5E5E5"> of more</font>

1059
00:43:07,780 --> 00:43:12,369
vulnerabilities after working<font color="#CCCCCC"> with in</font>

1060
00:43:09,339 --> 00:43:14,020
having a successful result so in my<font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font>

1061
00:43:12,369 --> 00:43:17,319
vision if you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at this bug you can</font>

1062
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:20,680
see this is an example of both<font color="#CCCCCC"> of us</font>

1063
00:43:17,319 --> 00:43:22,150
doing the right things and for me when

1064
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:24,490
we do the right things

1065
00:43:22,150 --> 00:43:27,180
when<font color="#CCCCCC"> vyas found the operators do</font>

1066
00:43:24,490 --> 00:43:30,009
absolutely as much as we can to try and

1067
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:31,149
remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> what the incentives are for the</font>

1068
00:43:30,010 --> 00:43:33,339
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are participating in the</font>

1069
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:35,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">program and if you as a bounty hunter</font>

1070
00:43:33,339 --> 00:43:37,690
can think about incentives of an

1071
00:43:35,619 --> 00:43:38,920
organization and why they operate the

1072
00:43:37,690 --> 00:43:40,270
dining program in the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> place</font>

1073
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:43,599
they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be a lot more</font>

1074
00:43:40,270 --> 00:43:46,599
successful and if we can take<font color="#CCCCCC"> it there's</font>

1075
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:49,059
a gap between developer conversations<font color="#CCCCCC"> /</font>

1076
00:43:46,599 --> 00:43:51,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">you researcher conversation if you can</font>

1077
00:43:49,059 --> 00:43:52,539
do anything to close that gap they're

1078
00:43:51,130 --> 00:43:54,369
going to be more successful about anyone

1079
00:43:52,539 --> 00:43:56,020
or<font color="#CCCCCC"> just plain and simple and those are</font>

1080
00:43:54,369 --> 00:43:58,210
those<font color="#E5E5E5"> people that we really want as part</font>

1081
00:43:56,020 --> 00:44:00,130
of our program and those people<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font>

1082
00:43:58,210 --> 00:44:02,829
do operate with on a daily basis

1083
00:44:00,130 --> 00:44:06,760
successfully to help secure a lot of our

1084
00:44:02,829 --> 00:44:08,859
application so for me it's just so for

1085
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:10,359
me that's a really important aspect of

1086
00:44:08,859 --> 00:44:12,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">it that was the goal of my presentation</font>

1087
00:44:10,359 --> 00:44:14,529
was the one that you win how to run<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

1088
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:16,029
hit up operation or how to operate a

1089
00:44:14,529 --> 00:44:18,309
good bounty program<font color="#CCCCCC"> or hopefully I'm</font>

1090
00:44:16,029 --> 00:44:20,440
giving you<font color="#CCCCCC"> some indicators of that also</font>

1091
00:44:18,309 --> 00:44:22,119
for those the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other security researchers</font>

1092
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:23,920
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be participants in about even</font>

1093
00:44:22,119 --> 00:44:26,410
trip hopefully<font color="#CCCCCC"> I gave you a couple tips</font>

1094
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:28,210
and tricks<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you can use if you want</font>

1095
00:44:26,410 --> 00:44:29,740
to start participating if you're

1096
00:44:28,210 --> 00:44:32,260
interested<font color="#CCCCCC"> in participating in Mozilla</font>

bounty program from dr. me after I'd

1098
00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:36,730
love to talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you about to find out</font>

1099
00:44:33,970 --> 00:44:38,939
which are interested in<font color="#CCCCCC"> and maybe we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

1100
00:44:36,730 --> 00:44:41,079
get a conversation going apt bootstrap

1101
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:43,740
that's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I happy you guys so</font>

1102
00:44:41,079 --> 00:44:51,480
yeah I think some time for questions so

1103
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:51,479
<font color="#CCCCCC">glad the speaker's calm down into a much</font>

00:44:52,500 --> 00:45:00,789
more from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> operation</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> side so that</font>

1105
00:44:57,490 --> 00:45:03,069
shot at the beginning control over

1106
00:45:00,789 --> 00:45:05,349
companies yeah it's obvious<font color="#CCCCCC"> that s</font>

1107
00:45:03,069 --> 00:45:08,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">concrete love the organization something</font>

1108
00:45:05,349 --> 00:45:10,119
even fortune 500 so for those of the

1109
00:45:08,140 --> 00:45:11,589
organization to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> really easy golden</font>

1110
00:45:10,119 --> 00:45:13,720
are they on the opposite<font color="#E5E5E5"> with for the</font>

1111
00:45:11,589 --> 00:45:16,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">researchers but of course so we can get</font>

1112
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:20,680
what from your<font color="#E5E5E5"> experience what's the</font>

1113
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:22,808
number of internal resources that you

1114
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:25,270
think you did not who said if I certain

1115
00:45:22,809 --> 00:45:27,490
amount call you coming in I think it

1116
00:45:25,270 --> 00:45:31,538
depends on what your volume is I can

1117
00:45:27,490 --> 00:45:34,569
tell you that<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mozilla we have about the</font>

1118
00:45:31,539 --> 00:45:37,330
web bug ready tired i<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like 42</font>

1119
00:45:34,570 --> 00:45:38,860
properties that we have ineligible which

1120
00:45:37,330 --> 00:45:40,630
is I think a lot greater than most

1121
00:45:38,860 --> 00:45:42,130
organizations out there a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1122
00:45:40,630 --> 00:45:44,470
organizations really really tightly

1124
00:45:44,470 --> 00:45:47,709
got to be in this application this curse

1125
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:50,169
of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> minute</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it can't be any of these</font>

1126
00:45:47,710 --> 00:45:52,150
classes own abilities we<font color="#E5E5E5"> operate a</font>

1127
00:45:50,170 --> 00:45:54,730
pretty wide open one so I feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

1128
00:45:52,150 --> 00:45:58,050
remarks those in the sense that we deal

1129
00:45:54,730 --> 00:46:00,640
with a good amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of input from people</font>

1130
00:45:58,050 --> 00:46:03,370
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mozelle</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are not big company where</font>

1131
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:07,509
1,000 people which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is still good size</font>

1132
00:46:03,370 --> 00:46:09,520
but we're not like a massive giant we

1133
00:46:07,510 --> 00:46:13,000
operate the<font color="#E5E5E5"> triage game with about five</font>

1134
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:15,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">people and the ricotta and I didn't</font>

1135
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:18,250
cause you too yeah with with a<font color="#CCCCCC"> one-day</font>

1136
00:46:15,610 --> 00:46:22,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> allies what's the ratio between two</font>

1138
00:46:22,420 --> 00:46:27,790
researcher very very much researcher

1139
00:46:24,850 --> 00:46:29,560
centric so like if<font color="#CCCCCC"> the researcher comes</font>

1140
00:46:27,790 --> 00:46:31,779
in they read the program and they like

1141
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:33,220
they do the steps though describing they

1142
00:46:31,780 --> 00:46:38,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">tend to be really successful right off</font>

1143
00:46:33,220 --> 00:46:41,799
um I think we do get a lot of submission

1144
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:43,900
they're like waste all my voice to you

1145
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:45,790
to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> rid of there's always lots of</font>

00:46:43,900 --> 00:46:47,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">knowledge if it's probably causality I</font>

1147
00:46:45,790 --> 00:46:49,830
feel like they pay a property of mike

00:46:47,260 --> 00:46:54,430
maybe but half the submission to come in

1149
00:46:49,830 --> 00:46:58,360
maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> more so I feel like we've got a</font>

1150
00:46:54,430 --> 00:47:00,819
good a good balance what happens with

1151
00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:03,400
researchers that like what I would

1152
00:47:00,820 --> 00:47:05,200
classify is not good researchers they

1153
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:07,990
don't take the last long because they're

1154
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:09,129
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> being successful it's just one of</font>

1155
00:47:07,990 --> 00:47:11,620
those things that they're only willing

1156
00:47:09,130 --> 00:47:13,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">to try to so long they go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on doing this</font>

1157
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:15,670
stuff and then every<font color="#E5E5E5"> now and again you</font>

1158
00:47:13,450 --> 00:47:17,140
get a couple researchers that are just

1159
00:47:15,670 --> 00:47:19,030
trying to cut their teeth<font color="#E5E5E5"> in things and</font>

1160
00:47:17,140 --> 00:47:21,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">we try to work with them but it's like</font>

1161
00:47:19,030 --> 00:47:23,230
if they're not successful they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font>

1162
00:47:21,070 --> 00:47:25,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">to peter out pretty quickly so it's like</font>

1163
00:47:23,230 --> 00:47:27,370
that's why<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really important</font>

1164
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:29,050
for for people that are interested in

1165
00:47:27,370 --> 00:47:31,839
value programs to get success early on

1166
00:47:29,050 --> 00:47:35,400
because it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to help feed the you</font>

1167
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:39,970
know feed that hunger to play a while

1168
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:42,940
any other questions actually is<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ok</font>

1169
00:47:39,970 --> 00:47:45,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">Vito ever you say it eighty percent of</font>

1170
00:47:42,940 --> 00:47:47,250
the price on the research parents would

1171
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:49,640
submit a 10 on the

1172
00:47:47,250 --> 00:47:51,780
well it's already spread more widely

1173
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:54,629
well there's some that are really

1174
00:47:51,780 --> 00:47:56,910
successful it's funny that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you say that</font>

1175
00:47:54,630 --> 00:47:58,770
because from a quantity perspective

1176
00:47:56,910 --> 00:48:00,210
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> really successful researchers</font>

1177
00:47:58,770 --> 00:48:02,460
tend to throw a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things in the</font>

1178
00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:04,890
wall<font color="#CCCCCC"> uh every most everything that are</font>

1179
00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:06,840
good researchers submit almost all of

1180
00:48:04,890 --> 00:48:08,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">its days because they've done their</font>

1181
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:10,400
homework it done they've looked at<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

1182
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:15,120
guidelines them understand what we want

1183
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:18,360
I don't make great interesting question

1184
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:22,170
or more I<font color="#E5E5E5"> machine is the same food</font>

1185
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:24,900
researchers that are submitting the

1186
00:48:22,170 --> 00:48:28,340
majority of your<font color="#CCCCCC"> book malin bottom I</font>

1187
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:31,110
wouldn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> say that that it's the majority</font>

1188
00:48:28,340 --> 00:48:34,980
they're probably maybe ten percent of

1189
00:48:31,110 --> 00:48:39,720
the overall like are<font color="#CCCCCC"> really like regular</font>

1190
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:41,520
people we probably have like<font color="#E5E5E5"> ten ten</font>

1191
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:43,500
people that are just like pretty solid

1192
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:45,630
that are mostly participating all the

1193
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:47,130
time and then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a wide range</font>

1194
00:48:45,630 --> 00:48:49,230
of other people just<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of popping in</font>

1195
00:48:47,130 --> 00:48:51,780
so oh hey you know there's new motor

1196
00:48:49,230 --> 00:48:56,160
billion in tonight's easier yeah here's

1197
00:48:51,780 --> 00:49:00,540
your something to chase down pizza any

1198
00:48:56,160 --> 00:49:03,690
other questions sir do I may evoke the

1199
00:49:00,540 --> 00:49:07,170
peak eight oh yeah we do do you have a

1200
00:49:03,690 --> 00:49:09,840
lot of duplicates mostly bugs that are

1201
00:49:07,170 --> 00:49:11,940
in the process so like it's surprisingly

1202
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:14,790
enough and it's priceless me to this day

1203
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:18,180
we do get like a what i would call

1204
00:49:14,790 --> 00:49:20,190
birthday attacks where someone you know

1205
00:49:18,180 --> 00:49:22,230
we go so long without anyone finding a

1206
00:49:20,190 --> 00:49:24,540
given to owner ability someone finds<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

1207
00:49:22,230 --> 00:49:26,250
on a monday and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then some someone else</font>

1208
00:49:24,540 --> 00:49:28,770
like completely unrelated submits that

1209
00:49:26,250 --> 00:49:31,830
bug on Tuesday it's like<font color="#E5E5E5"> how we went</font>

1210
00:49:28,770 --> 00:49:34,110
that long and like to write next<font color="#CCCCCC"> threes</font>

1211
00:49:31,830 --> 00:49:35,250
on there<font color="#E5E5E5"> it makes you wonder like these</font>

1212
00:49:34,110 --> 00:49:38,070
guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> working together they're like</font>

1213
00:49:35,250 --> 00:49:39,810
what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on but yeah so we use the</font>

1214
00:49:38,070 --> 00:49:41,310
ticketing system so in a case of

1215
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:46,259
bugzilla it's really simple for us to

1216
00:49:41,310 --> 00:49:48,270
like oh that's this bug resolve<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would</font>

1217
00:49:46,260 --> 00:49:50,940
like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more but I</font>

1218
00:49:48,270 --> 00:49:53,040
think we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have such a wide scope that we</font>

1219
00:49:50,940 --> 00:49:55,740
support that generally people<font color="#E5E5E5"> aren't</font>

1220
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:57,420
tripping on each other for duplicates<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

1221
00:49:55,740 --> 00:49:59,200
if the issue is an issue we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

1222
00:49:57,420 --> 00:50:01,630
work through to completion and

1223
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:06,520
the idea is that we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to see</font>

1224
00:50:01,630 --> 00:50:08,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">that but again and this is especially</font>

1225
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:10,930
the case when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you wipe entire blood</font>

1226
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:12,879
classes off the mat those are really

1227
00:50:10,930 --> 00:50:14,319
helpful so it's like<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know you deal</font>

1228
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:15,579
with it for so long<font color="#E5E5E5"> and like all right</font>

1229
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:20,470
we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find a real solution to this</font>

1230
00:50:15,579 --> 00:50:23,109
problem how much I'm relying<font color="#CCCCCC"> on your</font>

1231
00:50:20,470 --> 00:50:25,810
program for your own internal coverage

1232
00:50:23,109 --> 00:50:28,240
of the applications and how much do you

1233
00:50:25,810 --> 00:50:31,320
know we are internally need to make sure

1234
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:34,479
so I so he joins us all about a year ago

1235
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:36,520
to help kick-start their program<font color="#CCCCCC"> during</font>

1236
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:39,250
offensive testing so I'd say it's

1237
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:42,190
getting to be greater I think me two

1238
00:50:39,250 --> 00:50:43,960
years ago they were lying<font color="#E5E5E5"> on more I'd</font>

1239
00:50:42,190 --> 00:50:47,920
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to rely</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on it less and have it</font>

1240
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:50,260
supplements just as a fair warning do

1241
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:53,770
not use<font color="#CCCCCC"> my granny is the only thing that</font>

1242
00:50:50,260 --> 00:50:54,910
you're gonna do for<font color="#E5E5E5"> security ah yeah you</font>

1243
00:50:53,770 --> 00:50:57,190
definitely want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font>

1244
00:50:54,910 --> 00:50:58,810
finding a balance I think of the bug

1245
00:50:57,190 --> 00:51:01,420
bounty program more of like<font color="#CCCCCC"> the CP net</font>

1246
00:50:58,810 --> 00:51:02,980
so do as much as<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can with the</font>

1247
00:51:01,420 --> 00:51:04,450
resources that you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if you</font>

1248
00:51:02,980 --> 00:51:05,680
operate a bug bounty program you're

1249
00:51:04,450 --> 00:51:08,078
<font color="#CCCCCC">going to have a sense of whether or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

1250
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:09,520
you're keeping up with things if you

1251
00:51:08,079 --> 00:51:11,170
find yourself just like paying bounty

1252
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:12,520
after Bonnie you're just like throwing a

1253
00:51:11,170 --> 00:51:13,869
bunch of<font color="#E5E5E5"> money out the door I have the</font>

1254
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:16,180
same properties over and over again

1255
00:51:13,869 --> 00:51:18,310
maybe need to reassess the<font color="#CCCCCC"> strategy I</font>

1256
00:51:16,180 --> 00:51:26,259
want to percentage-wise you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can address</font>

1257
00:51:18,310 --> 00:51:28,720
all my mom i would say i would say we

1258
00:51:26,260 --> 00:51:37,300
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it like maybe like an extra</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> FPE</font>

1259
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:39,629
or blue<font color="#CCCCCC"> FTEs any other questions that's</font>

1260
00:51:37,300 --> 00:51:44,099
generally like we're with payouts<font color="#E5E5E5"> happen</font>

1261
00:51:39,630 --> 00:51:44,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">all right well let's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all of ya</font>

1262
00:51:44,170 --> 00:51:46,230
you
