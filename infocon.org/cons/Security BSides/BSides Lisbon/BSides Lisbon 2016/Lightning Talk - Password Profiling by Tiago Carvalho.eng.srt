1
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:16,079
so okay wait of whom I before<font color="#CCCCCC"> I worked</font>

2
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:19,009
at in in this as security I<font color="#E5E5E5"> worked for</font>

3
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:21,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">eight years as a Java developer after</font>

4
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:23,210
walking around with those crazy folks I

5
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:26,820
decided it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> his time to dedicate</font>

6
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:29,820
myself to something something<font color="#CCCCCC"> serious</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

7
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:32,790
built the first BMX tricks entered in a

8
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:35,040
weekend such a fun project as usually

9
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:37,469
someone calls me and says that has

10
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:41,719
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that he can't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do in I do or we</font>

11
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:44,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">should do it just because I can</font>

12
00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:46,590
objectives few times some time ago I

13
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:48,629
read something on a blog saying that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

14
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:50,579
asked for<font color="#CCCCCC"> time girls when you try to</font>

15
00:00:48,629 --> 00:00:53,280
crack passwords from other people you

16
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:57,360
get better edit it sounds weird so I

17
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:59,420
decided to test that for myself one of

18
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:02,550
the issues that i found one up when<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

19
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:05,220
started this was that blind brute force

20
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:08,280
takes a lot of time it usually<font color="#E5E5E5"> goes</font>

21
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:10,320
around trying use the huge word list

22
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:12,840
bringing that sign to work on

23
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:16,860
permutation of stuff and this consumes

24
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:19,619
time over time I also notice that this

25
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:23,580
besides efficiency you stop repeating

26
00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:26,340
yourself and<font color="#E5E5E5"> usually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> when you start</font>

27
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:30,570
thinking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this you want to go the</font>

28
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:32,880
other way around<font color="#E5E5E5"> so less words try not</font>

29
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:39,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">to repeat yourself remove the duplicates</font>

30
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:41,610
and as you go on<font color="#E5E5E5"> with this you start</font>

31
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:44,460
noticing that you need more information

32
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:47,220
about the hashes re or the person that

33
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:49,710
you're cracking it then the crash within

34
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:53,520
the hashes itself so when somebody says

35
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:55,679
that s you I've heard recently that you

36
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't need an expression they're gonna</font>

37
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">password because if it's a strong cost</font>

38
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:03,090
but nobody want nobody will find it

39
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:07,469
nobody chooses a strong password not

40
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:12,569
even we so that's why won't say the red

41
00:02:07,469 --> 00:02:13,150
word so<font color="#E5E5E5"> usually people choose passwords</font>

42
00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:15,159
or

43
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:17,709
on their personal information their

44
00:02:15,159 --> 00:02:19,720
interests their native language blogs

45
00:02:17,709 --> 00:02:24,730
visited websites all this can be

46
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:27,459
compiled into word<font color="#CCCCCC"> lists and your end if</font>

47
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:33,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">you use restrictions you will reduce</font>

48
00:02:27,459 --> 00:02:37,689
that word list even more so all this

49
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:39,518
source of<font color="#E5E5E5"> information and the source of</font>

50
00:02:37,689 --> 00:02:44,370
the words in the targets information

51
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:44,370
will compile itself into a word list i

52
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:50,829
repeated myself<font color="#E5E5E5"> are here so my use case</font>

53
00:02:48,609 --> 00:02:52,959
i have google around and I found a

54
00:02:50,829 --> 00:02:54,849
website that was kind enough to publish

55
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:57,120
all the user information including the

56
00:02:54,849 --> 00:03:03,909
ashes I won't say that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was a</font>

57
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:06,549
university and yeah it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> a fun to find</font>

58
00:03:03,909 --> 00:03:08,980
thing because they have 15<font color="#CCCCCC"> years 15 uses</font>

59
00:03:06,549 --> 00:03:13,120
in there the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ashes wall out there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

60
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:15,760
actually I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> they still are and the</font>

61
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:18,519
some of them were actually professors so

62
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:21,668
<font color="#E5E5E5">I decided to use this so my first step</font>

63
00:03:18,519 --> 00:03:24,519
was identified the algorithm create the

64
00:03:21,669 --> 00:03:28,739
users create<font color="#E5E5E5"> word list based on news and</font>

65
00:03:24,519 --> 00:03:32,590
information and here was my<font color="#CCCCCC"> hardware</font>

66
00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:35,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">this tools everyone knows and knows this</font>

67
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:37,750
one advantage of using the cpu although

68
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:40,569
by the end of this I've noticed that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

69
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:44,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">CPU</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is really something you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get as</font>

70
00:03:40,569 --> 00:03:48,099
it was so to efficiently use<font color="#CCCCCC"> the brute</font>

71
00:03:44,709 --> 00:03:50,859
force<font color="#E5E5E5"> he can build this I built this</font>

72
00:03:48,099 --> 00:03:54,970
square which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically lowercase and</font>

73
00:03:50,859 --> 00:03:57,069
uppercase<font color="#E5E5E5"> the digits and I've shuffled</font>

74
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:59,019
around with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this try to reduce the</font>

75
00:03:57,069 --> 00:04:01,448
number of permutations with stuff like

76
00:03:59,019 --> 00:04:03,370
this start with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> uppercase try the</font>

77
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:05,530
middle of your lower letters because

78
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:08,169
it's easier to remember and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Edwin end</font>

79
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:10,840
with numbers because we all know<font color="#CCCCCC"> how</font>

80
00:04:08,169 --> 00:04:13,930
people choose their last<font color="#E5E5E5"> date something</font>

81
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:17,829
like that the results were something

82
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:21,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">like this and you'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> notice that some of</font>

83
00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:23,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">these numbers are actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in Social</font>

84
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:24,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">Security numbers okay so what's keeping</font>

85
00:04:23,979 --> 00:04:29,340
fast

86
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:33,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">i have i have a two minute long board in</font>

87
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:36,388
my house so when time once things start

88
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:39,210
to get tough<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> usually do this this</font>

89
00:04:36,389 --> 00:04:41,099
small designs what<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm trying to do here</font>

90
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:43,318
<font color="#CCCCCC">is establish a pattern between the</font>

91
00:04:41,099 --> 00:04:46,740
number of layers in the password and

92
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:48,479
their components and time and the time

93
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:51,780
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to go over all the</font>

94
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:55,800
permutations some of the permutations i

95
00:04:51,780 --> 00:05:02,549
have here went from 10 to 10 seconds<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

96
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:04,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">2 hours or in seconds okay so okay</font>

97
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:07,409
what's not the proximate then this is

98
00:05:04,169 --> 00:05:12,530
last step when you go over all this and

99
00:05:07,409 --> 00:05:24,090
you start all over the brute<font color="#CCCCCC"> force yeah</font>

100
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:33,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">is not the person right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> magnify show the</font>

101
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:36,330
last 100 well the last one was actually

102
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:41,460
the last one was<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I managed to crack</font>

103
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:43,229
all the all the passwords in the the

104
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:45,210
total number of hours that<font color="#CCCCCC"> he's not</font>

105
00:05:43,229 --> 00:05:48,900
included crack all the 15 passwords were

106
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:52,969
still two hours basically and the last

107
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:52,969
one had 14 14 karat
