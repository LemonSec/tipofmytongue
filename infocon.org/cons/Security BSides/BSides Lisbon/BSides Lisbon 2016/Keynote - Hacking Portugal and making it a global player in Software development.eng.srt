myself today professionally in a very

17
00:00:52,629 --> 00:00:55,660
nice position because I have a big

18
00:00:54,039 --> 00:00:57,219
mandate and I work for different

19
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:58,660
companies but I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> not unemployed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

20
00:00:57,219 --> 00:01:01,300
those companies so i can say exactly

21
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:02,468
what I believe and that's exactly what

22
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:03,669
I'm saying<font color="#CCCCCC"> here this is a very team</font>

23
00:01:02,469 --> 00:01:06,130
presentation because I have no agenda

24
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:07,960
I'm literally presenting what I

25
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:09,880
generally believe is the best solution

26
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:11,830
for the problem and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you see because some</font>

27
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:13,960
of these ideas sound very radical but

28
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,370
given 2016 right and i'll leave in

29
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:17,740
london right so i do have personal

30
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:19,480
experience with 2016 I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think we</font>

31
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:21,670
could say that you know anything is not

32
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:23,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">possible and unprecedented change</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

33
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:25,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">something that it's really on the cards</font>

34
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:26,470
these days so let's<font color="#CCCCCC"> stop with this right</font>

35
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:28,570
so by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way there's actually there's a</font>

36
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:30,910
much bigger version of this online<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

37
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:32,740
creative commons everything is there you

38
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:33,970
can reach you there so on github you

39
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:35,619
know it's kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of all available so</font>

40
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:37,000
there's actually a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> more more</font>

41
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:39,880
crazy ideas there which<font color="#CCCCCC"> i didn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

42
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,980
time to put in so feel free<font color="#E5E5E5"> to join me</font>

43
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:44,949
so so<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's start with this right so</font>

44
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:46,630
what the view here is that I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

45
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:48,220
want to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> Portugal a global player in</font>

46
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:51,070
software development right that's

47
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:52,450
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> key we we want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a situation</font>

48
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:54,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">where as technology becomes more</font>

49
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:55,960
important to our society<font color="#E5E5E5"> we really want</font>

50
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:59,260
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure that we take it seriously</font>

51
00:01:55,960 --> 00:02:02,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">and that Portugal becomes a big player</font>

52
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:05,590
in in that world right and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've you</font>

53
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:08,288
application security as a very powerful

54
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:09,878
in a blur of that situation an

55
00:02:08,288 --> 00:02:11,679
application<font color="#E5E5E5"> you sits in a very very</font>

56
00:02:09,878 --> 00:02:13,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting way because application</font>

57
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,400
security tends to be there sometimes the

58
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:17,770
only ones that really ask how things

59
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:19,750
work what happens what

60
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:22,030
the attack surface what really<font color="#CCCCCC"> is going</font>

61
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:23,620
on the applications and everything is

62
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:25,240
related so when you start with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

63
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:27,070
application you go all the way either

64
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:29,590
way to the microchip right<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

65
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:30,730
everything is related to what's<font color="#CCCCCC"> going on</font>

66
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:32,380
on that<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular website and these</font>

67
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:34,329
days<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything is connected to the</font>

68
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:36,310
internet so in a way everything is

69
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:38,560
connected<font color="#CCCCCC"> to some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of to do with</font>

70
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:40,330
application security and code right so

71
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,370
I'm gonna provide a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of parts a lot</font>

72
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:43,540
of ideas a lot of stuff to actually make

73
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:46,150
this and you know to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

74
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:48,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">first-class citizen so the first and</font>

75
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:51,160
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably the key core idea that</font>

76
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:53,650
I try to come up with all sorts of ways

77
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:55,720
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> represent a good path and I found</font>

78
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:58,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one because i think it's it fits</font>

79
00:02:55,720 --> 00:03:02,140
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the political government you know</font>

80
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:04,180
companies educational things together so

81
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:07,239
<font color="#CCCCCC">i think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we need to make the portuguese</font>

82
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:08,920
network hostile to<font color="#CCCCCC"> e</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> secure code right</font>

83
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:11,470
so we're in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a situation where we are</font>

84
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:14,619
allergic to basically the situation

85
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:17,350
where somebody can just publish and put

86
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:19,840
a secure code into a network right and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

87
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:21,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">by my network I mean</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Portugal right and</font>

88
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,110
and you can actually do the same thing

89
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,700
for company so I company can decide to

90
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:26,260
do the same thing this presentation is

91
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:27,700
focus<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the country but you know</font>

92
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:29,109
Microsoft could decide to do the same

93
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:30,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing you know a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of companies do a</font>

94
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:32,980
bit of this but it's nice when<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a</font>

95
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:34,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">global agenda also because Portugal has</font>

96
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:36,579
sovereignty over our network right

97
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:38,080
although<font color="#CCCCCC"> with part of European Union</font>

98
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:40,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">know better stuff there's lines this</font>

99
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">borders that we can actually control and</font>

100
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:44,050
it's time<font color="#CCCCCC"> to bring the digital world</font>

101
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:46,720
into that so my view is that everything

102
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:48,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm saying here is fair game in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Portugal</font>

103
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:52,090
and this might not like it fine but<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

104
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:53,680
can define our own rules right and so

105
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:55,209
and this is to support by collaborative

106
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:58,030
columns of those comments comments

107
00:03:55,209 --> 00:03:59,200
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little slick and and and if</font>

108
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:00,520
you don't know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that term it's a really</font>

109
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,200
great concept<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll spend a little bit</font>

110
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:05,080
but it's a very<font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting way of</font>

111
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:07,959
working together in in a kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> way</font>

112
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:09,670
that makes a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of sense so you need</font>

113
00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:11,320
strong enforcement in a regulation you

114
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:12,700
market pressure to make this<font color="#E5E5E5"> work so the</font>

115
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:14,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">way you want to do is you want to attack</font>

116
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:16,269
vulnerable code so on this<font color="#CCCCCC"> situation</font>

117
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:17,680
where vulnerable apps and appliances as

118
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:19,479
soon as they plug to our network<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

119
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,280
should be hacked within minutes right

120
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:23,740
some of the best security teams in a

121
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:25,840
planet they hack internally you develop

122
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:27,700
application in a company<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if your app</font>

123
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,810
is not to a certain level<font color="#E5E5E5"> of security at</font>

124
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:30,580
some level resilience it will be

125
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:31,390
attacked not by the attackers<font color="#E5E5E5"> bye bye</font>

126
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:33,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">aunty</font>

127
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:36,430
and that's what you want right you want

128
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:38,289
a situation<font color="#E5E5E5"> where basically is hacked by</font>

129
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:40,150
the good guys oops sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> they hacked by</font>

130
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:42,370
the good guys which are basically trying

131
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:43,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">to help it to fix it or by disabled it</font>

132
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:46,000
right and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is something that when I</font>

133
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:47,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">presented at the last conference here</font>

134
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,780
and I said let's hack portugal's to a

135
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:51,250
shock now five years later with the

136
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:53,669
ideas of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bug bounty and all that</font>

137
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:56,200
stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> DC starts to common</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sense right so</font>

138
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:57,640
we the mandate from government at least

139
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,870
make it has to be important because you

140
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:01,270
have to have some<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of mandates for</font>

141
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:05,260
the kind of stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you also need to</font>

142
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:06,789
have a situation where you know in some

143
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:08,440
way the manufactures give us this

144
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:10,570
mandate because they publish<font color="#CCCCCC"> insecure</font>

145
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:12,100
stuff though the way I<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at it if you</font>

146
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:13,599
manufacture your publishing secure<font color="#E5E5E5"> code</font>

147
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:15,730
so you are giving us permission to

148
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,590
compromise it and to fix in to attack it

149
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:18,940
right and and you can't need some

150
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:20,679
insurance on this<font color="#E5E5E5"> because we will brick</font>

151
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:23,230
some devices right so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't support</font>

152
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:25,480
this a little bit buy some insurance now

153
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:27,250
covered this is actually a very key

154
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:28,450
important point right we have to make

155
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:30,460
sure that the next generation of

156
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:35,500
internet users including my kids right

157
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:37,419
and is that they don't have fear of the

158
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:39,340
internet right so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a situation</font>

159
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:41,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">where I don't want them to feel the</font>

160
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:43,239
<font color="#CCCCCC">internet I don't want them to fear to</font>

161
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:44,469
govern their actions because we do that

162
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:46,270
with terrorism and you can see what

163
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:48,760
created it right you have a complete

164
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:50,530
irrational conversation about the real

165
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:52,840
problems so we don't want<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same thing</font>

166
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:54,039
<font color="#CCCCCC">to happen</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in security right we I don't</font>

167
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:56,320
want the first experience with these

168
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:58,690
guys to be a hacked all a light bulb a

169
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:00,550
website email accounts a car the door

170
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:02,530
asking for some ransomware to be paid

171
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:04,360
this is already<font color="#E5E5E5"> not science fiction by</font>

172
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:06,280
the way right and he's only going to get

173
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:07,540
worse we don't want this world<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

174
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:09,929
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> world will create a much bigger</font>

175
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:12,640
problems than we have now right so

176
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:14,800
before I continue I think is a better

177
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:16,719
important to give a good disclaimer of

178
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:20,560
what i mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> by hackers and by hacking</font>

179
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:22,960
right and basically the hackers are the

180
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:26,380
good guys right the hacking created the

181
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:28,359
internet it's basically a hack is to

182
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:29,680
solve problems right this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what we</font>

183
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:32,350
were doing in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> University of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all car</font>

184
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:34,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">right we learn the internet by hacking</font>

185
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:36,490
to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet I blow up my mom's phone</font>

186
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:38,739
system because I was trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to plug the</font>

187
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:41,020
modems 280 was in two thousand four

188
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:43,210
hundred bucks Lord electic was right but

189
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:45,248
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> how you learn you improvise you</font>

190
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:48,099
learn you hack right that's what

191
00:06:45,249 --> 00:06:50,229
right the press abused the term hacker

192
00:06:48,099 --> 00:06:51,819
right and I they should<font color="#E5E5E5"> really be</font>

193
00:06:50,229 --> 00:06:54,188
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about things like malicious</font>

194
00:06:51,819 --> 00:06:56,919
hackers cyberattacks cyber criminals

195
00:06:54,189 --> 00:06:58,599
because that's a much better term so the

196
00:06:56,919 --> 00:07:01,239
way<font color="#CCCCCC"> I look at is that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> everything you do</font>

197
00:06:58,599 --> 00:07:03,308
today on internet was created and

198
00:07:01,239 --> 00:07:04,539
dreamed by hackers in the past right so

199
00:07:03,309 --> 00:07:06,669
when I<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about hacking are talking</font>

200
00:07:04,539 --> 00:07:09,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">about on this definition of hacking</font>

201
00:07:06,669 --> 00:07:11,438
right and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other thing that's great</font>

202
00:07:09,669 --> 00:07:14,318
about hackers do they have great values

203
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:17,019
right you have a very strong ethical

204
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:21,369
foundation based on sharing respect

205
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:24,699
friendship trust<font color="#CCCCCC"> more non-discrimination</font>

206
00:07:21,369 --> 00:07:27,009
human compassion right this is not<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

207
00:07:24,699 --> 00:07:28,809
<font color="#CCCCCC">will fluffy things right this is not oh</font>

208
00:07:27,009 --> 00:07:30,369
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is nice to live in this world when</font>

209
00:07:28,809 --> 00:07:31,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're in a hacking community when</font>

210
00:07:30,369 --> 00:07:34,149
you're in that community of sharing

211
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:36,549
information this is what you do you know

212
00:07:34,149 --> 00:07:38,559
I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> care what color skin you have I</font>

213
00:07:36,549 --> 00:07:40,089
don't care you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what you are where</font>

214
00:07:38,559 --> 00:07:42,519
you are where you come from your history

215
00:07:40,089 --> 00:07:44,139
it doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> matter what matter is that we</font>

216
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:46,269
share the same passion for the same

217
00:07:44,139 --> 00:07:47,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">problem right where we had the summit</font>

218
00:07:46,269 --> 00:07:49,719
here in Portugal you had<font color="#E5E5E5"> people from</font>

219
00:07:47,709 --> 00:07:52,179
competing companies all working together

220
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:53,949
to solve a common problem that's what

221
00:07:52,179 --> 00:07:55,659
you want right and that's what<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

222
00:07:53,949 --> 00:07:57,279
hacking in a way brings in I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

223
00:07:55,659 --> 00:07:59,409
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bring that community to a</font>

224
00:07:57,279 --> 00:08:01,089
country<font color="#E5E5E5"> and to etc we want to inspire</font>

225
00:07:59,409 --> 00:08:02,769
the next generation with these values

226
00:08:01,089 --> 00:08:04,329
and it's important to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have frames of</font>

227
00:08:02,769 --> 00:08:06,189
reference the thing that I find

228
00:08:04,329 --> 00:08:07,749
sometimes you don't have sometimes in

229
00:08:06,189 --> 00:08:09,639
Portugal I said even<font color="#E5E5E5"> companies not just</font>

230
00:08:07,749 --> 00:08:11,559
Portugal<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's sometimes you have</font>

231
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:13,360
professionals that don't have frames of

232
00:08:11,559 --> 00:08:15,279
reference they have not seen it working

233
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,419
so it's very hard to visualize how you

234
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:18,249
can do<font color="#CCCCCC"> something when you never</font>

235
00:08:16,419 --> 00:08:19,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">experience those things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you have that</font>

236
00:08:18,249 --> 00:08:21,009
with dev ops you have now we<font color="#CCCCCC"> deploy me</font>

237
00:08:19,779 --> 00:08:23,558
<font color="#E5E5E5">with coding you know you have management</font>

238
00:08:21,009 --> 00:08:25,839
guys who never experienced a really

239
00:08:23,559 --> 00:08:27,849
powerful software development

240
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:30,009
environment or very powerful secure

241
00:08:27,849 --> 00:08:32,259
environment that creates even faster

242
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:34,659
code and even better code so you if you

243
00:08:32,259 --> 00:08:36,490
don't experience that you really cannot

244
00:08:34,659 --> 00:08:38,139
ask for it so we need to provide

245
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:40,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">alternative narratives to the current</font>

246
00:08:38,139 --> 00:08:42,669
<font color="#CCCCCC">main stream</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Lies non-expert experts</font>

247
00:08:40,299 --> 00:08:44,349
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not experts welcome which is</font>

248
00:08:42,669 --> 00:08:46,059
one something happy in<font color="#CCCCCC"> York a little bit</font>

249
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:48,129
and entertainment which we just saw this

250
00:08:46,059 --> 00:08:50,469
week with a kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you know global</font>

251
00:08:48,129 --> 00:08:52,930
elections right this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the new reality</font>

252
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:54,429
that we have right so we need to create

253
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:57,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">our future and you have to remember that</font>

254
00:08:54,429 --> 00:08:58,899
the hackers<font color="#E5E5E5"> that grow up creating</font>

255
00:08:57,550 --> 00:09:00,939
distributing for example

256
00:08:58,899 --> 00:09:02,439
to attack the network and as part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

257
00:09:00,939 --> 00:09:04,360
example<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the peak hacking service</font>

258
00:09:02,439 --> 00:09:06,730
which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I get into a second are the same</font>

259
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:08,920
ones<font color="#E5E5E5"> that will find really powerful</font>

260
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:10,480
solution for Portugal for example why

261
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:12,160
don't we have a distributed Peter Pedro

262
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:15,220
network to combine fires in Portugal

263
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:16,660
right this is a great use to the use of

264
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:17,949
technology<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can create</font>

265
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:20,230
cryptocurrencies we can create all sorts

266
00:09:17,949 --> 00:09:22,479
of stuff but he's dad generation that

267
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:25,360
would do it right the same generation I

268
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:27,369
was hacking linux boxes right while we

269
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:29,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">university campus right is the same</font>

270
00:09:27,369 --> 00:09:30,999
generation us today solving fundamental

271
00:09:29,439 --> 00:09:32,920
problems so we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure that</font>

272
00:09:30,999 --> 00:09:34,869
<font color="#CCCCCC">this new generation knows whether</font>

273
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:37,449
raspberry pi is knows what's inside

274
00:09:34,869 --> 00:09:39,100
knows how to build one there's a

275
00:09:37,449 --> 00:09:41,469
factoring portrait you can build that

276
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:42,970
stuff right this is what we want right

277
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:44,110
you want to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> different and just</font>

278
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:45,249
<font color="#CCCCCC">because ninety nine percent of the world</font>

279
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:47,439
doesn't do something<font color="#CCCCCC"> doesn't mean you</font>

280
00:09:45,249 --> 00:09:49,240
should do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> I lost count how many times</font>

281
00:09:47,439 --> 00:09:50,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">people tell me that I'm the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> only one guy</font>

282
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:52,629
who wants<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do this or it's only you</font>

283
00:09:50,829 --> 00:09:54,099
Dennis and now it's never going to work

284
00:09:52,629 --> 00:09:56,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">and then eventually things change right</font>

285
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:58,119
so so again it's important to do it

286
00:09:56,379 --> 00:09:59,949
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> and remember that most of the</font>

287
00:09:58,119 --> 00:10:02,350
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> you value today we're actually</font>

288
00:09:59,949 --> 00:10:04,329
illegal any moral sometime in the past

289
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:06,249
so it's very important to remember that

290
00:10:04,329 --> 00:10:07,719
when<font color="#CCCCCC"> we take some sex a bit weird today</font>

291
00:10:06,249 --> 00:10:09,309
a lot of the stuff we take for granted

292
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:12,040
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually really problematic and</font>

293
00:10:09,309 --> 00:10:14,559
controversial in the past so attack in

294
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:15,730

00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:18,160
wanna spend time<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the problem if you</font>

297
00:10:17,139 --> 00:10:20,290
don't if you don't believe this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font>

298
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,850
problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> then you know it's a different</font>

299
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:23,559
discussion just basically some

300
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:26,189

00:10:35,589 --> 00:10:39,610
actually brilliant right it's be nice to

308
00:10:37,779 --> 00:10:41,350
even go another level and by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way you</font>

309
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:42,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">guys should have crazy funds from the</font>

00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:45,279
Portuguese government others to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

311
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:46,870
right so it's one of those cases<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

312
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:48,519
probably are it or company this big and

00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:53,049
this stuff right is absolutely critical

315
00:10:50,589 --> 00:10:54,730
for what's coming next right<font color="#E5E5E5"> if I could</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">actually left parties to see you here</font>

317
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:58,929
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay i mentioned sensing a second so</font>

318
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:00,009
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> found these cool attack vectors so</font>

319
00:10:58,929 --> 00:11:01,689
these are you can blow up<font color="#E5E5E5"> a country</font>

320
00:11:00,009 --> 00:11:03,579
right like you know the<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea that in our</font>

321
00:11:01,689 --> 00:11:04,990
country safe it's totally crazy when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

322
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:06,219
have stuff like this right the amount of

323
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:08,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">damage you can do in a country if you</font>

324
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:09,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">decide to be malicious I can ask you</font>

325
00:11:08,019 --> 00:11:12,870
right if you guys will really<font color="#E5E5E5"> pissed off</font>

326
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:12,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">at Portugal how much damage could you do</font>

327
00:11:13,329 --> 00:11:18,050
yeah but there you go right and it's

328
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:20,360
crazy<font color="#E5E5E5"> right is this this used to be</font>

329
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:22,969
funny five years ago it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> funny</font>

330
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:24,499
anymore right especially when government

331
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:26,540
agents and criminals are really stepping

332
00:11:24,499 --> 00:11:28,160
up and and again if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at the jail</font>

333
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:29,389
political move of the world you know I

334
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:31,368
<font color="#CCCCCC">think it's time for us to control our</font>

335
00:11:29,389 --> 00:11:33,230
technology right so they go we know this

336
00:11:31,369 --> 00:11:35,959
is like basic stuff he's like hacking

337
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:37,850
you know like<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's 2000 right so and</font>

338
00:11:35,959 --> 00:11:40,008
remote control see some scattered stuff

339
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:42,050
things with an hour career<font color="#E5E5E5"> text</font>

340
00:11:40,009 --> 00:11:43,999
protocols you know and then of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course</font>

341
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:44,990
the web apps<font color="#E5E5E5"> I even worse right but if</font>

342
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:46,249
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys don't cover that you should</font>

343
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:47,779
really be covering applications you have

344
00:11:46,249 --> 00:11:50,269
a mandate to hack everything that moves

345
00:11:47,779 --> 00:11:52,069
I'm sure you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> right and I'm sure</font>

346
00:11:50,269 --> 00:11:53,959
<font color="#CCCCCC">that anybody tries to lost to last you</font>

347
00:11:52,069 --> 00:11:56,449
you guys are screwed because you're not

348
00:11:53,959 --> 00:11:57,768
<font color="#E5E5E5">that big right but if not I says yes can</font>

349
00:11:56,449 --> 00:11:59,540
you sue Portugal because they<font color="#E5E5E5"> gave me</font>

350
00:11:57,769 --> 00:12:03,529
the mandate right that's the different

351
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:05,089
mandate right so and again the latest do

352
00:12:03,529 --> 00:12:06,079
s are very interesting right because you

353
00:12:05,089 --> 00:12:08,509
have to remove that<font color="#E5E5E5"> these denial of</font>

354
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:09,739
service are done against<font color="#CCCCCC"> the biggest cum</font>

355
00:12:08,509 --> 00:12:11,869
is in the planet and they are not

356
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:14,420
surviving I'm involving a coming that we

357
00:12:11,869 --> 00:12:16,459
got hit by the crossfire right it's not

358
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:17,748
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not even the target but we just</font>

359
00:12:16,459 --> 00:12:19,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hit just because we were sharing</font>

360
00:12:17,749 --> 00:12:21,709
some of the networks and sharing Akamai

361
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:23,569
and share some of those guys we actually

362
00:12:21,709 --> 00:12:24,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">had we lost money because of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

363
00:12:23,569 --> 00:12:26,748
<font color="#E5E5E5">things and we're not even targeted and</font>

364
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:29,059
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> this guy's point out to us we had no</font>

365
00:12:26,749 --> 00:12:32,300
chance right Oh to deal with this kind

366
00:12:29,059 --> 00:12:34,399
of stuff right so we got we have to

367
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:36,559
remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> right is that it doesn't take a</font>

368
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:38,899
lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> money to compromise a country or</font>

369
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:40,699
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> company this is that shadow day but</font>

370
00:12:38,899 --> 00:12:42,860
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the cost of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the zero day this is</font>

371
00:12:40,699 --> 00:12:46,459
the worst<font color="#E5E5E5"> case scenario to take to</font>

372
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:48,709
compromise a particular company right so

373
00:12:46,459 --> 00:12:49,699
to basically with this you know if I had

374
00:12:48,709 --> 00:12:51,859
one hundred thousand dollars<font color="#CCCCCC"> to invest</font>

375
00:12:49,699 --> 00:12:53,748
what would I do I'll buy a bunch of zero

376
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:55,639
days right I'll buy compromised machines

377
00:12:53,749 --> 00:12:57,679
inside the Portuguese network i buy

378
00:12:55,639 --> 00:12:59,990
botnets to attack<font color="#CCCCCC"> Portuguese companies</font>

379
00:12:57,679 --> 00:13:01,639
right and basically how much money can I

380
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:03,379
make out of it if I could<font color="#CCCCCC"> make a million</font>

381
00:13:01,639 --> 00:13:06,259
pounds<font color="#CCCCCC"> out of it it makes business sense</font>

382
00:13:03,379 --> 00:13:07,699
because it's all about the money right

383
00:13:06,259 --> 00:13:09,439
that's why I<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to think about if</font>

384
00:13:07,699 --> 00:13:11,540
there is a million dollars to be made in

385
00:13:09,439 --> 00:13:13,610
a particular company somebody will be

386
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:15,559
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put a hundred grand into it to</font>

387
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:16,670
invest right the good news<font color="#E5E5E5"> for Eddie's</font>

388
00:13:15,559 --> 00:13:18,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">the attackers are making far too much</font>

389
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:20,628
money doing other stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> right but they</font>

390
00:13:18,709 --> 00:13:22,549
grow it right but we get there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and again</font>

391
00:13:20,629 --> 00:13:24,170
what's the return on investment and who

392
00:13:22,549 --> 00:13:25,790
actually can survive this stuff and I my

393
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:26,579
view is very<font color="#E5E5E5"> little companies right</font>

394
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:28,049
specially important

395
00:13:26,579 --> 00:13:30,689
we will to survive this kind of stuff

396
00:13:28,049 --> 00:13:32,639
right so we already<font color="#E5E5E5"> had actually a</font>

397
00:13:30,689 --> 00:13:34,139
massive market hack because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would</font>

398
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:35,519
argue that Portugal has already been

399
00:13:34,139 --> 00:13:37,769
victim to financial manipulations

400
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:39,239
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the outside not some people</font>

401
00:13:37,769 --> 00:13:40,980
on the financials that I know they were

402
00:13:39,239 --> 00:13:42,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">totally playing with Portugal right</font>

403
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:44,790
later I know some guys there their best

404
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:47,249
fund returned investments where the

405
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:48,480
Portuguese dead right in other words hey

406
00:13:47,249 --> 00:13:49,860
let's put<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of money to purchase</font>

407
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,600
debt because we know those guys are

408
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:53,249
never going to default and let's push

409
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,379
the rates up because we know is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

410
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:57,839
be safe right you know the<font color="#CCCCCC"> system is</font>

411
00:13:55,379 --> 00:13:59,999
wrong this is hacking right but the

412
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:02,040
financial<font color="#E5E5E5"> markets right and we know and</font>

413
00:13:59,999 --> 00:14:04,499
you guys live with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the day-to-day</font>

414
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:07,738
consequences of this that was done to us

415
00:14:04,499 --> 00:14:08,999
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I'm basically they push it hard</font>

416
00:14:07,739 --> 00:14:10,860
they make a lot of money that Benny was

417
00:14:08,999 --> 00:14:12,720
not going to default and he didn't write

418
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:14,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">began and would continue to struggle</font>

419
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,869
right so that's a problem the other

420
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:17,009
thing that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> very very important when</font>

421
00:14:15,869 --> 00:14:19,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">you look at from the tacky point of view</font>

422
00:14:17,009 --> 00:14:21,839
just to end this is if they tell you

423
00:14:19,589 --> 00:14:23,759
<font color="#CCCCCC">about the attack right and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I know it</font>

424
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:26,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">might</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be painful when it's a leak</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

425
00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:28,350
your document whatever but when the

426
00:14:26,339 --> 00:14:30,899
attackers actually physically let you

427
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:32,279
know that they did something<font color="#CCCCCC"> right they</font>

428
00:14:30,899 --> 00:14:34,110
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> your best</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> friends and you have to</font>

429
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:35,249
thank them because they will make you

430
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:38,279
better from security point of view

431
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:41,850
because the criminals will not tell you

432
00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:44,220
the criminals business model is based on

433
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:46,769
you not knowing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they there right so</font>

434
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:48,239
the reality is that once you know about

435
00:14:46,769 --> 00:14:49,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">the attack you're going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fix it the</font>

436
00:14:48,239 --> 00:14:50,790
security team is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get a much</font>

437
00:14:49,319 --> 00:14:52,378
bigger budget right we're gonna be able

438
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:53,669
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> protect all these other things that</font>

439
00:14:52,379 --> 00:14:55,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">we would love to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do but nobody was</font>

440
00:14:53,669 --> 00:14:58,110
paying attention now suddenly it's a

441
00:14:55,919 --> 00:15:00,239
massive priority right so<font color="#CCCCCC"> ultimately</font>

442
00:14:58,110 --> 00:15:02,730
every time there's a public attack the

443
00:15:00,239 --> 00:15:05,669
outcome<font color="#E5E5E5"> is always tends to be net</font>

444
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:08,549
positive unless they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> criminals</font>

445
00:15:05,669 --> 00:15:09,989
unless they have malicious intent then

446
00:15:08,549 --> 00:15:11,429
is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> complete different problem I kid</font>

447
00:15:09,989 --> 00:15:13,439
that break into your<font color="#E5E5E5"> network and dumps</font>

448
00:15:11,429 --> 00:15:14,579
everything you should<font color="#E5E5E5"> hire him right</font>

449
00:15:13,439 --> 00:15:16,980
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is what we doing now when your way</font>

450
00:15:14,579 --> 00:15:18,329
with the bug bounties right on this so

451
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:20,069
again the positive side effects of all

452
00:15:18,329 --> 00:15:21,359
that stuff is that you basically get

453
00:15:20,069 --> 00:15:23,009
better teams better stuff and that's

454
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,480
what happens right so how secure is

455
00:15:23,009 --> 00:15:26,429
<font color="#CCCCCC">Portugal right how secures our</font>

456
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,649
infrastructure and companies<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we are</font>

457
00:15:26,429 --> 00:15:30,149
very digital company operations stuff

458
00:15:28,649 --> 00:15:31,980
and if you look at operate most of them

459
00:15:30,149 --> 00:15:34,110
run on software so<font color="#CCCCCC"> portugal is already</font>

460
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:35,789
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those countries</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that already runs</font>

461
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:38,399
on software probably has not realized

462
00:15:35,789 --> 00:15:40,769
that runs on software i challenge<font color="#CCCCCC"> you to</font>

463
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:42,929
find one company in portugal if

464
00:15:40,769 --> 00:15:44,850
from the most traditional I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

465
00:15:42,929 --> 00:15:47,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">that exists in here right the action is</font>

466
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:48,779
not depend on software for their

467
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,980
livelihood for their sales for their

468
00:15:48,779 --> 00:15:52,529
management for their purchases<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

469
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:54,389
everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if they do the efficacy</font>

470
00:15:52,529 --> 00:15:56,459
is very low right so everything's on

471
00:15:54,389 --> 00:15:58,379
software right and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> question how</font>

472
00:15:56,459 --> 00:16:00,388
<font color="#E5E5E5">security how you know how can they</font>

473
00:15:58,379 --> 00:16:03,059
sustain attack how can detect possible

474
00:16:00,389 --> 00:16:04,829
attacks and what's the probability of an

475
00:16:03,059 --> 00:16:07,709
attack happening in the short term so in

476
00:16:04,829 --> 00:16:10,199
a warehouse security right so how sec so

477
00:16:07,709 --> 00:16:11,459
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> question is we are very safe and I</font>

478
00:16:10,199 --> 00:16:13,679
was actually trying to find these word

479
00:16:11,459 --> 00:16:15,029
in Portuguese and I couldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> so maybe</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

480
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:16,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">can talk some you get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in tell me and I</font>

481
00:16:15,029 --> 00:16:18,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">couldn't find the difference in</font>

482
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:20,489
Portuguese between safe and secure in

483
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:23,069
England<font color="#CCCCCC"> the exists in Portuguese I could</font>

484
00:16:20,489 --> 00:16:25,439
find it because it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> smooth right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

485
00:16:23,069 --> 00:16:27,689
both of them right so but heat we are we

486
00:16:25,439 --> 00:16:30,209
safe today yes we are safe right do I

487
00:16:27,689 --> 00:16:31,498
use the internet do<font color="#E5E5E5"> I use my card am i</font>

488
00:16:30,209 --> 00:16:33,628
comfortable knowing that in principle

489
00:16:31,499 --> 00:16:35,759
not going to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> hat now by a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> criminal</font>

490
00:16:33,629 --> 00:16:37,379
I'm pretty safe right and I know what

491
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:39,089
the end the belly looks like right so if

492
00:16:37,379 --> 00:16:42,209
anybody should be paranoid should be me

493
00:16:39,089 --> 00:16:46,379
right but are<font color="#E5E5E5"> we secure no we massively</font>

494
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:48,809
secure right because<font color="#E5E5E5"> our current secure</font>

495
00:16:46,379 --> 00:16:51,480
state right the fact that we are secure

496
00:16:48,809 --> 00:16:53,549
right so<font color="#CCCCCC"> our Quinn security state</font>

497
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:55,740
depends on a very low number of

498
00:16:53,549 --> 00:16:57,749
attackers with view few skills and

499
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:59,610
unsophisticated business models right

500
00:16:57,749 --> 00:17:01,379
and this is important to understand and

501
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:03,509
this is Major cameras in the planet

502
00:17:01,379 --> 00:17:05,549
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not just Portuguese companies</font>

503
00:17:03,509 --> 00:17:07,289
but do I think here we<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be</font>

504
00:17:05,549 --> 00:17:09,329
caught by the crossfire right so the

505
00:17:07,289 --> 00:17:12,329
bottom line is that we know attacked

506
00:17:09,329 --> 00:17:13,740
because we are secure we're not attack

507
00:17:12,329 --> 00:17:15,448
because there's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> enough attackers</font>

508
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:17,159
right but it's important<font color="#E5E5E5"> to acknowledge</font>

509
00:17:15,449 --> 00:17:19,049
this because there we can start to look

510
00:17:17,159 --> 00:17:20,490
at better solutions for that right so

511
00:17:19,049 --> 00:17:22,439
the emperor has no new clothes so

512
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:24,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">Portuguese gay men ages are not secured</font>

513
00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:26,339
to studio she want the headline there it

514
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:28,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">is right and when we need to accept as a</font>

515
00:17:26,339 --> 00:17:31,980
fax for what's coming next to look likes

516
00:17:28,409 --> 00:17:33,389
radical right so um there's an also very

517
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:34,889
important there's no<font color="#E5E5E5"> silver bullets or</font>

518
00:17:33,389 --> 00:17:37,168
is it solutions there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of people</font>

519
00:17:34,889 --> 00:17:39,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to sell big lovely buttons and big</font>

520
00:17:37,169 --> 00:17:44,159
stuff that doesn't exist right what we

521
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:46,380
have is all the evolution right is about

522
00:17:44,159 --> 00:17:48,899
me know we we need to figure out all

523
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:50,730
these paths to go through so the logic

524
00:17:48,899 --> 00:17:53,100
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> presentation is to make portugal a</font>

525
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:53,900
player versus being a plate we want to

526
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:55,490
be a<font color="#CCCCCC"> sea</font>

527
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:57,110
your player on a table we want to

528
00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:59,390
control the game we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need the finals of</font>

529
00:17:57,110 --> 00:18:01,100
the game<font color="#E5E5E5"> verse just being upon into</font>

530
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:04,430
whatever the game is being played right

531
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:06,530
and um and if you prepare what's coming

532
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:08,870
next special in terms of upset right and

533
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:11,389
a response to<font color="#CCCCCC"> terrorist shows how bad</font>

534
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:13,010
you these can do if when the<font color="#E5E5E5"> problems</font>

535
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:15,140
occur you're not ready you don't have a

536
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:17,420
plan you don't have a turn 30 reality

537
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:19,850
and society is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not strong not being</font>

538
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:21,080
funny but the reaction to Sweden to the

539
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:22,669
terrorist attack that happen there

540
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:24,980
versus the reaction to some other

541
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:27,410
countries it's a massive difference so

542
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:29,480
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can see the value right of having a</font>

543
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:31,960
very strong society has thought about

544
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:33,890
these things<font color="#CCCCCC"> right think I'm wrong fine</font>

545
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:35,090
protective me wrong<font color="#CCCCCC"> where is the</font>

546
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:36,440
evidence where is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cyber security</font>

547
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:38,449
market in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Portugal which i believe is</font>

548
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:39,950
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> very small right how many</font>

549
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:42,590
treadmills are credit per week how many

550
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:44,600
secure lines of code are right basically

551
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:46,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">I like to what is this phrase a lot the</font>

552
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">consecutive model is based on magic</font>

553
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:49,879
fairies pixie dust a<font color="#CCCCCC"> schools like</font>

554
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:51,860
quality right is somehow automatically

555
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:53,540
become secure right that's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> reality</font>

556
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:55,490
right the good news you have a lot of

557
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:57,740
talent which I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get it so again</font>

558
00:18:55,490 --> 00:18:59,330
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> save right and at the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> moment</font>

559
00:18:57,740 --> 00:19:00,920
although we have insecure week right

560
00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:02,149
safe which is cool right but it also

561
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:04,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">means we have a bit of time to deal with</font>

562
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:06,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">it step right so i just wanted for</font>

563
00:19:04,730 --> 00:19:08,210
trackers so basically we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a couple</font>

564
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:11,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">more years so let's basically now look</font>

565
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:15,140
at the solutions for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this thing right so</font>

566
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:18,170
and i also like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is for a point you</font>

567
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:20,150
the best security model and I call<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

568
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:22,490
same security model it's not a security

569
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:26,540
model based on having no vulnerabilities

570
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:28,430
know any securities no a TI dependencies

571
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:30,230
or no<font color="#E5E5E5"> zero days that doesn't exist in</font>

572
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:31,550
the real world right the security model

573
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:33,710
is based on the attacker making a

574
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:37,040
mistake because<font color="#E5E5E5"> all attackers make</font>

575
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:38,660
mistakes right even guys like the NSA or

576
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:40,100
whoever created the Stuxnet right which

577
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:42,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">is still not officially you know</font>

578
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:44,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">acknowledged they make mistakes they</font>

579
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:47,510
crashed one odd little box that was

580
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:49,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">running on an odd you know antivirus and</font>

581
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:50,900
not unravel the whole thing right and

582
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,370
that's your security model now the

583
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:53,780
question is can you detect those do you

584
00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:55,189
understand your code<font color="#CCCCCC"> you understand your</font>

585
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:57,860
applications you understand how

586
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:59,180
everything works right that's why that

587
00:19:57,860 --> 00:20:00,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">is so critical and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's just you</font>

588
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:02,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">coulda model not for portable for any</font>

589
00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:04,310
company right that's what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

590
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:05,929
it right<font color="#CCCCCC"> so where's our op SEC industry</font>

591
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:07,669
I don't think we have one really<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

592
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:09,320
issues<font color="#E5E5E5"> very small</font>

593
00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:10,520
all is<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually I think the problem</font>

594
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:12,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">because I didn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have a lot of talents</font>

595
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:14,570
right and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> could see this because you</font>

596
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:16,159
see every time<font color="#CCCCCC"> you see an attack you see</font>

597
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:18,679
an object team right is literally you

598
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:20,300
know it's one to one right so I know you

599
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:22,070
dissing exists right in fact I know a

600
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:24,020
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> about portuguese in UK i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> clearly</font>

601
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:25,850
exporting object Alan to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be okay right</font>

602
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:28,250
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> work in London with a whole</font>

603
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:29,300
bunch of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Portuguese guys right I'm not</font>

604
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:30,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> anywhere i work at the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> moment</font>

605
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:32,690
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know i want to get any</font>

606
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:34,310
trouble right but you know there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

607
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:35,870
huge glass commuting<font color="#E5E5E5"> portugal right</font>

608
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:38,780
there so we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be proactive about</font>

609
00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:41,149
this stuff right and he's actually very

610
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:42,950
mature and again like<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do you want to</font>

611
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:44,960
be like the heads of<font color="#CCCCCC"> arabica on the</font>

612
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:47,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">crossfire or do you want to be actually</font>

613
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:48,320
proactive and praying industry that will

614
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:49,970
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> very powerful but it's very</font>

615
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:51,679
profitable so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is quite school</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font>

616
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:53,600
I'm defending here can actually really

617
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:55,820
really powerful and productive and

618
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:57,110
profitable for Portugal so gives us jobs

619
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:59,689
gives all sorts of stuff and drive

620
00:20:57,110 --> 00:21:01,909
industry right and then we help you so

621
00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:03,260
here's the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea right for you we</font>

622
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:05,240
should have the Portuguese<font color="#E5E5E5"> hacking</font>

623
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:07,580
service right so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> like we had</font>

624
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:08,780
this thing called<font color="#CCCCCC"> the service obligatory</font>

625
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:10,189
right you guys probably remember some of

626
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:11,960
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things right we need to do the</font>

627
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:14,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">same thing for hacking right need to</font>

628
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:16,520
have these service where 15 25 year olds

629
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:18,920
go and freaking hack the country right

630
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:20,900
everything has moved hack<font color="#E5E5E5"> companies code</font>

631
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:22,670
review<font color="#CCCCCC"> open-source curve view markets as</font>

632
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:24,380
interested to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Portugal contribute to</font>

633
00:21:22,670 --> 00:21:26,690
open<font color="#E5E5E5"> source projects right this will be</font>

634
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:28,640
a spectacular learning opportunity right

635
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:30,770
this would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> a great use of talent of</font>

636
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:32,450
users create a new generation that

637
00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:34,160
understands those things right it

638
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:37,070
doesn't cost any money it's just

639
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:38,900
political right it's just<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> decision is</font>

640
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:42,169
just a direction right but this will

641
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:44,570
gives us a lot of fuel a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of new</font>

642
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:46,190
things right<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did also I like this</font>

643
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:48,320
because it's almost like if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can even</font>

644
00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:49,610
stomach this idea then you know that's

645
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:51,740
fine but this conversation<font color="#E5E5E5"> will continue</font>

646
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:53,449
two years from now right<font color="#CCCCCC"> because it's</font>

647
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:54,560
not even that radical right but if

648
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:56,720
you'll radical because not a lot of

649
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:58,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">people has done it before but it's easy</font>

650
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:01,040
we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the tradition right and we</font>

651
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:02,780
should do it right<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I you know the</font>

652
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:04,190
military right so i buy this thing right

653
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:05,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">I was look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the thing say at the</font>

654
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:07,520
moment we probably say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that our cyber</font>

655
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:09,290
Mel defends as good as Portuguese

656
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:11,300
military the problem is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the attackers</font>

657
00:22:09,290 --> 00:22:13,070
are sophisticated as the best<font color="#CCCCCC"> out there</font>

658
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:15,440
so you have to imagine<font color="#E5E5E5"> that again</font>

659
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:17,090
portugal will be attacked by the

660
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:19,520
equivalent of us and china right or

661
00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:21,590
france in terms of UK and here's my

662
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:23,150
question why do we need two f-16s right

663
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:24,260
so I went to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the porch exam for us to</font>

664
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:27,350
try to figure<font color="#CCCCCC"> out the thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and i found</font>

665
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:29,240
that we have a nice<font color="#CCCCCC"> f16 fleet of stuff</font>

666
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:32,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">and all these jobs we have 2.1 billion</font>

667
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:34,460
turnover like why does<font color="#E5E5E5"> portugal need an</font>

668
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:38,480
offensive force right can you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys tell</font>

669
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:41,539
me right one scenario right that f-16

670
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:44,090
will actually come into play right like

671
00:22:41,539 --> 00:22:46,789
literally give me a war scenario where

672
00:22:44,090 --> 00:22:48,889
we have somebody attacking<font color="#E5E5E5"> portugal</font>

673
00:22:46,789 --> 00:22:52,309
without freaking<font color="#CCCCCC"> f-16s right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll</font>

674
00:22:48,890 --> 00:22:54,620
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know do any value right so</font>

675
00:22:52,309 --> 00:22:56,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">i know i understand have a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Civil Air</font>

676
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:59,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">Force because we have fires border</font>

677
00:22:56,690 --> 00:23:01,190
control but f-16s come on and by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way</font>

678
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:03,860
the way you fight these f-16s these days

679
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:05,720
is you hacking to them right that's the

680
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:08,029
way<font color="#E5E5E5"> you defend yourself right so if I</font>

681
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:09,529
ven readies book go sleep<font color="#E5E5E5"> I highly</font>

682
00:23:08,029 --> 00:23:12,140
recommend because it shows how China

683
00:23:09,529 --> 00:23:13,279
theoretically took over the US<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

684
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:16,250
you know you kind of compromise the

685
00:23:13,279 --> 00:23:18,620
whole thing right so if you use ten

686
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:22,070
percent of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that budget right we can</font>

687
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:23,510
start a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things right and I'm so</font>

688
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:25,100
basically hit by the crossfire talk

689
00:23:23,510 --> 00:23:27,020
about this so as they skip out thing is

690
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:28,610
so we should also have this<font color="#E5E5E5"> Portugal</font>

691
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:30,740
hackathon<font color="#CCCCCC"> link or we should</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> organize</font>

692
00:23:28,610 --> 00:23:32,479
hackathons right just like<font color="#E5E5E5"> we did for</font>

693
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:34,789
football is like you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know we should</font>

694
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:36,649
bring our PT def sconce you you know PT

695
00:23:34,789 --> 00:23:38,960
hacking things to<font color="#CCCCCC"> DEFCON it should be a</font>

696
00:23:36,649 --> 00:23:40,399
source of pride right<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same way that</font>

697
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:42,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">win-win we're on the football which was</font>

698
00:23:40,399 --> 00:23:44,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">great right really cool we should be</font>

699
00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:46,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">celebrating when our guys go to DEFCON</font>

700
00:23:44,149 --> 00:23:48,739
it and become first or second over there

701
00:23:46,429 --> 00:23:50,659
right we should be a source of proud<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

702
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:52,580
actually have the best and<font color="#CCCCCC"> most elite</font>

703
00:23:50,659 --> 00:23:53,990
hackers because there is a connection to

704
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:55,399
Portugal right there is a connection to

705
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:57,590
your country and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's what you really</font>

706
00:23:55,399 --> 00:23:59,570
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be so this is the source of</font>

707
00:23:57,590 --> 00:24:01,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">pride and then you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and they and</font>

708
00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:03,559
it's also great way to learn right so a

709
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:05,029
great source of talent for example and

710
00:24:03,559 --> 00:24:06,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is again to be controversial is we</font>

711
00:24:05,029 --> 00:24:08,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">should actually teach the convicted</font>

712
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:09,799
criminals how to hack right because

713
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:11,539
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of people that end up in</font>

714
00:24:09,799 --> 00:24:12,860
prison for all sorts of reasons right

715
00:24:11,539 --> 00:24:14,809
and brother them you<font color="#CCCCCC"> would do the same</font>

716
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:17,120
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you had those circumstances</font>

717
00:24:14,809 --> 00:24:19,010
right but there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a path today that we</font>

718
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:21,020
lose<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of talents right to go into</font>

719
00:24:19,010 --> 00:24:22,730
these guys you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> they already kind of</font>

720
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:24,830
already created right because to be fair

721
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:25,909
when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you rob something on your</font>

722
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:27,500
criminal you actually get your<font color="#E5E5E5"> head a</font>

723
00:24:25,909 --> 00:24:28,820
bit different right so we just need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

724
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:31,220
give those guys a little interesting

725
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:32,840
path to use of their skills right so

726
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:34,039
give them a career<font color="#E5E5E5"> strum the way to make</font>

727
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:35,209
money legally right because it's

728
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:37,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually legal to do stuff</font>

729
00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:39,620
teach them ethics and most criminals are

730
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:41,149
you too bad choices so let's use that a

731
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:43,039
great sort of talent is retired people

732
00:24:41,149 --> 00:24:44,899
again we lose them but<font color="#E5E5E5"> not losing their</font>

733
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:46,820
experience and on the past there were

734
00:24:44,899 --> 00:24:48,799
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> wise ones we now ignore them right</font>

735

and remember you'll be<font color="#E5E5E5"> old soon so it's</font>

736
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:51,770

the time we get there<font color="#E5E5E5"> we nicely we're</font>

738
00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:56,450

engineers doctors programs teachers etc

741
00:24:57,950 --> 00:25:01,850

everybody plays football because<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

823
00:27:34,730 --> 00:27:37,850

839
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:08,810
be an<font color="#E5E5E5"> attack we both give a brief</font>

840
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:10,610
history of providing this kind of stuff

841
00:28:08,810 --> 00:28:12,230
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically you know the same way that</font>

842
00:28:10,610 --> 00:28:14,240
would navigate the<font color="#CCCCCC"> seas in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> past</font>

843
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:15,470
right well now you know she<font color="#E5E5E5"> believes in</font>

844
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:17,420
the curve right if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> compared</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to our</font>

845
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:19,220
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know forefathers in the 15th century</font>

846
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:21,080
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think we bit more scary when you</font>

847
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:22,280
thought that on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other side there was</font>

848
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:23,870
like you know all<font color="#E5E5E5"> sorts of really</font>

849
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:25,160
dangerous and crazy stuff you even don't

850
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:27,080
know if the earth was fall to the other

851
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:28,760
side right so I think you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> we are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

852
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:31,699
bit more<font color="#E5E5E5"> cozy right in our little</font>

853
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:32,930
problems today right so and that's the

854
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:34,580
thing and<font color="#E5E5E5"> also we have a great tradition</font>

855
00:28:32,930 --> 00:28:36,350
of innovation and all this kind of stuff

856
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:39,500
right so I think code made in portugal

857
00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:42,080
is very important we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to create all</font>

858
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:43,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">the supply change right that exists in</font>

859
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:45,379
portugal and basically because they

860
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:47,180
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> where you add value right and</font>

861
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:48,830
they create reality so basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

862
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:51,020
control our<font color="#E5E5E5"> lives right so it's key for</font>

863
00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:52,879
our economy<font color="#CCCCCC"> and its key to action</font>

864
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:54,379
courage what is actually going on here

865
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:56,030
right and we're living on this age of

866
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:58,220
sustainability I know how much<font color="#CCCCCC"> you guys</font>

867
00:28:56,030 --> 00:28:59,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">following</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this kind of stuff but we're</font>

868
00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:02,509
moving<font color="#E5E5E5"> to all the factors are coming</font>

869
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:03,949
locally you know the whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> dynamic of</font>

870
00:29:02,509 --> 00:29:07,159
work is actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> changing uber</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

871
00:29:03,949 --> 00:29:08,479
warm-up for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the social and financial</font>

872
00:29:07,159 --> 00:29:09,979
changes that are happening to our

873
00:29:08,479 --> 00:29:12,169
society the question is do we want to

874
00:29:09,979 --> 00:29:13,909
lead it or you want to again cross by

875
00:29:12,169 --> 00:29:15,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">the crossfire right just for the guys</font>

876
00:29:13,909 --> 00:29:17,179
will develop stuff I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put some</font>

877
00:29:15,469 --> 00:29:18,469
geek stuff on this so let's just do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

878
00:29:17,179 --> 00:29:19,999
if this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of what i call</font>

879
00:29:18,469 --> 00:29:21,799
secure activity security champions

880
00:29:19,999 --> 00:29:23,299
that's the mug right if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have a</font>

881
00:29:21,799 --> 00:29:25,429
security champion your team get a mug

882
00:29:23,299 --> 00:29:27,918
right because<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's its better de mug I</font>

883
00:29:25,429 --> 00:29:29,599
stackoverflow ego review secure coding

884
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:31,099

887
00:29:32,959 --> 00:29:36,469
stuff you guys should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be doing and again</font>

888
00:29:34,579 --> 00:29:38,239
if you develop today not in any not take

889
00:29:36,469 --> 00:29:40,909
in terms of CI automation everything is

890
00:29:38,239 --> 00:29:43,339
code ten percent code coverage graphs

891
00:29:40,909 --> 00:29:45,169
containers version control a<font color="#E5E5E5"> iCloud bah</font>

892
00:29:43,339 --> 00:29:47,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">bah bah you already like writing legacy</font>

893
00:29:45,169 --> 00:29:48,289
code right you like to slag off the

894
00:29:47,029 --> 00:29:49,429
other project over there because<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

895
00:29:48,289 --> 00:29:51,259
legacy guess what if you're not doing

896
00:29:49,429 --> 00:29:53,479
<font color="#CCCCCC">this you are your legacy in your own</font>

897
00:29:51,259 --> 00:29:55,549
world right and and<font color="#E5E5E5"> also if you're doing</font>

898
00:29:53,479 --> 00:29:57,169
JavaScript for example and you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

899
00:29:55,549 --> 00:29:58,819
using wallaby and you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have real</font>

900
00:29:57,169 --> 00:30:00,169
time code coverage you're really<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

901
00:29:58,819 --> 00:30:01,309
dark age and they<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a couple of other</font>

902
00:30:00,169 --> 00:30:03,379
presentations on that you guys

903
00:30:01,309 --> 00:30:04,639
interested I really strong advise you

904
00:30:03,379 --> 00:30:06,168
guys to take a look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at it right and you</font>

905
00:30:04,639 --> 00:30:09,948
can't code TDD until you have those

906
00:30:06,169 --> 00:30:13,269
things so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I really like this public</font>

907
00:30:09,949 --> 00:30:16,369
health analogy right so what this is is

908
00:30:13,269 --> 00:30:18,499
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to choose</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the paradigm for OPSEC</font>

909
00:30:16,369 --> 00:30:20,149
or cyber security that we want and the

910
00:30:18,499 --> 00:30:22,819
paradigm is either going to be based on

911
00:30:20,149 --> 00:30:25,369
the military top-down control offensive

912
00:30:22,819 --> 00:30:27,109
or<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> public health defensive and</font>

913
00:30:25,369 --> 00:30:28,819
distributed this is very important

914
00:30:27,109 --> 00:30:31,069
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> this determines which point we</font>

915
00:30:28,819 --> 00:30:33,019
good does in fact the US UK and other

916
00:30:31,069 --> 00:30:35,239
countries they are totally<font color="#E5E5E5"> going the</font>

917
00:30:33,019 --> 00:30:36,919
military way right again we<font color="#E5E5E5"> could change</font>

918
00:30:35,239 --> 00:30:39,499
<font color="#E5E5E5">that and there's a reason for example</font>

919
00:30:36,919 --> 00:30:41,569
why you don't let<font color="#E5E5E5"> the army involve in</font>

920
00:30:39,499 --> 00:30:43,369
your country right<font color="#E5E5E5"> because the army</font>

921
00:30:41,569 --> 00:30:45,649
which is the military right in lot of

922
00:30:43,369 --> 00:30:47,569
ways is designed to defend against her

923
00:30:45,649 --> 00:30:49,819
enemies so any of everybody is a an

924
00:30:47,569 --> 00:30:51,799
attacker from an army point of view

925
00:30:49,819 --> 00:30:53,509
right which is why when<font color="#CCCCCC"> the US Army went</font>

926
00:30:51,799 --> 00:30:55,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">to defend Katrina was a horror show</font>

927
00:30:53,509 --> 00:30:56,779
right because<font color="#E5E5E5"> for them the guys on the</font>

928
00:30:55,489 --> 00:30:58,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">other side are criminals right or</font>

929
00:30:56,779 --> 00:31:00,739
attackers right the police and civil

930
00:30:58,609 --> 00:31:02,269
forces focus on protect individuals that

931
00:31:00,739 --> 00:31:04,159
makes a big difference so we have a

932
00:31:02,269 --> 00:31:06,289
massive public health problem we should

933
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:08,599
be thinking trading up sex you know

934
00:31:06,289 --> 00:31:10,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">specialists in a way we do nurses etc we</font>

935
00:31:08,599 --> 00:31:13,609
already<font color="#E5E5E5"> have an epidemic right and we</font>

936
00:31:10,879 --> 00:31:16,158
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to gain immunity that's really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

937
00:31:13,609 --> 00:31:16,730
we want to do right and basically the

938
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:17,990
decision

939
00:31:16,730 --> 00:31:19,669
can I skip of years will determine how

940
00:31:17,990 --> 00:31:21,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">well prepared doesn't mean that we won't</font>

941
00:31:19,669 --> 00:31:23,299
have problems it is at least we are

942
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:24,590
prepared right and that's what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we need</font>

943
00:31:23,299 --> 00:31:25,910
to think about<font color="#CCCCCC"> in secure code is</font>

944
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:28,070
epidemic that's already amongst us

945
00:31:25,910 --> 00:31:29,809
privacy<font color="#E5E5E5"> is very important is actually</font>

946
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:31,879
human right you will also be innocent

947
00:31:29,809 --> 00:31:34,040
until proven guilty the USA NSA we

948
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:36,320
define the notion of privacy which was

949
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:38,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">really bad they went from this idea</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

950
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:41,030
when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know you look at something if</font>

951
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:43,429
you invading somebody's privacy to just

952
00:31:41,030 --> 00:31:45,770
it's only so when you when you capture

953
00:31:43,429 --> 00:31:47,510
information to when you look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> it so</font>

954
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:49,700
what happens is they the reasoning<font color="#CCCCCC"> is I</font>

955
00:31:47,510 --> 00:31:51,740
can capture everything about any of us

956
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:53,809
but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> only when they look at the data</font>

957
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:55,429
when you do a<font color="#E5E5E5"> search or something that</font>

958
00:31:53,809 --> 00:31:57,410
you actually become a potential invasion

959
00:31:55,429 --> 00:31:59,419
of privacy right which of course is

960
00:31:57,410 --> 00:32:01,100
totally crazy right just<font color="#CCCCCC"> justifies that</font>

961
00:31:59,419 --> 00:32:02,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">stuff so we need to change that right</font>

962
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:04,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">and there's a huge amount</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of companies</font>

963
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:06,350
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> their entire business model depends</font>

964
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:07,639
on us not having privacy which is a

965
00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:10,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">problem because influence a lot of</font>

966
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:12,080
decisions etc and governments are now

967
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:13,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually actively making the internet</font>

968
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:14,659
less secure because they want to

969
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:16,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">continue to access that stuff which is</font>

970
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:17,450
that big problem so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know it used to</font>

971
00:32:16,490 --> 00:32:18,679
be they don't have to defend against

972
00:32:17,450 --> 00:32:19,910
criminals now you have to defend against

973
00:32:18,679 --> 00:32:21,919
even governments and other things that

974
00:32:19,910 --> 00:32:24,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually don't want you to fix</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> problems</font>

975
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:25,970
right so crypto again is private is

976
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:28,549
essential for this because<font color="#E5E5E5"> privacy</font>

977
00:32:25,970 --> 00:32:30,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">cessful human dignity is in a way</font>

978
00:32:28,549 --> 00:32:32,750
cryptography is a public service right

979
00:32:30,650 --> 00:32:34,309
and he's critical to protect user data

980
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:35,750
we really<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to embrace his much</font>

981
00:32:34,309 --> 00:32:37,040
better and<font color="#E5E5E5"> do it right and also the</font>

982
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:38,870
great tradition of<font color="#E5E5E5"> not relying on</font>

983
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:40,399
security by obscurity because I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

984
00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:41,689
that's very important right so great

985
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:45,110
crypto should be<font color="#CCCCCC"> C on a good thing</font>

986
00:32:41,690 --> 00:32:46,340
should not be sued right by some entity

987
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:48,379
who says oh please<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't make these</font>

988
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:51,379
devices so secure that I cannot break

989
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:53,750
them right which again<font color="#CCCCCC"> is wrong right so</font>

990
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:56,000
and whistleblowers very quickly we need

991
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:57,679
disclosure to do this to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about this</font>

992
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,780
stuff the market at the moment is really

993
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:01,760
work right so whistle blows are actually

994
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:03,470
very important right due to<font color="#E5E5E5"> these kind</font>

995
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:05,120
of stuff and again if Portugal<font color="#E5E5E5"> EU this</font>

996
00:33:03,470 --> 00:33:06,559
unlikely we should<font color="#CCCCCC"> suit you you know</font>

997
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:08,059
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> time for us to actually push some</font>

998
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:10,700
stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> and these can all comes down to</font>

999
00:33:08,059 --> 00:33:12,290
the way of sovereignty right we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1000
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:13,880
control stuff that happens<font color="#E5E5E5"> in our</font>

1001
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:16,040
country for exam which are very very

1002
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:17,510
powerful whistleblower laws that a lot

1003
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:19,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">of people to disclose what's going on in</font>

1004
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:20,960
the software happens in here right

1005
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:22,399
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> there isn't a important because</font>

1006
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:25,429
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> will make our market more efficient</font>

1007
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:28,100
they will basically have the situation

1008
00:33:25,429 --> 00:33:30,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">where they will keep the company's</font>

1009
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:31,010
honest right and as a great thing that

1010
00:33:30,679 --> 00:33:32,840
when

1011
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:34,520
things a secret like we have now nothing

1012
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:35,870
is a secret but so so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is very</font>

1013
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:38,300
important for a concept and you need to

1014
00:33:35,870 --> 00:33:40,159
protect them by law right and you also

1015
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:41,690
need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> say that you know I like this</font>

1016
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:43,070
idea that<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you break a law but the</font>

1017
00:33:41,690 --> 00:33:44,660
trans community<font color="#CCCCCC"> disclose the materials</font>

1018
00:33:43,070 --> 00:33:46,879
are smaller than will disclose its ok

1019
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:48,350
right and yeah people don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> like it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font>

1020
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:50,450
the companies didn't like you know stuff

1021
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:52,790
in the past that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay the other on the</font>

1022
00:33:50,450 --> 00:33:55,550
other hand is when I say that you know

1023
00:33:52,790 --> 00:33:57,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">we want total privacy for the individual</font>

1024
00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:59,899
we want no privacy for companies<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

1025
00:33:57,710 --> 00:34:02,090
governments right so and that's the game

1026
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:04,400
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> game is opening the game is that</font>

1027
00:34:02,090 --> 00:34:06,199
what we want<font color="#CCCCCC"> is to understand what's</font>

1028
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:08,990
going on<font color="#E5E5E5"> right so they public bodies</font>

1029
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:11,929
they should actually be completely open

1030
00:34:08,989 --> 00:34:13,729
and allowed technology allows this for

1031
00:34:11,929 --> 00:34:15,200
that to occur right so let's learn<font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font>

1032
00:34:13,730 --> 00:34:17,719
<font color="#CCCCCC">the music</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> industry that I basically saw</font>

1033
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:19,460
the users as<font color="#E5E5E5"> their the problem is start</font>

1034
00:34:17,719 --> 00:34:20,839
to basically sue everybody right so

1035
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:22,790
let's learn from<font color="#CCCCCC"> those guys right</font>

1036
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:24,860
because I didn't work very well and we

1037
00:34:22,790 --> 00:34:26,840
lost<font color="#E5E5E5"> a decade right so open source is</font>

1038
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:28,940
actually the key for all<font color="#E5E5E5"> this right and</font>

1039
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:31,130
I'm a very firm believer open source but

1040
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:33,350
not as open source software is great but

1041
00:34:31,130 --> 00:34:35,510
the model the values the work folder you

1042
00:34:33,350 --> 00:34:37,100
get with open source right so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way I</font>

1043
00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:39,139
look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> most of the ideas here</font>

1044
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:40,879
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't do this within a very</font>

1045
00:34:39,139 --> 00:34:42,379
strong open<font color="#E5E5E5"> source and creative commons</font>

1046
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:43,668
way you will not work you're actually

1047
00:34:42,379 --> 00:34:45,259
backfires you actually will create a

1048
00:34:43,668 --> 00:34:47,179
commanding control system right which is

1049
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:49,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of where we going now anyway right</font>

1050
00:34:47,179 --> 00:34:50,870
so open source<font color="#E5E5E5"> I provide this Oh ask if</font>

1051
00:34:49,850 --> 00:34:54,500
you guys know it's a great<font color="#E5E5E5"> organization</font>

1052
00:34:50,870 --> 00:34:55,969
on the governance<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of stuff and and</font>

1053
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:57,860
also get is a great part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this because</font>

1054
00:34:55,969 --> 00:34:59,390
it gives you some<font color="#CCCCCC"> work clothes open</font>

1055
00:34:57,860 --> 00:35:01,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">source values again we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talked about this</font>

1056
00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:02,810
they empower the staff these are<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the</font>

1057
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:04,670
stuff you do with open source and it's

1058
00:35:02,810 --> 00:35:06,080
all positive right it's all great stuff

1059
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:08,420
doesn't mean it cuz perfect but it's a

1060
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:09,680
great model oppa so is expensive again

1061
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:11,510
you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to realize</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> company</font>

1062
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:13,310
thats elephant source code what we don't

1063
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:14,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">want is to lock in and of course open</font>

1064
00:35:13,310 --> 00:35:16,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">source code is not free as in beer</font>

1065
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:18,830
there's a cost right the difference<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

1066
00:35:16,970 --> 00:35:21,500
you pay a bit differently and you need

1067
00:35:18,830 --> 00:35:23,210
to pay for<font color="#CCCCCC"> it right because it's a much</font>

1068
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:24,770
broader model right we have a mark of

1069
00:35:23,210 --> 00:35:26,810
melt lemons if you guys know the analogy

1070
00:35:24,770 --> 00:35:28,100
from the cars in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> past right where</font>

1071
00:35:26,810 --> 00:35:30,970
the crude economic model is really work

1072
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:33,110
does<font color="#E5E5E5"> rework companies to create security</font>

1073
00:35:30,970 --> 00:35:34,310
issues so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually need this so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1074
00:35:33,110 --> 00:35:36,680
think open source should be the lingua

1075
00:35:34,310 --> 00:35:39,799
franca for all these stuff because it

1076
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:41,930
actually gives us you know the this

1077
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:44,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">workflow where you know we actually</font>

1078
00:35:41,930 --> 00:35:47,660
communicate using open source right so

1079
00:35:44,839 --> 00:35:49,460
so this guy now now<font color="#CCCCCC"> he</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> comes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> nice</font>

1080
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:50,868
interesting more radical ideas right we

1081
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:52,069
should every code that's written in

1082
00:35:50,869 --> 00:35:53,719
paper government<font color="#E5E5E5"> agents should be</font>

1083
00:35:52,069 --> 00:35:55,579
released an<font color="#CCCCCC"> open-source license there is</font>

1084
00:35:53,719 --> 00:35:57,170
no reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> why sense that we pay as a tax</font>

1085
00:35:55,579 --> 00:35:58,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">payers actually released and the</font>

1086
00:35:57,170 --> 00:36:01,009
proprietary stuff right should all be

1087
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:02,900
open source old documents critter<font color="#E5E5E5"> gavish</font>

1088
00:36:01,009 --> 00:36:04,339
be creative commons right company's

1089
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:06,200
fortunes come should actually publish

1090
00:36:04,339 --> 00:36:07,880
that codes and license and the create

1091
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:09,078
stuff and actually should pay for open

1092
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:11,089
source which actually takes<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1093
00:36:09,079 --> 00:36:12,829
financial model to understand that right

1094
00:36:11,089 --> 00:36:14,269
that that<font color="#CCCCCC"> will create a massive</font>

1095
00:36:12,829 --> 00:36:15,950
difference i will create handles or

1096
00:36:14,269 --> 00:36:17,660
towns of companies just supporting apple

1097
00:36:15,950 --> 00:36:20,149
sauce in<font color="#E5E5E5"> portugal right now this is</font>

1098
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:22,460
quite<font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting right because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we can</font>

1099
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:24,019
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually take this other way and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i was</font>

1100
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:25,400
thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> how do you see this well look</font>

1101
00:36:24,019 --> 00:36:26,718
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> create a fun right you can</font>

1102
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:28,729
create<font color="#E5E5E5"> a venture capital fund in</font>

1103
00:36:26,719 --> 00:36:31,239
portugal that buys the portuguese

1104
00:36:28,729 --> 00:36:35,718
companies that create software oops and

1105
00:36:31,239 --> 00:36:37,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">and basically an open source their code</font>

1106
00:36:35,719 --> 00:36:39,349
right that's totally possible<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

1107
00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:42,529
exists right it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a problem at all</font>

1108
00:36:39,349 --> 00:36:44,089
right you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they can use</font>

1109
00:36:42,529 --> 00:36:45,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">that money to actually figure out how to</font>

1110
00:36:44,089 --> 00:36:47,719
do it<font color="#CCCCCC"> right so they rotated cetera but</font>

1111
00:36:45,769 --> 00:36:50,899
this will this will have a massive

1112
00:36:47,719 --> 00:36:52,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">bottom-line impact on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> portuguese economy</font>

1113
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:53,660
because you have all these software

1114
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:55,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">luton in portuguese that's not freely</font>

1115
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:59,328
available without being locked in by the

1116
00:36:55,430 --> 00:37:01,788
vendors right so so so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> government</font>

1117
00:36:59,329 --> 00:37:05,450
has a big responsibility in this right

1118
00:37:01,789 --> 00:37:06,380
and and basically and the vision<font color="#E5E5E5"> apply</font>

1119
00:37:05,450 --> 00:37:08,239
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> and there's this thing about</font>

1120
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:09,559
<font color="#CCCCCC">commons</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> which I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have time to go</font>

1121
00:37:08,239 --> 00:37:12,829
into but you guys should really definite

1122
00:37:09,559 --> 00:37:15,890
spoil it right and<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically the role of</font>

1123
00:37:12,829 --> 00:37:17,809
the government is basically to to be not

1124
00:37:15,890 --> 00:37:20,779
commanding control benign force right

1125
00:37:17,809 --> 00:37:23,180
and the key thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cody's law right so</font>

1126
00:37:20,779 --> 00:37:24,829
software is made of codes and<font color="#E5E5E5"> celt</font>

1127
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:26,450
controls<font color="#CCCCCC"> Portugal's so Portugal controls</font>

1128
00:37:24,829 --> 00:37:27,619
every love the stuff that we use so

1129
00:37:26,450 --> 00:37:29,779
let's take context take back control

1130
00:37:27,619 --> 00:37:31,249
right so who controls the world well

1131
00:37:29,779 --> 00:37:33,229
it's dominated by these guys right

1132
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:34,939
finance technology networks can flex

1133
00:37:33,229 --> 00:37:36,589
your property we are not any players

1134
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:37,819
there so what we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do is need to</font>

1135
00:37:36,589 --> 00:37:40,549
change the rules of the game right when

1136
00:37:37,819 --> 00:37:43,249
<font color="#E5E5E5">you a player that is fighting or playing</font>

1137
00:37:40,549 --> 00:37:44,660
a game that is not in<font color="#E5E5E5"> your favor then</font>

1138
00:37:43,249 --> 00:37:46,519
the best<font color="#E5E5E5"> way is not to be better than</font>

1139
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:47,839
those guys at that<font color="#E5E5E5"> game the best ways to</font>

1140
00:37:46,519 --> 00:37:49,999
change the rules of the game right which

1141
00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:51,229
we can do<font color="#E5E5E5"> because we have 70 right so if</font>

1142
00:37:49,999 --> 00:37:53,359
you move to open source<font color="#E5E5E5"> files and</font>

1143
00:37:51,229 --> 00:37:54,589
activities then we be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do this</font>

1144
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:55,788
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of stuff so the government's can</font>

1145
00:37:54,589 --> 00:37:57,769
make a difference because<font color="#CCCCCC"> the existing</font>

1146
00:37:55,789 --> 00:37:58,650
service so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know we should</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

1147
00:37:57,769 --> 00:38:00,750
requesting those guy

1148
00:37:58,650 --> 00:38:02,340
to do this and basically are two degrees

1149
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:04,320
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> separation away from people that can</font>

1150
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:06,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually do these things right I also</font>

1151
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:08,550
don't believe on big changes I believe

1152
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:10,740
on interactive and exponential ality

1153
00:38:08,550 --> 00:38:12,030
changes so you start small you build

1154
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:14,069
build build build just like we build

1155
00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:15,570
software now right so again anybody who

1156
00:38:14,070 --> 00:38:18,000
sells a big expensive solution is

1157
00:38:15,570 --> 00:38:20,070
telling a scam right<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's small</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> changes</font>

1158
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,840
start small deploy learn it make changes

1159
00:38:20,070 --> 00:38:23,280
go back to step 2 repeat right that's

1160
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:25,320
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> you build society that's how you</font>

1161
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:26,940
make<font color="#CCCCCC"> changes in fact on the country and</font>

1162
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:28,650
and anything so we should<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a</font>

1163
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:30,410
ministry of code right we should have a

1164
00:38:28,650 --> 00:38:33,180
ministry in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Portugal that cares about</font>

1165
00:38:30,410 --> 00:38:35,310
software right they they everything is

1166
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:36,660
code so<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically you know it's manners</font>

1167
00:38:35,310 --> 00:38:38,279
at high levels within the<font color="#E5E5E5"> government we</font>

1168
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:39,870
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Portuguese CTO and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a sea</font>

1169
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:41,550
so we should have things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like code for</font>

1170
00:38:39,870 --> 00:38:43,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">Portugal which is based on Code for</font>

1171
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:45,240
America which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a really cool idea</font>

1172
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:47,010
grassroots they should manage the

1173
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:48,540
Portuguese hacking servers they will

1174
00:38:47,010 --> 00:38:50,070
commit to only<font color="#E5E5E5"> by Commission in these</font>

1175
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:52,080
applications that have released their

1176
00:38:50,070 --> 00:38:54,330
code open sores<font color="#CCCCCC"> they have the schemas</font>

1177
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:56,250
and our restricted licenses right that's

1178
00:38:54,330 --> 00:38:57,960
what we want right we also it<font color="#CCCCCC"> on then</font>

1179
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:59,490
they manage the bug band stuff which we

1180
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:01,380
could have the clean software act right

1181
00:38:59,490 --> 00:39:03,419
and basically this is basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> one like</font>

1182
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:05,010
the clean air act that we had in the

1183
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:07,680
past that says now we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have</font>

1184
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:09,630
code quality built in<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a requirement</font>

1185
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:11,819
right we did we done this for pollution

1186
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:14,220
we can do the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing for code right</font>

1187
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:15,360
and and again there's a great face that

1188
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:16,649
says it's difficult to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a man to</font>

1189
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:18,720
understand something<font color="#E5E5E5"> where their salary</font>

1190
00:39:16,650 --> 00:39:19,560
depends and then understanding it so yes

1191
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:21,359
there's a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people who</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't like</font>

1192
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:23,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">these ideas but you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know they'll adapt</font>

1193
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:24,180
right so that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not problem right we</font>

1194
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,710
should have the software testing

1195
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:27,720
institute right and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is not stuff</font>

1196
00:39:25,710 --> 00:39:29,700
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> Portugal defer itself we can sell</font>

1197
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:32,279
this these are<font color="#E5E5E5"> billion-dollar markets</font>

1198
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:33,839
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> exist today that we should be key</font>

1199
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:35,280
players on it right we should have

1200
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:36,660
basically measure or visualize the side

1201
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:38,550
effects of code we need to focus on

1202
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:40,440
quality services right we can adopt

1203
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:42,330
testing has a way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to leapfrog these</font>

1204
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:44,010
things right that's easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> to allow</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> us</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1205
00:39:42,330 --> 00:39:45,990
measure this and allowed to create an

1206
00:39:44,010 --> 00:39:47,880
insurance world which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is where you're</font>

1207
00:39:45,990 --> 00:39:49,529
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> next maybe you have a cipher code</font>

1208
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:51,960
right and I know as I has<font color="#E5E5E5"> a really</font>

1209
00:39:49,530 --> 00:39:53,340
really by reputation<font color="#E5E5E5"> Portugal is also a</font>

1210
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:54,960
warning sign right because when

1211
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:57,210
regulation lose the plot which is what

1212
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:58,950
we had in Portugal right you you know we

1213
00:39:57,210 --> 00:40:01,050
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to learn it right you know as I had</font>

1214
00:39:58,950 --> 00:40:02,549
a massive loss of common sense right yes

1215
00:40:01,050 --> 00:40:03,540
they're secure and there's things

1216
00:40:02,550 --> 00:40:05,550
they've been doing for tradition

1217
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:07,410
generations that maybe it's okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep</font>

1218
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:08,490
doing it like that right but<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

1219
00:40:07,410 --> 00:40:10,649
happens when you get too<font color="#E5E5E5"> much regulation</font>

1220
00:40:08,490 --> 00:40:12,330
does understand on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bottom line which</font>

1221
00:40:10,650 --> 00:40:14,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">is to make empowerment good</font>

1222
00:40:12,330 --> 00:40:16,620
behavior common sense right that's what

1223
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:18,390
we want right so I know we<font color="#CCCCCC"> need a</font>

1224
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:20,490
Portugal wide bug bounty where

1225
00:40:18,390 --> 00:40:22,049
everything is hackable right and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get</font>

1226
00:40:20,490 --> 00:40:23,339
paid for it right and there's bug

1227
00:40:22,050 --> 00:40:24,900
bounties everywhere the pending has<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1228
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:26,400
bug bounty where is it I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to</font>

1229
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:28,020
find a bug bounty for Portuguese company

1230
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:30,000
I couldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> find one I'm probably there</font>

1231
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:31,710
is one but they're not<font color="#CCCCCC"> really that well</font>

1232
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,780
known that just shows you right and

1233
00:40:31,710 --> 00:40:35,670
again you crowdsource<font color="#E5E5E5"> a solution and</font>

1234
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:38,130
leave it like that insurance it's a

1235
00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:39,840
massive industry right this is one of

1236
00:40:38,130 --> 00:40:41,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">the keys to upset because insurance</font>

1237
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:44,250
wants data we could be creating that

1238
00:40:41,970 --> 00:40:46,290
data our Institute of quality<font color="#CCCCCC"> institute</font>

1239
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:48,510
of software testing they generate data

1240
00:40:46,290 --> 00:40:49,710
the insurance guys will consume and then

1241
00:40:48,510 --> 00:40:52,020
as long as we publish all these things

1242
00:40:49,710 --> 00:40:53,910
the model actually will work quite

1243
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:55,590
nicely right<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then come easily side</font>

1244
00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:56,850
to running secure code that's fine then

1245
00:40:55,590 --> 00:40:58,800
the insurance is a good metrics the

1246
00:40:56,850 --> 00:41:01,230
matter right so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite good right</font>

1247
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:03,510
now do the nuclear bomb here is we can

1248
00:41:01,230 --> 00:41:05,130
also nationalize code right you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

1249
00:41:03,510 --> 00:41:06,900
basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know sir</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> companies</font>

1250
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:08,700
critical for<font color="#CCCCCC"> Portugal and they don't</font>

1251
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:10,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">want to disclose the code guess what if</font>

1252
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:11,759
they want<font color="#CCCCCC"> operating Portugal we can</font>

1253
00:41:10,350 --> 00:41:12,900
nationalize it right yes it's the

1254
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:15,780
nuclear option but it should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be on the</font>

1255
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:17,820
table<font color="#CCCCCC"> right we cannot have black magic</font>

1256
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:20,400
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> running in our stuff right</font>

1257
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:21,540
everything right our data it<font color="#CCCCCC"> has to be</font>

1258
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:23,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">everything basically I look at</font>

1259
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:25,320
everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> that touches Portuguese data</font>

1260
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:27,660
and Portuguese networks and Portuguese

1261
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:29,280
lives has to be public p reviewable

1262
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:33,180
compile of about independent sources

1263
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:35,340
right and and<font color="#E5E5E5"> signs and basically</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

1264
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:36,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not just websites but I OT devices</font>

1265
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:38,610
network devices microchips for

1266
00:41:36,630 --> 00:41:40,320
everything right this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we want to</font>

1267
00:41:38,610 --> 00:41:41,880
do right and it's important to

1268
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:44,010
understand<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a red line that</font>

1269
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:46,560
sometimes we cross for certain companies

1270
00:41:44,010 --> 00:41:48,510
because the stick that the stakes of the

1271
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:50,190
game<font color="#E5E5E5"> I got high again European unity is</font>

1272
00:41:48,510 --> 00:41:52,050
great I'm a strong believer in Europe I

1273
00:41:50,190 --> 00:41:53,790
love Europe right but Europe needs a

1274
00:41:52,050 --> 00:41:55,140
reset right at the moment I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> again</font>

1275
00:41:53,790 --> 00:41:57,090
Portugal has a good experience of that

1276
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:58,890
right and we should have to beg to

1277
00:41:57,090 --> 00:42:00,780
Europe to fund<font color="#CCCCCC"> these stuff right I want</font>

1278
00:41:58,890 --> 00:42:02,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">either to sponsor this to be involved</font>

1279
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:04,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">because they want to because porch was</font>

1280
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:05,730
the best place in the world to do this

1281
00:42:04,110 --> 00:42:07,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of stuff we want to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> positive not</font>

1282
00:42:05,730 --> 00:42:10,050
like oh you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> just draw me some bones</font>

1283
00:42:07,710 --> 00:42:12,240
here right because that is a scale right

1284
00:42:10,050 --> 00:42:13,560
I need not in the power position to

1285
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:15,779
negotiate which what you really want

1286
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:17,279
right so that's what Europe you should

1287
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:18,540
be about collaborative Commons global

1288
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:21,750
village right this is the kind of stuff

1289
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:22,890
that we really want from to see right so

1290
00:42:21,750 --> 00:42:24,450
we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> even create new currency all</font>

1291
00:42:22,890 --> 00:42:26,009
right hey you know people<font color="#E5E5E5"> come play by</font>

1292
00:42:24,450 --> 00:42:27,540
the arrows say sucks is bad for

1293
00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:29,430
so near right there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> nothing wrong with</font>

1294
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:31,020
not now we don't have the generation but

1295
00:42:29,430 --> 00:42:32,310
you know give a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of years with</font>

1296
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:33,960
blockchain technology<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't shoot you</font>

1297
00:42:32,310 --> 00:42:36,000
guys involving that it's really powerful

1298
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:37,950
right you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> explore all these business</font>

1299
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,910
models right this is reality right of

1300
00:42:37,950 --> 00:42:40,830
course<font color="#E5E5E5"> you make your honey percent</font>

1301
00:42:38,910 --> 00:42:42,089
compatible<font color="#E5E5E5"> here and then you know and</font>

1302
00:42:40,830 --> 00:42:43,860
that could be created by make sure make

1303
00:42:42,090 --> 00:42:45,510
some hackers right there you go so why

1304
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:46,920
does<font color="#E5E5E5"> right so you might</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think why</font>

1305
00:42:45,510 --> 00:42:48,540
Portugal why<font color="#CCCCCC"> do you do this easy</font>

1306
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:51,120
Portugal because ironically is actually

1307
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:53,100
easy here right like the drug stuff it's

1308
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:54,870
easier to do this in smaller country

1309
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:56,310
because there's less agendas there's big

1310
00:42:54,870 --> 00:42:57,299
lobbies you'll be ignored for a while

1311
00:42:56,310 --> 00:42:59,640
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is great because you can actually</font>

1312
00:42:57,300 --> 00:43:01,170
make you work right generate momentum we

1313
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:03,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">have the power</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's right on our hands</font>

1314
00:43:01,170 --> 00:43:05,460
right so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not you don't have to</font>

1315
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:06,930
ask permission you guys already know

1316
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:08,580
people that can make this<font color="#CCCCCC"> happen right</font>

1317
00:43:06,930 --> 00:43:10,379
and by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way this is what i can say</font>

1318
00:43:08,580 --> 00:43:11,670
look I would love<font color="#CCCCCC"> to live in Portugal</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1319
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:13,890
would love to come back to Portugal<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

1320
00:43:11,670 --> 00:43:15,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">fortunately</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i don't but this is a world</font>

1321
00:43:13,890 --> 00:43:17,879
I want to live in right but<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually you</font>

1322
00:43:15,990 --> 00:43:20,970
also need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to fight for these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

1323
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:22,590
right there you go so we need to raise

1324
00:43:20,970 --> 00:43:24,359
<font color="#CCCCCC">the bar discussion is very dangerous the</font>

1325
00:43:22,590 --> 00:43:25,470
moment the debate we have now and we

1326
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:27,660
have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very strong sense of ethics</font>

1327
00:43:25,470 --> 00:43:29,040
engineering a bill to solve problems<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

1328
00:43:27,660 --> 00:43:30,180
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> learned the hard way was to be the</font>

1329
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:31,440
junior player right so there you go

1330
00:43:30,180 --> 00:43:33,359
where<font color="#E5E5E5"> you hit the rock bottom right so</font>

1331
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:35,430
hey the only<font color="#E5E5E5"> ways up so you might as</font>

1332
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:36,840
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> do this race so we have some big</font>

1333
00:43:35,430 --> 00:43:38,520
questions there's no perfect solutions

1334
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:39,900
on this right not all my ideas are

1335
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:41,910
perfect right but at least i think they

1336
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:43,890
step in right direction right and again

1337
00:43:41,910 --> 00:43:46,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">i found this thing what's portugal it</font>

1338
00:43:43,890 --> 00:43:47,970
says we are great at graduating from

1339
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:49,800
high school all right that's quite call

1340
00:43:47,970 --> 00:43:51,089
rides better than<font color="#CCCCCC"> quark actually try to</font>

1341
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:52,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">be like something like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> core cousins like</font>

1342
00:43:51,090 --> 00:43:54,600
that right what per se is not the right

1343
00:43:52,620 --> 00:43:56,009
but at least right we can do better

1344
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:57,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">right it should be craftsmanship</font>

1345
00:43:56,010 --> 00:43:59,070
software cybersecurity secure coding

1346
00:43:57,900 --> 00:44:00,810
right that's what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to see there</font>

1347
00:43:59,070 --> 00:44:03,630
right we want to be the best at that

1348
00:44:00,810 --> 00:44:05,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">stuff right so it's our turn to fight</font>

1349
00:44:03,630 --> 00:44:07,200
for these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things enough</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our parents</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

1350
00:44:05,730 --> 00:44:08,550
fasting races and pension or my rights

1351
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:10,710
all that stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> rock and roll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

1352
00:44:08,550 --> 00:44:12,570
including<font color="#E5E5E5"> that kind of things right it's</font>

1353
00:44:10,710 --> 00:44:14,850
our turn to do this to balance the power

1354
00:44:12,570 --> 00:44:16,800
is felt to be we adjust these things and

1355
00:44:14,850 --> 00:44:18,390
basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> if the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> power is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on who</font>

1356
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:20,970
controls a network it's time to<font color="#CCCCCC"> change</font>

1357
00:44:18,390 --> 00:44:22,290
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so we have and also another</font>

1358
00:44:20,970 --> 00:44:24,000
little thing is we should<font color="#E5E5E5"> export</font>

1359
00:44:22,290 --> 00:44:25,200
engineers to form them there's a whole

1360
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,760
bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of slides are you putting here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

1361
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:28,620
education you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> see on the website I</font>

1362
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:31,050
think that's key we should be<font color="#CCCCCC"> creating</font>

1363
00:44:28,620 --> 00:44:32,370
this whole generations of professionals

1364
00:44:31,050 --> 00:44:34,200
and then send them<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the world because</font>

1365
00:44:32,370 --> 00:44:36,660
they bring Portugal with them in their

1366
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:38,970
hearts while you don't you can't

1367
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:39,480
experience how amazing it was to be in

1368
00:44:38,970 --> 00:44:40,919
England

1369
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:42,420
português win the<font color="#E5E5E5"> World Cup so the</font>

1370
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:43,530
European Cup right it's amazing<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

1371
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:45,300
the parties<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they were there they</font>

1372
00:44:43,530 --> 00:44:48,690
were fantastic right it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> nice</font>

1373
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:50,010
nobody really<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know little leaves</font>

1374
00:44:48,690 --> 00:44:52,050
Portugal right so there are ambassadors

1375
00:44:50,010 --> 00:44:54,030
their clients they connect to Portugal

1376
00:44:52,050 --> 00:44:55,530
and they're an asset to us right so so

1377
00:44:54,030 --> 00:44:57,119
again and they'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> come back one day and</font>

1378
00:44:55,530 --> 00:44:58,830
share what<font color="#E5E5E5"> they've learned they bring</font>

1379
00:44:57,119 --> 00:45:01,320
ideas they bring stuff so again this is

1380
00:44:58,830 --> 00:45:03,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">very key right so our duty to protect</font>

1381
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:05,250
the internet the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet is one of the</font>

1382
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:07,050
biggest right assets<font color="#E5E5E5"> it gives to</font>

1383
00:45:05,250 --> 00:45:10,109
humanity the first generation made it

1384
00:45:07,050 --> 00:45:12,210
free and open right under the success of

1385
00:45:10,109 --> 00:45:14,040
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually a testament to</font>

1386
00:45:12,210 --> 00:45:15,600
those decisions now at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> time for our</font>

1387
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:17,250
generation to do the same thing we need

1388
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:18,480
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> realign the internet or else the</font>

1391
00:45:19,290 --> 00:45:22,590
commanding control it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to be</font>

1392
00:45:20,850 --> 00:45:25,230
open<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's not only</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> free and it's going</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">to be a much poorer in the lot of ways</font>

1394
00:45:25,230 --> 00:45:30,720
society right so so he's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> final</font>

1395
00:45:28,830 --> 00:45:32,520
concept right so what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the future for</font>

1396
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:35,368
Portugal I'll be a garden for Europe

1397
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:37,290
right are we a small pond on a<font color="#E5E5E5"> global</font>

1398
00:45:35,369 --> 00:45:38,820
force our control the world or I'm going

1399
00:45:37,290 --> 00:45:40,590
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> work with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all other person</font>

1400
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:42,300
portuguese-speaking<font color="#CCCCCC"> countries and are</font>

1401
00:45:40,590 --> 00:45:44,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to be a powerhouse that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> aspires</font>

1402
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:47,220
and leads the world in technology<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

1403
00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:49,050
so let's sail the codes right and let's

1404
00:45:47,220 --> 00:45:50,939
use code to create generation of work

1405
00:45:49,050 --> 00:45:53,850
ethics that's great new<font color="#E5E5E5"> reality so the</font>

same way that we want navigated right to

1407
00:45:53,850 --> 00:46:00,270
see we should<font color="#CCCCCC"> now do the same thing for</font>

1408
00:45:56,190 --> 00:46:02,420
digital code right and that's it thank

<font color="#CCCCCC">one of those things where you see I do</font>

1416
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:39,300
that's wrong right see it's wrong to

1417
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:41,970
think that you need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be in power to do</font>

1418
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:44,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things right I think that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

1419
00:46:41,970 --> 00:46:45,600
important is that the idea that only if

1420
00:46:44,250 --> 00:46:47,460
you in a position of power<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font>

1421
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:49,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually do things it's very wrong</font>

1422
00:46:47,460 --> 00:46:51,270
because what happens is the current

1423
00:46:49,260 --> 00:46:53,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">model and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> seen recently is so</font>

1424
00:46:51,270 --> 00:46:55,800
screwed that by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the time you get to</font>

1425
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:57,569
power you lost so many values you lost

1426
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:58,590
so many ideas that you then have the

1427
00:46:57,570 --> 00:47:00,780
power we don't know what to do with it

1428
00:46:58,590 --> 00:47:02,580
right and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> found these in companies</font>

1429
00:47:00,780 --> 00:47:04,200
right I found<font color="#E5E5E5"> out the best place to be</font>

1430
00:47:02,580 --> 00:47:05,549
the company is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the top is that</font>

1431
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:07,350
the place where<font color="#E5E5E5"> you respect it is that</font>

1432
00:47:05,550 --> 00:47:09,600
the place where<font color="#E5E5E5"> your opinion counts but</font>

1433
00:47:07,350 --> 00:47:15,060
you have the independence to say this is

1434
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:25,890
what I want to do right so I cool any

1435
00:47:15,060 --> 00:47:28,410
other comments questions I think you

1436
00:47:25,890 --> 00:47:30,629
should delete the way the way you drive

1437
00:47:28,410 --> 00:47:34,470
change is you<font color="#CCCCCC"> believe on it and you act</font>

1438
00:47:30,630 --> 00:47:36,510
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> it rather the others will do right</font>

1439
00:47:34,470 --> 00:47:38,669
and and you find<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the sphere of your</font>

1440
00:47:36,510 --> 00:47:41,160
influence is way bigger then you believe

1441
00:47:38,670 --> 00:47:42,090
so it's I think those great concept i

1442
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:43,620
said it's like waiting for<font color="#E5E5E5"> superman</font>

1443
00:47:42,090 --> 00:47:45,150
right same thing if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> wait for</font>

1444
00:47:43,620 --> 00:47:46,500
somebody else to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make a decision all</font>

1445
00:47:45,150 --> 00:47:48,570
you're doing is delegating a

1446
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:50,880
responsibility<font color="#E5E5E5"> he's saying oh well</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

1447
00:47:48,570 --> 00:47:54,000
do because<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> guy didn't approve it</font>

1448
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:56,460
well dag i didn't get it right<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that's</font>

1449
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:58,260
why it's wrong to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do big changes so the</font>

1450
00:47:56,460 --> 00:48:00,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you do big change</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the society is</font>

1451
00:47:58,260 --> 00:48:03,150
exponentially if you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at gift as a</font>

1452
00:48:00,570 --> 00:48:05,130
technology he grew exponentially not

1453
00:48:03,150 --> 00:48:07,140
because linna's could have done this and

1454
00:48:05,130 --> 00:48:10,050
he has enough power and said I've

1455
00:48:07,140 --> 00:48:11,609
developed his best you know thing source

1456
00:48:10,050 --> 00:48:14,040
control in the world everybody should

1457
00:48:11,610 --> 00:48:15,960
use<font color="#CCCCCC"> it he said hey I use this those</font>

1458
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:17,880
things suck this is great if you guys

1459
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:19,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">like it you should use it right and he</font>

1460
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:20,700
developed her that work for him so I

1461
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:22,680
think it's

1462
00:48:20,700 --> 00:48:24,899
again is a mistake to think that you

1463
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:27,299
need permission to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things right</font>

1464
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:28,859
because remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> like one day you will</font>

1465
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:30,660
be in this position of power right<font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font>

1466
00:48:28,859 --> 00:48:32,759
you ready to know somebody who that does

1467
00:48:30,660 --> 00:48:36,029
this so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> question is whether</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1468
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:37,410
believe it<font color="#CCCCCC"> or not right so I'm just</font>

1469
00:48:36,030 --> 00:48:39,599
showing you some interesting realities

1470
00:48:37,410 --> 00:48:42,779
right of ideas<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we can do and</font>

1471
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:44,970
hopefully<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know some of you guys will</font>

1472
00:48:42,780 --> 00:48:47,190
will take this on board and we can do

1473
00:48:44,970 --> 00:48:48,899
the conversation or listing happens and

1474
00:48:47,190 --> 00:48:50,460
now come<font color="#CCCCCC"> back three years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from now and</font>

1475
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:52,740
do a variation of this right and say hey

1476
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:55,170
guess what<font color="#E5E5E5"> the problem is worse right</font>

1477
00:48:52,740 --> 00:48:58,229
Hank maybe now you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the subtraction</font>

1478
00:48:55,170 --> 00:48:59,700
so they give my contribution so I

1479
00:48:58,230 --> 00:49:01,490
finally<font color="#CCCCCC"> feel like I've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there with could</font>

1480
00:48:59,700 --> 00:49:03,930
contribute something to my country

1481
00:49:01,490 --> 00:49:08,029
hopefully a little bit but good nice

1482
00:49:03,930 --> 00:49:08,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">step alright cool thanks guys</font>
