vulnerabilities that i found

65
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:50,850
particularly in two programs<font color="#CCCCCC"> ecker one</font>

66
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:53,760
in and in cobalt where to start

67
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:57,720
searching both in private programs and

68
00:03:53,760 --> 00:04:00,870
public programs bug bounty<font color="#CCCCCC"> verses are</font>

69
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:03,269
not security companies and in the end if

70
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:06,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">you have any questions you can ask me</font>

71

anything or come<font color="#CCCCCC"> to me and we talked a</font>

72
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:14,869
little so what's bug bounty quite simple

73
00:04:10,829 --> 00:04:19,190
right you find a bug you receive money

74
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:23,310
that's it<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can we talk about</font>

75
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:26,830

76
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:28,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">when you get some good money</font>

79
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:36,758
communication between the two<font color="#E5E5E5"> parties</font>

company itself the clients right so just

82
00:04:42,669 --> 00:04:50,430
to give you a small example I gave the

83
00:04:46,689 --> 00:04:52,870
example of Hoover because over as a nice

84
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:55,509
interaction with Portuguese guys because

85
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:59,110
integrity made an excellent work finding

86
00:04:55,509 --> 00:05:02,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">a security sheet there I already found</font>

87
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:05,680
one issue also but integrity<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok they</font>

88
00:05:02,349 --> 00:05:07,599
want lots of money so i think it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok</font>

89
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,400

90
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:11,789
report it on<font color="#CCCCCC"> ecker one which is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

will tell you<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok it's it's a duplicate</font>

94
00:05:18,669 --> 00:05:26,469
it's a valid one ok if it's sort of

95
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,900
scope you lose reputation something like

96
00:05:26,469 --> 00:05:31,919
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so in the end if everything goes</font>

97
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:37,060
well which went well to integrity right

98
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:40,930

104
00:05:56,589 --> 00:06:03,460
the world<font color="#E5E5E5"> i was a client and I decided</font>

105
00:05:59,889 --> 00:06:07,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">ok let's try to contact him and and try</font>

106
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:10,089
to to manage the the bug itself it was a

107
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:12,580
serious risk and they told me<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there</font>

108
00:06:10,089 --> 00:06:17,349
were a program that they were working

109
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:20,620
with that were mediating the security

110
00:06:17,349 --> 00:06:24,878
issues there so it was crowd curity

111
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:29,229
which is now cobalt so why was invited

112
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:32,860
to that program and started finding more

113
00:06:29,229 --> 00:06:35,889
issues or and when<font color="#CCCCCC"> I got many more</font>

114
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:38,440
reputation<font color="#CCCCCC"> I I was climbing the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> leather</font>

115
00:06:35,889 --> 00:06:40,740
and getting more invitations to the two

116
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:43,319
other programs and six months<font color="#CCCCCC"> later</font>

117
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:46,830
is with some effort I was number<font color="#E5E5E5"> one in</font>

118
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:52,770
cobalt rank this is the rank at the time

119
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:56,340
I think it changed a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

120
00:06:52,770 --> 00:07:00,150
in the current time is this I remained

121
00:06:56,340 --> 00:07:05,520
on the top but I think roupen is now

122
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:08,219
number two but and I already<font color="#E5E5E5"> have some I</font>

123
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:10,318
think more points i don't hear this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">to all of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fame which it's some type of</font>

125
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:15,090
game so you get encouraged<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find more</font>

126
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:18,060
more bugs not only for from money but

127
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:22,198
<font color="#CCCCCC">also for the reputation and and also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

130
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:32,130
important to to to join other programs

131
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:36,180

132

sorry it's a acceptable risk aight aight

147
00:08:28,259 --> 00:08:34,409
i try to mediate with background and

148
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:37,890
they helped me a lot but sometimes it

149
00:08:34,409 --> 00:08:39,870
doesn't doesn't the communication

150
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:43,020
between<font color="#E5E5E5"> the program was very bad</font>

151
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:45,750
experience for me and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i stopped</font>

152
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:48,149
working for<font color="#CCCCCC"> background and also it's</font>

153
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:50,610
very awkward security and mobile apps

154
00:08:48,149 --> 00:08:55,200
applications so it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> strong point</font>

155
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:57,090
so that was the start of my my lose

from private programs and it was pretty

159
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:09,290
cool because i think in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the name of in</font>

180
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:27,449
future for trousers or other type of

181
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:29,969
clothes because it's important I don't

182

188
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:55,319
I did it needs to be mine so I always

189
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:57,660
follow since I was a kid I was a

190
00:10:55,320 --> 00:11:01,350
self-taught it guy and read a lot of

191
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:04,250
books and with with that in mind I

192
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:07,260
always try to accomplish my goals and

193
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:08,819
I'm not the full time but bounty hunter

194
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:10,410

where others usually don't search that's

202

very<font color="#E5E5E5"> important</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's so and Etienne to</font>

test some bug bounty program so most

290
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:12,220
common vulnerabilities I gathering some

291
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:16,420
information about my valid reports more

292
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:17,860
than 500 and I it's only based on cobalt

293
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:23,170
in my<font color="#E5E5E5"> Quran because there are the</font>

294
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:27,370
programs that I work more often so this

295
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:32,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">is in cobalt sorry if my charts are not</font>

296
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:34,959
so cool as binary edge but I did<font color="#E5E5E5"> online</font>

297
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:39,310
I'm not very very comfortable<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing it</font>

298
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:40,810
but I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be specific that reflected</font>

299
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:43,390
file download was the most popular

300
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:47,109
vulnerability that I found very closely

301
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:50,740
to cross-site scripting on on the cobalt

302
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:52,810
platform it's incredible<font color="#CCCCCC"> because it's</font>

303
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:59,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">very different from the next chart from</font>

304
00:16:52,810 --> 00:17:02,760
maker one this is was by zine to 220

305
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:05,709
reports value reports I don't know but

306
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:07,599
it was pretty close because reflective

307
00:17:05,709 --> 00:17:10,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">and one of these one of my favorite</font>

308
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:16,599
vulnerabilities is not very well known

309
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:20,980
and I think most web modern applications

310
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:23,379
of these vulnerability on there so this

311
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:25,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">is from cobalt occur one completely</font>

312
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:28,000
different cross-site scripting of course

313
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:31,300
because it is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first thing that you</font>

314
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:34,120
try when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have for example a private</font>

315
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:36,570
program on<font color="#CCCCCC"> a cur one the first thing</font>

316
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:40,689
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you try is cross-site scripting</font>

317
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:44,530
this is i can divide these these fifty

318
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:47,020
percent on reflective and store the

319
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:53,139
the only reason is that reflective pays

320
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:57,430
like sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1k at max and stark and</font>

321
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:59,920
heat can get you sometimes on 5k so it's

322
00:17:57,430 --> 00:18:02,380
it's important to know that type of

323
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:04,300
information I<font color="#CCCCCC"> found some idols in</font>

324
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:08,560
Jackson template injection nowadays is

325
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:11,770
very common I love Jason issues API and

326
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:19,960
stuff like that bad practice is becoming

327
00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:27,790
more often well they pay so oh I'm going

328
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:34,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">backwards no sorry about that click the</font>

329
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:39,210
Run button come on<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay where it starts</font>

330
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:39,210
searching<font color="#E5E5E5"> and getting in this case coins</font>

331
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:45,310
on private programs of course crud<font color="#E5E5E5"> site</font>

332
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:47,230
scripting because why they are most

333
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:48,460
common you go to the most common

334
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:54,850
vulnerabilities that you find so

335
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:59,050
cross-site scripting cross<font color="#E5E5E5"> cross e a or</font>

336
00:18:54,850 --> 00:19:02,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">xxe is one of most interesting stuff</font>

337
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:06,280
right now and it's one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the things</font>

338
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:08,560
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I try very next to the cross site</font>

339
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:10,620
scripting I<font color="#E5E5E5"> always try to do the the</font>

340
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:14,409
both of them at the same time sometimes

341
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:19,179
RC Robin comment execution also very

342
00:19:14,410 --> 00:19:21,880
important you can find still lots of

343
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:24,790
imagemagick vulnerabilities there so

344
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:27,310
it's important check vulnerabilities in

345
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:31,570
subdomains that's important also i will

346
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:35,679
give you some some tools to to<font color="#E5E5E5"> check the</font>

347
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:39,700
the subdomains and best practices<font color="#CCCCCC"> i will</font>

348
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:41,500
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about cross xxe cross-site</font>

349
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:43,000
scripting it's it's a waste of<font color="#CCCCCC"> time</font>

350
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:46,560
talking here because most of you guys

351
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:50,230
already know that and our see also so

352
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:53,560
private programs<font color="#CCCCCC"> xxc well if you get to</font>

353
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:56,650
request that parse<font color="#CCCCCC"> XML and that is the</font>

354
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:58,269
law then DTD I'm going faster because I

355
00:19:56,650 --> 00:20:00,509
assume<font color="#CCCCCC"> that most people</font>

356
00:19:58,269 --> 00:20:03,669
I understand what I'm talking about so

357
00:20:00,509 --> 00:20:07,919
it's besides so<font color="#E5E5E5"> xml configured to</font>

358
00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:10,299
process the info and i will show you a

359
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:13,119
real example that i found on week you

360
00:20:10,299 --> 00:20:17,168
<font color="#E5E5E5">lock</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know if any of you knows</font>

361
00:20:13,119 --> 00:20:21,449
Mickey lock well it's a place where you

362
00:20:17,169 --> 00:20:26,409
can upload or download the GPS GPX file

363
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:29,499
and go for<font color="#E5E5E5"> walco cycling or something</font>

364
00:20:26,409 --> 00:20:32,859
like that so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I download with the GPX</font>

365
00:20:29,499 --> 00:20:37,179
file from o'clock i modified<font color="#CCCCCC"> it ggp x</font>

366
00:20:32,859 --> 00:20:41,799
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a xml so it has</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> coordinates so</font>

367
00:20:37,179 --> 00:20:44,799
I just treat<font color="#E5E5E5"> tweak it a little with the</font>

368
00:20:41,799 --> 00:20:48,399
entity together the file issue on the

369
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:52,389
linux server and requested the system to

370
00:20:48,399 --> 00:20:55,299
go to my website david super calm and

371
00:20:52,389 --> 00:20:59,379
grab the DTD from my server then you get

372
00:20:55,299 --> 00:21:07,749
<font color="#CCCCCC">request by the same name which is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

373
00:20:59,379 --> 00:21:10,899
amplified so the the importance<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

374
00:21:07,749 --> 00:21:15,909
important thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do is that when i</font>

375
00:21:10,899 --> 00:21:18,189
sent these GPS GPX file i got a

376
00:21:15,909 --> 00:21:21,029
interesting information went on my

377
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:26,409
server especially on my web server log

378
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:30,159
it returned the version or the file host

379
00:21:26,409 --> 00:21:34,149
which was this is my web server<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok the</font>

380
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:36,940
p-type is not this one anymore so in

381
00:21:34,149 --> 00:21:39,579
return on the request debian<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok it's the</font>

382
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:41,950
content of the exit file and it also

383
00:21:39,579 --> 00:21:45,099
tell me<font color="#CCCCCC"> the user agent or say they are</font>

384
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:49,329
using java so when i upload my modified

385
00:21:45,099 --> 00:21:52,089
GPX file i got an interesting stuff with

386
00:21:49,329 --> 00:21:54,219
these we can get drop a shell control

387
00:21:52,089 --> 00:21:57,158
everything on the server we can do

388
00:21:54,219 --> 00:22:01,299
whatever and they were pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> nice they</font>

389
00:21:57,159 --> 00:22:04,839
offered me a t-shirt they<font color="#E5E5E5"> always offer</font>

390
00:22:01,299 --> 00:22:07,149
t-shirts and for sure the two sides

391
00:22:04,839 --> 00:22:10,749
chain reaction III don't know if<font color="#E5E5E5"> i can</font>

392
00:22:07,149 --> 00:22:12,050
say it but so i can buy some some stuff

393
00:22:10,749 --> 00:22:14,450
some cycling stuff

394
00:22:12,050 --> 00:22:16,909
which which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I love it because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

395
00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:20,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">enough</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the stuff</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I do is cycling so</font>

396
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:22,670
very very cool subdomains<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have some</font>

397
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:25,400
open source tools here that i use

398
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:28,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">subleaser sub root and the arvest ER</font>

399
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:32,270
some of you may know<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's some of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

400
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:36,110
not and there are pretty easy to use to

401
00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:39,410
use they are all terminal so you can go

402
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:42,169
so blister and but the domain and they

403
00:22:39,410 --> 00:22:45,830
gather all the subdomains using reverse

404
00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:47,450
IP they<font color="#CCCCCC"> use google darking and stuff</font>

405
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:49,310
like that they are very very interesting

406
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:53,870
there are buster is a tool that's even

407
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:55,879
arvest for user accounts emails that<font color="#E5E5E5"> he</font>

408
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:58,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">founds on google darking linkedin</font>

409
00:22:55,880 --> 00:23:00,200
accounts for for the guys<font color="#CCCCCC"> that work on</font>

410
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:05,780
that company so it's an awesome tool

411
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:07,700
also it's very interesting again on

412
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:09,889
private programs after you check

413
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:11,930
vulnerabilities and subdomains let's

414
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:14,660
check for<font color="#CCCCCC"> wordpress installations</font>

415
00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:17,810
because especially on over that's a lot

416
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:20,090
of money you can use double biscayne<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

417
00:23:17,810 --> 00:23:22,970
think it's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> best wordpress scanner</font>

418
00:23:20,090 --> 00:23:27,169
tool that that nowadays it's available

419
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:29,650
to the public so run WP scan and try to

420
00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:32,300
find<font color="#E5E5E5"> something interesting plugins or</font>

421
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:34,790
anything like that check for files and

422
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:39,139
directories do<font color="#CCCCCC"> Buster</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and your search</font>

423
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:41,530
are very very very good one of the

424
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:47,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">things that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I already found and</font>

425
00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:50,030
sometimes developers like to to to well

426
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:52,490
to leave some files on the root server

427
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:55,420
on the accessible to the public that are

428
00:23:52,490 --> 00:24:00,470
interesting for example I found already

429
00:23:55,420 --> 00:24:04,010
database like SQL dot back okay all the

430
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:06,770
database was a backup file so PHP info

431
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:10,040
is very common to find so you get the

432
00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:13,400
information from the PHP and<font color="#E5E5E5"> pair</font>

433
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:19,040
disclosures and stuff like that also<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

434
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:22,250
had some<font color="#CCCCCC"> information regarding banking</font>

436
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:27,740
called one

<font color="#CCCCCC">odds old dogs back he found and I saw</font>

438
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:32,690
some transactions there and I was like

439
00:24:29,630 --> 00:24:35,750
okay let's let's let's into the program

440
00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:38,750
to see if<font color="#E5E5E5"> if it pays and yeah it pays so</font>

441
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:41,870
and finally<font color="#E5E5E5"> bill burp it's my favorite</font>

442
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:44,120
tool my proxy<font color="#CCCCCC"> to burp so you can do</font>

443
00:24:41,870 --> 00:24:47,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">everything even check for files using</font>

444
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:54,250
burp you can do wordpress scanning with

445
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:57,920
burp best practices you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> earn some</font>

446
00:24:54,250 --> 00:25:01,220
not not not a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of money</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but some of</font>

447
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:03,080
it tokens validation sensitive

448
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:06,530
information side cookies<font color="#CCCCCC"> yes sometimes</font>

449
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:09,070
cookies are encoded in base64 and as

450
00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:11,840
useful information I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know why</font>

451
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:15,800
password strength yeah this is one thing

452
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:18,649
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i found a lots of times</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> when on web</font>

453
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:20,480
applications and most of fitting in big

454
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:26,000
companies that allow you to<font color="#CCCCCC"> use the</font>

455
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:29,540
password one if anyone allows a brute

456
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:32,270
forcing attack please<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay one isn't</font>

457
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:37,070
even the most common i think is 1234 so

458
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:40,610
it allows to be to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be used so companies</font>

459
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:44,540
need to fix it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's also one of the</font>

460
00:25:40,610 --> 00:25:47,810
things that are illegible 222 boundary

461
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:49,639
reward username enumeration also using

462
00:25:47,810 --> 00:25:51,560
the result bass word or something like

463
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:56,600
that and several information disclosure

464
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:59,360
usually on others and<font color="#CCCCCC"> again i'm going</font>

465
00:25:56,600 --> 00:26:01,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">backwards public programs okay this this</font>

466
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:05,389
is the art part because public programs

467
00:26:01,370 --> 00:26:07,760
are that there that are androids or even

468
00:26:05,390 --> 00:26:10,790
millions of guys trying to to act web

469
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:13,700
application where<font color="#CCCCCC"> you try to also get</font>

470
00:26:10,790 --> 00:26:15,740
some so what I try reflective found on

471
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:21,920
wall because it's one of my babies I

472
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:24,380
love this and also business logic flaws

473
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:28,940
very interesting this is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> very common</font>

474
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:32,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm still studying it and it might be</font>

475
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:36,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the future bounty rewards that</font>

476
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:37,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">gain lots of money might be business</font>

477
00:26:36,050 --> 00:26:39,830
logic false and I will<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about</font>

478
00:26:37,850 --> 00:26:42,649
later mobile security issues of course

479
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:44,750
nobody especially me i don't understand

480
00:26:42,650 --> 00:26:48,500
really the mobile security issues so

481
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:50,450
what I usually do is just try to find

482
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:53,179
the endpoints on the application and try

483
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:55,610
to get an API and gather from that

484
00:26:53,179 --> 00:26:58,429
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have no knowledge on on on</font>

485
00:26:55,610 --> 00:27:01,520
mobile application CSV injection

486
00:26:58,429 --> 00:27:03,200
excellent action also very cool and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

487
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:06,020
will show<font color="#CCCCCC"> an example or to do it</font>

488
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:09,200
precisely scripting bypasses because<font color="#CCCCCC"> lof</font>

489
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:11,418
cross-site scripting and it's so so

490
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:13,669
interesting to sometimes to<font color="#CCCCCC"> to bypass</font>

491
00:27:11,419 --> 00:27:15,950
security in the in with these

492
00:27:13,669 --> 00:27:17,990
vulnerability and no no we have

493
00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:20,419
everything sanitized<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay let</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me prove</font>

494
00:27:17,990 --> 00:27:22,940
you or not and that's incredible also

495
00:27:20,419 --> 00:27:26,390
paid member area's most bounty hunters

496
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:29,330
don't pay for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a member area so your</font>

497
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:31,820
scope is even bigger because ok the the

498
00:27:29,330 --> 00:27:34,970
it's in scope the member area<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok of a</font>

499
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:39,280
client<font color="#E5E5E5"> or something like that and you</font>

500
00:27:34,970 --> 00:27:43,460
pay<font color="#E5E5E5"> 50 bucks most bounty hunters</font>

501
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:48,289
especially from countries where<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok I</font>

502
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:50,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to jump myself but don't pay</font>

503
00:27:48,289 --> 00:27:52,158
that kind of money so if you pay 50

504
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:54,919
bucks you might find lots of

505
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:58,720
vulnerabilities that gets you<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font>

506
00:27:54,919 --> 00:28:06,559
more so it's very very<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting and</font>

507
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:10,159
so my I don't know I<font color="#CCCCCC"> I already talked</font>

508
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:12,889
<font color="#CCCCCC">with the guy who</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> discovered these on on</font>

509
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:15,919
black publishing on blackheads or enough

510
00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:20,450
if is from Israel<font color="#E5E5E5"> he found reflected fat</font>

511
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:23,360
download and it told me that this is

512
00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:25,880
incredible and it's every web

513
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:29,479
application moderns is vulnerable to

514
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:32,419
these type of vulnerability again its

515
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:35,299
present in every<font color="#CCCCCC"> application</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as lots of</font>

516
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:39,770
potential keep in mind you'll find it

517
00:28:35,299 --> 00:28:42,379
these are<font color="#E5E5E5"> usually on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> api's but it's not</font>

518
00:28:39,770 --> 00:28:45,860
adjacent issue so you only need some

519
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:49,159
type of reflection to do it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wrote</font>

520
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:51,199
a very good article but the address was

521
00:28:49,159 --> 00:28:54,710
so big so I try to

522
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:57,440
a little bit so<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's good RFD rocks so</font>

523
00:28:54,710 --> 00:28:59,480
if you it's quite<font color="#CCCCCC"> simple but in the end</font>

524
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:01,480
i<font color="#CCCCCC"> will i will also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> treat my my</font>

525
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:04,940
presentation if you want to download it

526
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:07,940
this is a video example that I found a

527
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:11,659
reflective file download on google which

528
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:15,710
got me some bucks and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think i need to</font>

529
00:29:11,659 --> 00:29:17,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">play it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so you have google com I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> try</font>

534
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:36,980
when I run it something from google

535
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:40,960
you'll get what a calculator nice<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can</font>

536
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:45,500
do it whatever I wanted I could disable

537
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:49,100
open a new new tab with chrome disabling

538
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:51,679
all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> security add-ons and stuff like</font>

539
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:54,649
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I checked</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the account from</font>

the administrator whatever I have this

541
00:29:54,649 --> 00:30:01,158
one from ebay I i created a special

542
00:29:57,889 --> 00:30:05,120
crafted to page was posted on web surah

543
00:30:01,159 --> 00:30:08,090
still in web server anyway I was lonely

544
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:10,610
listed on the acknowledgement list so

545
00:30:08,090 --> 00:30:14,809
and it took like a year to fix this

546
00:30:10,610 --> 00:30:22,729
issue and what I did is a auto download

547
00:30:14,809 --> 00:30:28,510
stuff set up but<font color="#E5E5E5"> but batch file so when</font>

548
00:30:22,730 --> 00:30:31,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">I open the file it opens a new window</font>

549
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:35,990
you can see is from ebay the down low so

550
00:30:31,370 --> 00:30:39,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">pretty trusting in my opinion so when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

551
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:42,350
run<font color="#E5E5E5"> it it opens a new window this could</font>

552
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:46,070
be malicious but it's not okay you can

553
00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:48,230
do whatever you want with this business

554
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:51,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">logic floss is something that I told</font>

555
00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:53,450
before it's it's something that I'm I'm

556
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:58,010
trying still learning a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> because it's</font>

557
00:30:53,450 --> 00:31:02,120
not very common any operation that the

00:30:58,010 --> 00:31:05,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">web application is or not coded to be</font>

00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:07,689
performed or was not supposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

560
00:31:05,059 --> 00:31:11,360
you it can be<font color="#E5E5E5"> used as a tech for example</font>

561
00:31:07,690 --> 00:31:14,090
my web application is uses two factor

562
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:18,559
authentication right<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I think I'm</font>

563
00:31:14,090 --> 00:31:22,908
secure but if the developer forgot the

564
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:24,860
same authentication on a rezar where<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

565
00:31:22,909 --> 00:31:28,159
can use only clicking the league and

566
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:31,340
gave me<font color="#CCCCCC"> access to the account i bypassed</font>

567
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:35,990
the two-factor authentication so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

568
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:39,230
a major issue and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can get like 225 k</font>

569
00:31:35,990 --> 00:31:41,509
with this issue<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is a business logic</font>

570
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:43,610
flow it's quite<font color="#CCCCCC"> simple I'm still</font>

571
00:31:41,509 --> 00:31:47,840
learning about it and you have lots of

572
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:50,629
them it's a it's very<font color="#E5E5E5"> time-consuming to</font>

573
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:53,389
learn this and you need to get in the

574
00:31:50,629 --> 00:31:57,139
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> guts of the application to to act it</font>

575
00:31:53,389 --> 00:31:58,879
and I found a great paper rate called

576
00:31:57,139 --> 00:32:00,639
breaking the web with logics it's very

577
00:31:58,879 --> 00:32:05,830
interesting so you can search for it

578
00:32:00,639 --> 00:32:09,619
it's very<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool mobile security issues</font>

579
00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:12,529
again not very familiar with mobile

580
00:32:09,619 --> 00:32:14,240
security issues and why in public

581
00:32:12,529 --> 00:32:16,879
programs it's my it's interesting

582
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:21,499
because not many people knows how to

583
00:32:16,879 --> 00:32:23,748
track application on Android or iOS or

584
00:32:21,499 --> 00:32:25,820
something like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so it's very</font>

585
00:32:23,749 --> 00:32:28,580
important on public programs to try that

586
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:31,129
so this is one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that you</font>

587
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:35,059
can try on public programs CS injection

588
00:32:31,129 --> 00:32:37,668
I love<font color="#E5E5E5"> this it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so simple and so you</font>

589
00:32:35,059 --> 00:32:41,389
imagine<font color="#CCCCCC"> that a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> web application</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as export</font>

590
00:32:37,669 --> 00:32:45,860
or import CSV or<font color="#CCCCCC"> XML</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ok XML knows she's</font>

591
00:32:41,389 --> 00:32:50,449
Elias yeah for example a program on

592
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:53,269
cobalt which I will not tell the name<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

593
00:32:50,450 --> 00:32:57,259
the download member list where was

594
00:32:53,269 --> 00:33:01,999
accessible by members and it mean so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

595
00:32:57,259 --> 00:33:03,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">changed my name to equal to plus</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 5 quite</font>

596
00:33:01,999 --> 00:33:06,950
simple it's like<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing template</font>

597
00:33:03,769 --> 00:33:10,580
injection just using brackets but ok<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

598
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:13,700
what I when I opened the CSV after the

599
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:18,070
exportation I noticed that<font color="#E5E5E5"> my cell was</font>

600
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:22,060
the number 10<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok it did the math so</font>

601
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:25,120
interesting not bad so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do I use</font>

602
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:28,270
dde which are comment on I think it's

603
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:32,379
open office I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that tries to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> open</font>

604
00:33:28,270 --> 00:33:35,340
CMD and run<font color="#E5E5E5"> calc</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay if someone opens</font>

605
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:38,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">these X file will pop up a cult maybe</font>

606
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:41,620
yeah it's open a calc so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

607
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:45,400
comment you can see it you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> change</font>

608
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:47,830
your name to a CSV injection and when

609
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:50,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">the mean or other members have these</font>

610
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:53,290
opportunity they pop up a it's very

611
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:57,010
interesting or it knew it works on<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

612
00:33:53,290 --> 00:33:58,750
office on Axel and<font color="#E5E5E5"> open office it</font>

613
00:33:57,010 --> 00:34:01,090
doesn't matter you have only to change

614
00:33:58,750 --> 00:34:03,130
the type of comment you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can use another</font>

615
00:34:01,090 --> 00:34:07,209
thing which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is very interesting for</font>

616
00:34:03,130 --> 00:34:11,650
example imagine that your password is on

617
00:34:07,210 --> 00:34:16,330
my last name so posh you can use equal

618
00:34:11,650 --> 00:34:19,840
hyperlink use<font color="#E5E5E5"> your link for example look</font>

619
00:34:16,330 --> 00:34:22,319
at super calm and you put integration

620
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:27,220
point and give the parameter that is on

621
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:30,040
c3 when they click it they send me their

622
00:34:27,219 --> 00:34:33,250
password ok because it's on my server

623
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:35,860
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm waiting for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that request so it's</font>

624
00:34:33,250 --> 00:34:38,920
very simpler to<font color="#CCCCCC"> to to to recreate and</font>

625
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:41,560
it's very very<font color="#E5E5E5"> common very common nobody</font>

626
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:44,950
already because<font color="#E5E5E5"> sometimes they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

627
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:47,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">sanitize the equal sign you can use the</font>

628
00:34:44,949 --> 00:34:49,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">plus sign the minus sign many people</font>

629
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:52,020
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know that you have lots of</font>

630
00:34:49,270 --> 00:34:57,130
parameters that you can use so

631
00:34:52,020 --> 00:35:00,540
cross-site scripting bypasses I'm a big

632
00:34:57,130 --> 00:35:04,030
fan<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay of cross-site scripting and</font>

633
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:06,640
usually on public programs when you send

634
00:35:04,030 --> 00:35:11,650
something that you found because many

635
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:13,750
companies take so long to fix it it gets

636
00:35:11,650 --> 00:35:15,400
duplicate or<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's already fixed or</font>

637
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:18,400
something like that fixed no because<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

638
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:20,050
already sent it but it's a kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

639
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:23,020
cliche but you need to think outside the

640
00:35:20,050 --> 00:35:25,210
box what I did<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay let's go to Mozilla</font>

641
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:29,680
documentation and try to find<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

642
00:35:25,210 --> 00:35:31,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting like es6 the new JavaScript</font>

643
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:34,339
cool

644
00:35:31,369 --> 00:35:36,710
we can do<font color="#CCCCCC"> anything with other type of</font>

645
00:35:34,339 --> 00:35:38,808
characters like most<font color="#CCCCCC"> WAAFs</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

646
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:43,700
sanitizers block single and double coat

647
00:35:38,809 --> 00:35:47,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay on es6 i use tick i bypassed it so</font>

648
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:50,299
quite simple using documentation on the

649
00:35:47,390 --> 00:35:53,029
new<font color="#CCCCCC"> javascript or new technologies like</font>

650
00:35:50,299 --> 00:35:56,299
angular or react you can learn<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot</font>

651
00:35:53,029 --> 00:36:00,499
with new for the technologies that it's

652
00:35:56,299 --> 00:36:05,200
incredible because you can even<font color="#CCCCCC"> use</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> two</font>

653
00:36:00,499 --> 00:36:07,578
<font color="#E5E5E5">entities on october that you can use a</font>

654
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:12,169
cross-site scripting payload even on the

655
00:36:07,579 --> 00:36:16,579
function name so that's incredible<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

656
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:19,509
have the information here so my function

657
00:36:16,579 --> 00:36:25,099
is called these so it's quite simple

658
00:36:19,509 --> 00:36:32,180
also cross<font color="#CCCCCC"> icing bypasses again many</font>

659
00:36:25,099 --> 00:36:34,970
developers don't they try to<font color="#CCCCCC"> to use the</font>

660
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:37,129
content type HTML on Jason requests

661
00:36:34,970 --> 00:36:40,279
which is very wrong because if it

662
00:36:37,130 --> 00:36:44,569
reflects something that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> in injective</font>

663
00:36:40,279 --> 00:36:48,049
like a name or a call back you get a

664
00:36:44,569 --> 00:36:50,329
pop-up<font color="#CCCCCC"> right it's very simpler they need</font>

665
00:36:48,049 --> 00:36:53,299
to create the request with a<font color="#CCCCCC"> jason or</font>

666
00:36:50,329 --> 00:36:56,029
text or even protect themselves because

667
00:36:53,299 --> 00:36:57,559
this is even can be used as<font color="#E5E5E5"> a reflective</font>

668
00:36:56,029 --> 00:36:59,690
file download they need to use

669
00:36:57,559 --> 00:37:01,849
content-disposition other to force the

670
00:36:59,690 --> 00:37:05,900
name of the download they need to

671
00:37:01,849 --> 00:37:09,579
sanitize and write the content type on

672
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:13,489
other thing they're not rendered in HTML

673
00:37:09,579 --> 00:37:17,059
paid member areas like I told you most

674
00:37:13,489 --> 00:37:20,180
of them don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> pay for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it and I already</font>

675
00:37:17,059 --> 00:37:22,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">pay for many member areas which which is</font>

676
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:27,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">good because my scope is better than</font>

677
00:37:22,489 --> 00:37:31,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">most people okay so you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> increase</font>

678
00:37:27,470 --> 00:37:33,769
your scope using this and really if you

679
00:37:31,549 --> 00:37:36,019
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to start searching on what about</font>

680
00:37:33,769 --> 00:37:38,930
these programs start here and business

681
00:37:36,019 --> 00:37:43,089
logic flaws because I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that that's</font>

682
00:37:38,930 --> 00:37:43,089
the way to go not the other ones

683
00:37:44,030 --> 00:37:54,640
finally I don't know how much I have in

684
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:57,740
time<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay this is some tire some some</font>

685
00:37:54,640 --> 00:38:00,410
colleagues of mine we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have discussed is</font>

686
00:37:57,740 --> 00:38:03,310
a lot because especially I'm not a bug

687
00:38:00,410 --> 00:38:07,069
bounty hunter I have other profession

688
00:38:03,310 --> 00:38:10,340
but I do this like a hobby I don't get

689
00:38:07,070 --> 00:38:12,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">more money</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and with the money I earn i</font>

690
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:17,090
could buy stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> that usually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I I</font>

691
00:38:12,410 --> 00:38:20,270
couldn't so more shirts yeah but I need

692
00:38:17,090 --> 00:38:23,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">other things besides shirt my wife isn't</font>

693
00:38:20,270 --> 00:38:30,080
happy with new pack of t-shirts too<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

694
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:34,069
so one thing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I try to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> explain to</font>

695
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:35,720
security companies that the bug bounty

696
00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:38,000
security companies can combine each

697
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:41,180
other<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay because they are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> totally</font>

698
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:44,360
different the diversity of bounty

699
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:46,609
hunters have a completely different

700
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:53,060
approach on the pantry penetration

701
00:38:46,610 --> 00:38:56,750
testing guys so one of the things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

702
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:59,230
I try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> explain most of the colleagues</font>

703
00:38:56,750 --> 00:39:02,960
that work for security companies yet

704
00:38:59,230 --> 00:39:04,910
it's it's it's not a perfect solution of

705
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:06,890
course is gathering bug bounty and

706
00:39:04,910 --> 00:39:09,529
security company I'm telling<font color="#E5E5E5"> you this</font>

707
00:39:06,890 --> 00:39:12,319
because one of the last penetration

708
00:39:09,530 --> 00:39:16,700
testing that I had was on a program that

709
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:20,750
was present<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Kerwin like a year</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ago</font>

710
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:26,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">nope sorry it was present during a here</font>

711
00:39:20,750 --> 00:39:30,200
yeah and it have 170 reports soft and

712
00:39:26,450 --> 00:39:32,000
paved so it's very hard to find

713
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:35,299
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> there because it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was public</font>

714
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:39,110
many<font color="#CCCCCC"> researchers try to hack it and i</font>

715
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:43,250
can say that my penetration team could

716
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:47,140
gather 15<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think security issues some</font>

717
00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:49,310
of them pretty pretty critical so it's a

779
00:43:06,109 --> 00:43:13,499
hello do you participate more in private

780
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:18,239
or public programs privates of course

781
00:43:13,499 --> 00:43:21,689
they get you more money and many less

782
00:43:18,239 --> 00:43:24,839
researchers there so it's more more

783
00:43:21,690 --> 00:43:28,140
interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know what I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mean you</font>

785
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:34,499
race condition against other guys so

786
00:43:31,910 --> 00:43:35,910
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very interesting private programs</font>

787
00:43:34,499 --> 00:43:38,788
but for private programs you need to

788
00:43:35,910 --> 00:43:40,739
have reputation and you need to climb a

789
00:43:38,789 --> 00:43:42,900
ladder where you get more invitations

790
00:43:40,739 --> 00:43:46,710
and more invitation do stuff like that

791
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:50,099
so and could you<font color="#E5E5E5"> leave only with bug</font>

817
00:45:11,190 --> 00:45:15,990
question here that not a vulnerability

818
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:18,420
that you found has it been solved by now

819
00:45:15,990 --> 00:45:22,709
the availability they said that had an

820
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:25,290
acceptable risk yeah it was fixed did

821
00:45:22,710 --> 00:45:29,220
you get anything for it no anything yeah

822
00:45:25,290 --> 00:45:34,259
and it was one of the biggest newspapers

823
00:45:29,220 --> 00:45:43,049
online on us I can say that interesting

829
00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:08,430
it's a private program I think you can

830
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:12,029
find a bug in like first hour for

831
00:46:08,430 --> 00:46:16,049
example on<font color="#E5E5E5"> average on a public program</font>

832
00:46:12,030 --> 00:46:18,870
not so much sometimes you can spend one

833
00:46:16,050 --> 00:46:20,760
day two days if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you find something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

850
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:18,220
within the private the private programs

851
00:47:14,950 --> 00:47:21,129
problems how do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> choose which one you</font>

852
00:47:18,220 --> 00:47:36,640
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to attack or do you go further mall</font>

more kick or you liked it more to

research it or more challenging<font color="#CCCCCC"> for you</font>

858
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:56,500
like a remote code execution on

859

something no that wasn't the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ones that I</font>
