it lacks many many features that high

why it did

ask them maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> because they don't worry</font>

00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:59,810
simply compares the number of loops in a

00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:15,400
know that it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to be a good match</font>

00:17:13,669 --> 00:17:19,220
but it's not going to happen very often

340
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:21,949
so this one is considered is overall an

so before<font color="#E5E5E5"> implementing it I thought that</font>

that heuristic world cows too much false

but the reality provides all rights

00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:29,890
because it works better<font color="#E5E5E5"> than all the</font>

you see it into the sac base pattern and

535
00:27:26,170 --> 00:27:44,560
then printed it out<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok what's this is a</font>

539
00:27:50,770 --> 00:27:58,270
it is only copy in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the excess amount of</font>

541
00:27:58,270 --> 00:28:09,070
and then anyway it printed child again

542
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:12,870
and the final version where it is a

543
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:18,610

00:28:18,610 --> 00:28:26,709
compile<font color="#E5E5E5"> it both programs sorry to see</font>

551
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:47,530
for windows and for language i will

552
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:48,658

this one's good night<font color="#CCCCCC"> this okay yes</font>

583
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:35,799

627
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:14,380
right I need to start finding matters

628
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:17,710
well first it starts 14 the database<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

629
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:21,670
again it says the same the<font color="#CCCCCC"> cobra or what</font>

630
00:33:17,710 --> 00:33:23,760

631
00:33:21,670 --> 00:33:26,860
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to go to the partial matches</font>

really<font color="#CCCCCC"> the vulnerability that what</font>

723
00:39:55,039 --> 00:40:01,599
works as of today but I have many many

00:39:57,949 --> 00:40:05,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">chances on minds as of today it works</font>

725
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:06,859
sometimes better than dynamic indeed but

726
00:40:05,089 --> 00:40:09,229
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's for example dynamics</font>

this some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the improvements that I</font>

737
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:41,540
have manga model istics like using an

roll assembly until<font color="#E5E5E5"> optimizations over</font>

740
00:40:44,570 --> 00:40:49,340
the intermediate language and then

it's called be used to compare anything

744
00:40:55,460 --> 00:41:02,000
like a lot needs to a strike and so I

745
00:40:59,330 --> 00:41:04,400
plan to use basis on these interpreted

746
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:06,650

747
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:08,360
symbolical second to none of basic

748
00:41:06,650 --> 00:41:09,830
blocks from different architectures are

749
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:12,920
actually going to give the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same result</font>

750
00:41:09,830 --> 00:41:15,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> no matter if the instruction set is</font>

751
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:17,810
in one min son medio de pipi see if the

752
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:19,430
final result<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a basic block is</font>

753
00:41:17,810 --> 00:41:21,920
actually the same it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

basic block as of today<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm using vex</font>

756
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:32,720
vex comes from bulk net so any

instruction set supported by<font color="#CCCCCC"> Backman</font>

758
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:40,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">will be support also</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> by</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> their father</font>

759
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:43,100
after<font color="#E5E5E5"> I plan to use create an</font>

760
00:41:40,670 --> 00:41:47,840
independent GUI tools<font color="#E5E5E5"> so it doesn't</font>

761
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:50,390
depend<font color="#E5E5E5"> on I this is because some people</font>

762
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:52,460
ask me support for a dolly or asking me

763
00:41:50,390 --> 00:41:55,790
support for a snowman or ask is please

764
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:58,070
for support for<font color="#E5E5E5"> father well only two</font>

765
00:41:55,790 --> 00:42:01,970
guys one there is some people<font color="#E5E5E5"> that has</font>

766
00:41:58,070 --> 00:42:07,190
kept in for super for it and in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

767
00:42:01,970 --> 00:42:10,009
so near future I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do to improve</font>

768
00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:13,430
it in the sense of adding a way to match

769
00:42:10,010 --> 00:42:16,100
directly a binary from source code what

770
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:18,770
about finding matches between the C C++

771
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:22,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">also that you have from some application</font>

772
00:42:18,770 --> 00:42:24,009
let's say openssl to the binary tub

773
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:27,680
you're analyzing that you know

774
00:42:24,010 --> 00:42:29,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">statically linear the openssl code so</font>

775
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:32,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">you don't have to Los your time</font>

776
00:42:29,570 --> 00:42:35,180
analyzing the openssl related phantoms

777
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:36,700
into commercial product you'll simply

778
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:40,450
compare<font color="#E5E5E5"> the enemy</font>

779
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:43,060
the symbols and that's all I plan to use

780
00:42:40,450 --> 00:42:45,669
<font color="#CCCCCC">it comparing the abstract syntax tree</font>

781
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:50,349
from both the source code under the

782
00:42:45,670 --> 00:42:53,470
compiler generators one it's not easy at

783
00:42:50,349 --> 00:42:56,470
all I plan to do it maybe if I'm lucky

784
00:42:53,470 --> 00:43:01,000
and I have enough time in two to three

785
00:42:56,470 --> 00:43:04,209
years so it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> tomorrow naturally I</font>

786
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:07,060
need half a CC c plus plus plus parser

787
00:43:04,210 --> 00:43:10,930
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> univ 8a stressing tax free from</font>

00:43:07,060 --> 00:43:13,060
simpler<font color="#E5E5E5"> splat source or seed source but</font>

789
00:43:10,930 --> 00:43:17,470
this is a non-trivial task that by

790
00:43:13,060 --> 00:43:20,950
itself is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> full project so it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

791
00:43:17,470 --> 00:43:24,000
going to be available tomorrow and for

792
00:43:20,950 --> 00:43:27,009
now this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there for another source</font>

793
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:29,710
ebl so you can you say it modify adapt

794
00:43:27,010 --> 00:43:32,200
it to your name and if you want you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

795
00:43:29,710 --> 00:43:34,920
set me<font color="#E5E5E5"> back status this is the URL of</font>
