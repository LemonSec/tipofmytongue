that I have for you today ooh am I know

7
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:24,600
me I'm playing it makes since 2007 when

8
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:26,910
i bought my first bike I do a lot of

9
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:29,570
reverse engineering then I started a

10
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:32,189
blog which was mostly dedicated to

11
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:33,690
breaking<font color="#E5E5E5"> up productions usually when I</font>

12
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:36,059
download the new program the first thing

13
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:38,849
I do is breaking the protection just for

14
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:41,370
fun and then I testing program I'm not

15
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:43,350
the mac salad people get a lot surprised

16
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:46,559
when they asked me which from the US and

17
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:49,320
I tell them<font color="#E5E5E5"> we just form but where the</font>

27
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:17,070
time<font color="#E5E5E5"> hopefully throughout this year or</font>

28
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:19,740
early next year I think it will be worse

29
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:21,600
wait if you like you Stefan I<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

30

31
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:31,408
slides this one is 172<font color="#E5E5E5"> in my eyes I see</font>

32
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:34,619

54
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:38,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">Colonel would kill specially by passing</font>

56
00:02:38,049 --> 00:02:44,349
the first time last year in Japan in

57
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:46,299
marching in sis can<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm doing another</font>

58
00:02:44,349 --> 00:02:49,690
presentation based on the if I stuff

59
00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:52,360
that you probably saw on all the new

60
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:55,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">ones very happy probably parties</font>

61
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:58,120
research breaking stuff and I releases

62
00:02:55,510 --> 00:03:00,160
your that if you want to have a very

63
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:02,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting to blog posts if you want to</font>

64
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:04,900
learn about<font color="#E5E5E5"> these five go to my blog and</font>

65
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:06,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can learn and then again a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> week or</font>

66
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:09,489
<font color="#CCCCCC">two you can see the slides about that</font>

67
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:12,760
presentation you can tell you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know Rory</font>

68
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:14,079
<font color="#CCCCCC">gets these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are big doors or not they are</font>

69
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:15,700
mostly design and implement

70
00:03:14,079 --> 00:03:17,350
implementation flaws because I hope

71
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:21,459
usually doesn't know what they are<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing</font>

72
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:23,019
they can get to be bad Colonel

73
00:03:21,459 --> 00:03:25,150
vulnerabilities i'm going to show you

74
00:03:23,019 --> 00:03:27,609
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bench</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for his mighty that was</font>

75
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:29,760
released this week still in these two

76
00:03:27,609 --> 00:03:33,280
vulnerabilities so I'm unless my job

77
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:34,780
makes my life very easy because I don't

78
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:39,130
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to update the slides it's your work</font>

79
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:40,750
the coats your words funny which is the

80
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:43,180
second one that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to or the</font>

81
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:45,370
third one and they put some features

82
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:47,889
that we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> use</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to bypass all their</font>

83
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:50,130
protections so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

84
00:03:47,889 --> 00:03:52,930
call it back doors or not it's your

85
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:55,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">choice or decision after you see this</font>

86
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:56,920
presentation assumptions if you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font>

87
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,349
you know that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm Economist economy's</font>

88
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:02,260
fly to put the assumptions you know big

89
00:03:59,349 --> 00:04:04,388
file because you have the IMF failing

90
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:06,849
with their assumptions so but we still

91
00:04:04,389 --> 00:04:09,010
like to do this this is our model so

92
00:04:06,849 --> 00:04:10,869
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is where we work so the</font>

93
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:14,138
presentation assumes that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you already</font>

94
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:18,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">have put in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> machine so I'm not</font>

95
00:04:14,139 --> 00:04:20,349
<font color="#CCCCCC">trying to exploit and macros I can show</font>

96
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:23,470
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> or I'm not going to show you</font>

97
00:04:20,349 --> 00:04:26,409
because it's others did your day stuff

98
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:29,110
but it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> that difficult to get</font>

99
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:31,740
routine in mac OS if you try to estimate

100
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:34,960
the probability of this happening I

101
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:36,670
think this with you like and very fast

102
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:39,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">because i have this your days for that i</font>

103
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:42,930
can show you the proof but anything

104
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:46,210
below is probably wrong you cannot say

105
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:48,460
it medium or instead base like windows

106
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:50,169
everyone says bad-mouths about windows

107
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:53,620
but windows<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the chances are probably</font>

108
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:55,510
much harder than in microwave for

109
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:58,180
example I didn't take this slide this

110
00:04:55,510 --> 00:05:00,340
part because once again<font color="#E5E5E5"> Apple does my</font>

111
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:03,070
job my<font color="#E5E5E5"> life easy because this week they</font>

112
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:04,719
release the patch for 10 10 dot<font color="#CCCCCC"> for and</font>

113
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:06,520
if you go to see the<font color="#E5E5E5"> amount of</font>

114
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:09,040
vulnerabilities that they bench it's

115
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:11,049
insane a few more from this guy from

116
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:13,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">ian's beer so you have a single guy from</font>

117
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:16,330
google project european beer alike in

118
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:18,669
two or three men like 10-20

119
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:20,830
vulnerabilities your days<font color="#CCCCCC"> will route</font>

120
00:05:18,669 --> 00:05:22,870
with Colonel called the execution all

121
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:25,450
kinds of stuff one game so we can

122
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:28,300
imagine how things are then we aren't

123
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:30,669
funny stuff desire finally pension but

124
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:33,160
you have the funny things like this they

125
00:05:30,669 --> 00:05:35,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">patch the tumor abilities in iOS but</font>

126
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:37,630
they don't care about OS X and I put

127
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:40,450
this like playing<font color="#E5E5E5"> day it really is a</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">its baby they don't say anything when I</font>

130
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:47,680
need this presentation for example this

131
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:49,570
vulnerability for which projects he

132
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,130
releases the next point of fully working

133

problems flawless they've already things

135
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:59,950
for us mighty because they<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> got the</font>

care about that bench but also these for

141

example another example from a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Korean</font>

147
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:36,940
it's two words much easier ways to get

148
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:39,610
see you cannot<font color="#E5E5E5"> discuss this with me</font>

149
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:41,380
because I<font color="#CCCCCC"> will win this fight video you</font>

00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:44,860
can suffice the user the stupid mac

151
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:48,460
users give me our admin password and you

152
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:52,420
got this small where I<font color="#CCCCCC"> wore that in fact</font>

153
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:54,340
it normally 17k people just<font color="#E5E5E5"> wait then</font>

154
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:59,200
please insert<font color="#E5E5E5"> your admin password that</font>

155
00:06:54,340 --> 00:07:02,380
it more<font color="#CCCCCC"> fun stuff a lot of these</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">sounders it updates going over HTTP so</font>

157
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:07,420
if you are a guy<font color="#CCCCCC"> say once and you</font>

158
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:09,760
probably shouldn't download this stuff

159
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:11,980
over HTTP you have applications

160

the sweaty binary with on the on the

00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:28,870
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> override and play some games then it</font>

exploit the first time the user<font color="#CCCCCC"> execuse</font>

and gives the permission again whatever

170
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:45,130
you want so the question<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the tax</font>

171
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:47,440
advice is really big on my knees so the

172
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:50,080
assumption that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do that getting root</font>

173
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:53,230
is not that difficult<font color="#CCCCCC"> I Mike so we can</font>

174
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:55,450
continue on hundred<font color="#CCCCCC"> good kids so my goal</font>

175
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:57,340
since I like put kids especially the

176
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:59,979
colonel completes because it's low level

177
00:07:57,340 --> 00:08:02,320
and it's way more fun intent username

178

stuff please i<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to let to load the</font>

180
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:11,380

if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to load some kernel code that</font>

this this code is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> fine but I will</font>

186
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:25,750
all be genuine<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you like sometimes</font>

187
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:27,940
because it's the first time they

188
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:31,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">introduce these so they want to test to</font>

189
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:33,400
see<font color="#E5E5E5"> the effect of this finally in use my</font>

that's Colonel<font color="#E5E5E5"> that hope Blue Mountains</font>

194
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:46,420
in the colonel first there's a good

195

you

as user if physical signature is invalid

you cannot<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can't flow because it's</font>

really hold your Colonel extension very

security product<font color="#E5E5E5"> this brings you some</font>

204
00:09:04,629 --> 00:09:09,309

cannot use this trick anymore what are

the solutions the first one is what<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

spies are using if you are up to date

sucks man and who and<font color="#E5E5E5"> all that stuff</font>

212
00:09:25,629 --> 00:09:32,559
they are basically with me<font color="#CCCCCC"> suing the</font>

213
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:34,839
certificates final it costs you ninety

214
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:37,029
nine dollars to get a certificate then

215
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:41,079
you need to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> a request and tell</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

216
00:09:37,029 --> 00:09:43,269
<font color="#CCCCCC">i want to build a colonel work drinkies</font>

00:09:43,269 --> 00:09:47,110
say it's for testing they will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> knock</font>

219
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:48,610
to request it's just say<font color="#E5E5E5"> i want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to build</font>

220
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:51,490
a security product and they will give

00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:54,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">you the right search be they could</font>

223
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:59,829
eNOS mighty it's it's still available in

224
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:02,079
El Capitan if it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to still</font>

225
00:09:59,829 --> 00:10:04,559
available if you want to get visible as

00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:07,479
a perimeter inside disable everything

227
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:09,610
you can attack from the e-file this is

228
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:13,389
where I'm movie now this is a really fun

229
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:15,759
world and essentially if you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bronco</font>

230
00:10:13,389 --> 00:10:18,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">that the firmware level it's game over</font>

231
00:10:15,759 --> 00:10:21,629
you can be whatever you want which

232
00:10:18,209 --> 00:10:21,628
student firewalls

233
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:31,760
you can attack user this is really

234
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:33,469
stupid you are going to see how good a

235
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:36,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">please main steps you can exploit</font>

00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:38,060
Carlton<font color="#E5E5E5"> abilities because if it's if you</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">they can abuse existing teachers which</font>

240
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:47,779
is what i'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to show you last these</font>

241
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:50,029
are lying demons these are ever get me

242
00:10:47,779 --> 00:10:54,620
security video they have no idea what

243
00:10:50,029 --> 00:10:58,040
they are taking point there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> no demon</font>

244
00:10:54,620 --> 00:11:01,339
in my code is called<font color="#CCCCCC"> kexp what it does</font>

245
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:03,469
it's the immune responsible for doing

246
00:11:01,339 --> 00:11:05,329
the co-signatory<font color="#CCCCCC"> shank so if one more</font>

247
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:07,820
what do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to load the trailer it</font>

248
00:11:05,329 --> 00:11:10,040
sends a request this demon<font color="#E5E5E5"> this theme it</font>

249
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:12,589
goes to purify the container such as yes

250
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:14,510
or<font color="#E5E5E5"> no and that's it the funny detail</font>

251
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:17,450
design this demon is running in pink

252
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:19,370
tree basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's running gets to use</font>

253
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:22,160
reliable so it's not running<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:24,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">curve so what you have is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something very</font>

fine coat that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to load that the</font>

257
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:29,630
this isn't make any sense because you

258
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:33,079
can attack that process if you attack

259
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:36,230
that forces<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's game over they don't</font>

260
00:11:33,079 --> 00:11:38,870
seem to learn there's a guy saying we

266
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:53,870
the better version did you like this if

267
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:57,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">doing this it's game over it just</font>

268
00:11:53,870 --> 00:12:00,260
batteries and let it what you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

269

<font color="#E5E5E5">this is the piece of combat unit patch</font>

270
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:05,390

certificate related stuff essentially it

00:12:08,089 --> 00:12:12,910
has the codes shake the certificate see

if it's valuable value<font color="#CCCCCC"> return yes or no</font>

to the process<font color="#CCCCCC"> petra discount the shore</font>

278
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:28,310
what is your way of etching stuff and

287
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:51,989
anyway at the time I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just patched the</font>

288
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:53,640

extension is not well so just by two

291
00:12:56,370 --> 00:13:00,270
medicines the message never<font color="#E5E5E5"> appears and</font>

292
00:12:58,590 --> 00:13:03,300
that's it so it's more or less the same

293
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:06,600
variant about this so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not showing</font>

00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:12,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">you guys in infinite loop then they were</font>

295
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:16,650
like they're really nice but we really

presentation could essentially end here

298
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:24,930
because it is game over that it there's

<font color="#CCCCCC">nothing else to do but i like to wait</font>

write anywhere in the colonel you can

<font color="#CCCCCC">test part this comes from the mac design</font>

00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:44,370
task is just a container of data then

329
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:46,170
there's a there's a point to respondents

330
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:46,960
between the task and a process because

<font color="#CCCCCC">the process is</font>

before snow leopard depth or there was a

beans I want this Pete give me the

passport and they<font color="#E5E5E5"> can access to to build</font>

345
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:31,090
passport for the colonel and you get a

00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:35,910
net it you have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> DC described in that</font>

347
00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:39,820
Frank article there were<font color="#E5E5E5"> no steroids</font>

348
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:47,430
because we can write to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> colonel this</font>

349
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:50,290
is the function and 2 guys I hired<font color="#CCCCCC"> TT</font>

00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:53,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">organized the conference game in a in</font>

351
00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:55,120
Taiwan and they<font color="#CCCCCC"> report this very tracing</font>

352
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:59,320
vulnerability the processors fell tasks

353
00:15:55,120 --> 00:16:01,780
and insight is also easy and when I saw

354
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:03,580
this woman really rang the bell inside

355
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:05,709
my brain and I didn't know why and

356
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:08,260
someday i was browsing this book it's

357
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:09,520
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of my books thats always it on my</font>

358
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:12,130
desk is very stressing if you are

359
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:16,030
interested<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the term in the internal</font>

360
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:18,070
result in my class and i was browsing an

361
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:20,949
exploit the vulnerability was there

362
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:23,380
since the oak tree with nobody<font color="#CCCCCC"> notice it</font>

363
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:25,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">but it was there so insight is always</font>

364
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:29,320
easy to after you're not saying it

365
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:32,020
everything is<font color="#E5E5E5"> very clear what tomorrow</font>

366
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:33,940
will it does is gives you access to the

367
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:37,180
colonel passport which is the same

368
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:39,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">result as the best for you this is the</font>

369
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:42,310
function processors<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> passed see it</font>

370
00:16:39,610 --> 00:16:45,250
calls another function<font color="#E5E5E5"> this violent as a</font>

371
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:48,310
lot of code and essentially<font color="#CCCCCC"> what it does</font>

372
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:51,010
it goes over all tasks that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> running</font>

373
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:54,459
in into the season and returns dead part

374
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:57,569
into an array<font color="#CCCCCC"> testify stuff that we're</font>

375
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:57,570
done which is

376
00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:05,849
the defines to occur<font color="#CCCCCC"> I will show you</font>

377
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:08,678
what what this means this is how you get

378
00:17:05,849 --> 00:17:10,359
the passports you need to do get some

379
00:17:08,679 --> 00:17:12,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">ports</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is one of the reasons why you</font>

380
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:16,839
need root access because to get the<font color="#CCCCCC"> O's</font>

381
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:20,949
part<font color="#CCCCCC"> in row taxes so we feel good we can</font>

382
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:23,589
do this and you get the colonel passport

383
00:17:20,949 --> 00:17:25,720
from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first element of the array that</font>

384
00:17:23,589 --> 00:17:29,080
is returned it's dead or so it's very

385
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:31,270
easy to to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get as I told you this is</font>

386
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:33,760
your mud patch I was expecting<font color="#CCCCCC"> these to</font>

387
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:37,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">be banished at least in El comedic still</font>

388
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:39,280
not back there knowing<font color="#E5E5E5"> this page for use</font>

389
00:17:37,059 --> 00:17:41,050
my dude it's also not there I have no

390
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:43,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">idea why</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I hope is not patching this</font>

391
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:45,970
they know<font color="#CCCCCC"> because i was showing the</font>

392
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:48,870
slides to them in and right there in one

393
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:52,300
infinite loop i was this is about fitted

394
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:54,428
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i presented to two times and they</font>

395
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:58,500
say<font color="#CCCCCC"> use my teens every bit as powerful</font>

396
00:17:54,429 --> 00:18:02,620
as it loads<font color="#E5E5E5"> i say you've survived it is</font>

397
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:04,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">so what is it from you because they know</font>

398
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:06,459
what about this file because that's what

399
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:08,110
to secure Colonel define is there

400
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:10,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">because this one doesn't have any nye</font>

401
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:13,510
ways so they had matching the bug in iOS

402
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:15,760
because they understand how powerful the

403
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:18,370
buggies in iOS because if you are then

404
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:21,700
this part it price to iOS and Joan

405
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:24,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">breaks will be much easier I try to</font>

406
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:27,250
patch this park and there are no side

407
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:29,980
effects your<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mac will work without any</font>

408
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:32,230
problem so I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> understand why</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

409
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:35,919
are not bad genes let's get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the fun</font>

410
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:38,410
part other it spoil please what we can

411
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:40,360
do if you get the kernel corn what can

412
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:43,510
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> do with this world we can allocate</font>

413
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:46,209
internal memory we can read and we can

414
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:48,129
write and modify<font color="#E5E5E5"> write whole memory i</font>

415
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:50,530
will show you what i mean by<font color="#CCCCCC"> right about</font>

416
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:53,440
dressing in a bit we cannot<font color="#CCCCCC"> change the</font>

417
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:56,020
memory protection of kernel code and

418
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:58,660
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> beta sections because they are made</font>

419
00:18:56,020 --> 00:19:01,900
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the army and we cannot execute code</font>

420
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:05,380
because we just have access to transport

421
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:07,030
but we are from a different from a

422
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:09,040
different task so we cannot change<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

423
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:10,960
pointer are directly the colonel

424
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:14,080
watch somewhere else so we need some

425
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:16,690
tricks what are some kernel protections

426
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:19,120
the level guys are really bad at

427
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:22,150
security but they implement some stuff

428
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:29,159
for slowly but they do it the kernel

429
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:32,110
code is reductive you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> apples</font>

430
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:35,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">snitches connections to bike home like</font>

431
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:38,290
crazy and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> colonel is made Reno me</font>

432
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:40,180
but this is at page while so you can see

433
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:42,090
this is the code from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> kernel that</font>

434
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:44,980
finding the colonel is initializing it

435
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:47,020
changes the page table to reload<font color="#CCCCCC"> me this</font>

436
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:49,840
is a reason why we cannot<font color="#E5E5E5"> make the code</font>

437
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:52,930
it cannot change the deprivation because

438
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:55,300
a function and is from<font color="#E5E5E5"> a higher from a</font>

439
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:57,010
higher level and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we try to change it</font>

440
00:19:55,300 --> 00:20:00,550
cannot because the protection is

441
00:19:57,010 --> 00:20:02,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">education</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Bible the same happens to to</font>

442
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:07,060
battle sections they were made with only

443
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:09,280
for example before you could see the

444
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:11,139
data section is writable and you have

445
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:14,020
for example the deceased all tables and

446
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:15,790
the market<font color="#CCCCCC"> are tables then you just need</font>

447
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:19,389
to modify a pointer and you can get code

448
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:21,180
execution now they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> they are real and</font>

449
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:23,080
so you cannot detect this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> called</font>

450
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:25,030
directly these<font color="#E5E5E5"> also happened in</font>

451
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:27,189
seemingly not when I said at a sample

452
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:29,790
durability you could attack the table

453
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:32,650
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's rideable mouse</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> real ugly</font>

454
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:36,070
there are also another trip they made

455
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:38,410
the table itself<font color="#E5E5E5"> read-only but there was</font>

456
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:40,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">a pointer to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> dead table that was</font>

457
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:43,870
frightful so what you do is create a new

458
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:45,580
table input everything their original

459
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:47,500
you notify the pointer that you want and

460
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:50,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">then you change the pointer that points</font>

461
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:54,430
to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> table at it and the technique is</font>

462
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:57,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">always called shadow Siskel table and it</font>

463
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:59,560
comes from windows<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think it was some</font>

464
00:20:57,270 --> 00:21:01,750
cannot<font color="#E5E5E5"> remember the name but it was a</font>

465
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:05,740
little screw tip that implemented first

466
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:09,430
piece technique most of those pointers

467
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:12,370
from the dead section is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> god section</font>

468
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:14,980
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you cannot detect any more like this</font>

469
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:16,959
you cannot put<font color="#E5E5E5"> the shadow table in his</font>

470
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:19,030
mighty you can do the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same in one every</font>

471
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:23,710
person before<font color="#CCCCCC"> they can you can</font>

472
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:27,700
with this is the data section being very

473
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:29,800
naughty also also you have not execute

474

00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:43,840
all this stuff was introduced by<font color="#CCCCCC"> white</font>

483
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:59,080
provide this protection because there is

but we cannot directly execute code yet

difficult which easy easy things we

508
00:23:06,610 --> 00:23:14,050
usually work most of the time so my goal

509
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:16,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">is to execute kernel code there already</font>

510
00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:20,020
told you about the<font color="#E5E5E5"> matter problems we</font>

00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:23,560
can't execute code we can use<font color="#CCCCCC"> the siskel</font>

512
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:25,780
tables we cannot do that trick and the

513
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:27,490
Mavericks<font color="#E5E5E5"> are older we can use the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

514
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:30,070
shadows you stable which it's very easy

515
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:32,490
to implement so for those it's not to be

516
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:32,490
problem

517
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:39,100
how much it should will like that will

518
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:40,900
attract internet the kernel extensions

519
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:42,280
you could try to attack the kernel

520
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:43,600
extensions because we have the Caroline

521
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:45,730
the kernel extensions they are also

522
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:47,889
protected they are made we normally so

523
00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:52,630
it's not interesting to to attack what

524
00:23:47,890 --> 00:23:54,190
is the solution and become if you come

525
00:23:52,630 --> 00:23:56,260
from the good kids you know that this

526

means direct<font color="#CCCCCC"> Colonel object manipulation</font>

530
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:10,840
is to find a writable data structure

00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:11,669
because we have many hooks in the kernel

573
00:26:09,749 --> 00:26:15,539
that allow you to control a lot of

574
00:26:11,669 --> 00:26:18,330
functions in the system so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> build</font>

575
00:26:15,539 --> 00:26:21,330
for example your own module<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2 to control</font>

576
00:26:18,330 --> 00:26:23,879
and stop physical to mind it up for

577
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:26,549
example there's a module that if you try

578
00:26:23,879 --> 00:26:28,678
<font color="#E5E5E5">to execute a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> swanky binary it will send</font>

579
00:26:26,549 --> 00:26:30,119
you a warning and back saying this

580
00:26:28,679 --> 00:26:32,100
problem this<font color="#CCCCCC"> implication</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wants to</font>

581
00:26:30,119 --> 00:26:33,899
execute is slightly better do you want

582
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:36,539
to allow we want to deny you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> why</font>

583
00:26:33,899 --> 00:26:39,809
twist for example PS process one to

584
00:26:36,539 --> 00:26:41,879
whitelist it's a warning it's some more

585
00:26:39,809 --> 00:26:46,289
information<font color="#CCCCCC"> I also did something to</font>

presentation at whiskey turn I don't

589
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:55,559
was based also on this framework so it's

00:26:53,399 --> 00:26:58,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">very powerful you should take a look I</font>

00:27:39,869 --> 00:27:45,809
call the function that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have the hook</font>

and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> starts the root case let me</font>

609
00:27:45,809 --> 00:27:53,080
quickly go on what to do for this the

sex

611
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:57,909
we need a<font color="#E5E5E5"> colonel passport because we</font>

00:27:55,510 --> 00:28:00,640
are writing Colonel we need to find<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

615
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:07,300
structures are somewhere so we need this

00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:09,429
we need to compute the<font color="#CCCCCC"> route concise</font>

617
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:12,010
because we are going to copy and install

<font color="#CCCCCC">it in memory</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we need to move gate manner</font>

00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:20,230
some free space<font color="#CCCCCC"> for four days then we</font>

623
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:27,760

00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:29,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">somehow the coding in the colonel then</font>

625
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:31,420
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to change memory protections</font>

626
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:34,180
because if we locate the<font color="#E5E5E5"> memory is not</font>

executable<font color="#E5E5E5"> pi by default then we need to</font>

628
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:39,670
fix the simple service external signals

629
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:41,380
and this is the funniest part or the

630
00:28:39,670 --> 00:28:43,330
more interesting part at least this one

631
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:45,760
because we don't we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> by tracing the</font>

632
00:28:43,330 --> 00:28:47,919
colonel linker so we need to do

633
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:50,620
implement basically implement our own

634
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:54,460
liquor let me install a new recipe

635
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:56,739
policy and execute the hook to start and

636
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:59,500
you probably want to clean up so the

637
00:28:56,740 --> 00:29:03,850
forensics guys don't know what's what's

638
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:06,880
happening there and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I line what the</font>

00:29:03,850 --> 00:29:10,480
forensics guys I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure if useful</font>

640
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:12,610
agility for for a while I was playing a

641
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:14,830
little<font color="#CCCCCC"> you guys because they have an</font>

642
00:29:12,610 --> 00:29:17,320
assumption they think that they can find

643
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:20,080
everything because it's a memory and I

644
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:22,389
show<font color="#CCCCCC"> them a few times our few more</font>

647
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:31,479
their software so don't trust and your

648
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:34,390
tools I did<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about that just rest</font>

649
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:36,280
your tools<font color="#CCCCCC"> always be suspicious about</font>

650
00:29:34,390 --> 00:29:38,470
that especially if you are trying to

651
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:40,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">change route kids remember I'm running</font>

652
00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:43,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">on that on a level problem lower than</font>

653
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:46,810
your tools so i can men employed all

654
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:49,150
your tools<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> undress them and use them</font>

655
00:29:46,810 --> 00:29:50,919
but be very suspicious about the<font color="#CCCCCC"> spoons</font>

656
00:29:49,150 --> 00:29:52,980
and this is the hope is all ready to

657
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:56,020
show you to get the colonel test<font color="#CCCCCC"> port</font>

658
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:58,360
plussing difficult and this is the code

659
00:29:56,020 --> 00:30:01,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">to get a slide using that function the K</font>

660
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:03,100
has info this is basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> inline</font>

00:30:01,330 --> 00:30:05,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">assembly you can import the function is</font>

662
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:06,870
not very difficult<font color="#E5E5E5"> math nothing very</font>

663
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:09,490
type of it

664
00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:13,090
to compute the<font color="#E5E5E5"> rookies sighs there is a</font>

665
00:30:09,490 --> 00:30:15,100
small trick usually the site is

666
00:30:13,090 --> 00:30:18,399
different from the size<font color="#CCCCCC"> on memory</font>

667
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:21,189
because alignment recent so if you want

668
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:23,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">to compute the brute keys because we are</font>

in<font color="#CCCCCC"> our memory we need the memory the</font>

670
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:30,190
memory version so it's basically used

671
00:30:26,669 --> 00:30:32,200
fuel that gives you the size on memory

672
00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:35,380
and hot on disk because if they are

673

especially what we need we need memory

681
00:30:53,559 --> 00:30:58,299
somewhere in the colonel you don't get

682
00:30:55,200 --> 00:31:00,700
because we are controlling a pointer we

683
00:30:58,299 --> 00:31:05,620
are not playing with offset so we have

684
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:08,710
64 bits a absolute address so we can we

685
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:11,168
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> need memory somewhere you use the</font>

function the colonel part you see then

687
00:31:11,169 --> 00:31:15,309
the first parameter is the past is the

00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:17,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">past sports you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use this function</font>

689

program as long you are support offense

691

that's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> process</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can do whatever</font>

everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> else there are some problems</font>

694
00:31:28,570 --> 00:31:34,779
with is because if you do if you use

695
00:31:33,010 --> 00:31:37,830
these function like this and for example

696
00:31:34,779 --> 00:31:41,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">if you try to locate 100k of memory</font>

697
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:43,360
these you press your system what happens

698
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:46,330
is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the whole memory is not wired</font>

699
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:48,428
why would mean that non wired memory it

700
00:31:46,330 --> 00:31:50,649
can be pushed<font color="#E5E5E5"> out to this even from the</font>

701
00:31:48,429 --> 00:31:52,269
colonel attempt and what I memory is

702
00:31:50,649 --> 00:31:54,309
obvious they're physically for example

703
00:31:52,269 --> 00:31:56,440
the colonel grunting in wider memory

704
00:31:54,309 --> 00:31:59,769
because if you had a page out or<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

00:31:56,440 --> 00:32:02,200
fishing<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the colonel you could risk</font>

pressure to to the to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Beijing system</font>

708
00:32:04,179 --> 00:32:09,340
to this and then there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not no co2 to</font>

the symbols that need to be fixed in and

797
00:36:07,430 --> 00:36:14,089
so on complexity and there are 10

798
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:15,920
different types of publications and you

799
00:36:14,089 --> 00:36:19,040
can start restarting<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay this is why</font>

800
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:21,950
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> need a lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> work but in reality</font>

801
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:25,880
there are only two bit that you between

00:36:21,950 --> 00:36:28,160
into to face one is a relative

<font color="#E5E5E5">are used to researching stuff this is</font>

805
00:36:30,349 --> 00:36:37,609
basically 32 bits<font color="#E5E5E5"> offset to somewhere</font>

806
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:40,819
and using the current instruction

811
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:48,680

812
00:36:46,999 --> 00:36:50,390
relocation of which are actual two

813
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:52,640
dresses these are easy because we just

814
00:36:50,390 --> 00:36:55,578
need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> cite point to this address and</font>

815
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:57,890
that's it I know this<font color="#CCCCCC"> because I get the</font>

816
00:36:55,579 --> 00:36:59,980
small agility to go to all kernel

817
00:36:57,890 --> 00:37:03,740
extensions and get the number of symbols

818
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:07,599
and I know only<font color="#CCCCCC"> those two types are used</font>

819
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:10,578
and there are two two and two types

820
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:14,420
external which are the singles data data

821
00:37:10,579 --> 00:37:16,490
linker does and local local<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> strings</font>

822
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:18,829
for example that you I 1-yard code if

823
00:37:16,490 --> 00:37:20,660
you f and some other local kernel

824
00:37:18,829 --> 00:37:23,269
extensions symbols for example the stack

825
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:27,640
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> stop functions they are theirs so</font>

826
00:37:23,269 --> 00:37:31,189
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not very complicated to to do</font>

827
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:35,150
this is some code there locates and the

828
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:39,170
tables then finds the symbols to which

829
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:41,119
they could respond<font color="#CCCCCC"> to then try to solve</font>

830
00:37:39,170 --> 00:37:43,579
the current<font color="#E5E5E5"> symbol to locate</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the target</font>

831

833
00:37:46,369 --> 00:37:50,569
in the relocation them I need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> find</font>

834
00:37:48,799 --> 00:37:52,519
where the map copy function is

835
00:37:50,569 --> 00:37:54,619
implemented the colonel<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then you</font>

836
00:37:52,519 --> 00:37:56,930
just need to fix the offset yourself

837
00:37:54,619 --> 00:38:00,710
this is what the linker does when is

838
00:37:56,930 --> 00:38:03,589
thinking it's very waving this work this

839
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:06,920
is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little code I like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these on purpose</font>

840
00:38:03,589 --> 00:38:09,799
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> does about because offsets here is a</font>

841
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:11,900
32 bits and interior and there is no

842
00:38:09,799 --> 00:38:16,130
guarantee that these all set will be

843
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:18,890
nuts it can also flow and it will point

844
00:38:16,130 --> 00:38:20,630
tool to somewhere else written<font color="#E5E5E5"> for this</font>

845
00:38:18,890 --> 00:38:23,868
is that we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> implicating the Tyrell</font>

846
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:26,239
somewhere else in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the colonel so we get</font>

847
00:38:23,869 --> 00:38:30,529

848
00:38:26,239 --> 00:38:35,089
that's the address where it is in 32

and from there<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can use an absolute</font>

860
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:07,569
address because you have enough<font color="#CCCCCC"> space</font>

861
00:39:04,690 --> 00:39:09,850
and jump anywhere you want so we are

862
00:39:07,570 --> 00:39:12,040
basically in directing the flow of a

863
00:39:09,850 --> 00:39:14,920
problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> so it's not very difficult to</font>

864
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:19,150
implement it's a very easy way to work

865
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:21,790
around the problem these are the actual

866
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:23,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">defects these are very easy you find a</font>

867
00:39:21,790 --> 00:39:26,100
single where the similes and we put the

868
00:39:23,830 --> 00:39:29,529
whole offset the whole address and

869
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:32,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">deliveries to process and these are</font>

870
00:39:29,530 --> 00:39:34,570
related to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the to the local it's</font>

871
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:37,270
essentially<font color="#E5E5E5"> there the local ones are</font>

872
00:39:34,570 --> 00:39:42,040
always absent addresses so they are even

873
00:39:37,270 --> 00:39:44,740
easier to an end to things so fix to

874
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:47,110
build<font color="#E5E5E5"> your own linker it takes like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font>

875
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:50,649
200 lines of C so as you see it's very

876
00:39:47,110 --> 00:39:52,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">simple it appeared a very complex</font>

877
00:39:50,650 --> 00:39:54,970
problem with inning or something that

878
00:39:52,750 --> 00:40:00,460
you need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> spend some time but in the</font>

879
00:39:54,970 --> 00:40:03,939
end it's really easy to build so<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of</font>

880
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:07,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">line interesa PSD ah I will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not go to</font>

881
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:09,760
how this essentially there is a very

882
00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:11,800
important short the one which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

883
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:15,400
global variable that contains the

884
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:17,470
information but first BSB as the number

885
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:20,100
of policies<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> executes and all the</font>

886
00:40:17,470 --> 00:40:23,020
policies that that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> within the system</font>

887
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:25,870
this is the structure for for each

888
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:29,110
policy this is an array that contains

889
00:40:25,870 --> 00:40:30,970
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the policies and this is the policy</font>

890
00:40:29,110 --> 00:40:33,820
configuration for example we can see the

891
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:35,680
name and full<font color="#CCCCCC"> name</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and this is one</font>

892
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:38,410
contains a function pointers are the

893
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:40,779
hooks and this point to another starter

894
00:40:38,410 --> 00:40:43,060
which is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> really big structure with all</font>

895
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:45,340
the hoops available in the system what

896
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:47,740
you do you register<font color="#E5E5E5"> call back you say I</font>

897
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:50,290
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> for example to to get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a hook</font>

898
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:52,899
that's every time the access its

899
00:40:50,290 --> 00:40:54,580
function is executed I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

900
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:56,230
call<font color="#E5E5E5"> back so we put the function pointer</font>

901
00:40:54,580 --> 00:41:00,480
that to be our function that will

902
00:40:56,230 --> 00:41:00,480
process please and

903
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:16,580
Yahweh go about this because it's which

904
00:41:12,770 --> 00:41:19,520
is basically you do<font color="#E5E5E5"> yourself the word</font>

905
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:22,310
you install disruptors install a new

906
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:26,300
policy and inside the pointers in that

907
00:41:22,310 --> 00:41:31,009
way there's a something to facilitate

908
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:32,750
your work which is the rain is already

909
00:41:31,010 --> 00:41:35,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so we don't need to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> allocate memory</font>

910
00:41:32,750 --> 00:41:39,260
they pray locator right with it<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think</font>

911
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:44,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's 256 or 512 entries so you just find</font>

912
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:49,640
a slot there we put there and at it then

913
00:41:44,990 --> 00:41:51,439
to start your model which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is what we are</font>

914
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:53,210
going to use to get code execution you

915
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:55,010
just increase<font color="#CCCCCC"> inside a system</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there's</font>

916
00:41:53,210 --> 00:41:57,440
another module and then the system will

917
00:41:55,010 --> 00:42:00,350
go to the least and see okay this one's

918
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:03,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">to to get a comeback ever sent a call</font>

919
00:42:00,350 --> 00:42:07,460
back that's when we start with roofies

920
00:42:03,670 --> 00:42:09,470
in our example i hope this function the

921
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:11,900
task for<font color="#E5E5E5"> people because it's very easy</font>

922
00:42:09,470 --> 00:42:14,180
very simple you just call a<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep an on</font>

923
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:16,640
Pete you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can use the big one which is</font>

924
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:21,140
munchie-t which is equivalent to in it

925
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:23,660
in windows so you know that process is

926
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:27,680
always there you call it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> their end</font>

927
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:30,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">you probably want to do add some kind of</font>

928
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:33,500
fuse so your code is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not executed for</font>

929
00:42:30,830 --> 00:42:36,020
example if father hole is an object if

930
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:38,240
you get your<font color="#E5E5E5"> route get executed so you</font>

931
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:41,630
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to execute once you to fuse</font>

932
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:43,939
there and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it then you want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

933
00:42:41,630 --> 00:42:45,770
clean up all the stuff you don't want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

934
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:49,010
leave<font color="#CCCCCC"> a trace that you use the trusted</font>

935
00:42:45,770 --> 00:42:51,650
be policy so we decrease the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Houston I'm</font>

936
00:42:49,010 --> 00:42:53,810
the number of<font color="#E5E5E5"> loaded policies there's no</font>

937
00:42:51,650 --> 00:42:55,910
problem in doing this and runtime and

938
00:42:53,810 --> 00:42:57,890
then you remove all the memory that you

939
00:42:55,910 --> 00:43:02,920
located and how<font color="#E5E5E5"> that stuff you just</font>

940
00:42:57,890 --> 00:43:02,920
leave the Woodley's in memory I'm sure

941
00:43:25,180 --> 00:43:32,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay this is the one of the portions I</font>

run again nothing but you're fine so

960
00:44:32,210 --> 00:44:38,780
it's running I wanted code from from a

971
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:16,280
it is this came from my side this is a

reason why it's funny 11 p.m. because<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

00:45:29,069 --> 00:45:34,288
<font color="#E5E5E5">example you can you can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have the loader</font>

and you can have the payload on remote

<font color="#E5E5E5">website then you can clean up and</font>

forensics cannot get probably not much

982
00:45:39,059 --> 00:45:43,259
information from from the good kids so

it's so powerful you can enable it for

Colonel expansion it allows you to write

access physical memory this is the trade

1005
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:56,460
physical memory so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can read and</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">write up to 64 bits of memory you don't</font>

1007
00:46:56,460 --> 00:47:01,249
have a full control so you have to send

1008
00:46:58,279 --> 00:47:04,259
requests for 64 bits it takes a while

1009
00:47:01,249 --> 00:47:08,749
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it does this when I saw these i</font>

1015
00:47:22,289 --> 00:47:26,069
yeah but because the guy was complaining

1016
00:47:24,089 --> 00:47:28,828
know this can crash the system and a la

1022
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:42,060

feature to do the same virus diseases

1024
00:47:42,060 --> 00:47:45,420
the reasons why they went to different

1025
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:48,000
work there was a debugging framework

1026

shot it was a canal extension they

<font color="#CCCCCC">convert it to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a private framework</font>

1028
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:54,720
because these this these debugging tools

00:47:53,070 --> 00:47:57,150
need to connect the<font color="#E5E5E5"> colonel they</font>

copy what kid calls me to fix of

1064
00:49:31,380 --> 00:49:36,900
I mean we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to start the good kids</font>

1065
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:40,340
what are the problems with this we

1066
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:43,260
decision we need to find<font color="#E5E5E5"> memory because</font>

1067
00:49:40,340 --> 00:49:46,540
we cannot allocate memory as a Tully we

1068
00:49:43,260 --> 00:49:48,640
can find free space on

1069
00:49:46,540 --> 00:49:51,640
honestly for example the colonel Heather

1070
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:54,160
usually it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not guaranteed but there is</font>

1071
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:57,250
usually spice from the header to the

1072
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:59,230
first place where I put where cookies

1073
00:49:57,250 --> 00:50:01,660
there's usually some alignment space

1074
00:49:59,230 --> 00:50:05,950
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is essentially</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 000 ever since you</font>

1075
00:50:01,660 --> 00:50:08,290
that memory is executable so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> find</font>

1076
00:50:05,950 --> 00:50:12,279

have also<font color="#CCCCCC"> alignment spice we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can try to</font>

1080
00:50:17,290 --> 00:50:22,779
functions for example what what the

1081
00:50:19,540 --> 00:50:25,690
morning shelter was doing the Gator gets

1082
00:50:22,780 --> 00:50:27,580
a function thank you for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example NFS</font>

1083
00:50:25,690 --> 00:50:29,800
stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you are attacking a target that</font>

1084
00:50:27,580 --> 00:50:33,490
you know they are not using an offense

1085
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:36,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">and if s is default on my colonel so you</font>

1086
00:50:33,490 --> 00:50:38,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">just write that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it are you</font>

1087
00:50:36,310 --> 00:50:40,660
going to locate<font color="#E5E5E5"> memory via shell code</font>

1088
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:42,490
essentially you just need a few bites

1089
00:50:40,660 --> 00:50:45,490
for the shellcode allocate memory and

1090
00:50:42,490 --> 00:50:48,879
then you do whatever you want good

1091
00:50:45,490 --> 00:50:51,609
execution it's easier ear because TV we

1092
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:55,210
can buy protections we can use the

1093
00:50:51,610 --> 00:50:57,700
fiscal balance you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> go very complex</font>

1094
00:50:55,210 --> 00:50:59,530
and use the same trusted<font color="#CCCCCC"> vsb you cannot</font>

1095
00:50:57,700 --> 00:51:02,290
hope the kernel function because we can

1096
00:50:59,530 --> 00:51:09,910
write anywhere so it can be very

1097
00:51:02,290 --> 00:51:11,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">creative about it sometimes find the you</font>

1098
00:51:09,910 --> 00:51:15,250
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> find the amount of available</font>

1099

1100
00:51:15,250 --> 00:51:19,750
from the from the colonel we need to

1101
00:51:17,980 --> 00:51:21,400
boot for some stuff so you don't you

1102

<font color="#E5E5E5">don't want to go out of bounds because</font>

where the colonel isn't useful<font color="#E5E5E5"> number</font>

1106
00:51:27,810 --> 00:51:35,020
and if you can do the routine<font color="#E5E5E5"> size rice</font>

1107
00:51:31,510 --> 00:51:37,210
and everything else and I decided<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1108
00:51:35,020 --> 00:51:39,810
attack at cisco table because it's the

00:51:37,210 --> 00:51:42,340
easiest method there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> no point is</font>

1110
00:51:39,810 --> 00:51:45,520
complicating it's very easy to find the

<font color="#E5E5E5">calm and is it and then you call that</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">Cisco and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> start to get this is the same</font>

1116
00:51:55,990 --> 00:52:02,290
stuff so easy to find the the tournament

1117
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:11,140
system<font color="#E5E5E5"> early there is a function for for</font>

that and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> possible to told you it</font>

1119
00:52:11,140 --> 00:52:18,370
wasn't real every bit in<font color="#CCCCCC"> GMS and there</font>

1120
00:52:16,660 --> 00:52:19,810
are two solutions 14<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's a smart</font>

1121
00:52:18,370 --> 00:52:21,609
solution and there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> brute force</font>

solution<font color="#E5E5E5"> the smart solution is</font>

1123
00:52:21,610 --> 00:52:27,880
exploiting a subway of the car when<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

00:52:25,570 --> 00:52:31,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">your system starts there's nothing in</font>

1125
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:33,030
memory so<font color="#CCCCCC"> the colonel is put there in</font>

1126
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:35,860
memory and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's sleep somewhere</font>

1127
00:52:33,030 --> 00:52:38,200
depending<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the offset so what you can</font>

1128
00:52:35,860 --> 00:52:41,380
do you can read the dress where the

1129
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:44,169
colonel is from to this that is the

1130
00:52:41,380 --> 00:52:47,890
original address<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the system then</font>

1131
00:52:44,170 --> 00:52:50,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're the slide so we know where the</font>

1132
00:52:47,890 --> 00:52:51,970
colonel is in virtual memory what you

1133
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:56,049
can do you clear the highest<font color="#E5E5E5"> 32 bit</font>

1134
00:52:51,970 --> 00:52:59,500
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of physical memory you have 32</font>

1135
00:52:56,050 --> 00:53:02,800
bits there and you know what is very

1136
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:04,330
easy trick to get the physical location

1137
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:07,570
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can use the brute</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> force solution</font>

1138
00:53:04,330 --> 00:53:09,340
which is start from zero go to to the

1139
00:53:07,570 --> 00:53:12,220
amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of system and find where the</font>

1140
00:53:09,340 --> 00:53:15,880
perilous these winter problem was right

1141
00:53:12,220 --> 00:53:18,279
and remember the<font color="#CCCCCC"> time yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this works on</font>

1142
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:22,050
TBN first time I were put on a physical

1143
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:25,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">machine and there is a reason of course</font>

1144
00:53:22,050 --> 00:53:27,580
you have machines exceptions which is

1145
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:29,290
you have a lot of stuff devices and

1146
00:53:27,580 --> 00:53:31,360
everything that is mapped on physical

1147
00:53:29,290 --> 00:53:33,430
memory unusual you're very lower oil

1148
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:35,470
prices so if you try to read from that

1149
00:53:33,430 --> 00:53:38,710
stuff Colonel back this is the reason

1150
00:53:35,470 --> 00:53:40,779
why<font color="#CCCCCC"> you cannot do this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in Kitty paw</font>

1151
00:53:38,710 --> 00:53:44,020
machine these are<font color="#CCCCCC"> some drinks</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that left</font>

1153
00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:48,550
what I told me<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> language space</font>

1154
00:53:45,940 --> 00:53:50,440

1155
00:53:48,550 --> 00:53:53,710
headers and the data segments you can

1156
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:55,960
put stuff there for example in May

1157
00:53:53,710 --> 00:53:58,840
braids it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> enough you cannot put a</font>

1158
00:53:55,960 --> 00:54:01,180
rootkit<font color="#E5E5E5"> there for good kids and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

1159
00:53:58,840 --> 00:54:03,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">might at least have that version 2.0</font>

1160
00:54:01,180 --> 00:54:06,160
there is enough funds you can come to a

1161
00:54:03,070 --> 00:54:07,650
good hitter so it depends usually my

1162
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:10,200
solution or my best

1163
00:54:07,650 --> 00:54:13,680
put a small shellcode colgate memory and

1164
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:16,620
put everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> there just a warning that</font>

1165
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:23,160
night sessions are not wired as I<font color="#E5E5E5"> told</font>

1166
00:54:16,620 --> 00:54:26,339
you 32 p.m. we will get pinched folds if

1167
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:28,529
you want to use a shellcode to this k

1169
00:54:28,530 --> 00:54:34,830
get to continue you can use the normal

1170
00:54:31,430 --> 00:54:36,569
memory allocation but probably those

1171
00:54:34,830 --> 00:54:39,090
function is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not guaranteed</font>

1172
00:54:36,570 --> 00:54:41,820
that Vista memory it will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be continuous</font>

1173
00:54:39,090 --> 00:54:44,640
so you will need to find this piece of

1174
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:46,410
man where each page will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> located this</font>

1175
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:48,839
is too much work<font color="#E5E5E5"> there is a function</font>

1176
00:54:46,410 --> 00:54:50,670
that can tease you to give you physical

1177
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:53,760
memory that is<font color="#CCCCCC"> continue so why</font>

1178
00:54:50,670 --> 00:54:57,450
complicate what canvassing this is a

1179
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:59,580
shuttle we go there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and look but in</font>

1183

everything that you need to do good kids

1184
00:55:05,850 --> 00:55:16,319
there I'm saying find<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok fun</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

1185
00:55:14,340 --> 00:55:18,270
called table and you just there are some

00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:20,340
signatures for example<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know where a</font>

my bestie just once singing point detail

1196
00:55:43,770 --> 00:55:49,890
if you want to execute code and

1197
00:55:46,970 --> 00:55:52,830
multi-part<font color="#CCCCCC"> CPUs essentially everything</font>

1198
00:55:49,890 --> 00:55:56,819
and you is multi board we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of</font>

it was presented<font color="#CCCCCC"> by nima Frank article</font>

it<font color="#E5E5E5"> guarantees you execution on 12 cores</font>

1202
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:09,200
of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> machine so for example if you are</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">using the trick to visit cr0 register</font>

1204
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:15,509
you need to guarantee that execution is

1205
00:56:13,100 --> 00:56:18,330
happens on all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> course because this</font>

00:56:15,510 --> 00:56:20,190
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> racism is per core so for</font>

1207
00:56:18,330 --> 00:56:21,328
<font color="#E5E5E5">example it is about these not one car</font>

1208
00:56:20,190 --> 00:56:23,789
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> part is</font>

00:56:21,329 --> 00:56:26,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay but then another car price to</font>

1210
00:56:23,789 --> 00:56:30,359
execute get cold kernel panic because

<font color="#E5E5E5">dead car as a protection enabled so this</font>

1212
00:56:30,359 --> 00:56:46,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">is just a very small let me put another</font>

1213
00:56:33,359 --> 00:56:48,209
demo very weakly so<font color="#CCCCCC"> these are the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mighty</font>

1214
00:56:46,109 --> 00:56:54,259
that was released<font color="#E5E5E5"> this week and time</font>

1215
00:56:48,209 --> 00:56:54,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">plot for and this is the second portion</font>

1216
00:56:56,359 --> 00:57:03,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay once again the same put it by Road</font>

1217
00:57:00,779 --> 00:57:05,459
so it's for begging you can see takes a

1218
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:07,979
lot more time because it<font color="#E5E5E5"> because of the</font>

00:57:05,459 --> 00:57:11,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">64 bits maximum request so we need to</font>

1222
00:57:18,529 --> 00:57:24,269
it's there that was executed with using

1223
00:57:22,289 --> 00:57:26,069
these three so we can do<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same would</font>

1224
00:57:24,269 --> 00:57:33,019
keep bypassing all the protections that

1225
00:57:26,069 --> 00:57:35,640
there are against this<font color="#E5E5E5"> compulsions</font>

1226
00:57:33,019 --> 00:57:41,069
hopefully<font color="#CCCCCC"> i will convince you that or FX</font>

1227
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:43,979
cuties don't tell anyone crap total brat

1228
00:57:41,069 --> 00:57:45,959
there's the funny thing about this as<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

1229
00:57:43,979 --> 00:57:48,808
told you<font color="#E5E5E5"> i presented this first thing in</font>

1230
00:57:45,959 --> 00:57:51,239
japan and months ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> or something i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> got</font>

1231
00:57:48,809 --> 00:57:56,660
feedback and the first comment that they

1232
00:57:51,239 --> 00:57:59,910
sent me was from an attendee fi no web

1233
00:57:56,660 --> 00:58:02,368
will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be broken</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but it's not nice to call</font>

1234
00:57:59,910 --> 00:58:05,009
able to find that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i love this quote</font>

1235
00:58:02,369 --> 00:58:07,559
because i don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what what was the</font>

1236
00:58:05,009 --> 00:58:11,660
translation to japanese<font color="#E5E5E5"> punk wasn't that</font>

1237
00:58:07,559 --> 00:58:16,890
funny but because the guy was really

1238
00:58:11,660 --> 00:58:20,038
japanese that will be promotions I

1239
00:58:16,890 --> 00:58:22,140
hopefully<font color="#CCCCCC"> this your you are in these</font>

1240
00:58:20,039 --> 00:58:25,019
days the colonel extension code signing

1241
00:58:22,140 --> 00:58:27,509
as it is is useless because it's running

1242
00:58:25,019 --> 00:58:32,038
on on on reign three if they<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't put</font>

1243
00:58:27,509 --> 00:58:34,650
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> rings the bell rings you it's not</font>

1244
00:58:32,039 --> 00:58:37,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">Allah there is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> no pointing doing</font>

1245
00:58:34,650 --> 00:58:40,320
don't trust it as a security measure

1246
00:58:37,020 --> 00:58:42,630
there are some plots people telling case

1247
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:44,970
there is Colonel extension co-signing

1248
00:58:42,630 --> 00:58:48,510
it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> security feature dr. soon because</font>

1249
00:58:44,970 --> 00:58:50,430
it's useless and my question<font color="#E5E5E5"> whoever</font>

1250
00:58:48,510 --> 00:58:52,920
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> everything teacher</font>

1251
00:58:50,430 --> 00:58:54,540
dead why's it was even exist because if

1252
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:57,990
you are designing something to protect

1253
00:58:54,540 --> 00:59:00,300
at least give it requires some problems

1254
00:58:57,990 --> 00:59:03,149
that that I shall<font color="#CCCCCC"> be awarded a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> shortly</font>

1255
00:59:00,300 --> 00:59:05,670
there is no issue product advertised

1256
00:59:03,150 --> 00:59:08,100
policy for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> Apple releases</font>

1257
00:59:05,670 --> 00:59:10,170
patches for maple<font color="#E5E5E5"> correos mighty doesn't</font>

1258
00:59:08,100 --> 00:59:13,740
release the veggies except matches for

1259
00:59:10,170 --> 00:59:15,720
matrix so<font color="#CCCCCC"> even though I still run this</font>

1260
00:59:13,740 --> 00:59:18,930
laptop running kills my food on my plate

1261
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:20,970
that stuff is to<font color="#E5E5E5"> my friends I don't know</font>

1262
00:59:18,930 --> 00:59:24,330
for example they release a fiery<font color="#E5E5E5"> passion</font>

1263
00:59:20,970 --> 00:59:26,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Lyman which is a radio version but</font>

1264
00:59:24,330 --> 00:59:28,500
they don't release security patches so

1265
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:32,250
we don't know at least windows you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

1266
00:59:28,500 --> 00:59:34,170
and Microsoft's told you windows XP it's

1267
00:59:32,250 --> 00:59:36,450
that unless you pay 20 million light

1268
00:59:34,170 --> 00:59:38,400
than 80 to the US but this is there an

1269
00:59:36,450 --> 00:59:41,490
ordinance to know there will be no

1270
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:43,290
matches for for this essentially you

1271
00:59:41,490 --> 00:59:46,500
either upgrade or you more vulnerable

1272
00:59:43,290 --> 00:59:51,770
and even if you want bring your suit on

1273
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:55,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">rule because I end up in touch for a few</font>

1274
00:59:51,770 --> 01:00:00,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">Apple saw the presentation so it's it's</font>

1275
00:59:55,770 --> 01:00:03,360
great this is my<font color="#E5E5E5"> personal fight I tell</font>

1276
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:05,670
them<font color="#CCCCCC"> this a lot your strategy is</font>

1277
01:00:03,360 --> 01:00:08,550
essentially reactive<font color="#CCCCCC"> and not proactive</font>

1278
01:00:05,670 --> 01:00:11,160
and you know this why because I really

1279
01:00:08,550 --> 01:00:14,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">feel day on the e-file aight three or</font>

1280
01:00:11,160 --> 01:00:16,980
four weeks<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago and that will this be</font>

1281
01:00:14,280 --> 01:00:19,320
very surprisingly to me they release the

1282
01:00:16,980 --> 01:00:22,770
patch today if I<font color="#CCCCCC"> back so finally and</font>

1283
01:00:19,320 --> 01:00:24,780
they released to pop top<font color="#E5E5E5"> all machines</font>

1284
01:00:22,770 --> 01:00:26,700
for example final five year old machines

1285
01:00:24,780 --> 01:00:29,880
it really is the bed and then they<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

1286
01:00:26,700 --> 01:00:31,560
do this<font color="#E5E5E5"> while it is my personal</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> opinion</font>

1287
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:34,200
is that they had bad publicity because

1288
01:00:31,560 --> 01:00:38,580
that's the point everywhere they don't

1289
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:40,919
like publicity and so they react<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

1290
01:00:38,580 --> 01:00:44,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">issues there and they are not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> proactive</font>

1291
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:46,440
on that they try to be proactive for

1292
01:00:44,010 --> 01:00:48,059
example they kill to<font color="#CCCCCC"> protest but at</font>

1293
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:50,880
least the system like<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

1294
01:00:48,059 --> 01:00:54,809
now is a joke because we for example

1295
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:57,799
you've attached to the k xt process you

1296
01:00:54,809 --> 01:01:02,279
patch it these two words are still work

1297
01:00:57,799 --> 01:01:03,660
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know what they are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing if</font>

1298
01:01:02,279 --> 01:01:06,059
you want to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the gold</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Barry it's</font>
