uh anyone that doesn't understand the

<font color="#E5E5E5">Portuguese okay with me so yeah the book</font>

3
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:20,039
page about center then i'm recording

4
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:23,490
Dethklok talk more about it it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a tool</font>

5
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:27,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i started developing on my it's</font>

6
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:29,490
already more than two years ago this of

7
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:33,690
course of being not free time in my free

8
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:36,960
time but<font color="#E5E5E5"> still a sort of work so yeah</font>

9
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:41,730
this introduction my name and police

um so these are my<font color="#E5E5E5"> way my gloves and the</font>

13
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:59,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">single point about center I think I</font>

14
00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:09,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">Pamela working it cute grd these are</font>

15
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:15,479
some of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> main us I'm doing my work so</font>

16
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:21,689
well if you have a passion for any for

17
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:24,170
any of<font color="#CCCCCC"> these coming</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up to me later on so</font>

18
00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:30,000
let's start talking a little bit about

19
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:33,450
Cinco detectors in general yeah that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:37,170
realistic Safehold ejector suck they

21
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:42,030
suck big time and I'm going to explain

22
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:44,520
why first<font color="#E5E5E5"> of all all stopping or</font>

23
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:48,600
predictable vintage locations it's going

24
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:50,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be in a code embedded in ending file</font>

25
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:55,020
or at a new section with those

26
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:57,659
permissions blah blah blah so this is

27
00:01:55,020 --> 00:02:01,048
further they might just pass the entry

28
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:04,829
point just put the cross section jump do

29
00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:10,500
not sexual or just hoping a variety

30
00:02:04,829 --> 00:02:12,549
entry point code they<font color="#CCCCCC"> rely these are not</font>

31
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:15,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">properly hopefully starting</font>

32
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:18,550
rely on recognizing some common compiler

33
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:21,700
endpoints visual studio etc and they

34
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:24,310
just try to be no worth or<font color="#CCCCCC"> locations of</font>

35
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:26,679
the type<font color="#E5E5E5"> ingenico there instead</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of doing</font>

36
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:30,430
it directly in the entry point but all

37
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:33,280
this is very easy to find something<font color="#E5E5E5"> as I</font>

38
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:35,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">said my just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> had a huge section and this</font>

39
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:39,700
month I did appoint start executing

40
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:42,310
darkly there so they avoid very funny so

41
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:46,660
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> jump to another section directly in</font>

42
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:49,360
game point but of course using the

43
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:52,329
binary the first section is is the

44
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:56,520
section that falls basic double gold and

45
00:02:52,330 --> 00:03:00,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">gained upon the scores of the main one</font>

46
00:02:56,520 --> 00:03:02,880
so this is variability for a viscount's

47
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:06,730
of course you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got some you might help</font>

48
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:10,030
might have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a case of like just say other</font>

49
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:12,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">pillars whole back entry so the don't</font>

50
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:13,990
need to would<font color="#CCCCCC"> fire a three</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> point but</font>

51
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:16,030
finish the busy season to find the scan

52
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:19,000
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the degenerate can find the pointer</font>

53
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:24,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">that just goes come of course Pacific</font>

54
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:29,230
and a be a be smoother so what<font color="#CCCCCC"> can you</font>

55
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:31,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">do if you use one called Palos not</font>

56
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:33,730
totally busted there are many<font color="#E5E5E5"> vendors</font>

57
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:36,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">that can detect specific patterns of</font>

58
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:38,738
cell phone from generated from a display

59
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,260
usually<font color="#E5E5E5"> overset all-terrain x minus one</font>

60
00:03:38,739 --> 00:03:46,209
has the entry point of<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

61
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:50,470
similar so what kind of you then you

62
00:03:46,209 --> 00:03:53,020
have to go to<font color="#CCCCCC"> pillow so uniquely right</font>

63
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:55,780
execute permissions were you able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

64
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:58,330
it so there were two<font color="#E5E5E5"> usual just change</font>

65
00:03:55,780 --> 00:04:02,020
section permissions in specific section

66
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:03,580
where they have put it other peaceful in

67
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:10,080
already existing section in the cold

68
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:17,200
cave or they just create a new one yeah

69
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:20,410
so so<font color="#E5E5E5"> then a primo</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> rather sleep just use</font>

70
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:22,960
final exam other<font color="#CCCCCC"> phase at bay which is</font>

71
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:26,080
still not too bad but still look very

72
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:29,049
dynamic you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have my factory</font>

73
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:30,430
which it can read it maintained excuse

<font color="#CCCCCC">sure your circle but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is assuming</font>

76
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:40,719
you have bypass Vav in the it's not

77
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:42,639
mention about<font color="#E5E5E5"> bio factory uses the</font>

00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:48,219
the entry point and done through to my

80
00:04:45,969 --> 00:04:50,379
cell phone we start on the same style

81
00:04:48,219 --> 00:04:54,159
and it has been driving<font color="#CCCCCC"> second term</font>

82
00:04:50,379 --> 00:04:58,060
issues you can test this one you will

83
00:04:54,159 --> 00:05:04,000
see it's not really good and some

84
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:09,009
specified here so let's say this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is an</font>

85
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:12,370
achievement be fine so you have for

86
00:05:09,009 --> 00:05:16,690
example um an example I<font color="#E5E5E5"> cell phone</font>

87
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:19,240
interpre- they're going to point to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

88
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:21,400
code came first section and I feel you

have<font color="#E5E5E5"> any coding error that needs to be</font>

00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:28,448

00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:31,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">has specific permissions for each</font>

that's done from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> air 3.2 offended</font>

they're not mine doesn't have extra

101
00:05:54,039 --> 00:05:58,690
provisions you need execute if it's also

102
00:05:56,409 --> 00:06:02,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">called this because instead of full</font>

103
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:09,550
access or it gets us create initiation

104
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:12,639
with full access again really bad<font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font>

105
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:16,539
just change the permissions in random

106
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:21,719
section again politically vodka very

107
00:06:16,539 --> 00:06:27,219
which you find enough space so yeah it's

108
00:06:21,719 --> 00:06:30,039
totally bad but hopefully this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is where</font>

109
00:06:27,219 --> 00:06:35,050
I I come in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the game i decided to</font>

110
00:06:30,039 --> 00:06:38,649
totally change all this and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is my</font>

111
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:39,820
main motivation so<font color="#E5E5E5"> creates under is</font>

112
00:06:38,649 --> 00:06:45,490
truly dynamic

113
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:47,820
doesn't rely on static stuff for example

114
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:51,280
don't look<font color="#E5E5E5"> without passing a three-point</font>

115
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:56,080
cross sections on etc don't change<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font>

00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:58,659
<font color="#CCCCCC">you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> point to be in another section so</font>

117
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:01,270
not used to be the<font color="#CCCCCC"> base sometimes they</font>

118
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:03,190
use that main executable where they

119
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:06,099
usually in<font color="#CCCCCC"> take</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> their logical operators</font>

120
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:09,430
the loader loaded but then they have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

121
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:12,820
stick with from template which makes it

122
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:15,700
makes it more easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> to create a visa me</font>

123
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:19,390
inshallah but you<font color="#E5E5E5"> still need support in</font>

124
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:23,020
both payloads it's very important we

125
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:24,690
need to avoid relocation fix-ups you

126
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:27,520
can't<font color="#CCCCCC"> just inject anywhere in the binary</font>

127
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:31,330
because you might fall in the relocation

128
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:38,320
stable reference might break just modify

129
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:40,479
your code and of course we know so when

130
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:42,790
I just overwrite any code because my

131
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:48,370
might be said<font color="#E5E5E5"> no defined so that we pray</font>

132
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:51,580
for so-called run back and of course way

133
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:54,250
to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> a sign i'm as possible and still</font>

134
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:57,180
manage to arrive who are rejected code

135
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:59,890
without breaking execution before pinga

136
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:04,060
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that does not continue execution of</font>

137
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:06,580
the main application this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is us to</font>

138
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:09,220
bypass the<font color="#CCCCCC"> AVS as a pen tester we have</font>

problems<font color="#E5E5E5"> injected and got blowed it on</font>

140
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:15,130
your dinosaurs I do functionality to

141
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:17,800
actually continue but when the execution

142
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:21,640
of the main application is between to

143
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:23,830
fall back on the same or bad things that

<font color="#E5E5E5">all the others to append accord in</font>

00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:28,690
another section to these that I had some

146
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:31,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">ideas from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> dynamic and still have</font>

147
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:34,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">reading the same functionality but this</font>

148
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:39,330
is totally out of scope for this right

149
00:08:34,539 --> 00:08:43,809
now so some first steps<font color="#E5E5E5"> I started up</font>

150
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:48,700
2015 first release was in DC London may

151
00:08:43,809 --> 00:08:51,069
2015 then virus updates I added

152
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:52,089
different operation modes we said oh so

153
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:55,470
no answer

154
00:08:52,089 --> 00:08:58,360
I actually needed by the user always

155
00:08:55,470 --> 00:09:01,389
several<font color="#E5E5E5"> five six</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> years the musicians</font>

156
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:02,949
then I made one but compatible it has

157
00:09:01,389 --> 00:09:05,800
some issue the tracers or how to change

158
00:09:02,949 --> 00:09:08,229
some things I mean initially had two

159
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:11,589
periods ones as for window transas for

160
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:15,389
wine push compatible you back or fixing

161
00:09:11,589 --> 00:09:17,829
some issues then I Marisa I<font color="#E5E5E5"> come online</font>

162
00:09:15,389 --> 00:09:20,439
that's all the more important of the two

163
00:09:17,829 --> 00:09:22,779
others what makes mortgages friendly so

164
00:09:20,439 --> 00:09:27,459
it started as folk and then kept

165
00:09:22,779 --> 00:09:30,790
developing everything so moving on the

166
00:09:27,459 --> 00:09:33,180
automatic mode nouns can become a the

167
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:37,300
users of liquid understatement handlers

168
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:40,449
which means that Center basically does

169
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:43,149
it doesn't need to have for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example</font>

it is most more customizable now if you

we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to break the execution you</font>

don't affected the fair contest it

249
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:58,319
actually takes advantage of dynamical

00:13:56,490 --> 00:14:01,200
collects information from the actual

00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:04,080
really squished frog application it has

<font color="#E5E5E5">featuring so you can tell you later okay</font>

254
00:14:06,899 --> 00:14:11,820
at this<font color="#E5E5E5"> values would be the same every</font>

255
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:15,600
time round application so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

256
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:17,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">unique feature it was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> always there from</font>

257
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:21,630
the first thing is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> only difference</font>

258
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:24,180
was up to<font color="#CCCCCC"> quite there is some updates</font>

259
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:29,490
now so later that totally automates some

260
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:33,420
stuff and that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> ematic there it as a</font>

261
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:35,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">safe and exit with fine hole and receive</font>

262
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:40,170
a mooted applications you can just place

263
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:42,839
all the threads so it's more safe you

264
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:45,209
don't want to inject into a code that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

265
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:47,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">executed not fret and then might</font>

266
00:14:45,209 --> 00:14:52,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">overwrite partially if function is</font>

267
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:55,170
executed by a thread which is actually

268
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:56,760
executed before a friend up execute

269
00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:58,770
other part of the code or partially

270
00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:02,850
overrated so it's better to<font color="#CCCCCC"> keep track</font>

271
00:14:58,770 --> 00:15:05,339
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> four threads and as I said put my</font>

272
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:11,089
name in text from locations based on the

273
00:15:05,339 --> 00:15:16,339
execution flow so looks awesome not yet

274
00:15:11,089 --> 00:15:19,500
this is set a virtual for it introduces

275
00:15:16,339 --> 00:15:24,200
some awesome stuff and makes it even

276
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:27,360
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> user-friendly and better for a user</font>

277
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:31,680
so first update in fast injection

278
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:31,889
organization in auto mode so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going</font>

279
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:35,069
to

280
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:37,819
explain what this is so I to version 3.1

281
00:15:35,069 --> 00:15:41,608
in what we were using this in night mode

282
00:15:37,819 --> 00:15:44,819
we just use that location available from

283
00:15:41,609 --> 00:15:46,499
the list this is also<font color="#E5E5E5"> meaningful in</font>

284
00:15:44,819 --> 00:15:51,868
terms of how deep in the execution

285
00:15:46,499 --> 00:15:53,429
floating go so this is but in other mode

286
00:15:51,869 --> 00:15:56,189
because you want it's completely

287
00:15:53,429 --> 00:15:58,439
automatic set we just traced application

288
00:15:56,189 --> 00:16:00,179
for 30 seconds whatever it<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't raise</font>

290
00:16:00,179 --> 00:16:07,319
magic shield with the next stages so you

291
00:16:02,549 --> 00:16:10,799
don't have to interact with<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so a lot</font>

292
00:16:07,319 --> 00:16:13,169
of work<font color="#E5E5E5"> because sometimes you use that</font>

293
00:16:10,799 --> 00:16:15,569
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same machine you would basically</font>

294
00:16:13,169 --> 00:16:17,429
use the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same binary exact they're</font>

00:16:15,569 --> 00:16:19,709
different cellco that more or less has

296
00:16:17,429 --> 00:16:21,749
the same size and things like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> so in</font>

297
00:16:19,709 --> 00:16:23,099
30 seconds you might office not the more

298
00:16:21,749 --> 00:16:24,959
you might just always speak the same

299

injection locations in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same battery</font>

00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:33,809
different sessions from using the tool

301
00:16:27,089 --> 00:16:36,809
which totally makes sense so settle for

302
00:16:33,809 --> 00:16:38,850
randomizes this over a percentage of the

303

last available<font color="#CCCCCC"> section locations deep</font>

304
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:44,999
down in the execution flow so we'll just

305
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:47,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">take a percentage efficient use on one</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">brings us now to the proprietary got</font>

older it was about time to introduce

314
00:17:11,849 --> 00:17:21,839
this in point to explain why so does a

315
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:23,490
random selection of some operations the

316

generate the bit colder in an assembly

00:17:36,029 --> 00:17:40,139
decoder is not starting not even the

thread context-aware up on morse code

330
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:08,610
which makes it totally like obfuscated

331
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:10,980
during the live demo sponsored event

332
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:14,219
that brings us to their beds and that's

333
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:16,880
why<font color="#CCCCCC"> i had to introduce da corner before</font>

334
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:21,270
actually introducing embedded payloads

335
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:23,850
because as I said it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> good good hey</font>

336
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:26,280
don't encoded many companies recognize

338
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:32,040
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> hot first with the my own reporter so</font>

339
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:33,990
you have to figure the payload from

340
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:36,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">center and they said they will like a</font>

00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:40,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">cone and it will appreciate a decoder if</font>

342
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:46,770
you want which is recommended so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:49,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">the i am very basic Palos a lot of</font>

347
00:18:56,820 --> 00:19:02,070
probably do when you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to inject to</font>

348
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:07,110
upload the banner and probably need most

00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:11,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time I just need one of those can</font>

350
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:14,610
so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is an example vehicle TT is the</font>

351
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:17,159
binder where you won't<font color="#E5E5E5"> reject we serve</font>

as a pair of<font color="#E5E5E5"> method requested speaks and</font>

353
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:24,170
VIP support you say who said to set her

354
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:26,970
up on this<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> call it so encode</font>

355
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:30,780
about 100 people that the state will not

356
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:33,150
change section permissions I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

357
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:36,960
obfuscate it with older so in spoiling

358
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:42,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">older and also want to escape the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> portal</font>

359
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:51,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">stay 100</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so I have become passive fully</font>

360
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:54,970
yet and so this basement explanation of

361
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:57,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">why 33</font>

362
00:19:54,970 --> 00:20:00,530
so it's basically what that I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

363
00:19:57,380 --> 00:20:06,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">stride enough and this brings us to the</font>

364
00:20:00,530 --> 00:20:12,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">next version for reflected here others</font>

365
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:12,190
no just simple anymore you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

366
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:16,820
also pick on if I said there as well

367
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:19,790
it's going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be three there's a normal</font>

368
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:23,270
say both you can't exactly take the

369
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:25,280
other<font color="#CCCCCC"> end and go did it first of course</font>

370
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:29,960
text for the reflected<font color="#E5E5E5"> glory function so</font>

371
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:32,990
that together launch itself memory so

372
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:36,170
yeah now because us build something cool

373
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:39,220
in a in a small<font color="#CCCCCC"> tll like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this one dll</font>

374
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:42,590
file and put some basic functions there

375
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:44,930
like a mini riot or download and execute

376
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:46,879
sauce with the reason application be

377
00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:48,920
very handy so you still execute original

378
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:52,310
problem program<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a standalone</font>

379
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:55,490
applications someone and just maybe

380
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:57,070
that's more for a rating thing that so

381
00:20:55,490 --> 00:21:00,230
the downloader then it's going to

382
00:20:57,070 --> 00:21:02,600
download the<font color="#E5E5E5"> original executable back</font>

383
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:04,880
you will execute its only user will just

384
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:06,800
see the original one right<font color="#E5E5E5"> because you</font>

385
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:09,640
know just call<font color="#E5E5E5"> me a higher than lands</font>

386
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:11,899
like plus facile you kind it's more

387
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:15,140
flexible from the user people things

388
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:17,810
like that and this is an<font color="#E5E5E5"> example for</font>

389
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:21,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">usually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as I say the real oh is that one</font>

391
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:27,370

00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:28,110
arrives<font color="#CCCCCC"> there all you said there knows</font>

412
00:22:25,289 --> 00:22:31,220
what the key was and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> decoder it just</font>

413
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:35,668
needs to grab a pie from where it's time

414
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:37,500
we use it for you know if your

415
00:22:35,669 --> 00:22:40,320
extraction you have an analysis forth

416
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:42,990
just like I think try to emulate<font color="#E5E5E5"> over</font>

417
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:45,840
the loop<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the decoder is no key there</font>

418
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:48,350
unless you<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually execute the binary</font>

419
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:51,780
and you get to the point where the key

420
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:54,949
exists<font color="#CCCCCC"> none of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the registers you don't</font>

421
00:22:51,780 --> 00:23:02,220
know what they<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep going about the keys</font>

422
00:22:54,950 --> 00:23:04,760
so this is on by design permutations

423
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:09,080
that you can use when you use certain a

424
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:15,299
simple lines as having the paper holder

time moves slow down the execution

434
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:44,189
before you actually get<font color="#CCCCCC"> the payload or</font>

435
00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:48,750
you can tell something like that start

436
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:55,860
or you can have some meta so in this

437
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:57,690
case you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> any 800 I so so it means</font>

00:23:55,860 --> 00:24:00,840
that people need a special permission

439
00:23:57,690 --> 00:24:06,200
for anything so little holder can take

00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:31,050
the politics takes over and then you go

on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the payload and then a variation like</font>

00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:38,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">might turn out we might put i support</font>

467
00:25:34,530 --> 00:25:40,050
the reflective dealers might be a nice

468
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:42,300
thing for<font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> conscious focus he's</font>

00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:52,490
into an application<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it hold it so so</font>

471
00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:56,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm going to pass to do some live demos</font>

472
00:25:52,490 --> 00:26:00,140
right now I believe that's what you must

473
00:25:56,340 --> 00:26:00,139
be expecting

474
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:39,500
so just for testing right so I get a lot

475
00:26:37,850 --> 00:26:42,260
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people who want to use this from cali</font>

477
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:53,360
i also saw this using the<font color="#CCCCCC"> tools on both</font>

478
00:26:48,430 --> 00:26:56,620
so just are the silence makes more sense

479
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:56,620
for most of the beauties

480
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:29,340
gosh so yeah right so I have some<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort</font>

have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> windows relation I mean I sold</font>

486
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:51,300
some programs just going to pick<font color="#E5E5E5"> up the</font>

generate they are small girl standalone

489
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:59,340
you need used on the run applications

490
00:27:55,890 --> 00:28:02,430
anyway and they are very<font color="#CCCCCC"> good but not</font>

491
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:07,560
alone small on<font color="#E5E5E5"> how to clear bias from</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">Adam kilobytes awesome of course this</font>

493
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:12,149
leave<font color="#E5E5E5"> it to you what what you can inject</font>

494
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:16,470
I mean you want to inject the other girl

495
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:22,140
L this one<font color="#CCCCCC"> metal bike you can use a pick</font>

496
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:27,060
up something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that can feel right alright</font>

497
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:30,320
so let me just use<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's just ejection or</font>

498
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:30,320
most people know about

499
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:44,520
so our self in the mic then so the

500
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:47,610
options individual and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can use</font>

501
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:49,980
automated<font color="#E5E5E5"> mode to utter command line</font>

502
00:28:47,610 --> 00:28:52,139
into everything the other mode can also

503
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:55,260
work<font color="#E5E5E5"> falcom online in that case just</font>

504
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:58,020
automates everything just requires from

505
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:59,970
you that the basic<font color="#E5E5E5"> input but the you can</font>

506
00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:03,590
just customized to<font color="#CCCCCC"> home online and maybe</font>

507
00:28:59,970 --> 00:29:11,990
not enable an optional or something else

508
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:11,990
minority just totally specify everything

509
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:22,560
so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is actually passed if you put a</font>

510
00:29:19,170 --> 00:29:26,070
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Nashira the vessel gas will</font>

511
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:27,870
gather dynamics information this is used

512
00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:31,100
if you want to later use as a set an

513
00:29:27,870 --> 00:29:33,889
unfair context keys and things like that

514
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:37,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm not going to use that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I things now</font>

515
00:29:33,890 --> 00:29:44,730
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next example of so this is work</font>

516
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:46,850
so number of distractions just put<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

517
00:29:44,730 --> 00:29:49,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">number of instructions actually referred</font>

518
00:29:46,850 --> 00:29:51,990
instructions is<font color="#CCCCCC"> hadley</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> being fine it</font>

519
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:54,050
actually traces a lot more on what you

520
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:56,760
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to see but it ignores</font>

521
00:29:54,050 --> 00:30:00,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">structures executed outside of the p5</font>

522
00:29:56,760 --> 00:30:03,480
doesn't care about which the task people

523
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:06,689
want to take 475<font color="#CCCCCC"> holborn racing so it</font>

524
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:09,330
can do it can take 475 point with real

525
00:30:06,690 --> 00:30:11,190
arm<font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> increasing and it will also</font>

526
00:30:09,330 --> 00:30:15,750
difficulty neighborhood is fine you will

527
00:30:11,190 --> 00:30:19,730
also to be circulated by ejecting dress

528
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:23,430
or friends yes so real-time pricing know

529
00:30:19,730 --> 00:30:25,170
so Tracy starts as I said these are

530
00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:30,810
effectively structures inside the be

531
00:30:25,170 --> 00:30:34,440
fine after the race<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a lot more of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

532
00:30:30,810 --> 00:30:37,020
beings very interesting racing I'm not

533
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:40,710
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to place follow them this config</font>

534
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:44,160
file on this one it's racially to be is

535
00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:47,730
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the morning trade</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you download the</font>

536
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:49,790
execution flow<font color="#E5E5E5"> so so better for an ATF</font>

537
00:30:47,730 --> 00:30:56,490
agent Weiss stuff

538
00:30:49,790 --> 00:31:00,240
so it's fine you can interact wait so

539
00:30:56,490 --> 00:31:02,400
it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to ask variable payload from</font>

540
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:04,620
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> leash to submit the castle</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I will</font>

541
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:08,309
submit your custom a payload<font color="#E5E5E5"> generated</font>

00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:20,059
very ready for<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

546
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:35,659
so I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to need this information</font>

547
00:31:47,179 --> 00:31:55,919
or a game up with whatever you want just

548
00:31:50,370 --> 00:32:03,178
to the fourth one so then what would be

549
00:31:55,919 --> 00:32:07,919
called the data etc and yes we do and do

550
00:32:03,179 --> 00:32:12,080
all do off<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ship oh yes you won't</font>

551
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:16,530
make as complex as we can so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's such a</font>

552
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:18,750
randomly and this stage may take a few

553
00:32:16,530 --> 00:32:20,668
seconds because doesn't use<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

554
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:24,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">startled right to retain and bind</font>

555
00:32:20,669 --> 00:32:27,480
everything together so it needs to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

556
00:32:24,630 --> 00:32:31,110
very accurate what does ancestry called

557
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:33,780
a dragon without following specific

558
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:42,600
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> while you break it context which</font>

559
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:44,940
is very important at<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> days right so</font>

560
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:46,649
12<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask if you want to use important</font>

561
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:48,179
dress type of handlers or the same

562
00:32:46,650 --> 00:32:51,120
section permissions I would say of

563
00:32:48,179 --> 00:32:54,030
course<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> won't take from stable</font>

564
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:56,159
handlers the binary supports these

565
00:32:54,030 --> 00:32:59,070
methods we see if it'll ever use aqua

566
00:32:56,160 --> 00:33:02,090
tank will not vary the preparedness and

567
00:32:59,070 --> 00:33:05,909
verified mapping Matthew<font color="#CCCCCC"> 05 combinations</font>

568
00:33:02,090 --> 00:33:09,059
so let's try great fight puppy crate on

569
00:33:05,910 --> 00:33:12,390
moving and then mar 05 what people would

570
00:33:09,059 --> 00:33:14,520
use which all other but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't painting</font>

571
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:18,299
and it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to ask if you were top</font>

572
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:20,850
state but under as well yes would all

573
00:33:18,299 --> 00:33:25,940
say that work so we make it us

574
00:33:20,850 --> 00:33:25,939
polymorphic and then I'm as possible

575
00:33:41,809 --> 00:33:46,769
tasty said it was freshman<font color="#E5E5E5"> being</font>

577
00:33:46,769 --> 00:33:52,649

00:33:50,490 --> 00:33:55,529
<font color="#CCCCCC">pity to be very accurate what 10 raised</font>

580
00:33:55,529 --> 00:34:01,139
but i'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to prevent point more</font>

581
00:33:56,940 --> 00:34:04,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">people this refers to polymorphic time</font>

582
00:34:01,139 --> 00:34:07,439

584
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:11,820
everything else is to slow down before

585
00:34:09,418 --> 00:34:16,888
<font color="#CCCCCC">we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually enter</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> meaningful code a</font>

587
00:34:16,889 --> 00:34:23,070
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use up let the end wait for us</font>

588
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:26,480
when you use the engine and let's say

589
00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:32,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">generate 300 bites approach something of</font>

590
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:35,460
polymorphic tackle this is even more

591
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:42,389
random because doesn't really care fed

592
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:45,300
context and it give us a note<font color="#E5E5E5"> Oh 27</font>

593
00:34:42,389 --> 00:34:47,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">inches for example if I say yes it says</font>

594
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:50,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">that for now you have like 60 locations</font>

595
00:34:47,099 --> 00:34:52,919
available certain technique and you can

596
00:34:50,339 --> 00:34:56,359
see actually those distractions for

597
00:34:52,918 --> 00:35:02,220
example I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> put on it so let</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me start</font>

598
00:34:56,359 --> 00:35:06,630
started<font color="#E5E5E5"> 30 and platform so it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just shows</font>

599
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:11,939
you a list of addresses and what are

600
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:13,980
their aerial structures are so big one

601
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:25,200
look how will the school the last one is

602
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:28,170
fine so where is no right<font color="#CCCCCC"> then so what</font>

603
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:33,020
we need to do now is of course need to

604
00:35:28,170 --> 00:35:33,020
start there nice hungry here

605
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:41,850
in the meantime going to transfer the

606
00:35:38,650 --> 00:35:41,850
spider into the windows

607
00:36:01,479 --> 00:36:16,450
try to call you basic right

608
00:36:25,090 --> 00:36:33,630
this is my host Mike recession ended<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font>

609
00:36:29,410 --> 00:36:33,629
fighting here so

610
00:36:45,349 --> 00:36:51,999
I go back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

611
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:09,150
right

612
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:16,800
so another execute binary from here<font color="#CCCCCC"> 20</font>

613
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:24,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">some time machines right that's us for a</font>

614
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:41,099
few was just very<font color="#CCCCCC"> delayed or it's still</font>

615
00:38:24,569 --> 00:38:45,440
probably oh yeah I'm forgot to configure

616
00:38:41,099 --> 00:38:45,440
my my settings here

617
00:39:06,829 --> 00:39:32,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so but it's not simple as that how</font>

618
00:39:30,930 --> 00:39:35,819
to show you what the heck<font color="#CCCCCC"> is going on</font>

619
00:39:32,730 --> 00:39:41,880
otherwise you say that silly things that

620
00:39:35,819 --> 00:39:48,420
don't do I don't like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that so I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

621
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:50,700
to go we have here the brittle address

622
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:52,589
and the object of we're actually a cold

623
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:55,348
<font color="#E5E5E5">who's detective we're going to examine</font>

624
00:39:52,589 --> 00:39:58,109
this we followed butter so that you

625
00:39:55,349 --> 00:40:01,980
actually see what's going on well that's

626
00:39:58,109 --> 00:40:04,819
poking into a<font color="#E5E5E5"> point so I'm going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to 47</font>

627
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:04,819
654

628
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:17,200
right

629
00:40:27,190 --> 00:40:36,970
right so<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay this is very bad so this</font>

630
00:40:34,510 --> 00:40:40,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">is a sample of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sample I doesn't care</font>

631
00:40:36,970 --> 00:40:41,980
about colleagues now you're going to see

632
00:40:40,150 --> 00:40:44,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">that some random or subjected clear</font>

633
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:46,900
example just random locations and then

634
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:50,319
since returning back doesn't get about

635
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:53,859
that have<font color="#CCCCCC"> some time to looks here that's</font>

636
00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:56,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">a good</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep looking at doing some</font>

637
00:40:53,859 --> 00:40:59,170
random stuff as I<font color="#E5E5E5"> said it here doesn't</font>

638
00:40:56,589 --> 00:41:01,420
care about Fred context more looking

639
00:40:59,170 --> 00:41:05,770
code<font color="#CCCCCC"> here is full</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> two totally different</font>

640
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:08,260
this time some random poll is exactly

641
00:41:05,770 --> 00:41:13,089
that poor random fake functions in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

642
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:17,710
binary this is all one more time code it

643
00:41:13,089 --> 00:41:24,359
doesn't care about execution flow of the

644
00:41:17,710 --> 00:41:26,920
application and somewhere here fine but

645
00:41:24,359 --> 00:41:30,578
so somewhere here I believe it's the

646
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:33,280
beginning of the obfuscating hundred on

647
00:41:30,579 --> 00:41:34,960
Tuesday or the dress table functions to

648
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:37,210
allocate memory where<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can copy your</font>

649
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:39,280
<font color="#E5E5E5"> out there and start XP so I think</font>

650
00:41:37,210 --> 00:41:44,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the first effect exception of</font>

651
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:47,470
the earth under 20 and then a lot of

652
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:52,329
randomized gold there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> another</font>

653
00:41:47,470 --> 00:41:54,189
effective structure here a lot of random

654
00:41:52,329 --> 00:41:59,349
is cold and then course played by

655
00:41:54,190 --> 00:42:01,569
mocking then randomized code whatever

656
00:41:59,349 --> 00:42:07,810
there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> another effective instruction</font>

657
00:42:01,569 --> 00:42:15,849
here randomizer again it's like not

658
00:42:07,810 --> 00:42:20,440
effective stuff there another here it's

659
00:42:15,849 --> 00:42:27,099
another one here and let's go downward

660
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:30,180
actual course module file finally so if

661
00:42:27,099 --> 00:42:30,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">I say the break one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font>

662
00:42:32,670 --> 00:42:41,950
right so course that and let me know

663
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:44,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">scroll down let me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> find</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a very rustic</font>

664
00:42:41,950 --> 00:42:47,200
but it actually cop is the set code this

665
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:51,040
is randomized called so uh yeah this is

666
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:55,779
going to copy the circle we're not all

667
00:42:51,040 --> 00:43:05,830
capable let me just use magnify so you

668
00:42:55,780 --> 00:43:10,090
can actually so let's go so the actual

669
00:43:05,830 --> 00:43:13,390
circle is located where<font color="#CCCCCC"> the organization</font>

670
00:43:10,090 --> 00:43:15,880
and it will trust ready to eat where<font color="#E5E5E5"> ed</font>

671
00:43:13,390 --> 00:43:18,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">I points which is possibly right action</font>

672
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:22,170
permission are allocated by combination

673
00:43:18,310 --> 00:43:22,170
of great value marking and pop you file

674
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:35,080
just going to copy everything there and

675
00:43:33,130 --> 00:43:41,620
then we're already here you just don't

676
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:45,670
and now so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> appreciated</font>

677
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:48,190
decoder so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the decoder that shelter</font>

678
00:43:45,670 --> 00:43:53,260
generated and then we decided<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay it</font>

679
00:43:48,190 --> 00:43:58,440
before so this is all shady be colder so

680
00:43:53,260 --> 00:44:01,450
let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> find some useful instructions here</font>

681
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:05,800
you see just called the next the next

682
00:44:01,450 --> 00:44:08,290
action<font color="#E5E5E5"> there is to find a place they</font>

683
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:12,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">calculate the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> relative</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> motion there is a</font>

684
00:44:08,290 --> 00:44:15,940
lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> time code and then invasion of</font>

685
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:21,250
Isis press that iron by state so let me

686
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:24,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">go buddy so there's a lot of let's find</font>

687
00:44:21,250 --> 00:44:27,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">some mad coding operations 20 so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

688
00:44:24,910 --> 00:44:30,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">a recording operation you see it as</font>

689
00:44:27,910 --> 00:44:31,839
something where API point soon we'd be

690
00:44:30,430 --> 00:44:35,950
another<font color="#E5E5E5"> registered which is randomized</font>

691
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:37,570
just happened here another VDI I points

692
00:44:35,950 --> 00:44:40,029
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> sell</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gold in the allocated memory</font>

693
00:44:37,570 --> 00:44:42,820
this is really<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the prospect target</font>

694
00:44:40,030 --> 00:44:43,730
before and this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not a hard</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> coding key</font>

695
00:44:42,820 --> 00:44:46,280
see that

696
00:44:43,730 --> 00:44:48,140
testament album game we didn't use the

697
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:53,270
non technical information from coalition

698
00:44:48,140 --> 00:44:58,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> key is reporting you can also see</font>

699
00:44:53,270 --> 00:45:01,730
here another operation there is charcoal

700
00:44:58,070 --> 00:45:06,380
there is no operation and other is an

701
00:45:01,730 --> 00:45:09,500
operation here so all these operations

702
00:45:06,380 --> 00:45:12,680
are very people<font color="#E5E5E5"> for every for bias so</font>

703
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:15,350
one operation for its like the random

704
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:20,868
number of operations / 4 bytes of the

705
00:45:15,350 --> 00:45:25,310
sailboats multiple holding here is

706
00:45:20,869 --> 00:45:27,410
another effective instruction then just

707
00:45:25,310 --> 00:45:31,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">a lot of junk off yet this is another</font>

709
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:44,119
other things and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I scroll</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> down to the</font>

711
00:45:44,119 --> 00:45:52,880
you see it has not coded the experts<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

712
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:59,990
home this is a main folder it initiated

713
00:45:52,880 --> 00:46:08,060
use exs come next<font color="#E5E5E5"> time happy but this is</font>

714
00:45:59,990 --> 00:46:09,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">an example so now I'd like to show doing</font>

715
00:46:08,060 --> 00:46:11,900
the magic by using dynamic<font color="#E5E5E5"> level</font>

716
00:46:09,950 --> 00:46:13,160
information so we don't have to cut for

717
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:17,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">the kill you don't you don't know what</font>

718
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:20,600
is the key you won't see<font color="#E5E5E5"> the key until</font>

719
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:22,220
you arrive at that point when one of the

720
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:26,890
registers that's going to be picked up

721
00:46:22,220 --> 00:46:26,890
will<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually call a colleague</font>

722
00:46:44,119 --> 00:46:55,470
so let's try going to use another binary

723
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:58,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to tell you this one are no</font>

district honorific MRC this is

725
00:46:58,470 --> 00:47:05,009
frequently megabytes sighs make you want

726
00:47:02,190 --> 00:47:07,380
smaller binary but you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> just use a</font>

727
00:47:05,010 --> 00:47:11,640
select random subtle only if you don't

728
00:47:07,380 --> 00:47:15,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">play with now now i'm going to use the</font>

729
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:22,759
command line so it is more meaningful to

730
00:47:15,839 --> 00:47:28,680
you as well so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> said target</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> which is</font>

731
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:31,549
MIT which has the payload can do with

00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:36,779
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular command if you want</font>

733
00:47:31,549 --> 00:47:41,759
let's say it is execute this is a window

734
00:47:36,780 --> 00:47:44,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">unit sick and I want the displace you</font>

735
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:48,990
can see any details to show another

736
00:47:44,069 --> 00:47:52,440
hello I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use the nograkh context</font>

737
00:47:48,990 --> 00:47:54,629
keys this implies that the cell<font color="#E5E5E5"> called</font>

738
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:56,789

739
00:47:54,630 --> 00:48:05,490
you don't need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to specify the specific</font>

740
00:47:56,789 --> 00:48:07,529

741
00:48:05,490 --> 00:48:09,209
the parts so it's more clear sunny man

742
00:48:07,529 --> 00:48:12,240
choice he had a<font color="#CCCCCC"> while ago fateful</font>

743
00:48:09,210 --> 00:48:15,329
becomes very complicated you cannot see

744
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:25,160
actually the real goal that was

745
00:48:15,329 --> 00:48:25,160
generated so<font color="#E5E5E5"> is this enough let me try I</font>

746
00:48:26,450 --> 00:48:36,629
am really specify also how we want you

747
00:48:31,170 --> 00:48:40,770
would start handing want to use someone

748
00:48:36,630 --> 00:48:44,660
specify important stable again which is

749
00:48:40,770 --> 00:48:44,660
that most dynamic best way to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

750
00:48:47,970 --> 00:48:54,520
so now the tools would bottom identity

751
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:58,089
for you so just<font color="#E5E5E5"> grace for about 30</font>

752
00:48:54,520 --> 00:49:00,250
seconds<font color="#E5E5E5"> and i will proceed by itself it</font>

753
00:48:58,089 --> 00:49:03,279
would choose<font color="#E5E5E5"> the encoding key from</font>

use at one point and code without value

756
00:49:06,809 --> 00:49:29,079
created colder bind them together and

757
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:32,470
carry one consejos left we didn't you

758
00:49:29,079 --> 00:49:34,960
say ok<font color="#E5E5E5"> sir so much faster you didn't</font>

759
00:49:32,470 --> 00:49:39,730
have to generate a lot of code<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

760
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:53,730
engines start like that so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

761
00:49:39,730 --> 00:49:53,730
bring this now again my host that's if

762
00:49:55,020 --> 00:50:06,430
my predecessors didn't together I'm

763
00:49:58,809 --> 00:50:14,470
surprised<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so so this now is just</font>

764
00:50:06,430 --> 00:50:22,569
supposed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to just lock and voila so what</font>

765
00:50:14,470 --> 00:50:26,379
I'm going to do now right so let's go

766
00:50:22,569 --> 00:50:30,190
back<font color="#E5E5E5"> and see how none decodes because</font>

767
00:50:26,380 --> 00:50:33,329
it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use a hard Kentucky so</font>

768
00:50:30,190 --> 00:50:33,329
I need to go back<font color="#CCCCCC"> and just</font>

769
00:50:37,079 --> 00:50:45,040
to see what is a days extra knockers so

770
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:49,869
can go about in the darkling lightweight

771
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:58,180
but now if there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> no education so</font>

772
00:50:49,869 --> 00:50:59,339
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to actually see it's of</font>

773
00:50:58,180 --> 00:51:03,270
course<font color="#E5E5E5"> your comment a beautification</font>

774
00:50:59,339 --> 00:51:05,170
because this kind of my fellow guard

775
00:51:03,270 --> 00:51:13,960
makes it very difficult to read

776
00:51:05,170 --> 00:51:29,440
detection skills so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> 6252 right so</font>

777
00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:33,099
again 60 right so there's no sched now

778
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:37,240
so it's clear it does cause low battery

779
00:51:33,099 --> 00:51:40,150
I paper others want to put a<font color="#CCCCCC"> breakpoint</font>

780
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:44,259
here to see it's very<font color="#E5E5E5"> clear not what</font>

781
00:51:40,150 --> 00:51:50,500
it's going to do just<font color="#CCCCCC"> gets the the other</font>

782
00:51:44,260 --> 00:51:54,190
super tall it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pull it then</font>

783
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:59,560
it's going to copy nothing there and now

784
00:51:54,190 --> 00:52:02,349
it was yes from the start<font color="#CCCCCC"> and this is</font>

785
00:51:59,560 --> 00:52:07,060
what it's going to be our key now it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

786
00:52:02,349 --> 00:52:08,859
<font color="#CCCCCC">get inside this is the actual value what</font>

787
00:52:07,060 --> 00:52:11,828
eh should have been a real vacation

788
00:52:08,859 --> 00:52:15,730
without no injection a lot more it's not

789
00:52:11,829 --> 00:52:19,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that Sarah Kuta event you see</font>

790
00:52:15,730 --> 00:52:26,859
some operations that work it up to

791
00:52:19,089 --> 00:52:29,849
involve this one so going to you see

792
00:52:26,859 --> 00:52:29,848
it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start phone</font>

793
00:52:31,790 --> 00:52:38,640
you know who CBS as a counter top in the

794
00:52:36,330 --> 00:52:43,440
game if the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Irish picked up as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a point</font>

795
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:46,080
about snow fight that's amazing so let's

796
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:48,690
see today's but you see that it uses the

797
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:54,360
value in years<font color="#CCCCCC"> to decoding this value is</font>

798
00:52:48,690 --> 00:53:02,180
not set by me if I go back and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> I start</font>

799
00:52:54,360 --> 00:53:05,550
everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> stoned again what happens is</font>

800
00:53:02,180 --> 00:53:09,990
before entering hunger the tons that

801
00:53:05,550 --> 00:53:12,990
memory allocation<font color="#E5E5E5"> and everything you see</font>

802
00:53:09,990 --> 00:53:18,270
it has a yet because at that

803
00:53:12,990 --> 00:53:22,890
moment it felt violent the decoder crazy

804
00:53:18,270 --> 00:53:24,480
use that file to encoding so before we

805
00:53:22,890 --> 00:53:26,310
need to shave that value of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a stock</font>

806
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:28,830
that's why we push on the stock and

807
00:53:26,310 --> 00:53:32,130
we're going to pump it up so i use it as

808
00:53:28,830 --> 00:53:34,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">a key when they go to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> meet so this one</font>

809
00:53:32,130 --> 00:53:38,340

00:53:48,060 --> 00:54:04,200
don't know any other to the kinetics

814
00:53:50,130 --> 00:54:06,540
about love so<font color="#E5E5E5"> but this attention about</font>

815
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:12,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">the thing with no need I called the key</font>

816
00:54:06,540 --> 00:54:12,140
of course this might have some<font color="#E5E5E5"> mom I</font>

817
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:22,770
never had a failure it was really risky

818
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:24,869
I didn't never fail to my my tests so

819
00:54:22,770 --> 00:54:27,540
we're welcome if you use<font color="#CCCCCC"> the spoon</font>

820
00:54:24,869 --> 00:54:32,670
you're welcome to to use that unfair

821
00:54:27,540 --> 00:54:35,400
context keys and see that<font color="#CCCCCC"> every</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we fail</font>

822
00:54:32,670 --> 00:54:39,300
but I never had a failing adults it

823
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:41,670
seems to be very sickening I do some

824
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:44,250
wine of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course on filtering something</font>

825
00:54:41,670 --> 00:54:49,730
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not random so no</font>

826
00:54:44,250 --> 00:55:00,870
which raised to minus<font color="#CCCCCC"> beta web so well</font>

827
00:54:49,730 --> 00:55:06,180
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can't very fit so Commerce time five</font>

828
00:55:00,870 --> 00:55:08,490
minutes yeah what am I think I'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

829
00:55:06,180 --> 00:55:12,509
let you ask some questions now do not

830
00:55:08,490 --> 00:55:14,009
have much time<font color="#E5E5E5"> that same way I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

831
00:55:12,510 --> 00:55:18,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">approve these binaries on the bar so</font>

832
00:55:14,010 --> 00:55:20,790
that if you want note the second one

833
00:55:18,930 --> 00:55:30,299
because if they use it oops casement so

834
00:55:20,790 --> 00:55:32,810
it's not but the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> one why not so</font>

835
00:55:30,300 --> 00:55:32,810
let's see

836
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:45,729
so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> know specific exemplar has also a</font>

837
00:55:43,029 --> 00:55:47,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">couple of false positives from somebody</font>

838
00:55:45,730 --> 00:55:55,690
vendors so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> were already</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two</font>

839
00:55:47,940 --> 00:55:58,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">detentions maybe was not the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> best</font>

840
00:55:55,690 --> 00:56:03,029
example but it's fine you can't blame

841
00:55:58,029 --> 00:56:03,029
your own see what results<font color="#E5E5E5"> she won't get</font>

842
00:56:12,510 --> 00:56:18,090
I'm already expecting top of results a

843
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:20,759
couple of detection at least because<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

844
00:56:18,090 --> 00:56:23,100
know this way she hated a driver just

845
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:33,150
original file its<font color="#E5E5E5"> kayla double for</font>

846
00:56:23,100 --> 00:56:51,620
bringing some<font color="#CCCCCC"> hospital it's fine our</font>

847
00:56:33,150 --> 00:57:00,810
clothing fine because it saves might not

848
00:56:51,620 --> 00:57:05,779
otherwise no<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't like so let me go</font>

849
00:57:00,810 --> 00:57:05,779
back in the second is to do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> from here</font>

850
00:57:07,610 --> 00:57:11,720
if it's something the sound box

851
00:57:22,210 --> 00:57:31,160

00:59:59,300 --> 01:00:09,380
so I'm going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> use think let's see what</font>

875
01:00:01,850 --> 01:00:10,910
happen should speak I lasting right I'm

876
01:00:09,380 --> 01:00:13,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to use it fully a little bit move</font>

877
01:00:10,910 --> 01:00:23,839
look one line no nothing just automate

878
01:00:13,910 --> 01:00:29,600
just give me<font color="#E5E5E5"> skin looking said</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I stop</font>

879
01:00:23,840 --> 01:00:39,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just select the payload latest it's</font>

880
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:41,359
live data for a fresh you so much you

881
01:00:39,770 --> 01:00:47,210
got goat sample some bars but only once

882
01:00:41,359 --> 01:00:49,310
again just that makes we use of

883
01:00:47,210 --> 01:00:53,020
educational and everything so makes

884
01:00:49,310 --> 01:00:57,320
their life very hard that's all<font color="#CCCCCC"> I want</font>

885
01:00:53,020 --> 01:01:02,119
ok so this for hope let's do the gates

886
01:00:57,320 --> 01:01:07,250
of the quake soldered shut up versus the

887
01:01:02,119 --> 01:01:10,869
specs you continue to do everything by

888
01:01:07,250 --> 01:01:13,369
itself if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> use favorable combined</font>

889
01:01:10,869 --> 01:01:16,480
monthly neighbor for the features so it

890
01:01:13,369 --> 01:01:16,480
won't all skate everything

891
01:01:19,620 --> 01:01:32,770
for their cycles social vm so so it

892
01:01:29,230 --> 01:01:39,070
rather we beat up one of the methods to

893
01:01:32,770 --> 01:01:41,290
amuse me<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a lot of design and it's</font>

894
01:01:39,070 --> 01:01:49,540
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to now that we come with knowledge</font>

895
01:01:41,290 --> 01:01:51,490
being appreciated and it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to add</font>

896
01:01:49,540 --> 01:01:54,450
some polymorphic<font color="#CCCCCC"> on hold</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on top of</font>

897
01:01:51,490 --> 01:01:56,439
<font color="#CCCCCC">everything just for the sake of you to</font>

898
01:01:54,450 --> 01:02:02,490
execute more instructions before

899
01:01:56,440 --> 01:02:02,490
arriving to the effective<font color="#CCCCCC"> forms of done</font>

900
01:02:04,290 --> 01:02:15,690
so if i<font color="#CCCCCC"> just found Steve she takes some</font>

901
01:02:12,550 --> 01:02:20,470
time to actually ask you the commander

902
01:02:15,690 --> 01:02:26,590
is because of the of the turncoat we

903
01:02:20,470 --> 01:02:32,740
have actually depend and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> both so</font>

904
01:02:26,590 --> 01:02:47,460
let's add this thing to the bar spoken

905
01:02:32,740 --> 01:02:47,459
oh yeah that<font color="#CCCCCC"> Explorer does a long forgot</font>

906
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:11,380
hopefully we are going to being a better

907
01:03:03,759 --> 01:03:19,349
<font color="#CCCCCC">time a little who used by euro by here</font>

908
01:03:11,380 --> 01:03:25,869
or<font color="#E5E5E5"> javi maybe a nice</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> abs</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for tall people</font>

909
01:03:19,349 --> 01:03:36,549
like me I don't know there is justice

910
01:03:25,869 --> 01:03:58,950
patrol to take<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything so whether it</font>

911
01:03:36,549 --> 01:03:58,950
was very well so just wrap up everything
