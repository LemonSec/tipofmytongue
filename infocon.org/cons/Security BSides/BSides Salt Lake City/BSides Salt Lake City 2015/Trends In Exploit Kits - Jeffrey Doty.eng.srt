7
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:24,539
mad at me because I've got malware on my

00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:25,890
system and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they give me these emails and</font>

9
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:29,250
say hey you've got malware on your

19
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:53,399
what I'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be talking about today</font>

20
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:56,100
is malware and kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the evolution of</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">mauer especially exploit kits how</font>

22
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:00,809
malware has become monetized and crime

23
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:05,939
where's got into malware and is using it

24
00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:09,240
now these days so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we we've gone away</font>

27
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:18,090
using them for money perhaps not a guy

28
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:21,930
like that perhaps<font color="#E5E5E5"> he looks more like</font>

29
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:24,540
that or at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> he has this guy has</font>

talking about how these groups need

have defined organization they

powerful as nations I don't know if I

groups have more opportunity<font color="#CCCCCC"> to flex</font>

56
00:02:27,069 --> 00:02:33,250
their technical muscle because they're

call outs weren't to a central server

78
00:03:23,709 --> 00:03:28,120
that someone like<font color="#E5E5E5"> this burski could take</font>

down and and everybody wins so<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font>

80
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:32,530
peer-to-peer so they talked to all sorts

00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:35,890
of other compromised hosts in order to

82
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:37,239

88
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:54,910

00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:57,370
is back doing some stuff not as not edit

90
00:03:54,910 --> 00:04:01,180
the peak as what he once was but to show

91
00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:02,470
how how important these guys are and how

102
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:27,980
but uh yeah so he's popular and the

103
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:30,440
other reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> they started to make more</font>

104
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:33,430
money as they take they've<font color="#CCCCCC"> taken malware</font>

105
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:37,130
and they've made<font color="#CCCCCC"> it easy for</font>

106
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:39,050
non-technical users to use so kind of

107
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:42,020
like the<font color="#CCCCCC"> instant black hat or it's it's</font>

108
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:43,490
the photoshop elements of<font color="#E5E5E5"> photoshop so</font>

109
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:46,370
you basically if you have enough money

110
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:48,980
you can just buy everything you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need and</font>

111
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:53,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">you can be instantly owning a botnet and</font>

112
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:56,210
so will break these down so first you

113
00:04:53,150 --> 00:05:00,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">just gotta buy a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Trojan so here's</font>

114
00:04:56,210 --> 00:05:02,750
Citadel<font color="#E5E5E5"> here spy I as Zeus is a very</font>

115
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:05,840
popular one spy I the guy retired and he

116
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:08,240
sold his source code<font color="#E5E5E5"> pony is actually a</font>

117
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:10,039
downloader so they're a little bit

118
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,780
different they they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> mainly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

119
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:14,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">getting on the machine and then</font>

120
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:16,630
downloading warm<font color="#CCCCCC"> hour but you'll you</font>

121
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:19,250
won't get source code you'll just get a

122
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:21,530
builder like this so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can build a</font>

123
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:23,450
payload with all the settings<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

124
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:25,489
everything that you want so you buy the

125
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:27,380
button that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you buy the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Trojan and then</font>

126
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:29,150
you got to<font color="#E5E5E5"> buy a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> krypter because the</font>

127
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:32,030
source code<font color="#CCCCCC"> is known to all these ABS so</font>

128
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:35,150
they'll detect it so<font color="#CCCCCC"> krypter is it's a</font>

129
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:37,130
way of encrypting your mauer they'll

130
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:39,080
call it bud they'll call it fully

131
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:42,020
undetectable on these on these Russian

132
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:44,240
hacker forms but basically there's lots

133
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:46,909
of mechanics I can do to do this they

134
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:48,500
can throw in<font color="#CCCCCC"> AP</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is that don't mean</font>

135
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:50,390
anything they can throw in a random

136
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:52,160
assembly code into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the code that doesn't</font>

137
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:54,919
mean anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> but basically you're just</font>

138
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:56,510
trying to change<font color="#E5E5E5"> the hash enough and the</font>

139
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:59,390
signatures enough so they won't be

140
00:05:56,510 --> 00:06:02,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">detected and then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how we get you</font>

141
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:05,140

different settings run it through it

151
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:25,460
neyo<font color="#CCCCCC"> whole different hash and then you</font>

152

00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:29,210
you can get<font color="#E5E5E5"> just all the different</font>

154
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:30,590
hashes you could possibly want and so

155
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:32,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you see those some flighted</font>

156
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:35,929
numbers of look at all these malware

157
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:36,720
that's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> krypter you buy the exploit</font>

158
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:38,250
kit and<font color="#E5E5E5"> f</font>

159
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,860
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to go into deeper I'm an</font>

160
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:42,510
exploit kit basically just distribute to

161
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:45,600
malware on the internet this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the</font>

162
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:49,620
drive-by downloads essentially and then

163
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:50,880
you buy traffic you buy web traffic so

164
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:54,120
what does that mean has anyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> heard</font>

165
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:57,840
that before buying web traffic a couple

166
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:59,250
of people EDS exactly so there's some

167
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,349
malicious actors out<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the web that</font>

websites so that they will load whatever

187

00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:35,449
clearance aisle of Walmart because it's

225
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:39,689
the bad ass Brock's was a very popular

226
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:42,060
botnet was they still are I believe but

227
00:09:39,689 --> 00:09:44,300
the spam people they were paying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

228
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:47,008
deliver their payloads and their spam

229
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:49,769
suddenly stopped and now<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're just</font>

230
00:09:47,009 --> 00:09:51,660
delivering good old classic viagra spam

231
00:09:49,769 --> 00:09:53,519
and stuff like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I don't know if</font>

232
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:55,829
they lapsed in their payment to these

233
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:57,149
spam people or whatnot but but you can

234
00:09:55,829 --> 00:10:00,508
see how<font color="#CCCCCC"> they can just change around</font>

235
00:09:57,149 --> 00:10:02,550
really quickly so<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go into what the</font>

236
00:10:00,509 --> 00:10:04,949
exploit kit is the drive-by download i

237
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:08,849
kind of consider it like the opposite of

238
00:10:04,949 --> 00:10:12,240
a navy so what they'll do is they'll

239
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:13,230
rent an IP or server usually somewhere

240
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:16,350
where<font color="#CCCCCC"> we don't have a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font>

241
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:20,250
jurisdiction<font color="#CCCCCC"> Rob connect people yell at</font>

242
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:22,170
me now so like Russia or Ukraine or

243
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:24,689
somewhere where we can't do anything

244
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:27,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">about it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and then they'll wait for</font>

245
00:10:24,689 --> 00:10:29,459
someone to hit that site so to route EDS

246
00:10:27,149 --> 00:10:31,199
they go to a compromise website there's

247
00:10:29,459 --> 00:10:33,119
JavaScript on that page that loads

248
00:10:31,199 --> 00:10:36,029
something in the background or an iframe

249
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:37,829
or something like that and then they

250
00:10:36,029 --> 00:10:40,230
send you this big blob of just

251
00:10:37,829 --> 00:10:42,388
JavaScript and it's just a big ugly blob

252
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:45,180
of JavaScript and what that is it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> off</font>

253
00:10:42,389 --> 00:10:46,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">you skated JavaScript to obfuscate so</font>

254
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:49,800
you can't tell what it's trying to do

255
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:52,649
but once it actually runs it's basically

256
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:54,990
using the Java or JavaScript library

257
00:10:52,649 --> 00:10:58,230
called plugin<font color="#E5E5E5"> detect and it's looking</font>

258
00:10:54,990 --> 00:11:00,509
for the plugins in your web browser so

259
00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:00,810
like java and flash and a PDF<font color="#E5E5E5"> and stuff</font>

260
00:11:00,509 --> 00:11:02,730
like

261
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:05,369
and when it finds one that's vulnerable

262
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:08,400
to an exploit they'll give you an X

263
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:10,080
plate along with a downloader that can

264
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:14,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">just download the malware that your</font>

265
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:16,110
choice<font color="#E5E5E5"> so this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the dashboards a lot</font>

266
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,910
of these come with dashboard so you can

267
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:21,690
see your statistics so this is blackhole

268
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:23,760
exploit kit so you can see get the type

269
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:26,880
of os's you're hitting the type of

270
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:29,210
browsers and the exploits the big

271
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:32,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">security number up there is the</font>

272
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:34,440
percentage of extra successful exploits

273
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:36,990
you've gotten they'll always advertise

274
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:38,580
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the on the hacker forums like you'll</font>

275
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:41,220
get twenty-five percent of<font color="#E5E5E5"> all your</font>

276
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:44,370
traffic will be exploited<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then you</font>

277
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:45,870
always<font color="#E5E5E5"> find a ton more forum posts from</font>

278
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:47,910
people complaining about like yeah I

279
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:51,720
only get like twelve percent and then

280
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:53,430
they're all upset so from<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I've</font>

281
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:55,320
gauged is like really from twelve to

282
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:58,260
fifteen percent is really what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font>

283
00:11:55,320 --> 00:12:01,400
you normally these are the all the

284
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:03,960
exploits that are being successful and

285
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:05,610
there's become a marketplace for this so

286
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:07,170
all these people<font color="#E5E5E5"> are competing for other</font>

287
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:10,860
people's business I mean it's a

288
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:12,870
legitimate capitalist market of just<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

289
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:15,540
ever does the best exploit kit win and

290
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:17,070
so they pride themselves on on who's got

291
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:19,020
the best exploit<font color="#CCCCCC"> kid and who off you</font>

292
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:21,990
skates<font color="#E5E5E5"> their JavaScript best and we can</font>

293
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:23,819
change as much this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is old serenity</font>

294
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:25,860
exploit kit they're gone now but they

295
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:28,350
used to do their own black cat version

296
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:30,960
of virus pool so you could<font color="#CCCCCC"> take your</font>

297
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:32,910
payload your your payload you've crypt

298
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:36,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">and everything and you can see which</font>

299
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:39,290
anti viruses are detecting it perfectly

300
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:42,089
blackhole exploit kit did this as<font color="#E5E5E5"> well</font>

301
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:43,709
and the second<font color="#E5E5E5"> few of them start to</font>

302
00:12:42,089 --> 00:12:46,440
detect they'll change your payload for

303
00:12:43,709 --> 00:12:48,359
you so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> won't get detected by</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> abs and</font>

304
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:51,180
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's lots of other things that</font>

305
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:53,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">they've done angler exploit kit did the</font>

309
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:02,820
say hey come get our exploit kit we will

310
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:04,560
send you a<font color="#E5E5E5"> hundred and fifty thousand</font>

00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:09,030
unique visitors to your exploit kit a

312
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:11,939
day who<font color="#CCCCCC"> knows if that was true but</font>

313
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:13,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's what they claimed and then we</font>

314
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:14,590
can't go on<font color="#CCCCCC"> without talking about black</font>

315
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:17,950
hole black hole

316
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:21,790
exploit kid is was the king of black

317
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:23,440
exploit kits a lot of babies even today

318
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:25,180
when they detect an exploit kit they'll

319
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:28,120
call it black hole even though black

320
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:29,979
hole is gone and there was some

321
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:33,100
competing for him but<font color="#CCCCCC"> he</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really was the</font>

322
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:35,260
king he made it sexy he made it

323
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:37,210
efficient he was really well done and

324
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:40,270
then he took all that money he created

325
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:42,550
cool exploit kit and so it to do an

326
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:44,470
analogy like this is the toyota camry of

327
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:46,839
exploit kits this would be the<font color="#E5E5E5"> mercedes</font>

328
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:48,640
bed so he claimed he took a hundred

329
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:51,730
thousand dollars<font color="#CCCCCC"> and bought a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bunch of</font>

330
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:53,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">zero days you know this was gonna it was</font>

331
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:56,110
a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> more expensive to rent than the</font>

332
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:58,090
other ones 500 a month you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> prepared</font>

333
00:13:56,110 --> 00:14:00,310
to like 10,000 a month for cool exploit

334
00:13:58,090 --> 00:14:04,000
kid we<font color="#E5E5E5"> always thought that this was</font>

335
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:05,859
going to be the<font color="#CCCCCC"> judgement</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> day when these</font>

336
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,080
all these<font color="#E5E5E5"> zero days start flooding out</font>

337
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:12,250
to the internet from<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool exploit kit it</font>

338
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:16,000
never happened<font color="#CCCCCC"> i just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i think it</font>

339
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:17,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">was all bs I just you know when someone</font>

340
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,450
offers a product that's more expensive

341
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:21,310
but basically the same thing you<font color="#E5E5E5"> always</font>

342
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:23,350
get some people who<font color="#E5E5E5"> will pay for that</font>

343
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:25,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">more expensive product and I think</font>

344
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:27,790
that's what he<font color="#E5E5E5"> was doing there</font>

345
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:30,460
unfortunately the guy who ran blackhole

346
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:34,089
exploit kid his name a punch he got

347
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:37,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">arrested that's sexy devil there that's</font>

348
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:41,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">Podge that that guy kept me employed</font>

349
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:43,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">ponch is like russian slang for all you</font>

350
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:46,469
might know<font color="#CCCCCC"> its russian slang for like</font>

351
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:48,880
fat or<font color="#CCCCCC"> donut or something like that and</font>

352
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:50,350
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> people got offended by that but I</font>

353
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:55,390
kids his own name he called himself

354
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:57,460
punch so so so when he got arrested the

355
00:14:55,390 --> 00:15:00,280
market<font color="#CCCCCC"> just exploded so there was the</font>

356
00:14:57,460 --> 00:15:05,010
king was was gone and now everyone was

357
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:05,010
free to fill in that market and

358
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:13,150
everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> started taking off from there</font>

359
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:14,680
so so when I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was younger at play and I</font>

360
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:16,720
well when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I first</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> started working at</font>

361
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:19,229
blue coat I've been there about two and

362
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,230
a half years now

363
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:25,079
these extra like it's even black hole

364
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:27,329
were so much simpler and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they were easy</font>

365
00:15:25,079 --> 00:15:30,569
to detect and I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was just an</font>

366
00:15:27,329 --> 00:15:33,959
infosec super guy because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I could detect</font>

367
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:36,990
the thing is a comp is a website

368
00:15:33,959 --> 00:15:40,010
compromised and leading to exploit kits

369
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:42,750
it was quite easy just<font color="#CCCCCC"> use source and</font>

370
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:44,250
the scroll bar on the on the window

371
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:47,279
would go really tiny because at the very

372
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:50,040
top or bottom you'd see this script with

373
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:52,230
an eval call and this incredibly long

374
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:55,139
parameter and that's basically the

375
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:57,300
office<font color="#E5E5E5"> gated code so it was 100% easy</font>

376
00:15:55,139 --> 00:16:01,230
every time to figure out if these sites

377
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:06,209
were calm polite it was almost always

378
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:08,070
WordPress pages bar<font color="#CCCCCC"> none any other</font>

379
00:16:06,209 --> 00:16:09,119
website it was very rare<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see any of</font>

380
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:12,240
the other type of website could

381
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:13,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">compromise they mostly did java java</font>

382
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:16,920
java java and it was all just<font color="#CCCCCC"> java</font>

383
00:16:13,949 --> 00:16:18,689
exploit and then creating the signatures

384
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:21,209
were so<font color="#E5E5E5"> much</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> easier cuz that's what i do</font>

385
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:22,889
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bluecoat oh i'll find these Mauer and</font>

proxy so they protect our customers from

it they would use strings that were

391

completely unique on the internet we see

392

00:16:42,329 --> 00:16:45,449
like that it's ridiculous we basically

395
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">see a good portion of the internet and</font>

they would use strings that were

400
00:16:57,740 --> 00:17:03,269
Cal security he does this blog where he

401
00:17:00,449 --> 00:17:06,780
talked about the<font color="#E5E5E5"> most wanted exploit its</font>

402
00:17:03,269 --> 00:17:09,720
and he doesn't miss a wild wild<font color="#E5E5E5"> west</font>

403
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:11,579
presentation so the market kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

404
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:13,500
exploded so here's a lot of the popular

405
00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:15,178
exploit kits they're out now<font color="#E5E5E5"> he used to</font>

406
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:17,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">be black hole at maybe a couple other</font>

407
00:17:15,179 --> 00:17:20,339
players and now there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a ton of</font>

408
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:22,889
them some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the big ones rig exploit</font>

409
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:26,458
kits yes to exploit kits sweet orange

410
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:28,860
angler like I<font color="#CCCCCC"> said to the zero days just</font>

411
00:17:26,459 --> 00:17:30,020
big popular<font color="#E5E5E5"> women and then we'll see a</font>

412
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:32,780
lot of them that will

413
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:34,700
go so they'll come and then they'll

414
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:37,730
disappear for a while and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then they'll</font>

415
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:41,210
come back eventually<font color="#CCCCCC"> Styx exploit kit</font>

416
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:43,520
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> gonga</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is a Chinese exploit kit</font>

417
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:46,220
it's been around for several years<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

418
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:48,070
it just shows up<font color="#E5E5E5"> does some work and then</font>

419
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:50,390
it disappears and we don't see it again

420
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:52,040
so it's hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep track of these when</font>

421
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:54,470
they keep disappearing and coming back

422
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:56,750
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> all that and then there's a ton</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

423
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:58,730
just never come back at all<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

424
00:17:56,750 --> 00:18:01,130
these exploit kits are decently easy to

425
00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:04,720
write it's just plug and detect and then

426
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:07,100
a database<font color="#E5E5E5"> back-end it's pretty simple</font>

427
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:09,620
so we see newcomers come on to the

428
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:11,300
market and then they'll shoot up into

429
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:12,979
the market<font color="#E5E5E5"> be incredibly popular and</font>

430
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:15,470
then they'll just die<font color="#CCCCCC"> and go away</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and we</font>

431
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:18,830
never sleep already and so there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font>

432
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:22,310
that come and go<font color="#CCCCCC"> away and we never</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font>

433
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:25,909
again in tactics like did<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was a</font>

434
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:27,470
good one I get really<font color="#E5E5E5"> I like to</font>

435
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:33,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">reminisce and look at these old exploit</font>

436
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:38,030
kids Oh miss you but there's a lot and

437
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:39,800
there's a lot and there's a lot lots of

438
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:41,840
exploit did it is difficult to keep them

439
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:44,629
straight so a lot of these are sold on

440
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:46,639
underground markets hacker markets so

441
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:49,940
they have some type of marketing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

442
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:51,800
graphic design sticks exploit kit was

443
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:54,560
actually the first one to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have an open</font>

444
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:56,330
web site it was stick script calm and

445
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:58,129
you could just<font color="#E5E5E5"> go there to buy the</font>

446
00:18:56,330 --> 00:18:59,240
exploit get open on the web you<font color="#E5E5E5"> didn't</font>

447
00:18:58,130 --> 00:19:01,970
have to go through<font color="#CCCCCC"> Tory you didn't have</font>

448
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:05,390
to go on a Russian Heinrich form they

449
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:10,130
called it a browser vulnerability stress

450
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:12,130
tester so if they have a logo it's easy

451
00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:15,740
to keep track of em they're sweet orange

452
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:18,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">rig this was my favorite they're gone</font>

453
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:22,280
now but crying boss how cool is that you

454
00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:24,530
know you got a gun and<font color="#E5E5E5"> monies and and I</font>

455
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:30,020
don't know what phone that is it says

456
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:33,770
2012 up there I<font color="#E5E5E5"> take an old google phone</font>

457
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:37,150
yeah yeah the coke down of course a

458
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:37,150
crime boss has<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have code</font>

459
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:44,820
there used to be exploit kid called paw

460
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:47,730
pads exploit<font color="#CCCCCC"> get mainly because it</font>

461
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:49,740
exploited a web analytics company called

462
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:50,970
paw pads the paw pads that show<font color="#CCCCCC"> up in</font>

463
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:54,210
your browser that annoying and you

464
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:57,360
always<font color="#CCCCCC"> click the way and then it changed</font>

465
00:19:54,210 --> 00:20:00,930
and morph and it came<font color="#CCCCCC"> back and no one</font>

466
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:03,030
knew what to<font color="#E5E5E5"> call her so this researcher</font>

467
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:05,250
from emerging threats was researching

468
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:07,500
this this exploit kit and he was

469
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:10,670
watching<font color="#E5E5E5"> the TV show community you ever</font>

470
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:14,970
seen the TV show community anyone know a

471
00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:17,720
few I watched it much but apparently

472
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:20,640
there's a guy on there called magnitude

473
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:23,390
he's some actor or something celebrity

474
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:26,790
or something like that and his

475
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:28,980
catchphrases pop pop and he<font color="#E5E5E5"> just screams</font>

476
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:32,220
at every few seconds and so this

477
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:33,930
researcher was was a was researching

478
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:36,030
this explicate watching this at the same

479
00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:38,790
time and he just thought well let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

480
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:42,350
call it magnified exploit kit so this

481
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:45,120
exploit kit became magnitude exploit<font color="#E5E5E5"> pip</font>

482
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:47,490
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually found it later on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a russian</font>

483
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:49,530
form that it's called top exp that's

484
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:53,580
what the exploit<font color="#E5E5E5"> gets called but that's</font>

485
00:20:49,530 --> 00:20:55,980
boring and magnitude is so much cooler

486
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:57,570
and so<font color="#CCCCCC"> even today everyone in there like</font>

487
00:20:55,980 --> 00:21:00,420
the AV industry we still call it

488
00:20:57,570 --> 00:21:03,000
magnitude exploit kit because the one

489
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:04,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">researcher</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fertile emerging threats so</font>

490
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,230
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to keep these exploit given on</font>

491
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:09,660
the same page but everyone's calling of

492
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:11,790
different things it's part of my<font color="#E5E5E5"> bucket</font>

493
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:14,850
list that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> name my own exploit</font>

494
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:17,190
kit when<font color="#E5E5E5"> i find my first exploit kit i</font>

495
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:18,780
will name it something like fluffy

496
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:23,220
exploit kit or<font color="#CCCCCC"> something like that so</font>

497
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:27,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">we'll stick forever this is redkit</font>

498
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:29,190
exploit get a gold star for whoever<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

499
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:30,850
name the reason why we called redkit

500
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:33,850
exploit kit

501
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:35,889
it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> discovered by spiderlabs I think</font>

502
00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:38,939
and they didn't speak Russians and it

503
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:43,300
was red and so it's redkit exploit kid

504
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:45,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">redk it was very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> different for a couple</font>

505
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:48,340
reasons one day I came across this

506
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:55,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">website what do you think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

507
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:56,860
website pretty generic a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of times</font>

508
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:58,750
we'll find command and control servers

509
00:21:56,860 --> 00:22:01,000
and Mauer sites and they<font color="#E5E5E5"> have these</font>

510
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:03,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">jordan generic templates on their</font>

511
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,050
website with a lot of stock photos<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

512
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:07,270
kind of fool a researcher to say nothing

513
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:11,139
to see here<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are not the</font>

514
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:14,500
websites you're looking for<font color="#E5E5E5"> I totally</font>

515
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:15,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">thought</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that was it my wife works at</font>

516
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:17,770
buca with me she does a lot of spam

517
00:22:15,850 --> 00:22:20,169
stuff she looked over<font color="#E5E5E5"> my shoulder and</font>

518
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:23,290
said hey these are the same stock photos

519
00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:26,650
of the canadian pharmacy viagra scam

520
00:22:23,290 --> 00:22:28,930
people use and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> oh really so</font>

521
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:33,520
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's totally got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be a fake</font>

522
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:36,070
website this is a fake website but what

523
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:39,010
bugged me is there's a phone number up

524
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:40,240
there at the top and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I thought why</font>

525
00:22:39,010 --> 00:22:41,590
would they<font color="#CCCCCC"> put a phone number I've never</font>

526
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:44,500
seen a phone number on these<font color="#CCCCCC"> take</font>

527
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:46,449
template website so I thought I'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

528
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:49,450
call this website<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll call this number</font>

529
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:51,130
and I'll see<font color="#E5E5E5"> what happens expecting to</font>

530
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:54,190
get nothing disconnected or something

531
00:22:51,130 --> 00:22:56,110
like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> or at best maybe someone</font>

532
00:22:54,190 --> 00:22:58,210
problem far away who's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell me</font>

533
00:22:56,110 --> 00:23:01,449
my computers infected and you know

534
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:03,550
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> like that I call it and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I get</font>

00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:17,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">healthcare company and so it's like okay</font>

541
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:19,930
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't really contact the compromise</font>

542
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:21,340
website pages and try to help<font color="#E5E5E5"> them very</font>

543
00:23:19,930 --> 00:23:24,670
much because there's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> way too many</font>

544
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:26,709
there's no possible so since I'm there

545
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:28,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's like okay oh I'm a researcher from</font>

546
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:30,370
blue coat your mount your computer is

547
00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:33,010
infected and or your<font color="#CCCCCC"> website's affected</font>

548
00:23:30,370 --> 00:23:35,229
distributing malware did the DA and it

549
00:23:33,010 --> 00:23:38,260
does right over the poor lady said she

550
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:40,030
has no idea what I'm trying to say she

551
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:42,259
kept asking me like Sir do you have any

552
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:45,539
questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> about our health care services</font>

553
00:23:42,259 --> 00:23:47,159
eventually got to the manager and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

554
00:23:45,539 --> 00:23:48,779
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to show him that the website</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

555
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:54,629
kind of broken every link you clicked on

556
00:23:48,779 --> 00:23:56,450
was a 404 error which which I why I

557
00:23:54,629 --> 00:23:58,799
definitely thought it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a fake website</font>

558
00:23:56,450 --> 00:24:00,239
so i was able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to show him</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that at least</font>

559
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:02,879
and say hey you need to get your website

560
00:24:00,239 --> 00:24:05,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">fixed but what this actually was is this</font>

561
00:24:02,879 --> 00:24:07,649
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> red</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kid exploit kit so what they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> did</font>

562
00:24:05,399 --> 00:24:09,268
instead we're like black hole and all

563
00:24:07,649 --> 00:24:11,849
the other ones had a central server<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

564
00:24:09,269 --> 00:24:14,309
Russia<font color="#E5E5E5"> or somewhere else they used all</font>

565
00:24:11,849 --> 00:24:17,460
compromised websites so you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

566
00:24:14,309 --> 00:24:19,830
compromise website you get redirected

567
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:22,019
somewhere else the exploit will come

568
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:23,428
<font color="#E5E5E5">from another compromise website the</font>

569
00:24:22,019 --> 00:24:25,589

<font color="#E5E5E5">compromise website all the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> statistics</font>

571
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:28,440
are sent to a whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> different</font>

572
00:24:27,119 --> 00:24:30,689
compromised websites so their whole

573
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:34,919
infrastructure is spread throughout

574
00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:36,929
compromised websites to rent out the

00:24:34,919 --> 00:24:39,029
exploit<font color="#CCCCCC"> kit you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> had to go to another</font>

577
00:24:39,029 --> 00:24:42,899
a few pages where you could fill out a

578
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:45,210
form and request I want to rent this

579
00:24:42,899 --> 00:24:46,889
exploit kit so it was very<font color="#E5E5E5"> unique and</font>

580
00:24:45,210 --> 00:24:48,779
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> difficult</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for us at blue coat</font>

581
00:24:46,889 --> 00:24:50,549
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean there's so many</font>

582
00:24:48,779 --> 00:24:52,320
compromised<font color="#E5E5E5"> sites it's hard to flag them</font>

583
00:24:50,549 --> 00:24:54,389
all but<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can always flag that central</font>

584
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:56,820
server<font color="#CCCCCC"> be where the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actual exploit kit</font>

585
00:24:54,389 --> 00:24:58,258
lives and so they can go down<font color="#E5E5E5"> the chain</font>

586
00:24:56,820 --> 00:25:00,299
but will block them there and their

587
00:24:58,259 --> 00:25:02,399
customers are protected but with<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

588
00:25:00,299 --> 00:25:04,379
these compromised websites and

589
00:25:02,399 --> 00:25:06,689
everything's compromised you get

590
00:25:04,379 --> 00:25:08,248
collateral damage and so we block these

591
00:25:06,690 --> 00:25:11,099
websites for our customers and then they

592
00:25:08,249 --> 00:25:12,210
complain and all that and so I really

593
00:25:11,099 --> 00:25:15,418
thought this was going to be the future

594
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:17,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">of exploit yes there was an exploit kit</font>

595
00:25:15,419 --> 00:25:20,359
called infinity or goon whoever you

596
00:25:17,549 --> 00:25:23,489
<font color="#CCCCCC">asked that was mimicking this as well</font>

597
00:25:20,359 --> 00:25:25,589
and this was really<font color="#E5E5E5"> popular for a time</font>

598
00:25:23,489 --> 00:25:28,589
and then suddenly<font color="#CCCCCC"> just disappeared and</font>

599
00:25:25,589 --> 00:25:32,158
it's gone now and we really<font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't seen</font>

600
00:25:28,589 --> 00:25:35,039
it since the only thing I could say is

601
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:37,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">probably just there must be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

602
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:41,070
logistic problems of keeping all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

603
00:25:37,169 --> 00:25:44,849
data and<font color="#E5E5E5"> all your files to all your code</font>

604
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:47,450
on servers that you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really own but</font>

605
00:25:44,849 --> 00:25:50,399
that was an interesting exploit dead

606
00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:51,370
they've got better up at their office

607
00:25:50,399 --> 00:25:53,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">gation</font>

608
00:25:51,370 --> 00:25:56,350
the office gave their stuff used to be

609
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:58,120
really easy tools like<font color="#CCCCCC"> wepa wet and and</font>

610
00:25:56,350 --> 00:26:00,939
these automatic up the<font color="#E5E5E5"> offi skaters</font>

611
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:03,100
would do it really<font color="#E5E5E5"> simply you could you</font>

612
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:04,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">could easily see the shellcode you can</font>

613
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:07,270
easily<font color="#E5E5E5"> determine what CD either</font>

614
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:08,649
exploiting but now they hit usually<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

615
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:11,980
like two<font color="#CCCCCC"> or three layers</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of autistic</font>

616
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:14,230
ation and it's much harder<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do for</font>

617
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:17,920
their java stuff they'll do this java

618
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:20,760
class called pack so they'll pack their

619
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:24,580
jars so it's harder for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Avs to scan</font>

620
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:29,170
this is a commercial tool for flash to

621
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:32,110
pack flash files and I think nuclear

622
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:33,760
exploit<font color="#CCCCCC"> kit started using these ones so</font>

623
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:39,490
it's harder for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> AVS to read the</font>

624
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:44,170
flashlight don't worry I'll dog on a

625
00:26:39,490 --> 00:26:46,510
flash soon sorry for my Adobe<font color="#CCCCCC"> friend and</font>

626
00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:48,760
then they they started encrypting

627
00:26:46,510 --> 00:26:50,620
everything so<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the strings all the</font>

628
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:51,760
payloads are encrypted which makes it a

629
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:55,510
pain because you have to pull it<font color="#E5E5E5"> out and</font>

630
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:56,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">memory just about I think magnitude</font>

631
00:26:55,510 --> 00:27:01,750
exploit kits the only one who would just

632
00:26:56,980 --> 00:27:04,090
give<font color="#CCCCCC"> me a plain plain exe file more</font>

633
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:05,650
exploits they definitely have expanded

634
00:27:04,090 --> 00:27:09,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">to using more exploits than what they</font>

635
00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:11,890
did before let's play a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> game</font>

636
00:27:09,610 --> 00:27:13,540
shall<font color="#E5E5E5"> we let's do a little word</font>

637
00:27:11,890 --> 00:27:16,900
association so I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say a word</font>

638
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:19,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">and you just scream out whatever you</font>

639
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:25,230
think comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> to first thing to your mind</font>

640
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:25,230
so so<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's start with like Microsoft</font>

641
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:43,450
okay um what else<font color="#CCCCCC"> besides okay java yeah</font>

642
00:27:39,010 --> 00:27:46,330
so Java has a bad rap for for all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> 0</font>

643
00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:48,070
days they had<font color="#E5E5E5"> a couple years</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> back being</font>

644
00:27:46,330 --> 00:27:51,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">very vulnerable it was a big selling</font>

645
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:54,010
point of uninstall Java<font color="#CCCCCC"> uninstalled java</font>

646
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:56,649
don't have job on your machine that's

647
00:27:54,010 --> 00:27:58,750
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> not the case anymore the big</font>

648
00:27:56,650 --> 00:28:02,440
popular thing for the exploit kits right

649
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:03,760
now is our big friend flash flash is the

650
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:07,870
new<font color="#CCCCCC"> Java right now</font>

651
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:11,320
they've even<font color="#E5E5E5"> started to to drop their</font>

652
00:28:07,870 --> 00:28:14,020
java exploits from their exploit kits so

653
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:16,090
there there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are far more far fewer java</font>

654
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:19,570
exploit kits in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the web right now than</font>

655
00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:21,459
there ever have been before<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the only</font>

656
00:28:19,570 --> 00:28:23,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">reason</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can say for that is just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> its</font>

657
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:25,990
people are<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're now and so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people are</font>

658
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:27,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">focused on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> java they're going to move</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

659
00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:29,920
something else and they're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

660
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:33,280
pay<font color="#E5E5E5"> attention to job anymore but flash</font>

661
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:35,680
is really getting to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> popular</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> guy</font>

662
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:38,950
and also they try to avoid common

663
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:41,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">javascript so like I said they use</font>

664
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:43,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">plug-in detect it's just a JavaScript</font>

665
00:28:41,530 --> 00:28:45,580
library so they can just do a bunch of

666
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:47,710
loops to figure out what versions a plug

667
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:50,740
in your group of the browser<font color="#CCCCCC"> plug-in</font>

668
00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:52,300
you're using we used to quite<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm quite</font>

669
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:53,920
literally we would see this compromise

670
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:57,760
domain and they would tack on a file

671
00:28:53,920 --> 00:29:00,220
called plugin detect Jas and they at

672
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:02,560
that file the only file the only people

673
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:04,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">in the internet using that file name are</font>

674
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:07,570
the extra<font color="#CCCCCC"> like kids and so it was so</font>

675
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:09,520
easy to catch him but a bees are aware

676
00:29:07,570 --> 00:29:10,929
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that av's will detect that babies are</font>

677
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:13,360
paying<font color="#CCCCCC"> attention to that so now that</font>

678
00:29:10,930 --> 00:29:16,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">most</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of them used a custom library of</font>

679
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:20,020
some sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> so they can figure out what</font>

680
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:22,330
you're using pay attention that they're

681
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:26,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">using activex to figure that out what</font>

682
00:29:22,330 --> 00:29:29,740
version<font color="#CCCCCC"> of plugins you're using that's a</font>

683
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:31,210
little table of who uses what a few of

684
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:32,770
them still use<font color="#CCCCCC"> plug-in detect they have</font>

685
00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:35,530
other measures so that they don't get

686
00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:37,530
detected but they'll get rid of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

687
00:29:35,530 --> 00:29:39,760
plugin<font color="#E5E5E5"> detect so they don't repented is</font>

688
00:29:37,530 --> 00:29:42,310
there a way to minimize the amount of

689
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:44,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">JavaScript I expose so could we take it</font>

690
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:48,159
another step further so not show the AV

691
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:50,860
any<font color="#E5E5E5"> JavaScript at all or at least as few</font>

692
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:52,750
as possible so what a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them are</font>

693
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:55,780
doing is they're using our nice friend

694
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:58,440
flash and they will drop<font color="#E5E5E5"> a file on your</font>

695
00:29:55,780 --> 00:30:01,450
machine of a flash file and it's not

696
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:04,030
malicious per se it's just for the

697
00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:06,250
JavaScript or the action script which is

698
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:08,710
basically just JavaScript so that

699
00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:10,450
javascript and flash file will do all

700
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:14,620
the scanning and all those things so the

701
00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:15,760
AV now has to parse that you know in

702
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:17,379
order to figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

703
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:20,590
what is this thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing and this is</font>

704
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:22,480
malicious and then just<font color="#E5E5E5"> the flash</font>

705
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:24,909
exploits in general have gotten<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

706
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:27,610
hard to detect as well this came from

707
00:30:24,910 --> 00:30:30,070
nuclear actually kit and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> always a</font>

708
00:30:27,610 --> 00:30:33,330
fun day for me when I see the flat<font color="#CCCCCC"> zero</font>

709
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:37,000
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> buyers too low for no hits</font>

710
00:30:33,330 --> 00:30:39,399
that's not terribly uncommon from my

711
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:44,410
experience<font color="#E5E5E5"> so this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the exploit file</font>

712
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:46,270
exploit downloader usually<font color="#E5E5E5"> will start to</font>

713
00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:48,940
see detections within like two or<font color="#CCCCCC"> three</font>

714
00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:51,879
hours<font color="#E5E5E5"> of when the file first shows up I</font>

715
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:53,380
mean av's you can dog on AVS a lot but

716
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:55,330
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> just they're good they just a</font>

717
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:57,370
bit slow eventually they'll start to

718
00:30:55,330 --> 00:31:00,070
catch up<font color="#E5E5E5"> but what was interesting about</font>

719
00:30:57,370 --> 00:31:01,870
this is it has a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple votes so viral</font>

720
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:04,659
you can vote and say well I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think this</font>

721
00:31:01,870 --> 00:31:09,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">is bad and it has a couple votes already</font>

722
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:12,760
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I thought who voted for that caffeine</font>

723
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:15,490
he's a French security researcher<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

724
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:18,790
does a lot of good<font color="#E5E5E5"> work and I saw he</font>

725
00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:20,440
voted for this<font color="#E5E5E5"> two days ago so this file</font>

726
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:23,050
has been on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> almost two</font>

727
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:25,090
and a half days and it still is getting

728
00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:27,580
no detection and I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's crazy</font>

729
00:31:25,090 --> 00:31:31,120
how are they doing that so I kept paid

730
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:32,889
attention to it next<font color="#CCCCCC"> day nothing next</font>

731
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:35,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">day after that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> nothing this is three</font>

732
00:31:32,890 --> 00:31:37,870
days<font color="#CCCCCC"> after I first</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> found that files of</font>

733
00:31:35,410 --> 00:31:42,610
five days<font color="#E5E5E5"> from caffeine's paladin found</font>

734
00:31:37,870 --> 00:31:46,000
it still nothing Oh lenovo solution

735
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:50,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">center scheduled hardware scam oh I hate</font>

736
00:31:46,000 --> 00:32:11,080
you lenovo this stupid are you<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

737
00:31:50,020 --> 00:32:13,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">getting no postponed no comment I heard</font>

738
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:21,370
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I heard that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> he had something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font>

739
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:24,240
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> punch being arrested or in the US</font>

740
00:32:21,370 --> 00:32:24,239
where they could me

741
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:28,950
yeah yeah it most<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them have pretty</font>

742
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:30,300
bad code you know simple cross site

743
00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:32,850
scripting<font color="#E5E5E5"> and signal injection stuff</font>

744
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:34,950
like that so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually two weeks</font>

745
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:39,719
after<font color="#E5E5E5"> that file and it still only has</font>

746
00:32:34,950 --> 00:32:41,730
three detection on that flash file so i

747
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:45,510
went into the local of why is if yeah we

748
00:32:41,730 --> 00:32:47,910
should all be<font color="#CCCCCC"> clear to flash why is it</font>

749
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:51,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">so bud why is it fully detectable and</font>

750
00:32:47,910 --> 00:32:57,300
all that so this is that file and<font color="#CCCCCC"> hacked</font>

751
00:32:51,410 --> 00:33:03,420
anyone recognize<font color="#E5E5E5"> that file header it's</font>

752
00:32:57,300 --> 00:33:06,000
what I can't hear you um sorry so flash

753
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:09,990
should have a CWF header that's the

754
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:12,030
normal flash ZW s<font color="#CCCCCC"> I did not know what</font>

755
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:14,700
that is and<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you look at the hex it's</font>

756
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:19,080
kind of looks encrypted it just it's

757
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:22,140
pretty random it's actually a packer lvm

758
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:24,090
a compression has anyone heard of that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

759
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:25,620
had not<font color="#E5E5E5"> heard that much i went on the</font>

760
00:33:24,090 --> 00:33:28,949
internet could not find too much about

761
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:33,209
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> but is it is a flash packer winzip</font>

762
00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:35,460
uses it arnar sorry 7-zip but it's a

763
00:33:33,210 --> 00:33:37,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's a different packer and so the av's</font>

764
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:39,390
must be having<font color="#CCCCCC"> trouble with this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> packer</font>

765
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:43,470
for flash because it's not really

766
00:33:39,390 --> 00:33:47,010
detecting this death much avoiding

767
00:33:43,470 --> 00:33:48,780
detection so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> i mean when i first</font>

768
00:33:47,010 --> 00:33:50,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">started i could easily get a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> website to</font>

769
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:52,800
exploit me all I wanted now they're

770
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:55,200
doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> more to avoid that so this comes</font>

771
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:57,510
from angular exploit kit so again

772
00:33:55,200 --> 00:34:00,120
they're using the activex which is your

773
00:33:57,510 --> 00:34:02,400
friend and they're looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at your</font>

774
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:04,739
system files look metric drivers and so

775
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:06,780
at that<font color="#CCCCCC"> kll that's kaspersky that's a</font>

776
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:08,460
guess purse key driver and these other

777
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:10,529
ones are trend micro and some other ones

778
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:13,949
so they're looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> for a specific AV on</font>

779
00:34:10,530 --> 00:34:15,510
your computer to see if you have it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

780
00:34:13,949 --> 00:34:17,250
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> they if you have it they just won't</font>

781
00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:20,429
exploit you they won't they won't pet

782
00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:22,168
you and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just thought that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

783
00:34:20,429 --> 00:34:24,270
incredible that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you could go to a</font>

784
00:34:22,168 --> 00:34:26,940
website<font color="#E5E5E5"> and your browser can read your</font>

785
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:28,379
system files on your computer if that's

786
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:30,360
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> a reason why you shouldn't use</font>

787
00:34:28,379 --> 00:34:31,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">Internet Explorer I don't know why I</font>

788
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:34,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't know what else I could do to</font>

789
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:37,539
convince<font color="#E5E5E5"> it activex look</font>

790
00:34:34,599 --> 00:34:40,389
so they look for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a vs they also look for</font>

791
00:34:37,539 --> 00:34:41,919
real where again<font color="#E5E5E5"> I use a lot of virtual</font>

792
00:34:40,389 --> 00:34:43,329
machines for detection and stuff like

793
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:46,418
that so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's been a pain in the butt</font>

794
00:34:43,329 --> 00:34:50,289
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> me that that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> uh I can't use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

795
00:34:46,418 --> 00:34:51,779
anymore Cisco or someone<font color="#CCCCCC"> claims that</font>

796
00:34:50,289 --> 00:34:55,210
nuclear just doing this with their tds

797
00:34:51,779 --> 00:34:56,829
so the tds will actually check this for

798
00:34:55,210 --> 00:34:58,930
you first before they said you off I

799
00:34:56,829 --> 00:35:01,660
have not found that myself<font color="#E5E5E5"> personally I</font>

800
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:06,160
can still get exploited by by nuclear on

801
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:07,989
a vm machine tdss do do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that though they</font>

802
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:09,190
can check what country you come from and

803
00:35:07,989 --> 00:35:13,989
stuff like that and send you somewhere

804
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:15,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">else yeah yeah they'll send you diligent</font>

805
00:35:13,989 --> 00:35:19,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">Amit sites sometimes just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> afore you</font>

806
00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:21,899
booyah so here's kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a chart of that</font>

807
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:24,910
of the different ones<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are detecting</font>

808
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:27,729
<font color="#CCCCCC">Rob Lee and some of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sams guys</font>

809
00:35:24,910 --> 00:35:29,950
they're big fans of orson scott card<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

810
00:35:27,729 --> 00:35:33,848
the Ender's Game series and there's a

811
00:35:29,950 --> 00:35:38,229
big part where he says Mazer Rackham has

812
00:35:33,849 --> 00:35:40,329
a quote<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the only enemy the only</font>

813
00:35:38,229 --> 00:35:41,950
teacher is your hand me the only<font color="#E5E5E5"> enemy</font>

814
00:35:40,329 --> 00:35:43,269
the only year enemy can teach you where

815
00:35:41,950 --> 00:35:44,919
your week where you're strong and all

816
00:35:43,269 --> 00:35:46,899
that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I thought this was an amazing</font>

817
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:49,690
chart because if anyone out there is

818
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:51,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">looking for a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> navy vendor these are the</font>

819
00:35:49,690 --> 00:35:53,789
ones that the exploit kit don't like and

820
00:35:51,609 --> 00:35:56,680
they will just prefer to<font color="#CCCCCC"> avoid them</font>

821
00:35:53,789 --> 00:35:58,839
rather than yeah see<font color="#CCCCCC"> Kaspersky's on</font>

822
00:35:56,680 --> 00:36:02,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">there Trend Micro's on there which kind</font>

823
00:35:58,839 --> 00:36:04,839
of surprises me of it we set and also

824
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:07,809
I'm sorry this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> being</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> recorded I</font>

825
00:36:04,839 --> 00:36:11,640
should not<font color="#CCCCCC"> be saying these things my</font>

826
00:36:07,809 --> 00:36:14,829
views do not represent my employer<font color="#E5E5E5"> or a</font>

827
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:16,450
sandbox evasion these are popular now

828
00:36:14,829 --> 00:36:19,029
for a lot of the downloaders<font color="#E5E5E5"> they'll do</font>

829
00:36:16,450 --> 00:36:21,519
a lot of sandbox<font color="#E5E5E5"> evasion this was when i</font>

830
00:36:19,029 --> 00:36:23,700
got from magnitude exploit kit see how

831
00:36:21,519 --> 00:36:25,988
some of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> have been renamed calendar</font>

832
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:27,848
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically has five</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or six different</font>

833
00:36:25,989 --> 00:36:29,529
counters and so the bower just sits

834
00:36:27,849 --> 00:36:31,569
there and just twiddle the thumb as he

835
00:36:29,529 --> 00:36:34,769
just counts to like five billion a

836
00:36:31,569 --> 00:36:37,479
couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> times</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and why would you do that</font>

837
00:36:34,769 --> 00:36:40,930
as the sandbox is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to time out</font>

838
00:36:37,479 --> 00:36:43,029
eventually he just<font color="#E5E5E5"> this sample didn't do</font>

839
00:36:40,930 --> 00:36:45,930
anything so and there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> lots of</font>

840
00:36:43,029 --> 00:36:48,610
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> ways</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to invade sandboxes</font>

841
00:36:45,930 --> 00:36:51,759
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at the processors you can</font>

842
00:36:48,610 --> 00:36:54,100
look at how much memory you have I heard

843
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:57,340
of one sample that looked at the desktop

844

to claim that too much so angular

lot of compromise sites they'll do fake

861
00:37:39,610 --> 00:37:44,740
search engines pretty much my rule of

862
00:37:42,970 --> 00:37:46,390
thumb is you use google google and

863
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:48,149
google and if it's not google then you

864
00:37:46,390 --> 00:37:50,350
should not<font color="#E5E5E5"> be typing anything into it</font>

865
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:52,000
will get customers who want to go to

866
00:37:50,350 --> 00:37:56,380
these I want this search engine no you

00:38:21,850 --> 00:38:25,450
you to an intermediary domain just a

00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:27,760
domain that just gives you a 302

880
00:38:25,450 --> 00:38:32,230
redirect or an iframe just somewhere

881
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:35,410
else that's one for angler and then now

882
00:38:32,230 --> 00:38:37,420
for tithing um so I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do a pull if</font>

explain to<font color="#E5E5E5"> me in somewhat detail about</font>

886
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:47,319
what is mal vertising and why is it a

887
00:38:43,810 --> 00:38:50,080
threat<font color="#CCCCCC"> on your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> network of course you can</font>

how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people all right so if you were</font>

889
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:53,680
sleeping for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the rest of this talk this</font>

890
00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:56,170
is the time to pay<font color="#CCCCCC"> attention because</font>

891
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:56,740
malvert izing is kind of like the<font color="#E5E5E5"> rabbit</font>

892
00:38:56,170 --> 00:38:58,720
hole of

893
00:38:56,740 --> 00:39:00,759
of what we do<font color="#E5E5E5"> at blue coat it's just</font>

894
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:04,930
this big rabbit hole we dive into and

895
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:06,369
it's just a mess and it's terrible<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

896
00:39:04,930 --> 00:39:08,500
what mal vertising does is they take

897
00:39:06,369 --> 00:39:11,980
they go to legitimate web ad companies

898
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:14,170
they take out a militias ad and then

899
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:17,020
they distribute it through that<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's do</font>

900
00:39:14,170 --> 00:39:18,490
that legitimate web ad company so like

901
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:21,009
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll see a lot is will see like</font>

902
00:39:18,490 --> 00:39:23,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is a legitimate website and it's</font>

903
00:39:21,010 --> 00:39:24,940
got a search bar oh how nice well but

904
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:27,600
every time you search they always show

905
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:31,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">you ads so they'll search for something</font>

906
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:32,770
malicious ad will show up and exploit

907
00:39:31,390 --> 00:39:35,350
you and send you to that exploit kit

908
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:37,600
basically and everyone kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of does it</font>

909
00:39:35,350 --> 00:39:39,279
everyone's involved in this all the all

910
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:42,100
the legitimate wet bag companies they

911
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:45,070
all have problems with this<font color="#E5E5E5"> especially</font>

912
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:47,830
add cash<font color="#E5E5E5"> I doubt anyone hears heard of</font>

913
00:39:45,070 --> 00:39:50,380
add cash or or you know yo that's a

914
00:39:47,830 --> 00:39:51,970
special kind of nerd but add cash is a

915
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:53,380
web ad company they've actually talked

916
00:39:51,970 --> 00:39:54,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">to us a couple times and we kind of</font>

917
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:56,920
tongue-in-cheek talk to them back

918
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:58,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">because they have such a dirty network</font>

919
00:39:56,920 --> 00:40:05,470
everything pretty much they distribute

920
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:07,930
is so bad what does this look like it

921
00:40:05,470 --> 00:40:09,959
looks like flash but it's not flash this

922
00:40:07,930 --> 00:40:13,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually sends you to add where puff</font>

actually unloaded software they'll do<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

924
00:40:13,570 --> 00:40:20,170
fake AV stuff they'll even do mobile

925
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:21,250
stuff if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> on mobile they'll pay</font>

926
00:40:20,170 --> 00:40:25,630
attention to that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> send you the</font>

whatever yeah they just<font color="#E5E5E5"> have such a</font>

931
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:42,880
dirty network and why is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so awesome</font>

932
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:44,260
essentially what they're doing is is all

933
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:46,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">these websites have no idea what's going</font>

934
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:48,340
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> in their own website so to kind of</font>

935
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:50,410
put in<font color="#E5E5E5"> an analogy if I feel on a website</font>

it went up<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you and said hey and I</font>

say you're a say you're a business

943
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:04,660

00:43:36,890 --> 00:43:42,379
companies<font color="#CCCCCC"> and see on their websites how</font>

987
00:43:39,170 --> 00:43:46,550
many ads are they loading amazon had 18

988
00:43:42,380 --> 00:44:02,090
I checked blue coat they only have five

989
00:43:46,550 --> 00:44:03,530
that was good well good vibes good yeah

990
00:44:02,090 --> 00:44:06,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">definitely that's the third parties</font>

991
00:44:03,530 --> 00:44:08,300
that's I I used to<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

992
00:44:06,620 --> 00:44:09,890
internet was you know the Internet's

993
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:11,510
free because of advertising so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i didn't</font>

994
00:44:09,890 --> 00:44:15,410
use<font color="#CCCCCC"> adblock</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and I've definitely changed</font>

995
00:44:11,510 --> 00:44:17,960
it now but but even adblock they they

996
00:44:15,410 --> 00:44:20,450
have certain ad providers that pay them

997
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:22,400
money now so they will let those ads in

998
00:44:20,450 --> 00:44:24,379
and like I said that's changed from

999
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:26,480
third parties from third parties so none

1000

1004
00:44:33,940 --> 00:44:39,740
adblock but uh that's been successful so

and they search<font color="#E5E5E5"> something and they're</font>

I used to say that job that a

00:46:34,839 --> 00:46:38,828
Silverlight extension looks like could

<font color="#CCCCCC">you recognize Silverlight file on your</font>

network the two researchers yeah anyone

1047
00:46:41,589 --> 00:46:49,630
else<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's dot that dot x AP and it's</font>

1048
00:46:45,910 --> 00:46:54,490
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a zip file with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> DLLs in</font>

1049
00:46:49,630 --> 00:46:56,410
it but what uses silverlight<font color="#E5E5E5"> netflix</font>

1050
00:46:54,490 --> 00:46:58,660
does and so when they<font color="#E5E5E5"> started</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing</font>

1051
00:46:56,410 --> 00:47:01,240
silverlit exploits i thought wow that's

1052
00:46:58,660 --> 00:47:04,379
a huge market there because who does not

1053
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:09,029
have netflix on your computer anyone a

1054
00:47:04,380 --> 00:47:09,030
few of<font color="#CCCCCC"> you probably lying but ok</font>

1055
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:16,890
alright but ok was the different thing

1056
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:25,290
they it hasn't grown in that<font color="#E5E5E5"> much</font>

1057
00:47:16,890 --> 00:47:27,270
popularity it's what I don't know if

1058
00:47:25,290 --> 00:47:28,740
they're killed you no html5<font color="#E5E5E5"> is kind of</font>

1059
00:47:27,270 --> 00:47:31,920
killing<font color="#E5E5E5"> it because now you can do it all</font>

1060
00:47:28,740 --> 00:47:35,779
with html5<font color="#E5E5E5"> so so we'll see what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> happens</font>

1061
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:35,780
but it's not as popular as it once was

1062
00:47:36,050 --> 00:47:41,310
angler exploit kit will also do this

1063
00:47:38,550 --> 00:47:43,530
file s infection so what they'll do

1064
00:47:41,310 --> 00:47:46,259
instead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> dropping a downloader onto</font>

1065
00:47:43,530 --> 00:47:49,500
your computer they'll actually inject

1066
00:47:46,260 --> 00:47:51,630
code straight into your processes so

1067
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:53,190
they can jet code straight into your I

1068
00:47:51,630 --> 00:47:56,970
think they did internet explorer

1069
00:47:53,190 --> 00:47:59,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">explorer and so there's no forensic Lee</font>

1070
00:47:56,970 --> 00:48:02,009
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> no file to grab off the hard</font>

1071
00:47:59,100 --> 00:48:03,660
drive it's very effective against toast

1072
00:48:02,010 --> 00:48:06,630
and creeks intrusion protection systems

1073
00:48:03,660 --> 00:48:08,629
ones like that and then they would use

1074
00:48:06,630 --> 00:48:10,620
the payload they were using<font color="#E5E5E5"> was beat up</font>

1075
00:48:08,630 --> 00:48:14,160
just a botnet and they were doing

1076
00:48:10,620 --> 00:48:16,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">commanding control three ssl so so it's</font>

1077
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:18,569
a file s infection and then all the

1078
00:48:16,620 --> 00:48:21,000
columns command and control traffic you

1079
00:48:18,570 --> 00:48:23,340
can't look at because<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ssl basically</font>

1080
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:25,530
unless you do an inspection surprisingly

1081
00:48:23,340 --> 00:48:29,250
though the payload they'll drop payloads

1082
00:48:25,530 --> 00:48:33,780
in HTTP for suffering them but then all

1083
00:48:29,250 --> 00:48:35,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">the other called out traffic is ssl so</font>

1084
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:36,920
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> what a compromise site would</font>

1085
00:48:35,190 --> 00:48:39,150
look like for angular exploit<font color="#CCCCCC"> kit</font>

1086
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:41,100
usually the eye frames are invisible you

1087
00:48:39,150 --> 00:48:42,780
can't see them for some reason some of

1088
00:48:41,100 --> 00:48:45,450
them show up in the corner of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1089
00:48:42,780 --> 00:48:47,970
website and if this text looks familiar

1090
00:48:45,450 --> 00:48:49,439
to anyone and probably people want to

00:48:47,970 --> 00:48:51,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">MIT through it looks for it looks</font>

1092
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:53,940
familiar because they just<font color="#E5E5E5"> grabbed text</font>

1093
00:48:51,570 --> 00:48:56,340
from Pride and Prejudice and just throw

00:48:53,940 --> 00:48:57,810
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> in there so along</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with the blob of</font>

1097
00:49:00,090 --> 00:49:04,920
like Pride and Prejudice stuck in there

1098
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:06,840
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> guess it's to evade a vide to think</font>

1099
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:12,150
all this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is legitimate and it's got all</font>

1100
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:13,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">the texts</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and stuff I'd know and with</font>

1101
00:49:12,150 --> 00:49:17,130
the domains with<font color="#CCCCCC"> Tigers one of our</font>

1102
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:19,799
registers they like OVH and<font color="#CCCCCC"> LeaseWeb</font>

1103
00:49:17,130 --> 00:49:22,319
these are two big web hosts and and they

1104
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:24,569
get abused a lot

1105
00:49:22,319 --> 00:49:28,308
sub ohm use godaddy placeholders so what

1106
00:49:24,569 --> 00:49:28,308
they do is they just compromise the

1107
00:49:28,940 --> 00:49:34,229
either your DNS host or whatever end and

1108
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:37,410
so they add to take a legitimate site

1109
00:49:34,229 --> 00:49:39,299
put gibberish subdomains<font color="#E5E5E5"> onto it and</font>

1110
00:49:37,410 --> 00:49:41,848
then point<font color="#E5E5E5"> that subdomain to a different</font>

1111
00:49:39,299 --> 00:49:43,940
IP and they've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing this forever</font>

some reason so nuclear exploit kit uses

1142
00:50:54,690 --> 00:50:58,949
these for the redirects and stuff and I

1143
00:50:56,579 --> 00:51:03,509
why I have no<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea but that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what they</font>

different apache web server on it and

1149
00:51:12,690 --> 00:51:18,079
inject that code in every website on to

1150
00:51:15,029 --> 00:51:20,640
that web server pretty impressive

pretty much x every exploit kit drops
