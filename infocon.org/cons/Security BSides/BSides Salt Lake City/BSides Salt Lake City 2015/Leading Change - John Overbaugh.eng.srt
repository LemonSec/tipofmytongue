1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,899
so welcome all the diehards who are up

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:09,059
early this morning when I got the first

3
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:12,000
slot I thought they will see how many

4
00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:16,198
<font color="#E5E5E5">people and too so hopefully the topic is</font>

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,039
of interest the topic leading change and

6
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:19,289
what we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to talk about today</font>

7
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:20,820
could really be<font color="#E5E5E5"> considered an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> XOR for</font>

8
00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:23,910
all of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I've tried</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in my</font>

9
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:25,590
career have it work so we're going to

10
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:30,060
focus on things that are successful<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

11
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:33,000
we need change in security and the

12
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:36,540
approach hair is to leave change in an

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,329
organization without having or using

14
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:40,680
positional Authority so the goal of our

15
00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:43,739
conversations to talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> how we</font>

16
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:45,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually bring changed about in</font>

17
00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:48,180
organizations without having you know

18
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:50,429
big heavy hammer and somebody<font color="#CCCCCC"> conclusion</font>

19
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:51,719
I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of ties into what we were</font>

20
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:56,129
talking about yesterday in the keynote

21
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:57,840
address<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the you know our role as</font>

22
00:00:56,129 --> 00:00:59,940
security practitioner is this to help

23
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,969
not to look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> people and say you guys</font>

24
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:04,408
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> a bunch of idiots</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> try to help them</font>

25
00:01:01,969 --> 00:01:06,450
learn more about security and little

26
00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:10,470
more about how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be secure it and what</font>

27
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:13,020
they do and so we'll jump in I call this

28
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:15,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">the double 3+1 there's kind of a three</font>

29
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:16,979
aspects to the change paradigm and then

30
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:18,960
there are four aspects to patterns

31
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:21,210
anyone who's familiar with agile

32
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:24,270
development those in turn patterns the

33
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:26,610
book that this is based on the framework

34
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:28,920
in the book is called<font color="#E5E5E5"> perilous change</font>

35
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:31,170
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I highly recommend this book it's a</font>

36
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:33,060
great book it talks about first the

37
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:36,450
paradigm of change in the areas where we

38
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:39,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">would have success in change and then it</font>

39
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:40,560
has a series of patterns about 24 25

40
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,079
different patterns that can be used just

41
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,090
like a we write code we have patterns

42
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:47,850
that are best practice with limitations

43
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:49,890
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to tackle first</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> four</font>

44
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:53,309
patterns<font color="#E5E5E5"> and for most basic and most</font>

45
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:55,409
important patterns in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the UK so fearless</font>

46
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:58,140
change is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> book the authors are Mary</font>

Lynn man's and then the<font color="#CCCCCC"> rising and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

48
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:05,130
book was published by pearson education

49
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:06,719
in 2005<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'll give you a chance to write</font>

50
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:08,869
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm still</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the writing very</font>

all

52
00:02:08,869 --> 00:02:15,780
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> uh and I would encourage</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you to ask</font>

53
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:18,150
questions or share if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> had experience</font>

54
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:20,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">with what we're talking about share your</font>

55
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:22,889
experience throughout the presentation a

56
00:02:20,219 --> 00:02:24,510
very informal presenter and perfectly

57
00:02:22,889 --> 00:02:30,870
happy to see<font color="#CCCCCC"> am raising the question</font>

58
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:32,429
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> will jump in so the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> change paradigm</font>

59
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:34,200
there's three aspects<font color="#CCCCCC"> that change parent</font>

60
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:36,989
on the first one<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a change agent there</font>

61
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:39,209
needs to be someone who wants to enact

62
00:02:36,989 --> 00:02:42,419
change a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of times they'll be a kind</font>

63
00:02:39,209 --> 00:02:45,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">of a corporate directive you know you go</font>

64
00:02:42,419 --> 00:02:48,469
and make everyone do public bathrooms

65
00:02:45,629 --> 00:02:50,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's not a change agent that's just</font>

66
00:02:48,469 --> 00:02:52,198
something a change agent is someone

67
00:02:50,969 --> 00:02:54,329
who's passionate about what they're

68
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:55,739
doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> they have a they believe that the</font>

69
00:02:54,329 --> 00:02:57,209
change they're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to enact is going</font>

70
00:02:55,739 --> 00:02:59,219
to make a positive<font color="#E5E5E5"> difference and</font>

71
00:02:57,209 --> 00:03:02,069
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> really passionate about it then</font>

72
00:02:59,219 --> 00:03:03,659
also it requires some skills and we'll

73
00:03:02,069 --> 00:03:05,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk in a moment about those skills but</font>

74
00:03:03,659 --> 00:03:09,480
also there's just this<font color="#CCCCCC"> Drive this innate</font>

75
00:03:05,969 --> 00:03:10,530
drive of if I if I work on this change

76
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,969
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you make this change an</font>

77
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:14,849
organization that's going to make this

78
00:03:11,969 --> 00:03:16,918
more successfully what we do so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

79
00:03:14,849 --> 00:03:18,569
change for us the security professionals

80
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:20,159
can be anything from introducing a

81
00:03:18,569 --> 00:03:22,530
secure development lifecycle and

82
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:24,388
bringing some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the processes tools and</font>

83
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:28,439
skills into the development<font color="#E5E5E5"> side of what</font>

84
00:03:24,389 --> 00:03:29,879
we do all the way over to improving the

85
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:31,918
<font color="#E5E5E5">way we communicate with our clients</font>

86
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:33,418
about the security<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we're putting</font>

87
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:37,439
into the application in the security

88
00:03:33,419 --> 00:03:41,759
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we expect them</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> amazing so the skill</font>

89
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:43,858
set it tanks here are soft skills

90
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:45,689
they're your people skills most of us

91
00:03:43,859 --> 00:03:48,239
are have an engineering background and

92
00:03:45,689 --> 00:03:50,400
we think<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot about the hard skills you</font>

93
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:53,579
know we interact and relate a lot better

94
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">than 10 is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the review of people but you</font>

95
00:03:53,579 --> 00:03:58,379
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to bring change about you need to</font>

96
00:03:55,829 --> 00:04:01,590
develop<font color="#E5E5E5"> these students working well with</font>

97
00:03:58,379 --> 00:04:04,018
others we tend to at times be kind of

98
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:05,939
lone wolves but what's interesting is

99
00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:08,819
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> get together</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these conferences</font>

100
00:04:05,939 --> 00:04:10,560
together and we work in a group well

101
00:04:08,819 --> 00:04:11,940
that it's the office we're familiar with

102
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,190
and we're comfortable

103
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:17,070
extend that and say okay how can<font color="#CCCCCC"> I work</font>

104
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:19,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">with someone</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from say marketing in my</font>

105
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:24,170
organization and help get their health

106
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:26,520
into bears multi appreciating people is

107
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:30,540
underused but very<font color="#CCCCCC"> very powerful</font>

108
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:32,340
approach showing we don't especially in

109
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:33,210
engineering we don't often not touching

110
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:35,640
feeling they don't often show

111
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:37,770
appreciation to people for how they help

112
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:39,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">us and what they've done but this is</font>

113
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:41,940
like the grease that makes everything

114
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:43,260
work being able to you know put<font color="#CCCCCC"> your arm</font>

115
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:45,510
around someone and say thanks a lot i

116
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:47,670
really appreciate it makes a big

117
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:50,039
difference to them and it doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

118
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:51,450
to be a big<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing there are a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of</font>

119
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:53,730
different ways that<font color="#CCCCCC"> people are motivated</font>

120
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:56,099
or that they feel appreciated one of

121
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:57,900
them is money and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it can be as little as</font>

times<font color="#E5E5E5"> when we've done yes you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are for</font>

those their staff can send me a partner

133
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:28,080
others are motivated by public

134
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:30,090
recognition as simple as printing a

135
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,469
little you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know certificate out of word</font>

communicator that's really a challenge

141
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:45,750
for a lot of us in the engineering side

142
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:47,820
of things we<font color="#CCCCCC"> operate without computers</font>

143
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:50,430
and do each other but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't</font>

144
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:53,070
communicate<font color="#E5E5E5"> well with people struggle</font>

145
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:55,950
toasty get a non technical level for

another aspect of change is<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

208
00:08:39,589 --> 00:08:43,550
important as the culture in your

209
00:08:40,698 --> 00:08:45,199
organization and there are certain

210
00:08:43,549 --> 00:08:46,758
cultures where changes more difficult

211
00:08:45,199 --> 00:08:48,559
than others but it's possible in every

212
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:51,259
culture it's just a matter how long it

213
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:54,050
takes in order to have a culture please

214
00:08:51,259 --> 00:08:56,569
importantly things the foundation is a

215
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:58,609
nurturing environment so that's an

216
00:08:56,569 --> 00:09:01,279
environment that's open to change is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

217
00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:03,529
idea of bringing changes we also need

218
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:05,029
the flexibility to experiment and fail

219
00:09:03,529 --> 00:09:07,369
and we'll talk about that shortly a

220
00:09:05,029 --> 00:09:09,829
little bit more but having some support

221
00:09:07,369 --> 00:09:15,740
from your manager is having the ability

222
00:09:09,829 --> 00:09:17,719
to try new things help us change doesn't

223
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:19,220
happen to this alone you may have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

224
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:21,439
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of an idea and that's a good</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">spark of meats and tender to help that</font>

226
00:09:21,439 --> 00:09:25,730
spark throwing<font color="#CCCCCC"> food so if you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have</font>

227
00:09:24,529 --> 00:09:29,240
these things it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just going to take</font>

228
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:31,189
longer for it to get done but there are

229
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:33,800
some organizations where it just fails

230
00:09:31,189 --> 00:09:39,490
overall and that's a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> sign</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of an</font>

231
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:45,549
unhealthy organization questions so far

232
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:48,740
that's the sector<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so failure</font>

233
00:09:45,549 --> 00:09:51,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">and one of the concepts of agile is the</font>

234
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:53,660
idea of failing fast I think faster we

235
00:09:51,829 --> 00:09:56,929
can fail the faster we can find out that

236
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:59,929
our product is a bad idea the less time

237
00:09:56,929 --> 00:10:03,259
and money we waste them so failure<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

238
00:09:59,929 --> 00:10:05,929
really it's a freeing thing it gives us

239
00:10:03,259 --> 00:10:08,029
the freedom to explore loses the freedom

240
00:10:05,929 --> 00:10:09,589
to experiment and succeed in uncharted

241
00:10:08,029 --> 00:10:11,480
territory there are a lot of

242
00:10:09,589 --> 00:10:13,160
organizations that<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of say well this</font>

243
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:14,449
is how we've done it all along this is

244
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:16,160
how we're going to do is I'm not going

245
00:10:14,449 --> 00:10:18,109
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> try anything new those are the</font>

246
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:21,860
organizations that are disappearing I

00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:23,480
used to<font color="#E5E5E5"> work for one I left the 12 year</font>

00:10:26,089 --> 00:10:29,749
<font color="#CCCCCC">was a big mistake that was a company</font>

251
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:31,160
where is funny they were bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> nothing</font>

252
00:10:29,749 --> 00:10:33,860
good to great you know they<font color="#E5E5E5"> were like</font>

253

<font color="#E5E5E5">there they were welcome that's the kind</font>

255
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:45,199
of thing that's kind of indefinitely so

256
00:10:43,399 --> 00:10:48,589
now there's a great opportunity learn

257
00:10:45,199 --> 00:10:50,059
and it's the thing is that you know

258
00:10:48,589 --> 00:10:52,249
there's hundred things<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> might</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

261
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:59,360
clients better and it's great to try

262
00:10:57,919 --> 00:11:00,860
those<font color="#CCCCCC"> sort of things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because somewhere</font>

263
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,860
in there is one or two things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are</font>

264
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:06,649
unique that if they<font color="#E5E5E5"> were have set us</font>

apart from our competitors and the only

266
00:11:06,649 --> 00:11:13,389
way you can discover those is<font color="#CCCCCC"> to find it</font>

267
00:11:08,749 --> 00:11:16,370
so the console cares fail fail fast<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

292
00:12:15,319 --> 00:12:20,389
change to the bitter end and even those

293
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:22,549
people have some value because<font color="#E5E5E5"> once they</font>

294
00:12:20,389 --> 00:12:25,519
accept your idea you know that it's been

to do is share that I a being with

he was also a vector he just knows

355
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:56,110
people everywhere consequently that's

356
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:58,610
the next thing you one concept is

357
00:14:56,110 --> 00:15:01,560
working very large organization

358

00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:13,859
connectors I would have built this good

and we mean is grateful for that and you

367
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:29,519
find connectors because you might have

368
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:31,170
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> holler from this and then by the</font>

374
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:49,440
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's your paradise one other thing</font>

375
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:51,750
to talk about people<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay there are</font>

376
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:53,790
three kinds of people in this world once

377
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:55,589
the basic pattern those who watch things

378
00:15:53,790 --> 00:16:00,660
happen and those who wonder what

379
00:15:55,589 --> 00:16:04,110
happened you need to find<font color="#E5E5E5"> the right</font>

380
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:07,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at the phaser in the project race</font>

381
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:09,630
this truth hey there you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't spend</font>

382
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:12,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">time early in your project trying to</font>

383
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:14,670
convince a lagger and hopefully move on

384
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:16,320
and accept the fact that they may be

385
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:21,029
your<font color="#CCCCCC"> best friend but they're just not</font>

386
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:22,860
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to step up and then also be kind</font>

387
00:16:21,029 --> 00:16:25,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">to them to the slow adopters leaving</font>

388
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:28,230
once they adopt you know that your idea

389
00:16:25,529 --> 00:16:29,670
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> really very stiff so that goes back</font>

390
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:31,290
again to the patient's right a lot of

391
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:33,270
times we're just like this is so obvious

392
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:35,730
why can't you pick a homeless well

393
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:37,620
that's fine to have that idea in your

394
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:40,589
head just there's something okay to

395
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:44,880
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> some things but don't express at</font>

396

397
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,600
kind of note on people and let's note on

398
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:51,300
the paradigm so kind of summarize that

399
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:52,890
you have this paradigm that you need to

400
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:54,329
keep in<font color="#CCCCCC"> mind when you're trying to knock</font>

401
00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:57,779
to change because<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've got to pick the</font>

402
00:16:54,329 --> 00:16:59,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">right people you need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to either be in an</font>

something small with<font color="#E5E5E5"> Lou the word</font>

409
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:21,420
so now we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about</font>

410
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:28,470
patterns and I really am hoping that

411
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:30,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">they'll be some interactions so I'm</font>

412
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:32,190
where<font color="#CCCCCC"> you talk about four patterns</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

413
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:34,440
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the basic accessory patterns</font>

of the change in the book we eat change

415

or us are in the Book Fair has changed

416
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:43,050
there are about 25 or 26 patterns for

417
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:45,510
change the thesis comes from for me

418
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:47,190
Argentina<font color="#E5E5E5"> the test the water Centennial</font>

second work well in my organization in

424
00:17:57,270 --> 00:18:02,490
what I do dated it right that maybe you

425
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:04,590
know with the building applications from

426
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:08,130
dotnet and God that takes a long time to

427
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:10,169
build them there's music rails rails

428
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:15,210
seems to accelerate development I wonder

429
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:16,980
if that statistic so the person testing

so you didn't answer questions another

451
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:17,540
one is to just just do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> give a demo so</font>

460
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:39,940
consider this for a future project and

461
00:19:37,299 --> 00:19:43,299
then proud back so one of the patterns

462
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:44,440
in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> focus group food and you know</font>

having<font color="#E5E5E5"> a brown bag you're not</font>

464
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:47,799
necessarily breaking food but

465
00:19:45,789 --> 00:19:50,408
everybody's got to eat lunch<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll have</font>

466
00:19:47,799 --> 00:19:53,590
a engaging<font color="#E5E5E5"> conversation in front of a</font>

467
00:19:50,409 --> 00:19:57,309
computer game programming people and

468
00:19:53,590 --> 00:20:01,149
then no other things whose business

469
00:19:57,309 --> 00:20:03,820
conversations is ask your boss the time

470
00:20:01,149 --> 00:20:07,090
of the meeting it's funny have you ever

471
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:08,860
seen a meeting to a 43 minutes long

472
00:20:07,090 --> 00:20:11,220
if it's scheduled for an hour how long

473
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:11,219
does it

474
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:17,200
yeah an hour to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the meetings will expand</font>

475
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:18,490
and contract with it I'm given so to

476
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,980
talk to your<font color="#CCCCCC"> boss and say you know what</font>

00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:31,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">squish the meeting down to 45 minutes to</font>

480
00:20:28,409 --> 00:20:34,210
talk about what does we want to do and

481
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,409
hit people speak back so you know that's

482
00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:37,390
a great way to get a bunch of people

483
00:20:35,409 --> 00:20:40,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">together they're already in the room</font>

your patient

518

and that turned into like 25<font color="#CCCCCC"> years of</font>

519
00:22:27,810 --> 00:22:34,320
our ball game involving my little sister

00:22:31,770 --> 00:22:37,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">road road versus all those who follow so</font>

00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:42,030
she's smart she's a lot further than my

522
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:45,449
opinion so planting a seed really really

523
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:48,750
effective plant to c walk away or in a

524
00:22:45,450 --> 00:22:50,670
growth questions on the test the waters

525
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:54,950
does anyone have an<font color="#E5E5E5"> example of something</font>

526
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:54,950
that's worked for them in this program

527
00:22:56,030 --> 00:23:02,310
no change at all right<font color="#CCCCCC"> mulan next</font>

528
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:04,590
pattern time for reflection um<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

529
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:07,860
you know in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the IT world we're known for</font>

530
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:10,050
how much time we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so the idea</font>

531
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:12,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">of time for reflection is weird</font>

532
00:23:10,050 --> 00:23:14,070
evangelist dedicated champion we're

533
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:18,649
using passing the water and try to end

534
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:20,730
in forward to make change happen and we

535
00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:23,130
know so we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing all these little</font>

536
00:23:20,730 --> 00:23:26,460
things and<font color="#E5E5E5"> bringing about but we know</font>

537
00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:29,900
importantly before<font color="#E5E5E5"> i do is to just stop</font>

538
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:33,900
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> pig out on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> paperwork I'm going well</font>

00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:36,000
what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going and honor over those</font>

540
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:38,700
things and it may not necessarily be

541
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,170
about the idea they may be about how

542
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:42,870
we're approaching you change from the

543
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:45,990
idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> alright so maybe we held a brown</font>

544
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:50,489
bag and at the brown bag we did a little

545
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:52,680
demo in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> demo self that's one for the</font>

546
00:23:50,490 --> 00:23:55,020
reflect on<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay this could have been</font>

547
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:56,700
done different I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go home</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

548
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:59,790
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to practice the step of four five</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">times to make sure it's just it's rock</font>

550
00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:04,159
solid then I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to try the devil in</font>

551
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:09,300
it's important that we stop and really

552
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:11,340
think about this I know when I was

553
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:13,980
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to enact change in a couple of</font>

554
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:16,199
organizational work with I'm so busy go

555
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:17,630
go go go go this I didn't work<font color="#E5E5E5"> with me</font>

556
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:21,360
trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> study an apprentice idea</font>

557
00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:24,240
really what was if I step back and

558
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:27,540
consider the<font color="#E5E5E5"> paragon of team I wasn't</font>

559
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:29,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">using the paradigm all of the ideas that</font>

560
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:32,010
I tried to enact change it was covered

561
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:35,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">all very good idea is really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> effective</font>

562
00:24:32,010 --> 00:24:36,960
had I used the period so a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> times</font>

563
00:24:35,490 --> 00:24:40,080
our reflection

564
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:42,149
using<font color="#E5E5E5"> more than our style and for</font>

565
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:44,639
engineers I don't know about all of all

566
00:24:42,149 --> 00:24:47,820
y'all but for me stopping<font color="#E5E5E5"> and thinking</font>

567
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:50,549
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the software is frustrating I am I</font>

568
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:52,529
look this is just playing for those my

569
00:24:50,549 --> 00:24:55,710
face like this just makes sense why are

570
00:24:52,529 --> 00:24:57,809

to<font color="#CCCCCC"> think about that inhabit astrak--</font>

572
00:24:57,809 --> 00:25:03,710
skills that we are using and not<font color="#CCCCCC"> moving</font>

573
00:24:59,610 --> 00:25:03,709
in order to be effective changing

574
00:25:04,130 --> 00:25:09,510
ex-offenders by reflection and at some

575
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:11,850
point reflection may indicate hanging

576
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:17,760
what the idea the overall idea from the

<font color="#CCCCCC">room nice</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> come with taking on somewhere</font>

00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:24,240
else in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the organization how effectively</font>

579
00:25:21,809 --> 00:25:29,340
in my usual she's paranoid how

580
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:31,140
effectively am I another thing to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use</font>

581
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:33,209
reflect as a group so we use

582
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:35,520
retrospectives in agile right you sit

583
00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:37,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">down we plan out our releases and do it</font>

584
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:40,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">with a sprint couple of Sprint's or</font>

585
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:44,279
releasing that we have a retrospective

586
00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:46,620
where we<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how to go early on</font>

587
00:25:44,279 --> 00:25:49,140
in migrating to agile retrospectives a

588
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:52,459
really important because we start to

589
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:55,440
learn<font color="#E5E5E5"> about our estimation accuracy</font>

590
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:57,419
right so the whole bowl of agile is<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

591
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">work 40 hours and i go home that's</font>

592
00:25:57,419 --> 00:26:03,289
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> for me that's with the goal of a</font>

593
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:06,779
driver and so the first couple of sprays

594
00:26:03,289 --> 00:26:09,330
inevitably a computer and the problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

595
00:26:06,779 --> 00:26:11,159
if you're really agile if you took that

596
00:26:09,330 --> 00:26:14,668
work on your committed for this evening

597
00:26:11,159 --> 00:26:17,279
and all day<font color="#E5E5E5"> saturday or office so it's</font>

598
00:26:14,669 --> 00:26:19,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">sort of this really great negative</font>

599
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:21,600
feedback loop for her like I'm never

600
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:23,690
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that again let's talk about</font>

601
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:25,949
the way yes that's the retrospective

602
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:27,690
same thing is you're trying to change

603
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:29,909
you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a group of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things out of</font>

604
00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:31,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">matrices</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> connector type of early</font>

605
00:26:29,909 --> 00:26:35,100

606
00:26:31,770 --> 00:26:37,049
organization<font color="#E5E5E5"> always good step back and</font>

607
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:39,299
say all right I've been<font color="#CCCCCC"> reflecting you</font>

608
00:26:37,049 --> 00:26:42,360
internally in my own for what about of

609
00:26:39,299 --> 00:26:46,889
the group Hopkins<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a group of your</font>

610
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:49,049
back and then ask you know what why how

611
00:26:46,889 --> 00:26:52,229
why not in what if

612
00:26:49,049 --> 00:26:54,830
I had a great manager I used to work for

613
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:56,970
the LDS Church in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the IT department</font>

614
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:59,100
where I actually tried<font color="#CCCCCC"> to introduce</font>

615
00:26:56,970 --> 00:27:02,629
sister development and it's funny

616
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:06,719
because i have spent several months I've

617
00:27:02,629 --> 00:27:09,090
got no one and then when we<font color="#E5E5E5"> were</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing a</font>

618
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:12,029
new release<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the new</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> product</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> had a lot</font>

619
00:27:09,090 --> 00:27:14,730
of privacy repercussions actually just

<font color="#E5E5E5">said 80 or let's just sit down for a day</font>

621
00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:21,779

625
00:27:30,389 --> 00:27:35,758
when I was and other conversations who

626
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:40,320
asked why give an answer he asked for me

627
00:27:35,759 --> 00:27:43,230
but why hair each answer part going down

628
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:45,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">five why so if you're looking at change</font>

and it's not going well for<font color="#CCCCCC"> you one how</font>

from the organization's building softly

the incremental little steps celebrating

00:30:21,230 --> 00:30:26,030
little success especially the slow ones

684
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:29,420
in the early ones long change can take

685
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:32,000
forever<font color="#E5E5E5"> the idea is we have this goal</font>

686
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:33,890
that's way way out there but let's make

687
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:37,100
sure that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're focusing on what we're</font>

00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:40,189
will get to the sector and you know the

690
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:42,440
celebrations don't have to be big they

691
00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:44,260
can be sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> celebrations just</font>

692
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:46,850
feeling away from work for half an hour

about five o'clock on a Friday afternoon

victories are really important if you're

708

small because they<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're a feedback</font>

711
00:31:29,090 --> 00:31:34,159
couple early victories norm on the right

712
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:44,360
track that gives<font color="#E5E5E5"> me the energy is a</font>

713
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:46,700
dedicated<font color="#E5E5E5"> group</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so the last pattern</font>

714
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:48,409
here is step by step yeah the idea here

715
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:51,590
is you realize now that there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

716
00:31:48,410 --> 00:31:53,870
interested<font color="#E5E5E5"> in your idea and the</font>

717
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:57,800
important thing is to so you want to

718
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:59,479
know how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to introduce you've got some</font>

719
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:02,540
early feedback that it's good what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

720
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:03,830
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> now to go forward</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok and it is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to use</font>

721
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:06,139
that incremental approach am just

722
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:08,600
talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> where you've got this</font>

723
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:10,580
vision out here and that's fine<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

724
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:14,090
where you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be but focus on the</font>

725
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:16,970
next step well focused out there because

726
00:32:14,090 --> 00:32:19,040
that'll take care of<font color="#E5E5E5"> itself so it's</font>

727
00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:20,720
funny I mountain bike along i had the

728
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:26,030
opportunity to Michael either

729
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:27,620
professional racer very interesting

730
00:32:26,030 --> 00:32:31,700
story actually all fiber issues we have

731
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:34,280
any time she had mono and had to cancel

732
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:36,890
one of those seasons she came back the

733
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:38,510
next season is one of her first race and

734
00:32:36,890 --> 00:32:40,850
then she'd acted by a car broke<font color="#E5E5E5"> her</font>

735
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:43,760
pelvis<font color="#E5E5E5"> they didn't concede walk again</font>

736
00:32:40,850 --> 00:32:45,850
and the last<font color="#E5E5E5"> I saw on facebook last</font>

737
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:48,650
night she's hearing yellow jersey<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

738
00:32:45,850 --> 00:32:52,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">Vietnam there's an international</font>

739
00:32:48,650 --> 00:32:54,680
mountain<font color="#CCCCCC"> biking she's the kind of person</font>

740
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:56,480
that really sticks to it and she taught

741
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:58,010
us<font color="#E5E5E5"> when we were riding she's like look</font>

742
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:01,430
you can't look at the bottom the hill

743
00:32:58,010 --> 00:33:03,320
the bottom will come and you can't look

744
00:33:01,430 --> 00:33:05,630
right in front of your tire if you look

745
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:06,950
about 15 to 20 feet out of your minds

746
00:33:05,630 --> 00:33:09,500
with peripheral vision will pick up

747
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:14,780
everything up to that phone and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you'll</font>

748
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:17,030
have enough warning over if change is

749
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:18,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of the same idea if you have an</font>

750
00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:18,990
idea of where you're going and that's

751
00:33:18,410 --> 00:33:21,600
coming

752
00:33:18,990 --> 00:33:23,520
another why so and then you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

753
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:25,139
things you're doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> day-to-day right but</font>

754
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:27,150
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just want to run your next step</font>

755
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:30,990
aesthetics one or two steps into the

756
00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:32,220
darkness if you will and every<font color="#CCCCCC"> once in a</font>

757
00:33:30,990 --> 00:33:34,320
while when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> knew your pause for</font>

758
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:38,460
reflection you make sure okay am I still

759
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:40,320
the right path or are these people going

760
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:41,400
the wrong way is actually the right way

761
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:46,909
is the feedback we're getting

762
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:49,679
redirecting us or<font color="#E5E5E5"> you doing small test</font>

763
00:33:46,910 --> 00:33:51,830
so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> same idea is finding a</font>

764
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:56,280
ladder<font color="#CCCCCC"> right we do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it one at a time</font>

765
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:57,720
we'll just keep going up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and up so the</font>

766
00:33:56,280 --> 00:34:00,840
other thing to keep in mind is that a

767
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:03,840
plan<font color="#CCCCCC"> changes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so I Eagles at Merced you</font>

768
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:05,100
know battle pens are great here but they

769
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:10,379
get thrown up in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the bedroom will be</font>

770
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:13,469
<font color="#CCCCCC">engage with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> engines and the idea here is</font>

771
00:34:10,379 --> 00:34:16,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">also you step by step day looking things</font>

772
00:34:13,469 --> 00:34:18,209
that you can do a little real estate you

773
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:21,060
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> have that will gain confidence</font>

774
00:34:18,210 --> 00:34:22,800
review for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the team that's kind of an</font>

775
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:25,409
attitude of more importance to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:26,909
<font color="#CCCCCC">organization's that's taking the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> risk on</font>

777
00:34:25,409 --> 00:34:31,830
your change in the time that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is to</font>

778
00:34:26,909 --> 00:34:33,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">divert availability any questions each</font>

779
00:34:31,830 --> 00:34:34,980
other those are the four patents any

780
00:34:33,389 --> 00:34:40,109
questions or comments in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the pattern so</font>

781
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:41,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">far so we're on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to our last slide we've</font>

782
00:34:40,109 --> 00:34:43,679
got about 20 minutes left so actually

783
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:45,359
lieutenant money so some of the lessons

784
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:50,850
learned from the trenches this is kind

785
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:54,270
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the rest of my ex or people and</font>

786
00:34:50,850 --> 00:34:57,089
companies are are better with change

787
00:34:54,270 --> 00:34:58,590
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's incidental it's the fraud in</font>

790
00:35:00,330 --> 00:35:05,549
the problem stay there or if you drop a

frog in boiling water don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> chill out of</font>

792
00:35:05,550 --> 00:35:13,400
it so bring your changes slowly I have a

793
00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:16,140
former manager who had a fantastic

794
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:18,180
mindset I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> very enthusiastic about my</font>

00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:19,859
job I<font color="#E5E5E5"> wonderful a to just change the</font>

796

world in this organization where<font color="#CCCCCC"> I life</font>

797
00:35:19,859 --> 00:35:26,910
and she would always be focusing and say

798
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:29,430
John you can't order him he got to pick

799
00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:32,180
one or two things to focus on focus on

800
00:35:29,430 --> 00:35:37,220
those and then

801
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:42,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">April is a long provision best kept</font>

802
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:44,089
yourself you should give a general idea

803
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:45,500
of the direction you're going but<font color="#E5E5E5"> last</font>

804
00:35:44,089 --> 00:35:47,720
thing you want to do is walk in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

805
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:49,010
office I do<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of work in the secure</font>

806
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:51,558
development so that's right including

807
00:35:49,010 --> 00:35:53,000
those the last thing you want to do is

808
00:35:51,559 --> 00:35:55,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">the walking will be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here engineering</font>

office and say a<font color="#CCCCCC"> year from now your</font>

810
00:35:55,730 --> 00:36:00,260
developers will all write code and

811
00:35:58,730 --> 00:36:01,490
before they check their code in there

812
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:03,950
that are run it through static code

817
00:36:12,829 --> 00:36:17,599
comfortable now does that mean to

818
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:20,030
complete up<font color="#E5E5E5"> even how they do their work</font>

year from now we're going to be writing

822
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:28,550
significantly more secure code got a

823
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:31,609
number of<font color="#CCCCCC"> ideas to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> work on it and like</font>

826
00:36:33,559 --> 00:36:38,720
start<font color="#CCCCCC"> learning or could do that just to</font>

gazelle and there's a lion chasing me

840

I'm very very involved<font color="#E5E5E5"> in that moment</font>

paradigm is long yield results it's

845
00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:37,220
funny I always had historically approach

846
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:39,349
change from a ad hoc perspective I'm a

847

visionary my<font color="#CCCCCC"> likeness in like you know</font>

850
00:37:43,339 --> 00:37:50,730
i'm off and there nothing

855
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:03,990
thing so keep organized in your approach

856
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:06,300
and then change its best accepted when

857
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:08,549
it's couched<font color="#CCCCCC"> insulting for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stickers and</font>

862
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:25,770
do this and your developers are here to

863
00:38:22,950 --> 00:38:28,529
know how to write code that's free of

864
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:30,660
sequel injection vulnerabilities great

865
00:38:28,530 --> 00:38:32,460
i'm excited about that what I really

866
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:36,120
care about is getting my product out the

867
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:38,010
door open so with the cio we<font color="#E5E5E5"> talked</font>

868
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:40,589
about change in terms of well you know

869
00:38:38,010 --> 00:38:42,660
if we can work to teach the development

870
00:38:40,590 --> 00:38:44,850
team how to write code that's for you

871
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:47,190
seeking objection wrong reviews that's

872
00:38:44,850 --> 00:38:48,960
going to help you because of the one

873
00:38:47,190 --> 00:38:51,540
your code is<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> past the security</font>

874
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:53,640
review the first time instead of getting

875
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:55,050
kicked back and never tune when it goes

876
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:58,410
out the door it's not going to happen to

877
00:38:55,050 --> 00:39:00,660
that when you pump in the CFO they love

878
00:38:58,410 --> 00:39:03,480
return on investment and they love<font color="#CCCCCC"> risk</font>

879
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:06,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">reward</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right so i can go to a CIO and i</font>

880
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:09,300
can say look we've got X number of thi

881
00:39:06,930 --> 00:39:12,029
records of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your database if we were to</font>

breach every<font color="#E5E5E5"> single one of those records</font>

883
00:39:12,030 --> 00:39:16,680
that would cost us three hundred

884
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:19,529
thousand dollars directors x album in

885
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:22,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">the cabin so we're looking at a three</font>

886
00:39:19,530 --> 00:39:23,610
billion dollar risk and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font>

887
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:25,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">one of the ways we can significantly</font>

888
00:39:23,610 --> 00:39:27,690
reduce that risk is a bleeder too

889
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:29,910
invested<font color="#CCCCCC"> blah blah blah inconsistent</font>

890
00:39:27,690 --> 00:39:33,360
money is there Oh<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> per thousand</font>

891
00:39:29,910 --> 00:39:39,690
dollars to help mitigate it's definitely

892
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:42,120
great and then CEO<font color="#E5E5E5"> you talk about</font>

893
00:39:39,690 --> 00:39:44,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">filming for us to bring more and more on</font>

894
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:46,920
board through are holding their CEOs

895
00:39:44,070 --> 00:39:48,420
accountable for security and so it's a

896
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:51,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">great opportunity so what I go to</font>

897
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:54,019
borders it for this<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure</font>

898
00:39:51,309 --> 00:39:55,339
and then finally from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the engineers that</font>

899
00:39:54,019 --> 00:39:59,629
engineers are about learning new<font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font>

900
00:39:55,339 --> 00:40:02,089
about David's dead nor most cases and so

901
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:03,799
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> see there's a vizio really doesn't</font>

902
00:40:02,089 --> 00:40:12,650
care about me internal investment last

903
00:40:03,799 --> 00:40:15,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">it is scared now oh you know so speak in</font>

904
00:40:12,650 --> 00:40:19,819
the language of self-interest and think

905
00:40:15,650 --> 00:40:21,440
about your your audience listening so in

906
00:40:19,819 --> 00:40:24,259
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> end really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the whole idea</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

907
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:26,900
change is<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's a conscious thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here's</font>

908
00:40:24,259 --> 00:40:30,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">paradise there's some patterns to think</font>

909
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:33,559
the real key is to recognize oh I want

910
00:40:30,859 --> 00:40:36,109
change to occur my organization first

911
00:40:33,559 --> 00:40:38,329
recognition second one there are ways to

912
00:40:36,109 --> 00:40:40,880
do it successfully let's stop and think

913
00:40:38,329 --> 00:40:42,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">about them look my paradigm who are the</font>

914
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:44,390
people that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are going to help me with my</font>

915
00:40:42,259 --> 00:40:46,970
chain how am I going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do is one of the</font>

916
00:40:44,390 --> 00:40:49,460
patterns I want to apply<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then really</font>

917
00:40:46,970 --> 00:40:52,308
very consciously go through the process

918
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:55,970
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> be amazed how much more effective</font>

919
00:40:52,309 --> 00:40:57,710
you are impatient there to bring us all

920
00:40:55,970 --> 00:41:00,828
back to what we do in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this room we have</font>

921
00:40:57,710 --> 00:41:03,739
a fine link I guess is when we look at

922
00:41:00,829 --> 00:41:06,739
it there's a cultured conversation today

923
00:41:03,739 --> 00:41:08,809
about security and privacy we have the

924
00:41:06,739 --> 00:41:11,809
opportunity and the responsibility is

925
00:41:08,809 --> 00:41:13,609
Security leaders in art managers we are

926
00:41:11,809 --> 00:41:16,999
security leaders because we are blogging

927
00:41:13,609 --> 00:41:20,029
for security we've the opportunity now

928
00:41:16,999 --> 00:41:22,759
to push that change in our organization

929
00:41:20,029 --> 00:41:25,730
uses do the right skills we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need right</font>

930
00:41:22,759 --> 00:41:29,239
cool does and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is more very</font>

931
00:41:25,730 --> 00:41:32,029
effective approach so with that<font color="#CCCCCC"> all open</font>

932
00:41:29,239 --> 00:41:36,400
up the questions they have or comments

933
00:41:32,029 --> 00:41:36,400
that they have<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

934
00:41:47,890 --> 00:41:53,600
in security pain is the number one

935
00:41:50,870 --> 00:41:55,400
reason to change right I mean look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at it</font>

936
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:58,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">look it pardon look at all the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

937
00:41:55,400 --> 00:42:00,500
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> breach what do they do absolutely</font>

938
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:04,819
we turned around in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> fifth is daddy</font>

939
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:09,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">coming oh I just heard head okay</font>

940
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:13,610
perfectly all<font color="#CCCCCC"> right face yes that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fun</font>

941
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:17,570
so yeah it's pain is a key change now

942
00:42:13,610 --> 00:42:18,950
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very reactive and I think everyone</font>

943
00:42:17,570 --> 00:42:20,720
in this room would agree that right now

944
00:42:18,950 --> 00:42:23,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">security and security</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> chief is</font>

945
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:25,100
incredibly reactors in this in other

946
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:27,470
words we don't do anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> until it's</font>

947
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:29,839
broken for real key here is to be able

948
00:42:27,470 --> 00:42:31,700
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> drive risk conversations in your</font>

949
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:35,000
organization based on the pain and<font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

950
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:37,430
confirm experience and say okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

951
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:40,310
and the briefs recently look how much

952
00:42:37,430 --> 00:42:42,379
this is gonna cost them take the couple

953
00:42:40,310 --> 00:42:44,450
hundred thousand records x motor looks

954
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:48,830
bigger in dirty dollars definitely a lot

955
00:42:44,450 --> 00:42:50,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">or money are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we prepared so the best</font>

956
00:42:48,830 --> 00:43:04,279
thing is to<font color="#CCCCCC"> try to use other people's</font>

957
00:42:50,120 --> 00:43:06,020
pain and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fact the idea is</font>

958
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:09,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">long-term vision is best attempt</font>

959
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:11,509
yourself so if you say boss man we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

960
00:43:09,770 --> 00:43:13,430
going to implement<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the assistive</font>

961

966
00:43:24,770 --> 00:43:28,970
people are going to complain so there's

967
00:43:27,470 --> 00:43:31,450
there's a better way to<font color="#E5E5E5"> approach</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

968
00:43:28,970 --> 00:43:31,450
morning

969
00:43:47,210 --> 00:43:56,330
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll give you a indirect form</font>

970
00:43:51,560 --> 00:44:00,470
invasion I had a friend who knew a man

00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:19,400
every day without doing nothing so if

know there's I mean a potential a lead

981
00:44:26,270 --> 00:44:29,930
there isn't a lead in the world that

982
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:33,348
I've spoken<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not sit I would like</font>

984
00:44:33,349 --> 00:44:43,900
I'm constrained by what money time and

985
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:45,920
resources people right so so we say look

986
00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:47,500
great if we had a complete security

987
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:49,430
element life cycle<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this organization</font>
