can you hear me<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay in the back great</font>

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:08,099
perfect thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> for that introduction</font>

3
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:12,809
so today we're going to be talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

4
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:15,830
phones and wipe and security I'll bit of

5
00:00:12,809 --> 00:00:19,380
hacking a little farm<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay as far as</font>

6
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:22,560
what what we're going to be covering

7
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:24,538
today before<font color="#CCCCCC"> I get started I want to</font>

8
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,890
kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of go do a quick quick disclaimer</font>

9
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:27,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">write a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of stuff we can be</font>

10
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:30,570
discussing today can be used<font color="#E5E5E5"> for good</font>

11
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:32,279
and bad hopefully will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be beneficial to</font>

12
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:34,440
those that I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for good but</font>

13
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:37,110
I've had some of my co-workers that have

14
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:38,550
been<font color="#CCCCCC"> threatening to sue if not suit</font>

15
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:40,920
before so here's this claim right there

16
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:43,078
all right as always explain I've been

17
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:45,390
doing security for quite some time in

18
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:48,030
both mostly consulting some operations

19
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:50,640
we mostly consulting and as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I go from</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">trends and wipe secure your insecurity</font>

22
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:59,100
is one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things I want to talk</font>

23
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:02,430
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> today around a small consultancy</font>

24
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:04,939
called security and I community

26
00:01:04,938 --> 00:01:09,509
shameless plug we have a class coming up

27
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:11,369
here<font color="#CCCCCC"> in June anybody is interested to</font>

28
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:13,680
learn about web application security and

29
00:01:11,369 --> 00:01:16,020
ethical hacking can check it out on

30
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,780
sense the dog website I run a wats

31
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:21,570
chapter I've been doing it for about

32
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:24,630
seven eight years<font color="#CCCCCC"> now and if you never</font>

34
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:27,570
application security project right so

35
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:29,970
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> great resource for somebody</font>

36
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:33,298
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> learning about web only about</font>

37
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:34,860
security and and I need some guidance

38
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:37,290
there because a lot of a lot of great

39
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:39,750
resource on that site is also you toss a

40
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:41,759
gorg intersec is organization that we

41
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:44,100
kind of kicked off here to<font color="#E5E5E5"> her combined</font>

42
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:47,520
security<font color="#E5E5E5"> minded professionals together</font>

43
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:49,949
we have monthly meetings and you can

44
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,869
check it out<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> got you test cyborg so</font>

45
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:54,119
let me buy me so why here's the agenda

46
00:01:51,869 --> 00:01:56,549
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> today right so first we'll talk</font>

47
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:59,549
about why do we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to secure voice why</font>

48
00:01:56,549 --> 00:02:01,560
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it that you know this is with any</font>

49
00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:04,079
technology you get out new technology is

50
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:07,950
kind of flashy and useful and beneficial

51
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:11,730
cost savings then after<font color="#E5E5E5"> some time you</font>

52
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:13,290
will try to you know you find out

53
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:13,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">there's some some security concerns with</font>

54
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:15,390
that

55
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:16,620
technology and<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of hot for a while</font>

56
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:18,779
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> then it kinda falls off that</font>

57
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:21,209
something else comes up and<font color="#CCCCCC"> something</font>

58
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:22,740
else texts place so that's kind of why I

59
00:02:21,209 --> 00:02:25,260
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about wood because I feel</font>

60
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:28,080
like it<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of fell</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> off the radar a</font>

61
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:30,420
little bit and and I'm passionate about

62
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,160
that so we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about how is</font>

63
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:36,690
enterprise exposed so we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> focus</font>

64
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:38,579
this on an enterprise on you know maybe

65
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:43,620
public sector as well mostly private

66
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:45,959
sector 44 some<font color="#CCCCCC"> examples and then as far</font>

67
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:47,580
as how do you how do you you know

68
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:50,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">security how do you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> prevent</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> somebody</font>

69
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:52,470
from doing something like VoIP you know

70
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:54,780
via and hopping and getting into white

71
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:58,590
people on and<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting to that voice data</font>

72
00:02:54,780 --> 00:03:00,209
how do you<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually secure it now some</font>

73
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:02,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the recommendations are generic for</font>

74
00:03:00,209 --> 00:03:04,739
any vendor and then if you want to get

75
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:06,420
really into need<font color="#CCCCCC"> ingredient you gotta</font>

76
00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:07,769
get more specifically the vendor because

77
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:09,690
every vendor is going to have some

78
00:03:07,769 --> 00:03:12,630
little bit different capabilities so for

79
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:15,300
this talk I decided to go with the most

80
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:17,250
common ender that we see as we do

81
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:19,920
assessments and that's you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know Cisco</font>

82
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:21,180
this because is the vendor that we

83
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:25,260
normally assisting me five

84
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:27,450
communications and so that's why some

85
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:29,850
recommendations will be from that vendor

86
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:31,679
but but the concepts you'll buy candy

87
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:34,140
vendor out there shouldn't be vendor

88
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,640
specific<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about the</font>

89
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:37,470
implementation itself infrastructure

90
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:39,420
will talk about phones and what can you

91
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:41,880
do with bones and some of the settings

92
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:44,309
there and we'll wrap it all up at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

93
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:45,840
end there<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure</font>

94
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:48,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">everybody the same page as far as VoIP</font>

95
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:51,239
is concerned<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so you get your</font>

96
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:53,220
voice that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going over data network</font>

97
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:57,329
it's a great benefit there is obviously

98
00:03:53,220 --> 00:04:00,420
cost savings and that's kind of how it

99
00:03:57,329 --> 00:04:02,040
got got kicked off and anybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font>

100
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:05,160
works for company does not<font color="#E5E5E5"> use wipe</font>

101
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:07,200
they're just still so most of us<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

102
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:08,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">here kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of yeah most of their prices</font>

103
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we come</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> across there's going to be</font>

104
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:15,329
wipe on the network<font color="#CCCCCC"> and that's what it</font>

105
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:19,168
<font color="#E5E5E5">will be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> using all right oops all right</font>

106
00:04:15,329 --> 00:04:20,668
now the security<font color="#E5E5E5"> concerns with VoIP kind</font>

107
00:04:19,168 --> 00:04:23,880
of stem from the fact that you take

108
00:04:20,668 --> 00:04:26,190
voice that traditionally has been done

109
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:27,120
in one environment<font color="#CCCCCC"> and take it to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a data</font>

110
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:28,290
network

111
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,490
so it kind of inherent some of the

112
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:31,979
issues<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the data network that we</font>

113
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:35,280
talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> they will be talking about</font>

114
00:04:31,979 --> 00:04:37,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">more in detail but the fact that you</font>

115
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:39,900
know some of the establishment of

116
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:43,289
communication is not is not that very

117
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:46,138
well designed from security standpoint

118
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:48,510
and how do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know that whatever the</font>

119
00:04:46,139 --> 00:04:51,449
device is on a network is a device that

120
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:53,699
is advertising to be that device how do

121
00:04:51,449 --> 00:04:56,310
you prevent<font color="#E5E5E5"> spoofing and and those kind</font>

122
00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:57,900
of attacks now is it<font color="#CCCCCC"> something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we should</font>

123
00:04:56,310 --> 00:05:01,110
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> worrying about something worth</font>

124
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:03,900
securing right so here's a couple

125
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:07,050
examples there's an attack on the

126
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:11,400
hospital ER it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> an extortion attack</font>

127
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:13,020
so was the the threat was that if you

128
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:16,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't pay a certain amount of money will</font>

129
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:19,560
shut down your voice network and the

130
00:05:16,169 --> 00:05:22,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">part was ignored as a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> result the the</font>

131
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:25,590
phone you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> ER system completely went</font>

132
00:05:22,139 --> 00:05:28,620
dead right so so we have seen these down

133
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:30,929
in the wild I mean it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sound in to 911</font>

134
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:32,430
call centers you know something critical

135
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:35,669
critical constructor critical

136
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:39,210
functionality and relies on white quite

137
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:42,210
heavily and if I it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not protected</font>

138
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:45,060
properly then all<font color="#E5E5E5"> this can be abused you</font>

139
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:46,669
know the public safety agencies are<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

140
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:48,840
as vulnerable and then of course

141
00:05:46,669 --> 00:05:51,810
businesses kind of stems into that area

142
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:56,369
as well will rely on the voice you know

143
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:59,070
it is your phone lines is critical part

144
00:05:56,370 --> 00:06:02,340
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> business not to the question to</font>

145
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:04,440

199
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:19,619
I've been doing research<font color="#E5E5E5"> on this area</font>

200
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:23,400
for a<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit and that in the posting</font>

201
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:27,410
information<font color="#E5E5E5"> on online and social media</font>

202
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:30,450
and so forth and I see a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a lot of</font>

203
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:31,590
requests what requests for visa de

204
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:33,870
functionality the reason for this

205
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:35,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">information to be made public those</font>

206
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:38,270
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> are aware</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of it and they can act</font>

207
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:42,240
accordingly so here's an example<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

208
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:45,029
emails that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we get at our company I got</font>

209
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:47,130
one to hear from russian federation and

210
00:08:45,029 --> 00:08:50,490
they said hey<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to hack some phones</font>

211
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:53,180
price is irrelevant right so somebody

212
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:55,130
out there you know avoid data or

213
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:57,739
you know phone calls conversations are

214
00:08:55,130 --> 00:09:00,700
important to the extend it<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it built</font>

215
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:04,399
they'll pay whatever amount you're

216
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:08,899
you're willing to do it for and now as

217
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:11,680
far<font color="#CCCCCC"> as implementations of VoIP</font>

218
00:09:08,899 --> 00:09:16,070
implementations out there as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mentioned</font>

219
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:17,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">to get this to great detail you got to</font>

220
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:19,610
get<font color="#CCCCCC"> remember specific a little bit</font>

221
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:21,319
because every vendor will have a little

222
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:23,720
bit different functionality different

223
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:25,070
options that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they offering and here</font>

224
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:28,040
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be talking a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> little bit</font>

225
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:30,350
about that that misconfigurations all

226
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:33,529
right so everybody knows secure is

227
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:35,810
important so vendors by now have been

228
00:09:33,529 --> 00:09:38,120
pushed to the extent of offering those

229
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:40,219
those capabilities they might cost a bit

230
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:42,410
extra but they offering it now if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

231
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:44,420
spend certain amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of money out of</font>

232
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:46,579
your budget to buy a VoIP solution that

233
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:49,130
has those capabilities you do not turn

234
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:52,040
those capabilities on we don't configure

235
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:53,689
them your return<font color="#E5E5E5"> investment just you</font>

236
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:55,520
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not it's not there anymore</font>

237
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:58,459
right you know no taking<font color="#E5E5E5"> advantage of</font>

238
00:09:55,520 --> 00:10:00,350
the capabilities so we come across you

239
00:09:58,459 --> 00:10:02,449
come to the enterprise and you see<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

240
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:04,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">know latest and greatest hard work but</font>

241
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:06,650
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> very soft word and you look how its</font>

242
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:08,480
configured and it's not even using the

243
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:10,490
capabilities that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are available in</font>

244
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:13,130
it so we'll talk about how to<font color="#E5E5E5"> enable</font>

245
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:17,440
those capabilities and and how to make

246
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:20,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">it so that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our voice data is protected</font>

247
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:22,400
now is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it externals internal I'll some</font>

248
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:24,709
people will argue that hey this is this

249
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:26,930
is my phones in my office you know who

250
00:10:24,709 --> 00:10:28,189
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> who is really my internal network you</font>

251
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:31,939
know the whole barrier between external

252
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:33,650
internal is really really big you know

253
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:35,690
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of disseminating more and more</font>

254
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:37,300
if you use it internal network and you

255
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:39,829
use it<font color="#CCCCCC"> as your weakest link as we know</font>

256
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:41,449
right then then somebody from the

257
00:10:39,829 --> 00:10:43,069
outside<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get our internal network all</font>

259
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:47,870
link which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> your users so that barrier</font>

260
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:51,770

261
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:54,410

hasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> that hasn't played too well for</font>

263

00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:16,560
obviously off his<font color="#E5E5E5"> wide he uses it as</font>

290
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:17,610
well it says obviously everywhere was a

291
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:20,640
joke about power plant something

292
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:22,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">sensitive by the way and who else used</font>

293
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:24,060
cisco phones the<font color="#CCCCCC"> president</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> does on this</font>

294
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,760
picture though he's not actually using

295
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:31,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">the using cisco phone but it's on his</font>

296
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:33,720
desk so no he's used<font color="#E5E5E5"> it as well now the</font>

297
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:36,500
concept with with VoIP is that you

298
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:41,340
segregate your data from your<font color="#E5E5E5"> voice</font>

299
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:43,890
track right so we see<font color="#CCCCCC"> vlans being used</font>

300
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:45,570
quite a bit mostly is done from quality

301
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:50,100
of service perspective<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so you</font>

302
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:53,460
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have your your VLAN for sending</font>

303
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:56,460
your voice traffic and then you have

304
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:59,070
your data VLAN where you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have as</font>

305
00:12:56,460 --> 00:13:02,730
high of requirements for for quality of

306
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:05,190
service so but<font color="#CCCCCC"> vlans right it's a</font>

307
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:06,810
virtual LAN are we getting really

308
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:09,330
comfortable to virtual now now we have

309
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:11,579
virtual you know private and virtual

310
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:14,610
kind of goes<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the same sense of the</font>

311
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:17,430
cloud as well and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> cannot forget about</font>

312
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:19,230
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fact that virtual is not is not the</font>

313
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:19,640
same as<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know physical segregation</font>

314
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:23,060
right

315
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:26,120
so we'll see that typically these

316
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:28,729
sometimes there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> no filtering so you</font>

317
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:29,960
have your VLAN and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> get comfortable</font>

318
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:31,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the concept that it's feline</font>

319
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:33,320
security barrier<font color="#CCCCCC"> we've been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> providing</font>

320
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:36,079
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at calls any kind of filtering in</font>

321
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:38,240
between then it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> offering</font>

322
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:41,510
that segregation right and somebody can

323
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:43,340
get from one of you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> another so</font>

324
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:46,160
how do you do it how do you do it at

325
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:49,600
home well here's some examples you can

326
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:51,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">do it in on the Windows operating system</font>

327
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:54,730
you gotta you know install something

328
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:58,760
show additional software for that and

329
00:13:54,730 --> 00:14:02,380
but here's an example of how<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need to</font>

330
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:05,930
find<font color="#E5E5E5"> out what what that view n ID is and</font>

331
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:08,600
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that quite easily with ex VP</font>

332
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:10,839
Broadcast<font color="#E5E5E5"> you see it on the wire it's</font>

333
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:13,130
not hidden really well from that

334
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:15,080
otherwise you can choose using seat on

335
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:16,130
the phone you can you know go through

336
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:18,530
the settings on the phone you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get your</font>

337
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:20,390
VLAN now how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you join IV line here's</font>

338
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:22,459
an example of all you do you just say

339
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:24,380
hey well this interface I want to be

340
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:27,020
able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk on this new line there's no</font>

341
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:28,340
filtering now you<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on the voice VLAN</font>

342
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:31,100
yeah all right now you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just like a phone</font>

343
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:34,390
now you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just like call manager now you</font>

344
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:41,120
can intercept that traffic and that and

345
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:43,280
beyond that segment now on linux so you

346
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:45,350
got to have a tour to that one<font color="#CCCCCC"> QV line</font>

347
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:47,870
implementation it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard to get and</font>

348
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:51,160
then you can similarly just say hey I

349
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:54,800
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to configure my</font>

350
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:57,290
interface to to be MSP line and here's

351
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:59,599
commands there and then as long as they

352
00:14:57,290 --> 00:15:02,709
support the HCP it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> absolutely</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

353
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:04,580
addressed<font color="#CCCCCC"> BAM you're able to talk on</font>

354
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:08,090
something that's considered that

355
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:12,520
considered you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know a separate</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> separate</font>

356
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:15,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">land simple network on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> OS X even easier</font>

357
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:18,230
all you have to do just go to system

358
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:20,480
preferences or the network choose the

359
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:23,840
managed virtual interfaces and out of

360
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:26,090
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want and then just get your used to</font>

361
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:29,330
be configured and off you go so it's not

362
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:31,010
very complex right every operating

363
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:33,140
system pretty much too well the ones

364
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:33,470
that I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> mentioned here will have a</font>

365
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:36,290
keep

366
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:37,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">wait to do that yet when you come to</font>

367
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:39,290
network and you talk to network

368
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:41,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">administrators an awesome well tell me</font>

369
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:43,699
about your boy open and<font color="#E5E5E5"> your data is a</font>

370
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:46,250
grading people on the call is totally

371
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:49,150
separate<font color="#E5E5E5"> solely solely different but</font>

372
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:52,040
then you look under the hood and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I</font>

373
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:54,230
know some people<font color="#CCCCCC"> that do you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Hotel</font>

374
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:58,310
type environments where they try to get

375
00:15:54,230 --> 00:16:00,770
from you know phone to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the hotel from</font>

376
00:15:58,310 --> 00:16:03,739
phone to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internal network of the</font>

377
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:07,400
hotels and and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> still still come on</font>

378
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:09,650
there as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well now you know after that</font>

379
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:12,079
once you join the VLAN your regular man

380
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:14,120
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> middle are poisoning the common</font>

381
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:17,410
stuff that's been around there for quite

382
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:20,240
some time with with data networks and

383
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:22,939
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know some of the tools used example</font>

384
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:25,400
of being<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to decode that that</font>

385
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:28,370
traffic and actually play it with a Via

386
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:31,069
Media Player so how do we how do we

387
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:34,940
address this so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> gotta restrict access</font>

388
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:38,200
between one wheel and another so using

389
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:40,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know stateful firewalls ackles</font>

390
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:42,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">prevent the traffic from going from one</font>

391
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:45,080
to another prevent users from<font color="#E5E5E5"> his</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> being</font>

392
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:47,270
to connect reason when we see a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

393
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:49,370
times they'll open that ability to

394
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:53,000
connect<font color="#CCCCCC"> is for example they need to</font>

395
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:54,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">manage network wipe wipe network and</font>

396
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">they bring in consultants from the</font>

397
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:58,160
outside so the overhead right<font color="#E5E5E5"> now you</font>

398
00:16:56,300 --> 00:17:00,170
need to provide them that access now you

399
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:01,939
get that you know let them get to that

400
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:03,500
data it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> convenient when it's wide open</font>

401
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:06,970
right they<font color="#E5E5E5"> can just come in plug inin</font>

402
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:08,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">and I get get it fixed get it done in</font>

403
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:12,050
scenario where it needs to be updated

404
00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:13,339
used to be used to be corrected but at

405
00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:15,230
the same time we want to make sure that

406
00:17:13,339 --> 00:17:19,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">somebody it's not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> authorized can't do</font>

407
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:22,280
that as well and you know it let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> take</font>

408
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:24,200
a public<font color="#E5E5E5"> area right so in a lobby a lot</font>

409
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:25,849
of times a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I'm sure they</font>

410
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:29,690
cover and some of the social engineering

411
00:17:25,849 --> 00:17:31,610
talks if you if you were to try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

412
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:33,640
internal network obviously you you know

413
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:36,530
tailgate somebody get on the inside<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

414
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:38,720
you got<font color="#CCCCCC"> to find a public area right so</font>

415
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:41,480
your conference rooms your lobbies lot

416
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:43,400
of times will be public area<font color="#CCCCCC"> so now how</font>

417
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:45,050
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you prevent phones from being</font>

418
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:46,490
tampered with right how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you prevent</font>

419
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:48,200
people from unplugging the phone

420
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:53,059
plug in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the laptop and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

421
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:54,710
attack your voice network now you know

422
00:17:53,059 --> 00:17:56,770
we've seen it the<font color="#CCCCCC"> phones</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> being a lot</font>

423
00:17:54,710 --> 00:18:00,830
right so you got to get to<font color="#CCCCCC"> that physical</font>

424
00:17:56,770 --> 00:18:04,160
physical security right I'll lock the

425
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:06,439
phone so that way if anybody unplug<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

426
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:09,770
phone shark<font color="#CCCCCC"> like laptop or another</font>

427
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:11,840
device into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the network physically they</font>

these some<font color="#CCCCCC"> limitations with those so we</font>

435
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:35,390
recommend people looking at something

436
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:38,690
like Mac<font color="#CCCCCC"> sack is the fine and I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Triple E</font>

you do because of some data you have now

446
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:04,820
how do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know which phones to to</font>

that's how you know

476
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:24,700

477

infrastructure somebody's going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to log</font>

478
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:28,890
into it so it's going to be using a

password we were<font color="#E5E5E5"> lying on that steel so</font>

480
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:36,429
we see companies and not not enabling

those credentials policy by now

482
00:20:36,429 --> 00:20:40,210
everybody has the windows active

sure that they are your users have

strong using<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> password a lot of</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">companies will enforce that policy when</font>

488
00:20:49,419 --> 00:20:54,600
you go outside of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you go into</font>

489
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:57,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like a call manager and your</font>

00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:02,320
and listen to the conversations or

492
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:04,450
improvement of quality and other reasons

493
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:06,129
then you got<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure that when they</font>

security mode enabled on on the devices

500

and they can be<font color="#E5E5E5"> divided enabled devices</font>

501
00:21:25,059 --> 00:21:29,379
however<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of environments they're</font>

502
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:32,140
not there's encryption that is to be

503
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:33,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">applied right in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cikini in the security</font>

504
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:36,010
we try to encrypt information that's on

505
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:37,510
our ways to make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that somebody in</font>

506
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:39,490
the middle there's no authorized can

00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:42,879
read that data we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> see that that</font>

508
00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:44,980
that being done and then you know the

509
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:47,830
configuration information for the poems

510
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:50,650
I because that's that's an area between

511
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:51,730
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> phone and your infrastructure it's</font>

512
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:53,919
gotta be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> communicate and</font>

513
00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:55,840
authenticate and that's not not

514
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:57,490
enrollment process how do you know this

515
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:59,980
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> phone how do you know this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

infrastructure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that's not</font>

517
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:05,650
somebody's not spoofing that information

518
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:09,668
here's example of in fact munications

519
00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:13,480
manager being used and here is how<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

520
00:22:09,669 --> 00:22:14,500
configure your credential policy right

521
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:18,330
long time is

522
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:20,710
I'm just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how it is here now I</font>

523
00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:24,340
mentioned briefly about security mode

524
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:26,440
and it's it's pretty clear you can

525
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:28,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">enable a disabled here it does take</font>

526
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:30,280
quite a bit of overhead obviously you

527
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:32,379
want security you gotta be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

528
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:34,540
manage it it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a lot of times it's</font>

529
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:37,990
it's not just a switch<font color="#E5E5E5"> but a lot of</font>

530
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:40,389
defenders make it more easier it'd make

531
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:42,400
it easier for<font color="#CCCCCC"> people to actually enable</font>

532
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:47,440
those settings here's an example of that

533
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:48,970
where you can set it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to if you set it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

534
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,380
non-secure obviously you know what they

535
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:55,270
could<font color="#E5E5E5"> monitor that those capabilities</font>

536
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:57,840
and the setup of communications and the

537
00:22:55,270 --> 00:23:00,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">data itself he's not being protected and</font>

538
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:03,610
you can actually encrypt the tftp config

539
00:23:00,970 --> 00:23:05,500
files as well so somebody does intercept

540
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:08,379
it or somebody queries that file<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

541
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:12,400
can you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know make any sense out of the</font>

542
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:14,320
data because it is encrypted and you

543
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:16,930
know retrieving registration information

544
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:18,429
from the ftp servers will have some kind

545
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:20,050
of authentication<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm kind of way of</font>

546
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:22,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">knowing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that hey this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really the</font>

547
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:24,129
phone this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is really the information i</font>

548
00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:27,129
want to provide<font color="#CCCCCC"> to that phone and it's</font>

549
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:28,330
not somebody doing it in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the middle</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> now</font>

550
00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:29,860
there's you know additional

551
00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:32,610
functionality with the sensor unified

552
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:35,590
communications manager such as a

553
00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:37,719
certificate authority proxy function so

554
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:42,360
it's kind of a functionality work you're

555
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:46,050
able to you know send out those those

556
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:48,909
configuration files and certificates and

557
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:50,980
but a lot of times we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> have that will</font>

558
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:54,520
see that enable will see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> as part of</font>

559
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:57,670
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> as part of the implementation but</font>

560
00:23:54,520 --> 00:24:00,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">it will be by</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stream which means</font>

561
00:23:57,670 --> 00:24:04,900
that that that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> how you're you're not</font>

562
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:08,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">really encrypting data at all just like</font>

563
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:12,310
having you know SSL and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then using you</font>

564
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:15,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">know no no encryption and not actually</font>

565
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:16,389
taking advantage of that functionality

566
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:18,580
there and just using it for fornication

567
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:22,480
you can you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font>

568
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:24,428
have pls ssl without encryption but and

569
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:27,370
in this case we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this functionality</font>

570
00:24:24,429 --> 00:24:28,440
we have that proxy function and if the

571
00:24:27,370 --> 00:24:30,810
authentication is by

572
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:33,630
string so we do is send an<font color="#CCCCCC"> Allen and</font>

573
00:24:30,810 --> 00:24:37,200
your your indicated then you never<font color="#E5E5E5"> take</font>

574
00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:38,670
advantage<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that and the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> problem with</font>

575
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:41,100
this is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> because it doesn't require</font>

576
00:24:38,670 --> 00:24:43,790
using an erection then it can be abused

577
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:48,300
so we've seen it in<font color="#CCCCCC"> a while when when</font>

578
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:50,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can actually you know push out rogue</font>

579
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:54,240
provision provisioning files to the

580
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:57,270
phones and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually have them being</font>

581
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:59,340
able to reset their settings and have

582
00:24:57,270 --> 00:25:01,110
them talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to two different</font>

583
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:04,560
infrastructure and legitimate in the

584
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:06,179
structure so how do you enable this just

585
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:08,100
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know you can do check for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> trudel</font>

586
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:09,690
passwords right that's kind of their way

587
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:11,879
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> ensuring that the process is complex</font>

588
00:25:09,690 --> 00:25:13,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'll check</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> dictionary passwords and</font>

589
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:14,880
it will tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> you users how you can use</font>

590
00:25:13,290 --> 00:25:18,659
that password because it's too simple

591
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:21,330
and you also have your pins voicemail

592
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:23,310
pins you can increase<font color="#CCCCCC"> the length on</font>

593
00:25:21,330 --> 00:25:25,050
those to make it a little bit harder for

594
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:26,639
people to brute force it some kind of

595
00:25:25,050 --> 00:25:30,240
monitoring place<font color="#CCCCCC"> in somebody's before</font>

596
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:31,710
since you can address it that way it's

597
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:33,300
same thing that we have in the windows

598
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:35,940
infrastructure as well you know

599
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:38,250
somebody's trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> guess logins guess</font>

600
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:40,740
pins lock them out to slow down the

601
00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:42,870
process<font color="#E5E5E5"> investigate it nothing really</font>

602
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:44,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">new there and then you want to make it</font>

603
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:48,810
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that if somebody is locked out an</font>

00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:50,879
account looked out<font color="#E5E5E5"> a user and you want</font>

605

t-shirt on the on the manager a little

608
00:25:57,690 --> 00:26:03,330
bit more<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know you can enable that</font>

609
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:08,040
encryption security mode and that awful

610
00:26:03,330 --> 00:26:11,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">its uses you know TLS and obviously it's</font>

611
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:15,149
using for integrity authentication and

612
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:17,639
encryption and you know you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> use you</font>

613
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:20,520
know secure real-time protocol for

614
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:23,910
actually carrying that that phone call

615
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:26,040
media cross cross network<font color="#E5E5E5"> however it's</font>

616
00:26:23,910 --> 00:26:28,200
not all the phone support right once you

617
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:29,550
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> might have to upgrade to latest and</font>

618
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:31,620
greatest in order to take advantage of

619
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:33,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">that functionality because chances are</font>

620
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:35,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">had only been available since somebody</font>

621
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:39,020
pushed<font color="#CCCCCC"> vendor to be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> offer that</font>

622
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:40,440
functionality now as far<font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font>

623
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:41,700
configurations and sending

624
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:43,260
configurations back in

625
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:47,010
fourth and configuring device and that's

626
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:49,440
kind of like<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're you're kind of like</font>

627
00:26:47,010 --> 00:26:51,210
your group policy type functionality we

628
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:52,950
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to push out configuration it's kind</font>

629
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:56,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">of sensitive kind of important feature</font>

630
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:57,510
of the implementations so you know in a

631
00:26:56,039 --> 00:26:59,970
billion encryption on that so that

632
00:26:57,510 --> 00:27:01,980
somebody can just you know download<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

633
00:26:59,970 --> 00:27:04,649
preparation of files off you're off

634
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:07,860
you're ticked EP servers and and use it

635
00:27:04,649 --> 00:27:09,658
for legitimate purposes now the problems

636
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:14,219
will have come with locally significant

637
00:27:09,659 --> 00:27:16,860
security certificate that that that is

638
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:18,630
embedded there by the by the vendor

639
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:20,789
right so they'll come with a certificate

640
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:22,799
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it take advantage of that the</font>

641
00:27:20,789 --> 00:27:26,629
advantage of the fact that you can use

642
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:28,649
that you know functionality that type of

643
00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:30,779
functionality in order to ensure that

644
00:27:28,649 --> 00:27:32,699
somebody can't just add a certificate to

645
00:27:30,779 --> 00:27:36,120
their to the phone without your

646
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:38,340
knowledge and you can do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that by saying</font>

647
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:41,939
you know you can enable authentication

648
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:44,519
setting to be by existing certificate so

649
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:47,190
you saying a reciprocal ready existing

650
00:27:44,519 --> 00:27:51,000
then use that certificate to to

651
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:53,760
authenticate the palm now as far<font color="#CCCCCC"> as you</font>

652
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:57,529
know changing that certificate trust

653
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:59,879
list and updating that there's been some

654
00:27:57,529 --> 00:28:03,179
some research done and it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> presented</font>

655
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:06,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">at the black hat</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Europe or 12 on how</font>

656
00:28:03,179 --> 00:28:07,889
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> process can be abused so some of</font>

657
00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:09,570
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can come out of that is</font>

658
00:28:07,889 --> 00:28:10,769
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do in that initial provisioning</font>

659
00:28:09,570 --> 00:28:13,049
make<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure you do it in a secure</font>

660
00:28:10,769 --> 00:28:15,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">environment</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right it is there's a part</font>

661
00:28:13,049 --> 00:28:19,260
of your process that is impossible or

662
00:28:15,899 --> 00:28:21,899
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> difficult to secure then do it an</font>

663
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:24,929
environment where you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

664
00:28:21,899 --> 00:28:26,039
little opportunity for abuse<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so</font>

665
00:28:24,929 --> 00:28:28,230
make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that when you're provisioning</font>

666
00:28:26,039 --> 00:28:30,600
phones their internal network internal

667
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:33,480
environment something control and then

668
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:35,129
then you know that is trusted right that

669
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:37,279
somebody wasn't able to temper it at

670
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:39,809
that stage<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> less</font>

671
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:42,750
secure environment you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can rely on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

672
00:28:39,809 --> 00:28:47,010
more and that's kind of that the benefit

673
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:48,269
here okay now some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the phones some of</font>

674
00:28:47,010 --> 00:28:50,789
the models and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> latest and greatest</font>

675
00:28:48,269 --> 00:28:53,760
will come security by default so yeah

676
00:28:50,789 --> 00:28:55,470
the defenders identified the fact that

677
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:58,590
even<font color="#E5E5E5"> if y'all grafalk for security</font>

678
00:28:55,470 --> 00:29:02,039
and people don't enable it then you

679
00:28:58,590 --> 00:29:05,250
gotta put it in the out of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the box that</font>

680
00:29:02,039 --> 00:29:08,549
type approach that's what we see as well

681
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:13,700
to be able to modify that initial trust

682
00:29:08,549 --> 00:29:16,610
list<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's is definitely making it more</font>

683
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:21,600
more challenging for somebody to do that

684
00:29:16,610 --> 00:29:23,459
now as far as so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I talked</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

685
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:28,860
implementation self infrastructure

686
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:30,690
however the phones<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right because</font>

687
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:32,428
just like the client you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can have the</font>

688
00:29:30,690 --> 00:29:33,840
hardest infrastructure in the world and

689
00:29:32,429 --> 00:29:38,100
you can use as clicks on the links and

690
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:40,580
get compromised and then the data is at

691
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:43,260
risk<font color="#CCCCCC"> so same way with the phones right</font>

692
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:45,149
you have the settings access which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

693
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:47,190
what the poems obviously just with

694
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:50,070
anything your physical access then then

695
00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:51,870
that that overrides a lot of a lot of

696
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:53,789
our controls so the phones are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

697
00:29:51,870 --> 00:29:57,510
have a setting access where you can go

698
00:29:53,789 --> 00:30:00,690
in and you know it all over the settings

699
00:29:57,510 --> 00:30:02,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">and change them and that's one of the</font>

700
00:30:00,690 --> 00:30:03,720
areas<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll talk about how to secure</font>

701
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:06,000
that how do you how do you make it<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

702
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:07,590
that users can change your settings you

703
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,980
pushed out for your configuration

704
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:12,418
profile there's also a way and we see

705
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:14,370
companies doing that they only have one

706
00:30:12,419 --> 00:30:16,590
jack in the office<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they try to</font>

707
00:30:14,370 --> 00:30:19,770
utilize it for both voice and data so

708
00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:21,539
they'll have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a pc port on the phone</font>

709
00:30:19,770 --> 00:30:23,190
where you can actually connect to the

710
00:30:21,539 --> 00:30:28,919
phone the back of the phone you're going

711
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:30,630

environment will push out certain

742
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:53,250
security configurations on to our

743
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:57,060
servers on towel workstations same way

744
00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:59,130
here be able to push out and say hey

746
00:31:59,130 --> 00:32:06,030
my users to to change<font color="#E5E5E5"> the tftp server</font>

747
00:32:01,770 --> 00:32:07,650
they talk to and and there's a default

748
00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:09,270
default<font color="#CCCCCC"> password so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to make</font>

749
00:32:07,650 --> 00:32:13,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that you actually change that</font>

750
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:14,820
password on the on the pub now the

751
00:32:13,530 --> 00:32:17,639
phones will come with integrated

752
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:20,790
switching them right so what you want to

753
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:22,770
do is make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that anybody followed</font>

754
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:24,899
that that I is enabled you see for

755
00:32:22,770 --> 00:32:26,639
analysis Capone's enabled so you want to

756
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:28,590
disable it at<font color="#E5E5E5"> least in the public area</font>

757
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:31,830
at least do it in the lunch rooms and

758
00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:35,340
your folio lobby and conference rooms

759
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:37,560
and what you find is when the phone

760
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:39,750
first boots up it won't have the

761
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:41,010
configuration yet so you have that<font color="#E5E5E5"> small</font>

762
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:45,870
window of opportunity when you can

763
00:32:41,010 --> 00:32:47,370
actually you know we can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> take</font>

764
00:32:45,870 --> 00:32:49,620
advantage of the default insecure

765
00:32:47,370 --> 00:32:51,209
settings so make sure you aware of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

766
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:52,979
so evenly people shout configuration

767
00:32:51,210 --> 00:32:54,900
settings<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the phone while it boots up</font>

768
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:57,090
it doesn't have those security

769
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:59,880
configurations yet so there's that a

770
00:32:57,090 --> 00:33:02,250
small window<font color="#E5E5E5"> of attack when that voice</font>

771
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:06,720
VLAN is actually pc voice plan is

772
00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:10,230
enabled and so as<font color="#E5E5E5"> i mentioned that the</font>

773
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:11,370
settings come over k ftp and one of the

774
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:13,980
things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to prevent users</font>

775
00:33:11,370 --> 00:33:16,199
from doing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> overriding the gift EP</font>

777
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:20,940
they can't push

00:33:18,150 --> 00:33:23,580
settings to the phone that are there

779
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:25,440
changed by an attacker<font color="#E5E5E5"> burger boy so</font>

780
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:28,889
there's a setting within the phone that

781
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:31,170
says a now instead of using<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

legitimate ftp server use this new one

783
00:33:31,170 --> 00:33:36,080
and that trust trust this new one so we

784
00:33:34,290 --> 00:33:40,470
want to prevent that from happening and

785
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:41,669
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that rogue rogue / profiles and</font>

786
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:45,210
configurations can be pushed to the

797
00:34:11,699 --> 00:34:16,139
setting and allow to be it's unlocked

798
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:18,089
setting now and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can erase it</font>

799
00:34:16,139 --> 00:34:22,859
and then you can give<font color="#CCCCCC"> it your own your</font>

800
00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:29,970
own set<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so now let's do a quick</font>

801
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:35,220
demo so for a lot of this unfortunately

802
00:34:29,969 --> 00:34:39,600
need to have wired access but in here we

803
00:34:35,219 --> 00:34:44,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't so I just pre recorded a demo then</font>

804
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:50,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to play over here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I can get to</font>

805
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:55,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">my mouth like that cool</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> alright so just</font>

806
00:34:50,730 --> 00:34:59,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">a quick demo so in this demo I have have</font>

807
00:34:55,739 --> 00:35:00,689
a boy pump and pull these demonstration

808
00:34:59,550 --> 00:35:02,910
I'm going to use a cell phone as well

809
00:35:00,690 --> 00:35:04,650
you don't have to ever you know hardware

810
00:35:02,910 --> 00:35:06,750
phone to do what conversations you can

811
00:35:04,650 --> 00:35:10,470
it's a laptop you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can download a lot of</font>

812
00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:14,220
freeware VoIP our clients out there in

813
00:35:10,470 --> 00:35:17,220
this case I'm using X slide and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

814
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:19,500
using a VoIP service to to do you know

815
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:22,169
to establish that communication so and

816
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:26,040
for the tools nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> fancy right people</font>

817
00:35:22,170 --> 00:35:27,330
heard<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a Cain and Abel right your your</font>

818
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:28,960
has been around for a long time

819
00:35:27,330 --> 00:35:31,900
definitely

820
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:33,520
definitely a full-featured tool of our

821
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:35,609
functionality and we're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to use</font>

822
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:41,770
this demonstration for our poison and

823
00:35:35,609 --> 00:35:43,210
and carry this out so the so what you do

824
00:35:41,770 --> 00:35:47,250
first is obviously you need to identify

825
00:35:43,210 --> 00:35:50,710
the devices on your<font color="#CCCCCC"> on your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> network and</font>

826
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:54,940
identify what devices you want to

827
00:35:50,710 --> 00:35:56,290
intercept traffic problem right so this

828
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:57,849
<font color="#CCCCCC">is part of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my youtube videos</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so this is</font>

829
00:35:56,290 --> 00:36:04,599
where I'm talking I'll the new possible

830
00:35:57,849 --> 00:36:07,240
rivers part alright so now what you do

831
00:36:04,599 --> 00:36:11,440
enable sniffing and then you scan for

832
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:15,009
mac addresses on your PO co lam and here

833
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:19,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">i have a couple</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of devices that I have</font>

834
00:36:15,010 --> 00:36:21,460
my astra phone and that beer switch and

835
00:36:19,349 --> 00:36:23,530
now what you want to do is you want to

836
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:26,380
our poison communication between between

837
00:36:23,530 --> 00:36:29,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">those devices so here I go you select a</font>

838
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:32,260
switch and then you select the phone you

839
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:35,230
want to intercept communication from and

840
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:38,800
then you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just start that car Poisson</font>

841
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:41,890
process so very simple just you know

842
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:44,530
click click type a type tool and then

843
00:36:41,890 --> 00:36:47,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">you make a connect a phone call so here</font>

844
00:36:44,530 --> 00:36:49,810
I'm calling I'm calling the the phone

845
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:51,549
from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cell phone right I'm in a</font>

846
00:36:49,810 --> 00:36:56,080
second communication between them the

847
00:36:51,550 --> 00:36:58,359
switch and the phone itself and now this

848
00:36:56,080 --> 00:37:00,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">conversation goes on the call is</font>

849
00:36:58,359 --> 00:37:05,710
established you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that on top</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

850
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:09,509
here so in the behind the scenes it

851
00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:13,690
enables recorded conversation and and

852
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:16,119
that concession is happening as we as we

853
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:17,830
see and as far as<font color="#E5E5E5"> the users don't see</font>

854
00:37:16,119 --> 00:37:19,660
any difference<font color="#CCCCCC"> pryda conversation is</font>

855
00:37:17,830 --> 00:37:23,880
just fine and there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> no indication</font>

856
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:27,759
right and then you just go<font color="#CCCCCC"> on very white</font>

857
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:29,980
tab here on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the UM can enable and it</font>

858
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:32,770
tells you where the you know it's

859
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:35,070
recording right now and then gives you

860
00:37:32,770 --> 00:37:38,259
status there on the end and when it

861
00:37:35,070 --> 00:37:39,430
converted that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the codec then you just</font>

862
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:43,900
go ahead and

863
00:37:39,430 --> 00:37:50,040
and play it right and this you play it

864
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:53,770
over here so I have it example<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that</font>

865
00:37:50,040 --> 00:38:05,130
you know what it sounds like it's the

866
00:37:53,770 --> 00:38:09,430
file<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> help it that</font>

867
00:38:05,130 --> 00:38:11,530
you're able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to all right so this is a</font>

868
00:38:09,430 --> 00:38:15,430
conversation<font color="#E5E5E5"> between two individuals and</font>

869
00:38:11,530 --> 00:38:18,430
you can hear both of them talk in the

870
00:38:15,430 --> 00:38:21,250
recording and you can actually you know

871
00:38:18,430 --> 00:38:23,078
see the see the<font color="#E5E5E5"> information going go and</font>

872
00:38:21,250 --> 00:38:26,619
going back<font color="#CCCCCC"> and forth so nothing</font>

873
00:38:23,079 --> 00:38:29,290
complicated right nothing complex and in

874
00:38:26,619 --> 00:38:38,770
this case you're able to take advantage

875
00:38:29,290 --> 00:38:45,910
of that<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so in this in this case</font>

876
00:38:38,770 --> 00:38:47,890
what we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually cover now is how do</font>

877
00:38:45,910 --> 00:38:49,690
we how do we deal with this this

878
00:38:47,890 --> 00:38:53,140
concerns that we may have<font color="#E5E5E5"> right how do</font>

879
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:55,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">you address this and how do we make sure</font>

880
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:57,940
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> these risks are not exposing on</font>

881
00:38:55,119 --> 00:39:00,309
enterprise closing our environments

882
00:38:57,940 --> 00:39:03,910
first thing is to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> aware of the risks</font>

883
00:39:00,309 --> 00:39:07,240
know what has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been exposed know what is</font>

884
00:39:03,910 --> 00:39:10,118
that what is allowing the people to get

885
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:12,368
access<font color="#E5E5E5"> to that information right so and</font>

886
00:39:10,119 --> 00:39:14,559
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> make any assumptions about</font>

887
00:39:12,369 --> 00:39:17,200
security enforced by the vendors and

888
00:39:14,559 --> 00:39:20,650
prevent that that from from happening

889
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:23,348
and in case of the environment<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

890
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:24,819
we're describing here it's you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know for</font>

891
00:39:23,349 --> 00:39:26,770
cisco unified communications manager

892
00:39:24,819 --> 00:39:28,690
there are settings they're taking

893
00:39:26,770 --> 00:39:30,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">advantage of them make sure that you</font>

894
00:39:28,690 --> 00:39:31,690
understand what they do make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

895
00:39:30,430 --> 00:39:34,270
understand how<font color="#CCCCCC"> the impact your</font>

00:39:31,690 --> 00:39:38,109

897
00:39:34,270 --> 00:39:40,150
understand it from reston<font color="#E5E5E5"> quote and in</font>

898
00:39:38,109 --> 00:39:43,240
order to know how secure environment

899
00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:45,790
test it<font color="#E5E5E5"> I look under the hood all the</font>

900
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:49,180
times will find that that we just assume

901
00:39:45,790 --> 00:39:51,308
that it's secure and I tell tell a

902
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:52,740
customer unless you pay somebody unless

903
00:39:51,309 --> 00:39:55,200
somebody has

904
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:57,509
has a reason identify those issues you

905
00:39:55,200 --> 00:40:00,330
really wouldn't know right because

906
00:39:57,510 --> 00:40:02,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">security is is a quality factor al</font>

907
00:40:00,330 --> 00:40:08,369
anything right<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's a quality that</font>

908
00:40:02,810 --> 00:40:10,680
that is it's either side<font color="#CCCCCC"> of their</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or to</font>

909
00:40:08,369 --> 00:40:13,590
be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to achieve that quality you need</font>

910
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:15,540
to spend<font color="#E5E5E5"> resources prime time on it so</font>

911
00:40:13,590 --> 00:40:18,840
it definitely different requires

912
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:21,450
attention now as far as the slides

913
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:23,040
slides are on our website secure am calm

content buzz pc voice oh yeah you

922
00:40:56,340 --> 00:41:04,700
talking about the when you first boot up

923
00:40:59,910 --> 00:41:08,279
home so so<font color="#E5E5E5"> what happens is your your</font>

924
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:10,020
your phone is pretty much dumb device

925
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:12,359
right so it does<font color="#CCCCCC"> have conversations</font>

926
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:15,060
until they push to it so when you first

927
00:41:12,359 --> 00:41:17,819
plug in the phone it that while it boots

928
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:20,910
up it has default configurations which

929
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:26,280
by which will allow things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like you know</font>

930
00:41:20,910 --> 00:41:28,649
you pc pc VLAN still enable so well

931
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:31,710
while it's booting up it's already<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a</font>

932
00:41:28,650 --> 00:41:34,170
network and it can communicate but chasm

933
00:41:31,710 --> 00:41:35,910
hasn't received that configuration file

934
00:41:34,170 --> 00:41:37,770
yet so somebody's trying to hide them

935
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:40,290
their phones and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they boost very secure</font>

936
00:41:37,770 --> 00:41:41,670
configuration files to it if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

937
00:41:40,290 --> 00:41:44,130
able you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have physical access</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with the</font>

938
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:46,560
phone and you plug in to the back<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

939
00:41:44,130 --> 00:41:47,790
phone while<font color="#CCCCCC"> the phone is booting up and</font>

940
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:49,770
while the phone is waiting for that

941
00:41:47,790 --> 00:41:51,570
configuration file to come in you can

942
00:41:49,770 --> 00:41:54,210
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk to the phone is by default</font>

943
00:41:51,570 --> 00:41:56,310
that pc<font color="#E5E5E5"> glenn is enabled so that was</font>

944
00:41:54,210 --> 00:41:58,950
that's what i was<font color="#E5E5E5"> referring to even if</font>

945
00:41:56,310 --> 00:42:00,990
you know the administrators<font color="#E5E5E5"> say hey we</font>

946
00:41:58,950 --> 00:42:02,490
got configurations<font color="#E5E5E5"> all our phones make</font>

947
00:42:00,990 --> 00:42:05,129
them aware that somebody has physical

948
00:42:02,490 --> 00:42:06,160
access the phone they can<font color="#E5E5E5"> still take</font>

949
00:42:05,130 --> 00:42:08,500
advantage of the folk

950
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:10,359
operations before the secure

951
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:11,890
configuration pushed pushed<font color="#E5E5E5"> onto</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

952
00:42:10,359 --> 00:42:18,960
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> kinda what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> referring to</font>

953
00:42:11,890 --> 00:42:18,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">there hey any other questions go ahead</font>

954
00:42:20,549 --> 00:42:28,150
and so exact can enable is the tool for

955
00:42:24,990 --> 00:42:32,740
interception of traffic and it's you

956
00:42:28,150 --> 00:42:35,380
know as default you know decoding off of

957
00:42:32,740 --> 00:42:37,750
your data into playable format mp3<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

958
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:39,910
believe and so it came to Mabel is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

959
00:42:37,750 --> 00:42:43,329
tool you can use there's other and you

960
00:42:39,910 --> 00:42:48,160
know if either cap and other tools that

961
00:42:43,329 --> 00:42:51,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">can accomplish same thing yeah so so can</font>

962
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:53,410
enable do pretty much everything so so

963
00:42:51,099 --> 00:42:55,930
we did the art poisoning you did that

964
00:42:53,410 --> 00:42:58,170
decoding of conversation kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of all in</font>

965
00:42:55,930 --> 00:43:00,279
one you can also you know you can just

966
00:42:58,170 --> 00:43:02,440
accomplished our poisoning with another

967
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:05,049
tool and then you can just figure out

968
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:06,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do the coding and can use you</font>

969
00:43:05,049 --> 00:43:08,829
know Wireshark will do that for you as

970
00:43:06,490 --> 00:43:12,490
well or<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's able to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> decode you know</font>

971
00:43:08,829 --> 00:43:15,010
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> your stream into playable audio or</font>

972
00:43:12,490 --> 00:43:18,339
your file so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know you can use other</font>

973
00:43:15,010 --> 00:43:20,859
tools to do our<font color="#CCCCCC"> part poisoning and then</font>

974
00:43:18,339 --> 00:43:27,279
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just need to know that which more</font>

975
00:43:20,859 --> 00:43:30,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">targets any other questions</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay think</font>

976
00:43:27,279 --> 00:43:30,390
we're up on<font color="#E5E5E5"> time thank you</font>
