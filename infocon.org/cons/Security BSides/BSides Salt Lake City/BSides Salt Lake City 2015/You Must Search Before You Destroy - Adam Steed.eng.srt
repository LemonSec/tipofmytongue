24
00:01:05,509 --> 00:01:11,840
job postings for cissp and then I

25
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:16,339
divided that by the population of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

26

41
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:07,520
think about why in this market our

these public sources having having this

85
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:15,299
data I can<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> build org charts and</font>

86
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:17,190
so when I'm when I'm doing social

87
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:19,530
engineering I can go into the org chart

88
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:21,120
and say hey cuz I have the entire org

89
00:04:19,529 --> 00:04:22,469
chart up when I'm doing social

90
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,260
engineering pen test

91
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:27,060
and I say okay I know everyone in the

92
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:29,700
company and<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of times</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I have their</font>

93
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:35,010
phone numbers their email addresses so

94
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:37,409
it makes<font color="#CCCCCC"> pentesting so much easier itn</font>

95
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:39,240
staffing levels execution in the

96
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:42,870
boardroom I've been able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go into the</font>

97
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:46,290
boardroom and say hey all of<font color="#CCCCCC"> our</font>

98
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:49,230
competition they they have X number of

99
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:52,620
information security professionals /

100
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:54,810
thousands of employees why are we

101
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:58,080
staffed at one-tenth of staffing level

102
00:04:54,810 --> 00:05:00,600
as our competition using this

103
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:03,120
information has provided me an emission

104
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:05,730
to get more IT staffing<font color="#CCCCCC"> 44 by</font>

105
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:08,640
departments because ultimately I I can

106
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:10,590
say I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> secure not secure really all my</font>

107
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:16,140
all my management cares is that they're

108
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:20,510
cooler than our competition is so how

109
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:24,419
can a bad guy use this information<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

110
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:27,510
if I was a bad guy and I saw two

111
00:05:24,419 --> 00:05:30,090
separate companies and I saw<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this</font>

112
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:33,659
the put this company over here had a

113
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:36,200
hundred infosec employs and this in this

114
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:39,630
company company be over here had<font color="#E5E5E5"> ten</font>

115
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:43,650
infosec employees which would I choose

116
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:45,750
as a target so having this understanding

117
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:55,349
what helps with target acquisition as a

118
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:58,979
bad guy project just justifications are

119
00:05:55,350 --> 00:06:01,229
great to justify your projects knowing

120
00:05:58,979 --> 00:06:08,400
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> your competition is running helps</font>

121
00:06:01,229 --> 00:06:10,740
you justify your projects for example at

122
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:14,010
my last company I've been trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to push</font>

123
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:15,870
a citrix<font color="#CCCCCC"> vdi project through i wanted to</font>

124
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:19,560
remove all the data off of everyone's

125
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:22,190
laptops container eyes it and make it as

126
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:24,479
so it was a one-way container and

127
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:26,160
management kept pushing back at me

128
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:29,159
because it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> a large financial</font>

129
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:32,250
investment it was a lot lot of money and

130
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:35,270
so and for a year they told me no and

131
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:38,600
then I started I came<font color="#E5E5E5"> up with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this this</font>

132
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:41,150
method and that's when I went to

133
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:43,850
management says okay tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> me who you</font>

134
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:46,010
perceive<font color="#CCCCCC"> as our top 25 competitors I</font>

135
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:49,040
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know who you perceive</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as being</font>

136
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:51,380
competition then after that I took that

137
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:54,940
list of who they perceived as the

138
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:57,440
competition<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then I turned around and</font>

139
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:59,690
that's when I started doing doing my

140
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:02,510
analysis because they took those people

141
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:05,510
as serious then I went<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the board and</font>

142
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:09,409
says hey seventy-two percent of our

143
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:11,840
competition<font color="#CCCCCC"> is using</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> VDI to da another</font>

144
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:13,760
eleven percent have opened job

145
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:15,979
requisitions looking for vdi

146
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:17,870
professionals so that's eighty-three

147
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:19,820
percent of our competition<font color="#CCCCCC"> is using the</font>

148
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:22,010
EDI and also another one of the

149

that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have and your HR departments</font>

161
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:06,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">go into how we're going to find this so</font>

162
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:08,380
let's start with linkedin profiles so

163
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:11,750
first we need to have a discussion

164
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:13,969
around being able to do meaningful

165
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:17,540
search on linkedin without paying a lot

166
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:19,760
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> money</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you need to have lots of</font>

167
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:22,640
connections originally when linked out

168
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:24,560
linkedin came out it was like<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm only</font>

169
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:27,289
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to connect with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I know</font>

170
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:29,870
and just keep this close-knit little

171
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:32,270
community well if you want to do this if

172
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:35,030
you want meaningful searches you need

173
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:38,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">lots of connections so you can see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

174
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:42,949
i currently have 26 hundred connections

175
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:45,080
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can see their friends and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i can</font>

176
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:48,380
see their friends of friends<font color="#E5E5E5"> so in</font>

177
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:49,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">reality i have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> access to 29 million</font>

178
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:51,620
linkedin

179
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:54,290
files right now so the question you're

180
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:58,420
asking so if how do I build my linkedin

181
00:08:54,290 --> 00:09:03,740
network so i can spy on my competition

182
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:06,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">lions lions is the key here oftentimes</font>

183
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:08,660
what you'll see is you'll see someone

184
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:12,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">with their profile and it will say lion</font>

185
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:14,629
what lion means is if you send me<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

186
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:17,290
request i'm just going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say yes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

187
00:09:14,629 --> 00:09:20,569
accept I don't care if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know you or not</font>

188
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:25,040
so it means linkedin open network<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

189
00:09:20,569 --> 00:09:27,229
open to open suggestions for<font color="#E5E5E5"> requests so</font>

190
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:30,860
that's what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can actually do is when</font>

191
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:33,639
you do a search search for lions and so

192
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:36,920
and then just<font color="#E5E5E5"> start sending them</font>

193
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:42,199
linkedin request also<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's mailing</font>

194
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:48,349

195
00:09:42,199 --> 00:09:53,569

198
00:09:56,089 --> 00:10:01,399

199
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:04,279
into connections say any email and then

200
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:06,350

201
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:09,730

202
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:12,589
bulk lists that contain thousands of

203
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:14,959
email addresses that you can connect

204
00:10:12,589 --> 00:10:18,769

205
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:20,119
connections really quick like I said

206
00:10:18,769 --> 00:10:22,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">before if you don't have all these</font>

207
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:25,790
connections you're gonna have to you're

208
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:29,809
gonna have to pay<font color="#E5E5E5"> for it even even if</font>

209
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:33,860
you don't pay for<font color="#CCCCCC"> it they do have hey</font>

210
00:10:29,809 --> 00:10:35,629
walls so you're only allowed as a free

211
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:38,720
subscriber I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about a hundred</font>

212
00:10:35,629 --> 00:10:40,459
searches per month<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it resets at the</font>

213
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:42,470
first of every month so if you do too

214
00:10:40,459 --> 00:10:46,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">many too many searches you're going to</font>

215
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:48,110
be locked out for a month just be aware

216
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:52,939
that that exists when I was doing my

217
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:55,279
research I'm like oh dang<font color="#CCCCCC"> it p wall so</font>

218
00:10:52,939 --> 00:10:56,899
what when<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> targeting accompany the</font>

219
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:59,809
first thing I do is I<font color="#E5E5E5"> I look up the</font>

220
00:10:56,899 --> 00:11:01,970
company and in LinkedIn and what I'm

221
00:10:59,809 --> 00:11:03,160
looking for it first is their company

222
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:05,440
size what LinkedIn

223
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:08,730
thinks their company sizes then the next

224
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:12,459
thing I look for is how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> had</font>

225
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:17,800
connections do I have into that company

226
00:11:12,459 --> 00:11:19,989
so I can see that there's 363 361

227
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:23,829
employees in LinkedIn which is right in

228
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:26,350
that 500,000 target size and I have

229
00:11:23,829 --> 00:11:30,508
direct connections to half that people

230
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:36,939
so I have really pretty decent coverage

231
00:11:30,509 --> 00:11:39,610
inside that company once you've once now

232
00:11:36,939 --> 00:11:41,379
you start doing searches for all the

233
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:44,050
employees in that company you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

234
00:11:41,379 --> 00:11:47,019
say show me when you search for the

235
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:48,839
company there's a little link on the

236
00:11:47,019 --> 00:11:51,310
site that<font color="#E5E5E5"> says show me how I'm connected</font>

237
00:11:48,839 --> 00:11:52,839
this is how you start building<font color="#CCCCCC"> your org</font>

238
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:57,489
charts it's very important to build your

239
00:11:52,839 --> 00:11:59,139
org<font color="#CCCCCC"> chart and you can even a lot of</font>

240
00:11:57,490 --> 00:12:05,850
times you have pictures put your org

241
00:11:59,139 --> 00:12:08,880
charts they're really pretty so start

242
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:11,470
targeting down the infosec departments

243
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:14,290
for these these companies that you're

244
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:17,589

257
00:12:54,699 --> 00:13:05,319
running building budgets is also helpful

258
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:06,939
when you're justifying the the size of

259

262
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:15,959
pretty easy to estimate someone's IT

263
00:13:14,589 --> 00:13:18,970
spinning

264
00:13:15,959 --> 00:13:23,439

production environment looks like one of

360
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:29,350
the trouble things that I didn't find

361
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:31,120
that I wish I would have found was a

362
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:34,240
free site that allowed<font color="#CCCCCC"> me to do</font>

363
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:37,689
historical searches on companies job

364
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:39,730
postings I found<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> website that does</font>

365
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:43,090
it but charges tens of thousands<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

366
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:44,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">dollars to basically say show me show me</font>

367
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:49,870
every posting that this company has ever

368
00:18:44,769 --> 00:18:52,659
made for a sysadmin if you guys know the

369
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:55,149
site that there's a warm hug it in

370
00:18:52,659 --> 00:18:57,970
exchange for<font color="#CCCCCC"> that information another</font>

371
00:18:55,149 --> 00:19:01,090
awesome place to find disclosures that

372
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:03,970
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> shouldn't be posting press releases</font>

373
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:07,029
this this this example here comes from

374
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:09,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">VMware so VMware did a case study of</font>

375
00:19:07,029 --> 00:19:12,639
cornerstone lending it's a mortgage

376
00:19:09,549 --> 00:19:15,629
company and so in the case case study

377
00:19:12,639 --> 00:19:21,428
they says okay our VMware environment

378
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:24,159
consists of HP BL blades with this much

379
00:19:21,429 --> 00:19:26,919
memory so if I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to do an</font>

380
00:19:24,159 --> 00:19:28,659
estimate estimation of how much of a

00:19:26,919 --> 00:19:31,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">denial of service attack how much</font>

382
00:19:28,659 --> 00:19:33,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">hardware I'm going to need to flood out</font>

383
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,980
there there there VMware environment

384
00:19:33,549 --> 00:19:38,230
that pretty much tells me exactly what I

385
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:43,090
need I know exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> what kind of storage</font>

386
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:45,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">they have and they published it right in</font>

387
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:47,530
their white paper when they did<font color="#CCCCCC"> the case</font>

388
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:49,540
study and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then also</font>

389
00:19:47,530 --> 00:19:51,610
here's another<font color="#E5E5E5"> great one they had a</font>

390
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:54,899
video they had a video<font color="#E5E5E5"> of their case</font>

391
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:59,679
study and they see they show these guys

392
00:19:54,900 --> 00:20:00,850
in their data center<font color="#CCCCCC"> and Allison so I</font>

393
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:02,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't even care what these guys look</font>

394
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:05,620
like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're wearing those little</font>

395
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:08,170
hot sexy man blue<font color="#CCCCCC"> shirt what I do care</font>

396
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:10,120
about is what they're standing in front

397
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:14,680
of so on the left one there you can see

398
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:17,679
a VNX<font color="#E5E5E5"> I see two big-ip controllers I can</font>

399
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:19,030
see specifically<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can see exactly what</font>

400
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:20,560
technologies are running in their data

401
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:24,070
center because they took<font color="#E5E5E5"> a picture and</font>

402
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:26,679
posted it online I was floored to see

403
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:28,450
the number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of data center photos that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

404
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:31,420
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to find from companies online</font>

408
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:39,909
I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a big deal but</font>

409
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:42,700
others I think others in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this audience</font>

410
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:46,330
or the lights coming on going<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe this</font>

411
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:49,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">is a bad idea you know other thing in</font>

412
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:52,030
this this posting they took a screenshot

413
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:54,940
in the video of their public of their

414
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:57,010

00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:08,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">release so these are not the kind of</font>

418
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:10,389
things that I'm looking for so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can</font>

419
00:21:08,290 --> 00:21:12,399
quickly do an analysis of a company in

420
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:15,070
an hour or two so the question you can

421
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:18,010
you can ask yourself is this worth doing

422
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:21,100
once or<font color="#CCCCCC"> twice a year spending a couple</font>

423

hours once or twice a year and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and as an</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">just going through and just searching</font>

429
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:40,209
to tell sis admins that they may need to

430
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:43,990
take certain information off their their

431
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:46,840

that I got from my legal department when

433
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:53,230
I did have a job was the combination

434
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:57,340
while running a particular technology

435
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:59,240
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> Cisco is not proper wouldn't say</font>

it the combination itself could be

441
00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:17,450
alluded as proprietary information in of

442
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:20,239
itself so the people the legal<font color="#E5E5E5"> people I</font>

443
00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:21,770
talked to said yes because in most

444
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:23,809
employee agreements it says that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

cannot disclose proprietary company

446
00:22:23,809 --> 00:22:32,000
information but check with your legal

447
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:34,700
departments so first off should we we

448
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:37,220
talked about if we should you should we

449
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:39,140
monitor this<font color="#E5E5E5"> should we watch for this so</font>

450
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:47,150
how do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> stop</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it how do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we stop this</font>

451

disclosure of information having company

452
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:54,950
policies in place I second don't use

453
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:58,340
vendor specific job titles instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

454
00:22:54,950 --> 00:23:01,970
instead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying Citrix admin or</font>

455
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:05,419
vcenter admin just<font color="#CCCCCC"> call it us this</font>

456
00:23:01,970 --> 00:23:07,910
engineer or it's just admin so work<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

457
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:11,120
your HR departments into making your job

458
00:23:07,910 --> 00:23:13,929
titles more generic and not specific

459
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:19,629
towards up take a particular technology

460
00:23:13,929 --> 00:23:23,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">I I did some scouting in that list of</font>

461
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:24,740
companies that<font color="#E5E5E5"> my organization took as</font>

462
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:28,540
being serious<font color="#E5E5E5"> competition i found one</font>

463
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:31,250
particular organization that they had

464
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:34,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">posts that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you could tell they had gone</font>

465
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:36,200
through and sanitized because when<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

466
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:39,559
searched that company all their IT guys

467
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:42,380
all it said was this admin no

468
00:23:39,559 --> 00:23:44,960
description note of what they<font color="#CCCCCC"> had while</font>

469
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:47,270
they worked there and when<font color="#CCCCCC"> i looked at</font>

470
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:49,370
their job postings they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> very vague</font>

471
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:52,070
and so what they had done is they were

472
00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:55,070
leveraging their HR is systems and their

473
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:58,550
HR department because now when they when

474
00:23:55,070 --> 00:24:01,250
they post a vague job posting it takes a

475
00:23:58,550 --> 00:24:02,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">lot more HR resources to filter that</font>

476
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:05,720
down to what they're actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking</font>

477
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:09,700
for so they relied heavily on their HR I

478
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:12,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">asked system to filter out job</font>

479
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:13,100
submissions people that have made job

480
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:14,900
