so to begin<font color="#E5E5E5"> things off this is actually</font>

2
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:20,090
first for me<font color="#E5E5E5"> I actually have my boss and</font>

4
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:27,539
heckle all day long so just kind of some

5
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:29,640
of the things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> Dan already said you</font>

6
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:32,250
know a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me as meta</font>

7
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:34,920
cortex others know me as Danny call me

8
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:38,040
either or don't care i'm a senior

9
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:41,129
security consultant at secure ideas i'm

10
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:42,510
also an 801 labs founder and a board

11
00:00:41,129 --> 00:00:44,940
member<font color="#CCCCCC"> i could spell that correctly</font>

12
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:49,680
apparently<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think it ran into the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> image</font>

13
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:52,410
oops 0801 labs is the local hacker space

14
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:54,989
out here in Salt Lake City DC 80 on the

15
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:57,538
local<font color="#CCCCCC"> DEFCON group I helped do a lot of</font>

16
00:00:54,989 --> 00:01:02,489
stuff with them and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is my third</font>

17
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:08,340
time speaking at beside salt lake now to

18
00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:10,140
kick it off as a quick survey who in

19
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:14,670
this room has ever thought about or

20
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:18,659
currently wants to be a pen tester a lot

21
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:26,189
<font color="#CCCCCC">of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people why it open for discussion</font>

22
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:30,950
yells stuff out it is sexy get to break

23
00:01:26,189 --> 00:01:38,119
into things fantastic job security yes

24
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:51,000
pays decent amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of money reports</font>

25
00:01:38,119 --> 00:01:53,189
they're my favorite that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> true so</font>

26
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,960
just some of the answers that I've heard

27
00:01:53,189 --> 00:01:57,719
from other people and it looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> like you</font>

28
00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:00,809
guys answered most of them you know it's

29
00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:03,419
fun sexy you get paid to own companies

30
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:08,009
or some kind of your mom joke which I'm

31
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:08,410
disappointed in all of you but I can

32
00:02:08,008 --> 00:02:13,480
relate

33
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:18,670
because for years I set my goal as my

34
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:21,519
<font color="#CCCCCC">career to start pentesting 89 years ago</font>

35
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:22,989
and I'm only just getting to this point

36
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:26,590
where<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm being able to do it</font>

37
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:30,040
professionally most of my experience

38
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:32,590
before getting this job was tons of<font color="#CCCCCC"> VMs</font>

39
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:34,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">I would load up VMs for everything I</font>

40
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:36,490
could I didn't care if they were

41
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">backdoored iso's that i downloaded off</font>

42
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:43,270
some shady trekker I was going to own

43
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:46,450
them myself tons of<font color="#CCCCCC"> metasploit materials</font>

44
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:49,600
I anything that would said<font color="#E5E5E5"> metasploit on</font>

45
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:51,609
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was reading or watching tons of</font>

46
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:55,840
mailing lists the security focus stuff

47
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:58,420
sometimes makes a lot of noise various

48
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:01,660
different podcast mailing lists<font color="#E5E5E5"> Twitter</font>

49
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:03,730
monitor Twitter a lot it's very<font color="#CCCCCC"> active</font>

50
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:07,690
medium in our community and our industry

51
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:10,690
I would<font color="#CCCCCC"> hop into every CTF I possibly</font>

52
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:14,829
could I would compete to the best of my

53
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:18,520
ability and you know take a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> away at</font>

54
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:20,740
the end<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it and you know most</font>

55
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:24,370
importantly I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> listen to everybody</font>

56
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:25,930
else everybody else's experiences you

57
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:29,830
know penetrating networks getting paid

58
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:31,360
to do it everything I would I didn't

59
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:34,930
care how boring it was I was going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

60
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:36,760
listen to the story but while I was

61
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:38,739
doing all that most of my time was spent

62
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:41,950
in the blue team side of things doing

63
00:03:38,739 --> 00:03:44,980
network engineering firewall deployments

64
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:50,140
firewall configurations support for

65
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:51,340
those firewalls so yeah so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can</font>

66
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:53,230
understand where a lot of people<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

67
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:57,010
coming<font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and wanting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to get into this</font>

68
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:59,140
field but real quick<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go over kind</font>

69
00:03:57,010 --> 00:04:02,950
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> I through this together real quick</font>

70
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:06,059
but it's my idea of security testing and

71
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:08,260
different levels of testing in those

72
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:12,610
everything in my experience has been

73
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:15,269
building upon the lower levels so you

74
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:18,120
get good audits going if you're fairly

75
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:21,430
in mature

76
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:24,220
program for as far as<font color="#CCCCCC"> security goes you</font>

77
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:26,169
start auditing a lot of stuff and start

78
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:28,199
fixing it depending on what the<font color="#E5E5E5"> audit</font>

79
00:04:26,169 --> 00:04:31,090
says and from<font color="#E5E5E5"> there you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can move into</font>

80
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:35,770
vulnerability scanning things like

81
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:38,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">Nessus open Baz tons tons of</font>

82
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:39,880
vulnerability scanners out there they'll

83
00:04:38,169 --> 00:04:43,830
go<font color="#CCCCCC"> out scan the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> whole network tell you</font>

84
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:46,210
what's there what's not and and let you

85
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:50,229
you know look at what are some of the

86
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:52,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">higher severity things and fix</font>

87
00:04:50,229 --> 00:04:54,880
accordingly to try and just build the

88
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,770
security in your company from there on

89
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:59,530
top we have penetration testing and red

90
00:04:56,770 --> 00:05:01,419
team which<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't know why I'm going</font>

91
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:07,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">through all of that I do have slides for</font>

92
00:05:01,419 --> 00:05:09,909
those so it's going security audit 819 a

93
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:13,930
lot of checkboxes a lot of compliance

94
00:05:09,909 --> 00:05:15,909
<font color="#CCCCCC">PCI yeah that's the big one you get to</font>

95
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:18,430
you know just evaluate tons of systems

96
00:05:15,909 --> 00:05:21,909
and configurations you just look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

97
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:25,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">and try and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> identify issues with them</font>

98
00:05:21,909 --> 00:05:29,740
and keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> going like I said vulnerability</font>

99
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:31,780
scanning it is mainly automated you can

100
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:34,270
put scanners in various different points

101
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:37,119
of the network to you know catch certain

102
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:39,490
things and a lot of time as you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> put</font>

103
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:41,740
in credentials into those systems so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

104
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:45,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">log in tell you vulnerable software</font>

105
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:47,530
versions all that third like I<font color="#E5E5E5"> said</font>

106
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:51,070
there's a ton of vulnerability scanners

107
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:53,349
there's a good list there and then what

108
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:55,690
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> get into is penetration testing which</font>

109
00:05:53,349 --> 00:06:00,159
is I mean the focus of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this talk which</font>

110
00:05:55,690 --> 00:06:02,469
is basically you let people come in find

111
00:06:00,159 --> 00:06:05,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">those vulnerabilities exploit them to</font>

112
00:06:02,469 --> 00:06:10,840
see what they can gain access to as<font color="#E5E5E5"> far</font>

113
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:13,020
as critical business systems and how<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

114
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:15,369
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> at you can leverage want to exploit</font>

115
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:18,190
move it over to another vulnerability

116
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:19,630
and keep moving through<font color="#CCCCCC"> the network to</font>

117
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:25,060
find the most<font color="#CCCCCC"> critical things in the</font>

118
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:29,169
business the thing that penetration

119
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:32,040
tests are limited on is generally scope

120
00:06:29,169 --> 00:06:36,159
and length of the engagement

121
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:38,590
which gives me<font color="#E5E5E5"> into red team which I see</font>

122
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:41,530
more as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> pen penetration test with less</font>

123
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:48,150
scope and less time constraints it's

124
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:48,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">really all it is for the most part so</font>

125
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:54,430
sorry we want to you know start

126
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:57,699
penetration testing eat tons of awesome

127
00:06:54,430 --> 00:07:03,940
tools everywhere you know metasploit can

128
00:06:57,699 --> 00:07:06,479
enable anything in cali you tons of all

129
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:09,969
these sexy exploits that you can run and

130
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:12,669
do a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cool stuff in so</font>

131
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:16,150
great you can grab all your stuff all

132
00:07:12,669 --> 00:07:22,780
your tools get them already and<font color="#E5E5E5"> just let</font>

133
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:28,690
loose you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> I had to put a pony in</font>

134
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:33,280
here somewhere there it is so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> hone</font>

135
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:36,520
all the things great<font color="#CCCCCC"> fantastic but hold</font>

136
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:40,989
on a minute because<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not all like</font>

137
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:45,090
that so let's dispel some myths real

138
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:47,320
quick I made this slide it may make

139
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:54,729
Kevin in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> back scream a little bit</font>

140
00:07:47,320 --> 00:08:00,520
but it's funny nonetheless sec to read

141
00:07:54,729 --> 00:08:04,270
over<font color="#CCCCCC"> it so in a penetration test like I</font>

142
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:06,639
said we are limited on scope and time

143
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:09,760
that we're able to actually run this

144
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:12,960
assessment most of the times we're

145
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:16,840
limited to five days business hours and

146
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:19,599
we have to cover a lot of ground in that

147
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:22,929
five days sometimes I've seen networks

152
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:38,169
love it you basically set up a scan tell

153
00:08:36,219 --> 00:08:42,789
it to not do anything crazy that might

154
00:08:38,169 --> 00:08:44,270
knock over devices say go then map the

155
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:45,770
entire network<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

156
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:48,610
list of vulnerabilities it was able to

157
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:51,319
find<font color="#E5E5E5"> it helps a lot it's really noisy</font>

158
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:54,620
we're not running in trying to be a

159
00:08:51,320 --> 00:09:00,470
ninja<font color="#CCCCCC"> right off the bat just because of</font>

160
00:08:54,620 --> 00:09:04,850
that time constraint so you know a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font>

161
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:07,490
of people I've heard have have said a

162
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:09,020
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of negative</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things about pen testers</font>

163
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:12,950
going in and run vulnerability scans

164
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:17,510
which i think is unfair just because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

165
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:21,020
that time constraint but so we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

166
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:23,960
into some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the tools that I use the</font>

167
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:27,079
most you know as you'll see up here it's

168
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:29,360
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> metasploit I've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> used it I've</font>

169

those lot of burp for web app stuff

173
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:44,569
that's de facto burp is amazing if

174
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:47,540
you're looking at web apps and honestly

175
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:49,810
sometimes I've spent a couple hours just

176
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:51,920
browsing around open network shares

177
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:57,020
because there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of good</font>

178
00:09:51,920 --> 00:10:01,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">information in those</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I have seen several</font>

179
00:09:57,020 --> 00:10:03,470
times that passwords are stored in<font color="#CCCCCC"> text</font>

180
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:07,040
files on an open share that anyone with

181
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:10,340
domain credentials can get to as well as

182
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:13,910
personal identifiable information such

00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:15,860
as identity<font color="#E5E5E5"> cards for Canada and a lot</font>

184
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:21,199
of scary<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff that wouldn't want</font>

185
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:22,790
everybody to have so another

00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:25,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">misconception that I've heard I've heard</font>

187
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:27,890
a lot of stories people like fired up

188
00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:30,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">metasploit set my our hosts</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this whole</font>

189
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:34,130
gigantic subnet range typed and

190
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:36,440
explaining go and all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a sudden I'm</font>

191
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:40,490
getting back tons of shelves I'm owning

192
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:45,350
the network every way possible<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

193
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:51,550
doesn't happen a whole lot it<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

194
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:55,340
doesn't honestly it took me several

195
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:58,060
engagements to find something vulnerable

196
00:10:55,340 --> 00:11:01,190
enough<font color="#CCCCCC"> to actually get a shell</font>

197
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:04,189
why because a lot of our customers are

198
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:06,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">really good at security they hire us and</font>

199
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:14,180
they know a lot what they're doing to

200
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:17,510
begin with<font color="#CCCCCC"> so but I don't want to put</font>

201
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:21,699
<font color="#CCCCCC">you off no don't want to say it's boring</font>

202
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:25,760
or anything there are times that I feel

203
00:11:21,699 --> 00:11:31,069
you feel like Luigi and to get this

204
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:35,899
reference go back and play mario party 2

205
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:38,600
for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Nintendo 64 if you're playing</font>

206
00:11:35,899 --> 00:11:41,930
single player and you put all four other

207
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:44,540
characters on easy mode you can set the

208
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:47,239
controller down<font color="#E5E5E5"> and walk away</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you will</font>

209
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:50,750
win every single mini game that game

210
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:53,180
will throw at you and if i<font color="#CCCCCC"> can find</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

211
00:11:50,750 --> 00:12:13,459
mouse on here<font color="#E5E5E5"> i will show some proof of</font>

212
00:11:53,180 --> 00:12:15,469
that there's this long there are a lot

213
00:12:13,459 --> 00:12:20,079
of videos<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to skip ahead to</font>

214
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:20,079
another thing this is the other good<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

215
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:40,399
you know I feel like Luigi when I find

216
00:12:36,279 --> 00:12:43,370
Microsoft sequel running as system

217
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:48,890
administrator with the password<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

218
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:54,290
nothing or the one on the exact net IP

219
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:57,319
next to it sa password password it makes

220
00:12:54,290 --> 00:13:00,410
it really easy<font color="#CCCCCC"> you just have to show up</font>

221
00:12:57,319 --> 00:13:05,479
and you basically owned a network that

222
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:09,140
doesn't happen very often though so

223
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:11,160
let's go<font color="#CCCCCC"> into real quick some things</font>

224
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:15,449
that I

225
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:21,540
do not like<font color="#CCCCCC"> about pen testing my boss's</font>

226
00:13:15,449 --> 00:13:23,969
boss is one of them fully external

227
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:27,899
penetration tests with no social

228
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:30,300
engineering they will you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know that's</font>

229
00:13:27,899 --> 00:13:31,980
classic example of destroying a scope

230
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:36,449
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> it won't let</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you do a whole lot</font>

231
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:39,930
because you know firewalls work what do

232
00:13:36,449 --> 00:13:44,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">you what do you want which leads them to</font>

233
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:46,199
my other one scope scope will kill you

234
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:48,990
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> limit you to what you can do there</font>

235
00:13:46,199 --> 00:13:51,870
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been a couple times I've seen you</font>

236
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:55,439
know hey<font color="#E5E5E5"> this system over here is</font>

237
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:56,939
vulnerable just basically using using

238
00:13:55,439 --> 00:13:59,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">the application lets a web application</font>

239
00:13:56,939 --> 00:14:02,759
and it's relying on another component

240
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:05,699
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can tell</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> us</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> vulnerable but it</font>

241
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:09,300
it's not part of scope I can't touch

242
00:14:05,699 --> 00:14:11,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">that system actively or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do anything</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

243
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:15,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">that so that's going to hinder the test</font>

244
00:14:11,699 --> 00:14:17,459
a little bit which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is fine if that's</font>

245
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:19,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">what the customer is looking for or</font>

246
00:14:17,459 --> 00:14:24,239
they're looking to test one specific

247
00:14:19,319 --> 00:14:26,459
application that's fine<font color="#E5E5E5"> but you'd stay</font>

248
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:30,240
can't go unmentioned you so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I like to</font>

249
00:14:26,459 --> 00:14:32,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">mention that to them and how we</font>

250
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:34,850
mentioned it to them is the next part

251
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:42,139
that I don't like about pen testing

252
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:45,720
which is the reporting reporting Sox

253
00:14:42,139 --> 00:14:47,759
there have been times where my boss and

254
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:53,220
my<font color="#E5E5E5"> boss's boss in the back have asked me</font>

255
00:14:47,759 --> 00:15:00,540
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> bang out a 45-page report in two or</font>

256
00:14:53,220 --> 00:15:04,319
three<font color="#CCCCCC"> days it sucks it's not a lot of</font>

257
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:08,519
<font color="#CCCCCC">fun it ends up with me sitting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in my</font>

258
00:15:04,319 --> 00:15:12,569
apartment for 8-10 hours compiling<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

259
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:14,730
bunch of content or document and that's

260
00:15:12,569 --> 00:15:23,459
my day and that sometimes tends to be my

261
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:24,960
night not fantastic but there I mean all

262
00:15:23,459 --> 00:15:26,579
the negatives

263
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:30,090
are offset by the things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I love</font>

264
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:32,810
about it it's fantastic<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do things</font>

265
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:40,740
that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> wouldn't legally be able to do</font>

266
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:43,920
how fun is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> woohoo you know I don't</font>

267
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:57,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to go to jail I wouldn't fare very</font>

268
00:15:43,920 --> 00:16:01,920
well I am I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a fighter I will not</font>

269
00:15:57,150 --> 00:16:04,319
dignify your response to that I love

270
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:06,449
getting passwords for admins who are

271
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:10,200
logged into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the systems like it's</font>

272
00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:11,820
incredible I've seen passwords that you

273
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:13,590
probably shouldn't be using his

274
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:17,550
passwords in your corporate environment

275
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:19,860
and I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> had to ping a co-worker</font>

276
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:22,020
before and be like they asked us to

277
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:27,450
publish all the passwords we found that

278
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:29,340
might get him fired what do<font color="#CCCCCC"> we do so we</font>

279
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:33,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">ended up you know redacting most of it</font>

280
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:35,940
just you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be nice guys but I know</font>

281
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:40,490
that admin saw that report and I know he

282
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:47,610
knows that we saw that password which

283
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:50,010
just makes me smile um another thing I

284
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:53,040
like I've got painted company's phone

285
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:55,500
systems because they were recording

286
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:58,469
every call and out of every phone and

287
00:16:55,500 --> 00:17:03,180
storing<font color="#E5E5E5"> it in a central server for the</font>

288
00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:05,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">past six years that's fun being able to</font>

289
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:07,619
listen to conference calls about

290
00:17:05,869 --> 00:17:09,719
promotions that they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give</font>

291
00:17:07,619 --> 00:17:16,139
out to their customers coming up here

292
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:18,390
pretty soon handy things to know gaining

293
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:24,990
access to personal identifiable

294
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:28,470
information that's always<font color="#CCCCCC"> fun again when</font>

295
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:30,450
he<font color="#E5E5E5"> said passwords on clear text or clear</font>

296
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:34,590
text passwords stored on open shares

297
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:37,530
that's one of my favorites but most

298
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:38,770
importantly the the best thing that I

299
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:41,290
really love about

300
00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:46,450
this job and everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm able to do</font>

301
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:48,700
is be the<font color="#CCCCCC"> baseball bat companies hire us</font>

302
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:51,550
sometimes knowing they're vulnerable to

303
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:54,970
a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of things and they want the report</font>

304
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:58,480
to prove it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to upper management we get</font>

305
00:17:54,970 --> 00:18:01,030
to come in<font color="#E5E5E5"> and and be that weapon for</font>

306
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:04,090
change in<font color="#E5E5E5"> that company it's an</font>

307
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:06,190
incredible feeling to hear the guys say

308
00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:08,770
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is going to give me so much an</font>

309
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:11,860
ammunition to get everything changed in

310
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:16,720
our environment can't get much<font color="#CCCCCC"> better</font>

311
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:18,850
than that because you are the catalyst

312
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:23,230
for that change to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> people more</font>

313
00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:26,469
secure so I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's pretty much the</font>

314
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:32,890
biggest takeaway that I had from this

315
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:34,810
job what about you guys everybody that

316
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:38,470
wants to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get into this industry wants to</font>

317
00:18:34,810 --> 00:18:42,310
start doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> this professionally you have</font>

318
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:44,950
to commit to it I mean I was hanging

319
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:48,030
around<font color="#CCCCCC"> the industry for monitoring</font>

320
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:50,680
participating for eight nine years<font color="#CCCCCC"> now</font>

321
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:53,620
before I even felt I was ready to do

322
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:57,580
this it's a big commitment you have to

323
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:59,110
know what you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> before you can</font>

324
00:18:57,580 --> 00:19:01,120
let loose all these hacker tools in

325
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:02,860
somebody's environment because it'll

326
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:07,750
knock a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of stuff over and cause</font>

327
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:10,389
outages if you're not careful it's it's

328
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:14,350
a way of life you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to stay up to</font>

329
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:16,660
date if you're not monitoring feeds and

330
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:19,000
everything you're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be way left</font>

331
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:21,670
behind and you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to start</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> getting</font>

332
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,170
worse at what you're doing it's

333
00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:25,720
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's it's a lifelong</font>

334
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:28,560
commitment<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have to keep doing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it for</font>

335
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:31,360
as<font color="#CCCCCC"> long as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you want a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> job doing it and</font>

336
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:34,720
then one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> biggest ones is the</font>

337
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:37,439
community like this local community has

338
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:40,810
done leaps and bounds for me personally

339
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:42,610
then I<font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have ever imagined it has</font>

340
00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:44,889
made some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the most key connections</font>

341
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:47,490
for me<font color="#CCCCCC"> to learn the things that I need</font>

342
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:51,700
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> ping the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people that are this</font>

343
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:52,550

344
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:54,920

00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:59,270
teach me everything that they know and

346
00:19:54,920 --> 00:20:02,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">just that collaboration is incredible</font>

347
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:05,690
and invaluable in my opinion I know many

348
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:07,490
people that<font color="#CCCCCC"> have gotten jobs through</font>

349
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:11,810
coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the hackerspace and hanging</font>

350
00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:17,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">and talking to people like it's that's</font>

351
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:19,129
the way you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do it so I'm ending</font>

352
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:22,040
really quick I got through those slides

a lot quicker<font color="#E5E5E5"> than i thought i would but</font>

354
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:27,620
that will give everybody a break to go
