00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:10,349
research efforts into all areas of

4
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:12,120
application security so an advanced

5
00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:14,580
application security professional with

6
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:16,350
years of security experience seth has

7
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:18,210
worked in a multiple disciplines from

8
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:20,699
software development to network

9
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:23,519
protection as a manager contributor and

10
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:27,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">speaker so Seth explores the world of</font>

11
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:30,778
that application security via at SEF law

12
00:00:27,529 --> 00:00:36,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">ok and then before we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> let Seth take it</font>

13
00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:39,090
away they asked us to ask everybody to

14
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:41,640
please sign up go talk with the vendor

15
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:44,340
sign up on their<font color="#E5E5E5"> lists that the vendors</font>

16
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:47,399
need some love downstairs that's really

17
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:49,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">all right the vendors needs love yeah</font>

18
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:52,170
they made this all possible right I mean

19
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:54,019
yeah it cost us a little bit as far as

20
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:56,129
getting in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the door but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they definitely</font>

21
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:57,600
stepped up to the plate when we needed

22
00:00:56,129 --> 00:00:59,039
them so we could get the space<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

23
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,050
get the badges everything that you see

24
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:03,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">really comes from vendor contributions</font>

25
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:07,158
so go give them some love even if it's

26
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:10,530
just hey thanks right thanks all right

27
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:12,750
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> good and she say how long oh its</font>

28
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:14,159
final we got it so we're gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> start</font>

29
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:16,650
cutting these down to about 40 minutes

30
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:19,200
since Jason went so long he's a little

31
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:20,759
long-winded i typically tend to be as

32
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:27,390
well so we're gonna work my cover a lot

33
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:29,369
of stuff um like she<font color="#E5E5E5"> said see if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I can</font>

34
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:30,840
get back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to my slides here my name is</font>

35
00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:33,659
Seth lime the director of research and

36
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:37,170
development and busy 'um I've been<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

37
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:39,299
developer I've been in security my

38
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:42,030
development background was I Omega if

39
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:43,890
you all remember that no years and years

40
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:46,829
ago the click of death that killed us

41
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:51,119
all I know I'm getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> up there and I'm</font>

47
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,780
Chelsea all right what am I doing here

48
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,619
today we're talking building<font color="#CCCCCC"> app second</font>

49
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:09,780
we're talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about building</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

50
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:11,300
application security program is this mic

51
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:13,400
working okay for you<font color="#CCCCCC"> guys back there</font>

52
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:25,250
kind of feels like this one

53
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:29,870
to me that's cool all<font color="#CCCCCC"> right is that that</font>

54
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:34,430
better okay all right first things<font color="#E5E5E5"> first</font>

55
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:36,829
what is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this shell-shocked yay right</font>

56
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:41,239
this one little string causes all sorts

57
00:02:36,829 --> 00:02:46,310
of bad things to happen now who's fault

58
00:02:41,239 --> 00:02:48,620
was shell-shocked who's to blame<font color="#CCCCCC"> PSD I</font>

59
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:52,879
don't know it I is it Richard Stallman

60
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:55,879
right it's bash or Michelle at some

61
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:57,048
point and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that that's really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at the</font>

62
00:02:55,879 --> 00:02:59,629
heart of what I want to get out today

63
00:02:57,049 --> 00:03:03,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">your application</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> security program like</font>

64
00:02:59,629 --> 00:03:06,409
what you build internally all it all

65
00:03:03,379 --> 00:03:09,590
boils<font color="#CCCCCC"> down to who's responsible for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

66
00:03:06,409 --> 00:03:11,209
vulnerabilities within your code you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

67
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:13,599
you can point<font color="#E5E5E5"> your developers here but</font>

68
00:03:11,209 --> 00:03:17,060
most likely they weren't the ones that

69
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:18,709
implemented this inside of<font color="#E5E5E5"> bash it goes</font>

70
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:21,379
back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to some open source developer</font>

71
00:03:18,709 --> 00:03:24,889
somewhere and yet it bit us all in the

72
00:03:21,379 --> 00:03:26,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">butt right so where where does</font>

73
00:03:24,889 --> 00:03:29,900
application security sit who's

74
00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:31,250
responsible for application security in

75
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:32,780
this room I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> obviously you're up</font>

76
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:34,909
here we got a better representation here

77
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:37,370
than I had at st. cons so you know I'm

78
00:03:34,909 --> 00:03:41,418
<font color="#E5E5E5">only I'm speaking to you know not three</font>

79
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:42,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">people but at least a few of you who's</font>

80
00:03:41,419 --> 00:03:46,310
responsible here in this room for

81
00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:51,310
application security<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so we've</font>

82
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:55,540
got a few people good are you developers

83
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:57,769
cool good I I love to see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that because</font>

84
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:59,090
when I first got into the industry<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

85
00:03:57,769 --> 00:04:01,790
we first started<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about</font>

86
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:03,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">application security it was all the</font>

87
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:05,629
network security guys that just decided

88
00:04:03,769 --> 00:04:08,239
hey I know what sequel injection is or

89
00:04:05,629 --> 00:04:09,709
you know it was probably more management

90
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:11,239
when hey this is security it has

91
00:04:09,709 --> 00:04:12,680
security in the title so I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

92
00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:15,349
hand it to the network security guys

93
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:16,639
that run my firewall and then they turn

94
00:04:15,349 --> 00:04:18,409
around and say hey you've got sequel

95
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:23,240
injection but I don't know what<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is</font>

96
00:04:18,409 --> 00:04:25,550
or how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to fix it so application security</font>

97
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:27,580
goes up and down the stack right we've

98
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:29,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">got all these different</font>

99
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:31,669
technologies and people<font color="#E5E5E5"> that talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

100
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:34,460
application security but really it

101
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:38,330
should holistically be anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

102
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:40,190
your application depends upon that that

103
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:43,010
may affect the overall security of your

104
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:45,710
application<font color="#E5E5E5"> I in bash is a portion</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

105
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:47,539
your<font color="#CCCCCC"> applications security program and</font>

106
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:50,479
you've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have some purview into</font>

107
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:52,010
that some of the new DevOps technologies

108
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:54,050
and things like that whether it's doc or

109
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:55,940
something along those<font color="#CCCCCC"> lines helps us in</font>

110
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:58,040
that just because we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> deploy things</font>

111
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:59,750
easily and we can push things further

112
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:01,070
but each of these different<font color="#E5E5E5"> pieces I</font>

113
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:04,640
mean you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> sands</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and you've got a</font>

114
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:06,290
loss that tell us what application

115
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:07,400
security is or where vulnerabilities

116
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:09,170
exist but you've also got the

117
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:10,549
technologies the stack you know rails

118
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:13,460
the framework you're using you may be

119
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:16,070
using tomcat you may be using<font color="#CCCCCC"> Apache you</font>

120
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:17,930
may be using<font color="#CCCCCC"> BSD or Linux or whatever</font>

121
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:20,990
underneath the hood it all affects your

122
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:22,160
application security to kind of frame

123
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:24,260
the discussion today we're going to talk

124
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> versus technology because you</font>

125
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:26,780
know that's that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's really where the</font>

126
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:28,940
rubber hits the road you know where

127
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:31,159
where<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that fine line that fits</font>

128
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:34,190
between those two if you're the guy

129
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:36,290
that's sitting around<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know coding an</font>

130
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:39,070
application and you're up against

131
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:41,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">terminator who's the one that wins who</font>

132
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:44,840
takes<font color="#E5E5E5"> it over and who actually runs with</font>

133
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:47,650
your application security program from

134
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:50,510
an osm OSI model model perspective

135
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:52,429
application security right we've got the

136
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:56,840
different levels but everything from

137
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:59,210
physical security let's do think it all

138
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:01,729
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> way up there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> oh I went too fast to</font>

139
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:03,739
application security right this is our

140
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:05,840
traditional look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the technologies</font>

141
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:08,600
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are out there and where we kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

142
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:10,849
classify the different security programs

143
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:12,680
physical security<font color="#CCCCCC"> owns your security</font>

144
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:14,570
guards they cover the data<font color="#E5E5E5"> in physical</font>

145
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:17,540
layers network security is your

146
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:18,469
firewalls your IPS is they cross over a

147
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:21,050
little bit up into the application

148
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:23,930
security space and into those higher

149
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:26,270
levels of the OSI model but they still

150
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:27,890
don't go as far as we traditionally can

151
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:32,330
when we're building<font color="#CCCCCC"> out a program we're</font>

152
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:35,539
really digging into the code<font color="#CCCCCC"> itself now</font>

153
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:37,340
the major issue is to fit application

154
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:38,580
security into the same budget that we

155
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:42,568
fit everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> else</font>

156
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:44,460
if you're talking about cost-benefit

157
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:45,990
analysis you know I'm getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the</font>

00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:56,069
we are as application security

professionals we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> competing for the</font>

163

same dollars that network security

164
00:06:57,150 --> 00:07:02,188
typically competes for if you're in an

165
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:03,659
organization where they fund it through

168
00:07:07,169 --> 00:07:11,219
where it normally sits I've had

00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:13,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">discussions this week already with</font>

170
00:07:11,219 --> 00:07:14,879
people that are saying hey you know

application application security is

172
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:19,349
great but I'm a you know I'm a network

177
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:30,150
years we took it and we threw it away

178
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:32,159
because it didn't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> provide any</font>

179
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:34,529
extra security to us because it<font color="#CCCCCC"> was a</font>

network security guy running it so in

181
00:07:34,529 --> 00:07:38,150
that case it was it was a matter of you

182
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:40,680
know resource problems that they have

<font color="#E5E5E5">today they line up pretty closely with</font>

these phases each of these does prevent

196
00:08:12,449 --> 00:08:17,610
i mean we skip any one of these steps

197
00:08:15,089 --> 00:08:19,229
and bad things<font color="#E5E5E5"> are going to happen if</font>

typically where there is very little

00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,810
tech involved right it's mostly a

223
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:20,399
political battle between different

got the security view which is hey we

230
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:40,170
are a bunch of geniuses and what we're

231
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:41,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">trying to do is convince lazy developers</font>

232
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:43,740
to do something they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to do</font>

233
00:09:41,779 --> 00:09:47,370
how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> times have you run</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into that</font>

234
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:48,959
and either from either side but on the

235
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:51,240
flip side we've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> the development view</font>

236
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:54,000
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we are Jedi Masters that can code</font>

anything and build things that make the

243
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:12,480
understand why they're saying it but a

244
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:14,399
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of times there's there's not this</font>

247
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:23,010
perspective you're all just a bunch of

248
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:25,829
geeks and I don't really care right

249
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:27,209
you're both experts in<font color="#E5E5E5"> your field and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

250
00:10:25,829 --> 00:10:30,329
don't know where it no way we're arguing

251
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:31,709
about who's the better captain<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

252
00:10:30,329 --> 00:10:33,329
really what it boils down<font color="#E5E5E5"> to is I pay</font>

253
00:10:31,709 --> 00:10:36,180
both your salaries and we just need to

254
00:10:33,329 --> 00:10:39,569
get stuff done<font color="#CCCCCC"> so what's really needed</font>

255
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:42,149
here the important you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know I mean IT</font>

256
00:10:39,569 --> 00:10:43,920
Crowd obviously but the important link

257
00:10:42,149 --> 00:10:46,649
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have in your organization is</font>

258
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:48,469
right there<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the middle the person</font>

259
00:10:46,649 --> 00:10:50,880
that is trying to<font color="#CCCCCC"> communicate</font>

260
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:54,500
application security needs up the chain

261
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:56,639
if you can't build<font color="#E5E5E5"> that case for money</font>

262
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:58,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're number one you're going to be</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">to cause all sorts of problems down the</font>

00:11:02,819 --> 00:11:07,839
line it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to turn your app</font>

267
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:10,569
into a complete raid and that's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font>

268
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:13,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">we want so wait you what can you do</font>

269
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:15,850
right we can take<font color="#E5E5E5"> this formula and</font>

270
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:21,579
present it<font color="#CCCCCC"> to management but really what</font>

271
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:23,890
does this mean right what more money it

272
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:25,990
does mean more money but if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> come to</font>

273
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:27,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">them with some mathematical well looks</font>

274
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:31,360
like a mathematical model right but it's

275
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:34,240
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> really a mathematical equation this</font>

276
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:36,480
really just equates to hey what is<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

277
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:39,040
that we should really<font color="#E5E5E5"> be worried</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

278
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:41,410
you know it's getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> easier you know</font>

279
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:43,360
again go back to that Google that Google

280
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:44,829
slide and search for breach and say hey

281
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:47,380
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> really don't want to be the next</font>

282
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:49,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">target I mean not only did our stock</font>

283
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:52,780
price drop but now we owe thousands of

284
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:54,010
consumers millions of dollars so there

285
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:55,060
are technologies out there there's

286
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:57,189
people that are trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> help out</font>

287
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:58,660
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> semantics they've got a data</font>

288
00:11:57,190 --> 00:12:00,490
breach calculator where you can actually

289
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:02,199
go in and can give them some data about

290
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:05,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">your organization they'll give you a</font>

score<font color="#CCCCCC"> and a small list of things that</font>

292
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:09,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">you can work through you know that's not</font>

293
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:10,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">the best</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> way to go about it really you</font>

294
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:13,480
should be doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> some sort of threat</font>

295
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:15,940
modeling this is you know the analysis

296
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:18,640
phase right if you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to build a new</font>

297
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:20,290
app a new<font color="#E5E5E5"> mobile application what are</font>

298
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:21,550
all the threats that go into that right

299
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:23,500
do you need to be worried about<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

300
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:25,479
sniffing bluetooth off of that phone

301
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:26,920
because you're transferring credit card

302
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:29,800
numbers between the terminal and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

304
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:33,939
to LTE or something along those

305
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:35,530
something along those lines you got to

306
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:37,690
get people to sit down<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a room and</font>

307
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:40,959
whiteboard this stuff out now how many

308
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:43,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">of you have ever done</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a threat model hey</font>

309
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:46,810
this is awesome<font color="#CCCCCC"> right most of the time I</font>

310
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:49,540
ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> that question and I get like maybe</font>

311
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:51,449
one in you know 50 that have actually

312
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:54,640
done a threat model<font color="#E5E5E5"> just because</font>

313
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:56,260
organizations don't typically pay for

314
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:58,090
people to sit<font color="#E5E5E5"> around and think about</font>

315
00:12:56,260 --> 00:13:00,460
cool ways<font color="#CCCCCC"> to break into their stuff</font>

316
00:12:58,090 --> 00:13:02,560
right it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just it's kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

317
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:04,960
counterintuitive but that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really what</font>

318
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:06,880
needs to happen if we sit down and we

319
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:08,860
can figure out you know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of</font>

320
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:11,439
attack vectors<font color="#E5E5E5"> exist it's easier to</font>

321
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:14,380
extrapolate back and you know analyze

322
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:16,150
where we need to put money and we need

323
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:18,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">to put dollars does it make sense to</font>

324
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:19,840
upgrade our firewall win

325
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:21,550
and you know our application is

326
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:23,140
vulnerable to sequel injection yeah

327
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:25,420
probably not throw<font color="#E5E5E5"> that money at</font>

328
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:28,770
development versus you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know the the</font>

329
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:30,699
network team there are a couple

330
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:32,199
technology instances that are out there

331
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:33,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">right these are more frameworks that you</font>

332
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:37,060
can use for running a threat model

333
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:41,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">Microsoft is definitely one of the you</font>

334
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:42,819
know premier processes or the premier

335
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:44,710
frameworks for doing this they've got

336
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:46,030
their fret<font color="#E5E5E5"> ma threat modeling tool that</font>

337
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:49,150
actually just got updated within the

338
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:50,079
last year trike and octave or both open

339
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:51,760
source and you can go pull those down

340
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:54,670
and use them as well and they do a

341
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:57,250
pretty good job<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the people side of</font>

342
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:59,290
things everybody's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be involved</font>

343
00:13:57,250 --> 00:14:00,910
in this phase if you're doing a threat

344
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:02,920
model you probably don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want your</font>

345
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:04,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">project managers in there but you do</font>

346
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:06,370
want the technical folks<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

347
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:08,350
architecture your application owners

348
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:09,880
that know about<font color="#E5E5E5"> what they're trying to</font>

349
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:11,290
build and why they're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to build it</font>

350
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:15,939
those guys have a different viewpoint

351
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:17,650
than the rest of<font color="#E5E5E5"> us yeah</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> consultants you</font>

352
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:20,320
know you know come pay us to do it<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

353
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:21,550
kidding<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't have to do that but</font>

354
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,470
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are some issues there right it's a</font>

355
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:25,060
time<font color="#CCCCCC"> investment whether</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or not you want</font>

356
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:26,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do it on all your projects what's</font>

357
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:30,130
your methodology how you actually

358
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:32,829
implement that across the board becomes

359
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:36,280
very difficult so you got to think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

360
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:39,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of them okay so let's jump into the</font>

361
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:44,079
next phase design phase this is where we

362
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:46,030
talk more specifically about your your

363
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:48,610
implemented sdlc how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you use a</font>

364
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:52,319
waterfall method here for implementing

365
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:56,140
or for coding no one uses waterfall

366
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:58,530
agile<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I'm seeing more and more</font>

367
00:14:56,140 --> 00:15:02,980
agile what are the rest<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you use</font>

368
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:07,569
cowboy<font color="#E5E5E5"> Wow so somebody just you know</font>

369
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:09,430
coding in production okay yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly</font>

370
00:15:07,570 --> 00:15:11,110
if you don't have production data you

371
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:12,520
can't test it look it's so beautiful

372
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:15,550
though you know this whole waterfall

373
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:18,310
methodology you know this doesn't quite

374
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:20,709
equate to that but you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know it is along</font>

375
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:22,239
those same lines definitely the two most

376
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:24,910
common that we run into or water file

377
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:26,650
waterfall and agile you know agile I

378
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:29,439
like a cheetah there and you know you

379
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:31,480
spin<font color="#CCCCCC"> around and around and around but a</font>

380
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,950
company I worked with you no claim to

381
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,720
make the

382
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:35,130
switch from water file to agile like

383
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:38,060
they've been around for 20 some odd

384
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:40,770
years there were what their their whole

385
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:43,260
production process was built around the

386
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:45,030
waterfall methodology and they said okay

387
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:47,610
at some point somebody read a book and

388
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:49,050
decided we're moving to agile now how

389
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:52,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">hard you think it is to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> change an</font>

390
00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:54,540
organization from waterfall to agile is

391
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:57,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">is that an easy thing to do that's just</font>

392
00:15:54,540 --> 00:16:00,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">a weekend to change everyone's mind set</font>

393
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:01,950
yeah it wasn't until you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> initially</font>

394
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:03,450
they said this and the development teams

395
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:05,250
they you know structured them into their

396
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:06,960
agile teams started doing sprints and

397
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:09,150
things like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> but then they forgot oh</font>

398
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:10,860
guess what you know if we don't do QA

399
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:13,860
and production support and everybody

400
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:15,990
else it doesn't matter<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we do on the</font>

401
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:18,240
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the development side yes we may be</font>

402
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:20,520
releasing more<font color="#E5E5E5"> often but you've still</font>

403
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:22,500
got the production support people that

404
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:24,750
don't trust any of the key of the QA

405
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:26,670
people or the development people<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you</font>

406
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:28,020
hand them a jar file and what<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the</font>

407
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:30,180
production support people do because

408
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:31,500
they're you know they're all you know 50

409
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:33,780
years<font color="#E5E5E5"> old they don't want anything</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bad</font>

410
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:35,640
to happen they take that that jar file

411
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:37,350
they explode it out and actually extract

412
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:40,110
the classes<font color="#CCCCCC"> and put them into place on</font>

413
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:41,880
the within<font color="#E5E5E5"> the application in production</font>

414
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:43,950
yeah that's a bad way to deploy an

415
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:45,480
application so that's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way the</font>

416
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:47,700
developers<font color="#CCCCCC"> test it but that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> way that</font>

417
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:50,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">the production support people did it so</font>

418
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:52,140
I mean it took them about three years to

419
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:54,570
actually make that<font color="#E5E5E5"> switch where it was</font>

420
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:56,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">running and effective and even</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now right</font>

421
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:58,250
now it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like oh well we've got Agilent</font>

422
00:16:56,520 --> 00:17:01,319
place let's do continuous deployment and

423
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:04,859
yeah that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going okay we'll see how it</font>

424
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:07,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">ends up in this phase you really need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

425
00:17:04,859 --> 00:17:09,708
talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> requirements right you're</font>

426
00:17:07,949 --> 00:17:12,620
building<font color="#CCCCCC"> a design for an application</font>

427
00:17:09,709 --> 00:17:14,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're designing all sorts of you I</font>

428
00:17:12,619 --> 00:17:16,649
requirements and functional requirements

429
00:17:14,849 --> 00:17:17,969
if you're if you aren't in the

430
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:20,940
discussion is an applications of

431
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:22,110
security professional defining the

432
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:25,680
security<font color="#CCCCCC"> requirements for the</font>

433
00:17:22,109 --> 00:17:28,409
application games over right there's no

434
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:30,480

little bit about google trusted stores

461
00:18:26,789 --> 00:18:30,629
we did some analysis just recently on

472
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:07,408
some money that goes along there but

473
00:19:04,789 --> 00:19:10,379
there's no checks for SSL there's no

00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:49,260
honestly you know yeah the best is the

573
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:51,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">guy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at the foreign dude it's like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> no no</font>

574
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:56,040
I won't give it to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you but ok you asked</font>

575
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:57,510
multiple times so I will so that's what

576
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:59,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">you got to remember is it you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

577
00:23:57,510 --> 00:24:02,879
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're taking them outside of</font>

578
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:04,350
their comfort zone and if we're taking

579
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:06,480
them<font color="#E5E5E5"> outside of our comes to think about</font>

580
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:09,659
how you are outside of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your comfort scum</font>

581
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:11,580
firts own right you know just last night

582
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:13,530
you know I talking to a doctor you know

584
00:24:13,530 --> 00:24:17,129
attack so we went in and<font color="#E5E5E5"> talked to a</font>

585
00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:18,419
doctor about<font color="#CCCCCC"> it he's describing all this</font>

586
00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:20,850
stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like oh yeah you told me</font>

587
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:22,680
this like you know this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not the first</font>

588
00:24:20,850 --> 00:24:24,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">time that we've talked to you about you</font>

589
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:25,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">know my my daughter having this</font>

590
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,760
condition and yet at the same time all

591
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:28,650
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a sudden I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have the right</font>

592
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:31,110
medicine I don't have whatever it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

593
00:24:28,650 --> 00:24:32,610
because it<font color="#CCCCCC"> slipped my mind and it's been</font>

594
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:34,949
been in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the past so he's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at me</font>

595
00:24:32,610 --> 00:24:36,240
like I'm a complete idiot because we

596
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:38,640
should be able to do this we've had this

597
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:40,500
discussion before so you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

598
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:42,210
shouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> be slapping them up upside the</font>

599
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:43,470
head with guess what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> shouldn't be</font>

600
00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:44,580
writing your password down like that

601
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:45,840
it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> got to be these gentle</font>

602
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:47,639
reminder<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's got to be this training</font>

603
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:49,020
that needs to go on there's all sorts of

604
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:50,730
options for us to actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> do this</font>

605
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:52,680
training right you're in<font color="#E5E5E5"> person you're</font>

607
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:57,870
for doing training whether that is you

security awareness training that you we

610
00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:02,760
all have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do every year and you know</font>

611
00:25:01,170 --> 00:25:04,440
roll our eyes when we do it but it but

612
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:07,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">it is important to remind people about</font>

613
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:08,490
the security<font color="#E5E5E5"> aspects and what they are</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">with developers right you know a</font>

616
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:15,510
developer training that needs to dig

617
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:18,060
into the code and needs to<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually show</font>

618
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:20,040
them talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the basics we all need</font>

619
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:21,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be reminded about the basics we do</font>

620
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:22,889
that I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> why we come to these</font>

621
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:25,710
conferences yeah granted there's the new

622
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:28,080
hot hotness whatever that may be but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

623
00:25:25,710 --> 00:25:32,250
basics are what pay our salary on a

624
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:34,230
daily basis so in this phase we got you

625
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:35,910
know variety of different personnel that

626
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:36,990
need to be involved right designing the

627
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:38,880
requirements figuring out with

628
00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:40,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">requirements are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the third parties we</font>

629
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:42,640
got to understand the risk of the tech

630
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:44,440
and you know

631
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:46,450
everybody has to work together<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

632
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:48,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">and there has to be a specific amount of</font>

633
00:25:46,450 --> 00:25:51,490
time dedicated to this but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't</font>

634
00:25:48,850 --> 00:25:55,030
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get stuck in the mud I dealt</font>

635
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:57,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">with an organization just you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

636
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:59,680
a few short months ago<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was trying</font>

637
00:25:57,790 --> 00:26:02,080
to roll out a whole new Hadoop cluster

638
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:06,580
but could not for the life of them

639
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:08,470
decide what version of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Cassandra or you</font>

640
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:10,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">know basically no sequel databases they</font>

641
00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:13,540
wanted to use on top of the data itself

642
00:26:10,450 --> 00:26:15,790
they spent six months talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

643
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:17,830
different vendors about just this one

644
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:19,540
issue right they did they talked to one

645
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:20,919
may be like oh well we're implementing

646
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:22,300
this feature so they wait with them

647
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:24,310
while somebody else came and sold them

648
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:26,230
another version and you know by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the time</font>

649
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:27,700
it came down to it the organization<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

650
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:29,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">fired the whole team and replaced them</font>

651
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:31,300
because they couldn't you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know put</font>

652
00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:34,210
rubber to the road<font color="#E5E5E5"> and actually make a</font>

653
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:36,159
decision to move on and implement what

654
00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:38,500
needed to be done at some point you just

655
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:40,810
gotta you got to cut it and move on to

656
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:42,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">the implementation phase right start</font>

657
00:26:40,810 --> 00:26:44,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">building that code and start putting a</font>

658
00:26:42,490 --> 00:26:46,990
solution into place so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is where you</font>

659
00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:49,450
know rubber meets the road we got to

660
00:26:46,990 --> 00:26:50,890
know if the the code meets<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the</font>

661
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:52,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">requirements whether those whatever</font>

662
00:26:50,890 --> 00:26:53,980
those requirements are from our

663
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:55,780
perspective our<font color="#E5E5E5"> security agreements that</font>

664
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:58,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">we've built out during the design phase</font>

665
00:26:55,780 --> 00:27:00,280
during the threat modeling phase note

666
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:02,230
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the security should be a feature</font>

667
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:03,879
within your application if it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a</font>

668
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:05,200
feature it's not going to be in port

669
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:06,670
that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason if it's not a feature</font>

670
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,140
if it's not a requirement it's not going

671
00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:11,020
to be important it's not going to be in

672
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:12,160
there involve QA I always<font color="#CCCCCC"> say and I tell</font>

673
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:14,200
people all the time you know what you

674
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:19,260
know what pen testers are they're just

675
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:22,000
glorified QA testers who document poorly

676
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:25,480
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> write you look at what comes out</font>

677
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:28,900
of a QA team and how they're trained<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

678
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:30,550
do QA testing and it's it's leaps and

679
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:33,820
bounds above what comes out of most pen

680
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:35,649
testing teams it's not some crappy PDF

681
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:37,300
but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that's actionable for</font>

682
00:27:35,650 --> 00:27:39,790
the development organization to go in

683
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:42,430
and actually fix bugs change things and

684
00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:44,530
make it better<font color="#CCCCCC"> so involve QA you'll give</font>

685
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:45,880
them your security tests there's no

686
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:49,200
reason that you need to hold those close

687
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:52,930
to the best but remember there is no

688
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:54,820
silver bullet okay at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this phase you're</font>

689
00:27:52,930 --> 00:27:56,020
going to start dealing<font color="#CCCCCC"> with multiple</font>

690
00:27:54,820 --> 00:28:00,280
different vendors

691
00:27:56,020 --> 00:28:03,310
we've got you know you know we<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk</font>

692
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:11,889
<font color="#CCCCCC">about static analysis tools come on</font>

693
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:13,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">let's move on here I know so we're</font>

694
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:14,800
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about static analysis tools</font>

695
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:16,180
within the implementation phase<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

696
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:17,379
you know any<font color="#E5E5E5"> time that you're writing</font>

697
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:18,970
code you're going to be scanning it

698
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:21,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">somebody's going to be looking at that</font>

699
00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:24,760
code whether it's a tool like an IBM HP

700
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:26,530
fortify you know Coverity very code now

701
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:28,750
all these have a static analysis<font color="#E5E5E5"> tool</font>

702
00:28:26,530 --> 00:28:30,840
that they will sell you who here is

703
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:33,340
dealt<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a static analysis tool before</font>

704
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:34,629
sweet<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so what's the problem with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

705
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:36,790
I'm gonna pick on Justin<font color="#E5E5E5"> because i knows</font>

706
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:37,750
Nene sitting up here false positives

707
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:39,970
right how much time do you spend

708
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:43,810
actually like filtering down what comes

709
00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:46,840
out of fortify and and yeah basically

710
00:28:43,810 --> 00:28:51,370
making it useful for a developer right

711
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:53,830
does<font color="#E5E5E5"> it take a while oh yeah yeah I you</font>

712
00:28:51,370 --> 00:28:55,360
know back when I worked for fish nemesis

713
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:59,980
you know a<font color="#E5E5E5"> few years ago we worked with</font>

714
00:28:55,360 --> 00:29:01,719
a very large retail operation there's a

715
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:04,750
couple down the road here i'm sure you'd

716
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:05,710
know who they were but they decided hey

717
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:07,330
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go ahead</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and we're going</font>

718
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:09,220
to implement fortify across the

719
00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:13,419
organization handed all the developers

720
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:16,150
but the code was so poor<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it was you</font>

721
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:17,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">know so old so you know there were so</font>

722
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:19,900
many vulnerabilities that came out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of it</font>

723
00:29:17,890 --> 00:29:22,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we had to actually go in and write</font>

724
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:23,400
a filter list of the top<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten</font>

725
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:26,620
vulnerabilities that we could identify

726
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:28,000
because everything else<font color="#E5E5E5"> just overwhelmed</font>

727
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:29,919
the developers too much<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean when</font>

728
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,690
you're dealing with developers across an

729
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:34,090
organization you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know when you're</font>

730
00:29:31,690 --> 00:29:37,030
talking you know 15,000 developers total

731
00:29:34,090 --> 00:29:39,040
worldwide it's very<font color="#E5E5E5"> difficult to say hey</font>

732
00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:40,780
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know here's twenty thousand</font>

733
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:42,790
vulnerabilities go fix all of them in

734
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:45,040
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next two days that just doesn't</font>

735
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:46,720
happen so they had to we had to actually

736
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:48,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">filter it down to that listed like okay</font>

737
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:50,290
if we can take<font color="#E5E5E5"> care</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of these top ten</font>

738
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:52,000
then that means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that our risk level</font>

739
00:29:50,290 --> 00:29:54,010
dropped by like maybe one to two percent

740
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,660
right there was still so many outs there

741
00:29:54,010 --> 00:29:57,160
were<font color="#E5E5E5"> they were out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there that it was</font>

742
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:59,320
still an issue but though it just

743
00:29:57,160 --> 00:30:00,700
approached it in that manner but what

744
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:02,439
does that<font color="#E5E5E5"> say about these tools right</font>

745
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:04,840
there's so much data coming out of it

746
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:06,880
it's not actionable if it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> built</font>

747
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:08,530
into their the development process it's

748
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:09,520
just like finding that needle in the

749
00:30:08,530 --> 00:30:12,399
haystack

750
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:16,360
that with the static analysis analysis

751
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:18,970
tools and if we've got that many to take

752
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:20,709
care of it's going to be an issue this

753
00:30:18,970 --> 00:30:23,530
is an<font color="#E5E5E5"> example of one right this is just</font>

754
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:24,760
for 25 but again<font color="#E5E5E5"> so many there's only so</font>

755
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:26,710
much that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with that so then</font>

756
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:28,390
you revert back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> a manual code</font>

757
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:29,950
analysis but<font color="#E5E5E5"> again you're searching</font>

758
00:30:28,390 --> 00:30:31,120
through all the code for specific

759
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:33,730
vulnerabilities and who do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get</font>

760
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:35,620
involved<font color="#E5E5E5"> right is your security</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mateen</font>

761
00:30:33,730 --> 00:30:37,630
mature enough to bring them in to

762
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:41,830
actually talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about how sequel injection</font>

763
00:30:37,630 --> 00:30:43,390
is remediated in rails if the guys don't

764
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:44,649
know that then you know why are you

765
00:30:43,390 --> 00:30:45,880
having the discussion with them<font color="#E5E5E5"> why are</font>

766
00:30:44,650 --> 00:30:50,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">you bringing me bring them into that</font>

767
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:52,330
discussion so you know will you know

768
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:55,360
will involve the architects the

769
00:30:52,330 --> 00:30:57,970
developers the security team as as we

770
00:30:55,360 --> 00:31:00,129
see fit<font color="#E5E5E5"> but really implementation phase</font>

771
00:30:57,970 --> 00:31:02,020
needs to be owned by the development

772
00:31:00,130 --> 00:31:03,670
organization these tools are not

773
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:06,730
security tools they are development

774
00:31:03,670 --> 00:31:09,940
tools if there's any way that you can

775
00:31:06,730 --> 00:31:13,720
find<font color="#E5E5E5"> yourself a security developer on</font>

776
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:15,520
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> team itself that's going to go it's</font>

777
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:17,890
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go so far to actually fixing</font>

778
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:19,570
the problems that pop up there so

779
00:31:17,890 --> 00:31:22,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">traditionally you know this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the phase</font>

780
00:31:19,570 --> 00:31:23,950
that we we will see some<font color="#E5E5E5"> security</font>

781
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:25,360
involvement we do see it rolled out in a

782
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:28,630
lot of organizations but it's not always

783
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:30,490
implemented that that that well because

784
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:32,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's security that's pushing it 20 on</font>

785
00:31:30,490 --> 00:31:33,370
the developers it's not the developers

786
00:31:32,170 --> 00:31:35,350
going out and choosing the tool<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

787
00:31:33,370 --> 00:31:36,969
putting it in place so then we get<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

788
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:38,199
the testing phase right this is this is

789
00:31:36,970 --> 00:31:40,150
where your traditional you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

790
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:44,310
automated versus manual discussion comes

791
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:46,390
up but<font color="#CCCCCC"> again there is no silver bullet</font>

792
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:48,220
the vendors will try to sell you this

793
00:31:46,390 --> 00:31:49,600
all day<font color="#CCCCCC"> long hey just by our next-gen</font>

794
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:51,760
firewall and you'll never<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a problem</font>

795
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:54,159
with application security again oh wait

796
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:56,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">wait</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Oh will you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> found sequel injection</font>

797
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:58,750
well did you run you know our scarp you

798
00:31:56,500 --> 00:32:01,450
know scanner against your code as well

799
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:02,950
so we can sell you that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that'll fix</font>

800
00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:05,830
all your problems you'll never have an

801
00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:08,950
issue<font color="#E5E5E5"> there but again you're going to</font>

802
00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:11,580
run into false positives with that come

803
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:14,110
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did too many exes II there we go</font>

804
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:15,490
there's hail so not<font color="#E5E5E5"> only do you have</font>

805
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:16,870
vendors you've got free tools that are

806
00:32:15,490 --> 00:32:19,060
out there<font color="#CCCCCC"> that'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> same thing</font>

807
00:32:16,870 --> 00:32:21,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">right who do you depend on giving you</font>

808
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:24,649
the best result set

809
00:32:21,790 --> 00:32:26,750
when you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at what these tools are</font>

810
00:32:24,650 --> 00:32:28,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually doing though it's just a matter</font>

811
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:30,230
of pounding their way into your

812
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:32,600
application I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to test every</font>

813
00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:34,100
input that I can possibly see and I'm

814
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:36,379
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to throw every I'm going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to throw</font>

815
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:38,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">you know the kitchen sink at it with the</font>

816
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:39,710
rest<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the house to see what sticks and</font>

817
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:42,350
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything does and I'm going to throw</font>

818
00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:45,590
up a flag but what are the pros and<font color="#E5E5E5"> cons</font>

819
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:47,870
here right you know where where do we

820
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:49,310
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> problems with this right I I assume</font>

821
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:51,739
<font color="#CCCCCC">that some of you have run burp suite be</font>

822
00:32:49,310 --> 00:32:57,050
probed before or apps can or web inspect

823
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:59,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay okay what is it that you know apps</font>

824
00:32:57,050 --> 00:33:08,240
can is really good at finding just one

825
00:32:59,570 --> 00:33:10,520
example of vulnerability any ideas info

826
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:13,630
leaks yeah it can tell us hey guess what

827
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:15,800
I saw this in a server header<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

828
00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:17,300
cross-site scripting does a pretty good

829
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:20,030
job of telling us where cross-site

830
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:23,149
scripting exists it does a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very poor job</font>

831
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:25,280
of authorization issues if I can jump

832
00:33:23,150 --> 00:33:27,740
from one account to another if I can see

833
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:29,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">someone else's account the the request</font>

834
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:31,310
still looks valid to the scanner so it

835
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:32,930
doesn't know if that if that information

836
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:34,460
is associated with one account or

837
00:33:32,930 --> 00:33:38,240
another you've got to get a manual

838
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:39,560
tester involved<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so here I've got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font>

839
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:42,050
example<font color="#CCCCCC"> of cross-site scripting and a</font>

840
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:43,370
couple other things this is apps can but

841
00:33:42,050 --> 00:33:45,649
the manual assessment you got to turn

842
00:33:43,370 --> 00:33:47,239
those those hackers loose right you got

843
00:33:45,650 --> 00:33:49,790
to turn your security team loose at some

844
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:52,040
level but again right why<font color="#CCCCCC"> not have QA</font>

845
00:33:49,790 --> 00:33:53,750
run that for you so this becomes you

846
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:55,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">know somebody</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's just so you know</font>

847
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:57,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's some lady that's sitting in the</font>

848
00:33:55,070 --> 00:34:00,139
room and whatever this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is more real</font>

849
00:33:57,770 --> 00:34:03,470
expectation if you actually want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

850
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:06,500
implement this the problem is where do

851
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:07,940
you find these guys right not too long

852
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:08,870
ago you know the army came out and

853
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:10,280
they're like hey we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to create</font>

854
00:34:08,870 --> 00:34:14,299
this cyber command and we're going to

855
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:16,429
hire 30,000 security professionals how

856
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:20,270
big is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> security industry I honestly</font>

857
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:22,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">like 30,000 you can't find you can't</font>

858
00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:27,590
find 10,000 people that know how to do

859
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:29,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">this so there is there is a huge gap in</font>

860
00:34:27,590 --> 00:34:32,390
the number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people to the number</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

861
00:34:29,449 --> 00:34:33,980

are

864
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:37,940
like I'm saying you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know find someone on</font>

865
00:34:36,409 --> 00:34:41,089
the security team find somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

866
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:43,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">within development that can actually you</font>

867
00:34:41,089 --> 00:34:45,799
know spearhead this this for you QA is a

868
00:34:43,579 --> 00:34:48,950
great resource other<font color="#E5E5E5"> things give them</font>

00:34:45,799 --> 00:34:51,440
access to burp right burp compared to or

870
00:34:48,949 --> 00:34:54,859
is that attack proxy compared to apps

871
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:56,629
can the price is negligible for the the

872
00:34:54,859 --> 00:34:58,250
value that it provides<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you yeah you</font>

know give<font color="#CCCCCC"> them a couple days training on</font>

874
00:34:58,250 --> 00:35:01,819
go send them you know somewhere so that

875
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:04,220
they can<font color="#CCCCCC"> use the tools</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that are out</font>

876
00:35:01,819 --> 00:35:06,799
there to actually enhance your your

00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:10,129
testing process doesn't have to be you

know again security testing me during

the QA testing phase<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so you've</font>

880
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:16,250
got all these different people<font color="#E5E5E5"> one word</font>

on this<font color="#E5E5E5"> right dynamic testing you know</font>

882
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:19,880
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> got all these different names that</font>

are out there for it really what the

884

hell's going on there right<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is just</font>

885
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:26,900
an application assessment<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's all it</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">is if you know even though all the</font>

different vendors call it something

different you got to remember that<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

889
00:35:29,690 --> 00:35:34,160
penetration tests are<font color="#E5E5E5"> not created equal</font>

00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:39,650
experts on Ruby on Rails and you're

<font color="#E5E5E5">having them look at a Java you know</font>

bringing<font color="#E5E5E5"> into to look at it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so</font>

899
00:35:48,589 --> 00:35:53,990
the last phase maintenance<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know I'm</font>

900
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:55,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">about done here right at this point</font>

901
00:35:53,990 --> 00:35:57,709
we've done everything with test our code

902
00:35:55,400 --> 00:36:01,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">is completely secure right we're done</font>

903
00:35:57,710 --> 00:36:03,470
it's good no right we've inoculated

904
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:05,539
ourselves a little bit but we shouldn't

905
00:36:03,470 --> 00:36:07,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">be anti-vaxxers right we really need to</font>

906
00:36:05,539 --> 00:36:09,559
to keep up with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the regular check-ups</font>

907
00:36:07,490 --> 00:36:10,848
and all the organizations that are out

908
00:36:09,559 --> 00:36:15,529
there will push you to do this whether

909
00:36:10,849 --> 00:36:18,260
that's HIPAA<font color="#E5E5E5"> fdic pci well i was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> working</font>

910
00:36:15,529 --> 00:36:19,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">at one company a couple</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> years ago that</font>

911
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:21,650
you know they actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> hold something</font>

912
00:36:19,579 --> 00:36:23,390
like ninety-five percent of the DDA

913
00:36:21,650 --> 00:36:26,000
account information that's out there is

914
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:27,470
formed by a bunch of the big banks yeah

915
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:30,619
they get audited<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

916
00:36:27,470 --> 00:36:32,750
something like 16 to 20<font color="#CCCCCC"> times a year by</font>

917
00:36:30,619 --> 00:36:34,369
different organizations everything

918
00:36:32,750 --> 00:36:35,960
because every one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> banks wants to</font>

919
00:36:34,369 --> 00:36:37,579
come in and do an audit<font color="#E5E5E5"> on them you know</font>

920
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:39,559
hey we gave you our data but then so

921
00:36:37,579 --> 00:36:40,760
does the OCC so does the FDIC so does

922
00:36:39,559 --> 00:36:42,559
pci because there's credit card

923
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:44,150
information in there we can take<font color="#CCCCCC"> it got</font>

924
00:36:42,559 --> 00:36:46,160
to the point they had audit festivus

925
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:46,980
every year it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> like hey all the banks</font>

926
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:48,450
come down and

927
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:50,340
you know will host you and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can come</font>

928
00:36:48,450 --> 00:36:52,740
in and we'll show you everything and

929
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:55,350
take you around because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the cost was</font>

930
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:57,359
so ridiculously high they had you know

931
00:36:55,350 --> 00:36:58,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">full time staff like a team of like five</font>

932
00:36:57,359 --> 00:37:01,410
or<font color="#E5E5E5"> six people that were dedicated to</font>

933
00:36:58,830 --> 00:37:03,240
audits and you know we're talking an

934
00:37:01,410 --> 00:37:06,149
organization that's maybe 250 people

935
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:08,520
that's crazy so you know in this case

936
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:11,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">proactive is it really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> better than</font>

937
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:15,690
reactive on the maintenance cycle not

938
00:37:11,369 --> 00:37:18,470
necessarily your reactive controls go

939
00:37:15,690 --> 00:37:21,690
from you know doors locks guards

940
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:22,859
firewalls intrusion prevention systems

941
00:37:21,690 --> 00:37:26,280
all the way up to web application

942
00:37:22,859 --> 00:37:29,880
firewalls but the reactive controls as

943
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:31,680
well are needed otherwise<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're going to</font>

944
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:34,340
be missing stuff and the element that

945
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:36,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">connects those two technical controls</font>

946
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:38,609
and see it like security<font color="#E5E5E5"> in that</font>

947
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:39,869
monitoring right yes sorry I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

948
00:37:38,609 --> 00:37:45,509
flip through these quicker than I really

949
00:37:39,869 --> 00:37:47,220
expected is controlled you know the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

950
00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:49,380
link between those two sets of controls

951
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:50,368
is your sock these are the people that

952
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:51,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">are going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be sitting there I'm going</font>

953
00:37:50,369 --> 00:37:54,510
to be watching what's going on with your

954
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:56,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">code they're going to be using that</font>

955
00:37:54,510 --> 00:37:58,109
technology combining<font color="#CCCCCC"> it with process to</font>

956
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:00,118
make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you've got patching done</font>

957
00:37:58,109 --> 00:38:01,650
that you've you know find out find all

958
00:38:00,119 --> 00:38:03,450
the bugs that they're pushing out new

959
00:38:01,650 --> 00:38:06,240
and improved<font color="#E5E5E5"> code you know new improved</font>

960
00:38:03,450 --> 00:38:07,649
applications for you the people are at

961
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:09,509
least as good as the technology in this

962
00:38:07,650 --> 00:38:12,570
phase if not better think about target

963
00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:14,010
right target the whole problem the whole

964
00:38:12,570 --> 00:38:16,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">reason they got hacked they knew they</font>

965
00:38:14,010 --> 00:38:19,680
got hacked but no well the computers<font color="#E5E5E5"> new</font>

966
00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:21,899
they got hacked and the technology did

967
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:24,629
it was actually in their security event

968
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:27,150
log but no one looked at it and they

969
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:28,290
didn't pay for<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the the resources</font>

970
00:38:27,150 --> 00:38:30,150
that they needed to sit down and

971
00:38:28,290 --> 00:38:32,430
actually take a look at the logs and do

972
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:34,200
something actionable with it so they

973
00:38:32,430 --> 00:38:37,259
ended up blowing up letting everything

974
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:38,939
you know the castle was<font color="#E5E5E5"> breached so</font>

975
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:43,230
maintenance<font color="#E5E5E5"> is all about constant</font>

976
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:46,950
vigilance so you know yeah we've you

977
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:48,180
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> I I've talked about a lot today if</font>

978
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:50,549
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to talk about it more come up</font>

979
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:53,009
in you know give<font color="#CCCCCC"> me a holler otherwise</font>

980
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:56,010
let's really what it boils down to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

981
00:38:53,010 --> 00:38:59,310
security is hard just try harder if you

982
00:38:56,010 --> 00:39:00,660
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> help let me know so</font>

983
00:38:59,310 --> 00:39:02,040
I've got a cheat sheet that I'll leave

984
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:03,330
up here for a minute right this is

985
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:06,480
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything that I've talked about</font>

986
00:39:03,330 --> 00:39:10,020
for implementing an application security

987
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:12,420
program let me know if you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> any</font>

988
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:14,670
questions though yeah really<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's it's</font>

989
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:17,600
pretty fun stuff and it is possible I've

990
00:39:14,670 --> 00:39:20,130
seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> organizations implemented properly</font>

991
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:21,540
but it takes some work both from the

992
00:39:20,130 --> 00:39:23,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">development side and the security side</font>

993
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:28,320
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just got to work together all right</font>

994
00:39:23,550 --> 00:39:30,000
any questions good deal all right well

995
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:32,430
we move along equipment fast enough

996
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:35,340
thanks<font color="#CCCCCC"> again for participating in and</font>
