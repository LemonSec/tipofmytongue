cloudy is here to stay organizations are

00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,670
moving to the cloud to<font color="#CCCCCC"> reap the benefits</font>

27
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:23,158
of agility and simplicity that it

00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:24,840
provides security is possible in the

29
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:26,790
cloud but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's going to require us to</font>

30
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,320
take a different approach that approach

31
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:30,990
depends on the cloud service the

32
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,490
organization is consuming many cloud

33
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:34,829
vendors are saying that security is a

34
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:36,658
shared responsibility but what does that

35
00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:38,399
really mean what are the boundaries and

36
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:41,130
how does<font color="#CCCCCC"> that affect</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my network controls</font>

37
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:43,170
and so on and I'm gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> leave it up to</font>

38
00:01:41,130 --> 00:02:04,189
Scott to tell us about<font color="#CCCCCC"> that hear it for</font>

40
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:36,280
okay maybe if I move it closer<font color="#E5E5E5"> as I work</font>

41
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:38,470
better<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right all right well thank</font>

42
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:45,459
you let's talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit about cloud</font>

43
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:46,870
security we talked<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the cloud the</font>

44
00:02:45,459 --> 00:02:48,820
cloud means a lot of different<font color="#CCCCCC"> things to</font>

45
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:50,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">a lot of different people and it really</font>

46
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:52,030
depends on<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at if</font>

47
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:54,220
you're looking at infrastructure as a

48
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:56,050
service platform is a service software

49
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:59,220
as a service or software and services

50
00:02:56,050 --> 00:03:01,000
they're all different types of things<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

51
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:02,440
services<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get in the cloud</font>

52
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">and usually when we're talking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

53
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:06,220
moving<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the cloud you hear a lot of</font>

54
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:09,850
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like agility scalability</font>

55
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:13,810
resiliency high availability but where

56
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:14,680
does security fit into all of that and

57
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:17,830
that's what we're going to talk a little

58
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:20,050
bit about today<font color="#E5E5E5"> and when you talk about</font>

59
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:23,980
the cloud what is really what's really

60
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:26,560
behind the cloud we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to focus</font>

61
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:28,329
today a whole lot in Amazon Web Services

62
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,400
if you look at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Gartner reports</font>

63
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:33,700
obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> amazon</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is the clear market</font>

64
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:36,160
leader in cloud services in the case of

65
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:38,410
Amazon Web Services you're looking at

66
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:39,820
regions that are worldwide they have 11

67
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:41,890
different regions all around the world

68
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:44,769
and basically what a region is is it's a

69
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:46,720
set of separate and distinct data

70
00:03:44,769 --> 00:03:49,870
centers they call those things

71
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:51,010
availability zones and they have

72
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:52,780
separate power they have separate

73
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:55,149
network they have all different types of

74
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:58,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">things there they also have about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 50</font>

75
00:03:55,150 --> 00:04:02,019
edge locations or basically your CDN

stuff your static content if you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

77
00:04:02,019 --> 00:04:06,370
each one of those data centers there

78
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:07,630
you've got your traditional application

79
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:11,160
stack there where you've got your data

80
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:13,930
up on top you<font color="#E5E5E5"> got your application</font>

out the cloud<font color="#CCCCCC"> you see this phrase all</font>

89
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:35,350
over the place security is a shared

90
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:39,010
responsibility and that's especially

<font color="#E5E5E5">true inside of the cloud what you need</font>

92
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:42,340
to understand is what is your

00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:44,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">responsibility and what is your provider</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">of responsibility</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and that really</font>

you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to purchase from the cloud</font>

97
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:52,409
if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking for software services</font>

you may only be responsible for that<font color="#E5E5E5"> top</font>

00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:10,750
that virtual network on up when you're

105
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:12,190
evaluating cloud providers there's a few

106
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:16,000
things that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> really need to look at</font>

107
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:17,890
right really what sort of things are

108
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">they going to be willing to go what sort</font>

of contracts<font color="#E5E5E5"> are they going to be</font>

113
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:29,169
when you look at what's actually in the

114
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:30,190
contract what are they putting on the

115
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:34,150
limits<font color="#E5E5E5"> there whether the financial</font>

limits what sort of things what sort of

117
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:39,520
assurances are they willing to give you

118
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:43,150
also looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see what those providers</font>

119
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:45,219
provide in the way of attestations right

if you're if you're working<font color="#E5E5E5"> on for</font>

121
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:50,740
example building the<font color="#E5E5E5"> pci implementation</font>

122
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:54,340
out in the cloud does your provider have

123
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:55,930
a level<font color="#E5E5E5"> one pci compliance at a station</font>

124
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:58,210
that they're willing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give you and is</font>

125
00:05:55,930 --> 00:06:02,560
that has that<font color="#E5E5E5"> been</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> done by a third party</font>

126
00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:03,729
rather than a better organization and

127
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,070
you really<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to make sure that those</font>

128
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:07,180
fit than the need that fit the

129
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:13,270
application that you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> putting out</font>

130
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:14,680
there in the cloud so as we talk as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

131
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:16,630
said<font color="#E5E5E5"> earlier we're going to really focus</font>

132
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:18,400
in on Amazon Web Services there's plenty

133
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:20,440
of other services<font color="#CCCCCC"> out there this is just</font>

00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,630
this is just the one I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think is the most</font>

00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:24,969
interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to talk about and</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">we're going to build our application or</font>

we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about how are you</font>

00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:48,270
secure those things on up before we

146
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:50,070
build any sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> application I think</font>

147
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:52,409
the first step we always need to do is

148
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:53,730
evaluate the risk right what where<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

149
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:56,720
the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we need to be most</font>

150
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:59,160
concerned about with our application

151
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:01,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">when you look at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it we're on this stack</font>

152
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:02,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">do you think our biggest risks lie are</font>

153
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:04,740
they down at the virtual network layer

154
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:08,700
that the data<font color="#E5E5E5"> layer the application</font>

155
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:11,280
layer where those those risk lie if you

156
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:15,300
look at the verizon data breach and

157
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:19,320
incident report from 2014 you see a

158
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:20,850
couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> things first off I've got the</font>

159
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:25,140
actions down there I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want those</font>

160
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:31,169
numbers to confuse you the 133 277 those

161
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:35,520
are the the the most occuring actions

162
00:07:31,169 --> 00:07:37,650
that the attackers 2 so 4 2014 stolen

163
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:40,200
creds we're number<font color="#E5E5E5"> one exporting data</font>

164
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:42,239
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> number two the previous</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> year three</font>

165
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:45,870
and seven previous year three and four

166
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:47,490
so we're really looking at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the things as</font>

167
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:49,620
we trend over the last three<font color="#CCCCCC"> years these</font>

168
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:52,890
are really<font color="#E5E5E5"> the top things that attackers</font>

169
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:55,890
are trying to do let's go up<font color="#CCCCCC"> to look at</font>

170
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:58,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">instant incident classification web</font>

171
00:07:55,890 --> 00:08:00,900
application attacks number one on the

172
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:02,820
list that that is verizon says in the

173
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:05,250
report that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the proverbial punching</font>

174
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:06,930
bag<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the internet every web</font>

175
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:08,460
application is different you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

176
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:10,110
a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people developing those things</font>

177
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:13,380
there are a lot of vulnerabilities in

178
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:15,810
that even<font color="#E5E5E5"> more interesting eighty-eight</font>

179
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:18,240
percent of those applications those

180
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:22,290
organizations whose web applications

181
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:23,760
were attacked did not detect them number

182
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:26,190
two on the list obviously cyber

183
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:27,450
espionage basically people<font color="#E5E5E5"> clicking on a</font>

184
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:30,540
link or getting sent some sort of

185
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:32,848
malware an email or picking<font color="#E5E5E5"> up a USB</font>

187
00:08:32,849 --> 00:08:38,940
disk externally discovered most<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

188
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:41,039
time so when we look at where those

189
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:43,200
risks lie you're looking at the higher

190
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:43,470
layer of the staff we're not worried you

191
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,140
know

192
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:48,030
network type of thing is is something we

193
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:49,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">need to worry about but our application</font>

194
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:51,720
is what they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going after and that was</font>

195
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:54,240
going to be compromised and we're not

196
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:55,650
seeing it as organizations when was the

197
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,900
last time you heard of somebody breaking

198
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:59,420
into a data center and and taking some

199
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:05,579
you just don't hear about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that right</font>

200
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:07,050
doesn't occur today's so also you know

201
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:08,460
who are who are the attackers in the

202
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:11,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">target are they going to target our</font>

203
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:13,680
users or developers our DevOps teams I

204
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:16,460
think that's pretty obvious they're

205
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:18,810
going to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> going after our DevOps teams</font>

206
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:22,260
so let's go ahead and start building<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

207
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:24,420
application here is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Amazon AWS</font>

208
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:26,850
dashboard we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have near enough time</font>

209
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:28,260
to go through all of this stuff but this

210
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:34,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">gives you an idea after you get your</font>

211
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:36,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">account set up and you get logged in not</font>

212
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:38,520
only that they also have a whole bunch

213
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,530
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> CL is and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ap is that you can</font>

integrate with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> whole purpose of</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">Amazon Cloud Services is moving into</font>

216
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:48,180
moving into the cloud but also getting

217
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:49,740
things automated so the less that you

218
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:51,510
have to do manually the better off

219
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:52,850
you're going to be that gives you the

220
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:54,750
scalability that gives you the

221
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:55,860
availability the resiliency that you

222
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:59,460
want we're going to hit<font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on that</font>

223
00:09:55,860 --> 00:10:02,730
throughout the presentation so here's

224
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:04,560
our basic architecture and we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

225
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:07,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">going to kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of drill through a very</font>

226
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,790
quick pace all the different services

00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:11,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">i'm going to i'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to use in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

228
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:16,140
simple implementation you start out with

229
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:17,699
our account right that account is what's

230
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:18,840
assigned to me as my credit card

231
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:20,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">information on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my business</font>

233
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:24,840
out there it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be charged back</font>

234
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:27,840
to me there are with that<font color="#CCCCCC"> account i</font>

235
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:31,050
could set up essentially virtual private

236
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:33,750
clouds bbc's anywhere in the world we

237
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:35,250
talked about the 11 regions us we<font color="#CCCCCC"> u.s.</font>

238
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:36,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">East</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is one of those regions they have</font>

239
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:38,790
them on the west coast they have them in

240
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:43,650
Europe to have them in Australia them

241
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:48,770
all over everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I do with my</font>

242
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:50,930
account I manage with their I am service

<font color="#E5E5E5">Identity and Access Management</font>

244
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:55,920
everything that those users do with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

245
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:56,780
account I can't track it with cloud

00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:59,640
trail

247
00:10:56,780 --> 00:11:01,470
so when they spin up a new<font color="#E5E5E5"> VP see when</font>

248
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:03,300
they delete VPC when they create

249
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:05,570
instances all those types of things I

250
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:07,770
can clock I can track and cloud trail

251
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:09,060
when we talk about data storage there's

252
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:12,540
a lot of different<font color="#E5E5E5"> options here we're</font>

253
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:17,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">just going to talk about s 3 s 3 simple</font>

254
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:18,810
storage service since I want this<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

255
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:22,380
scale globally and I may want to spin up

00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:25,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">V pcs in other</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> areas besides us east and</font>

257
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:27,150
we use Amazon's route 53 which will

258
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:28,949
basically take a look at the clients the

259
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:31,560
users that are connecting to my service

260
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:33,780
decide which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the nearest or the best</font>

261
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:35,849
location for them to go to interact with

<font color="#E5E5E5">my application and over out them that</font>

services called cloud front there's

266
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:50,790
obviously other ones besides Amazon's

267
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:52,320
CDN services some of those other CD and

268
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:54,089
services allow you to<font color="#E5E5E5"> put the web</font>

269
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,430
application firewall out there as well

but<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this in this case we're not going</font>

271
00:11:56,430 --> 00:12:01,560
to do that we talked<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the VPC</font>

272
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:04,140
that's my virtual private cloud and

273
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:06,660
inside of that VPC well I've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font>

those subnets<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have security we're</font>

280
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:23,550
going to talk about all this again and

281
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:27,990
just a minute miss doing an overview

282
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:29,880
here all my traffic is<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to come</font>

00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:42,420

right in cloud again<font color="#CCCCCC"> we talked all about</font>

325
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:14,060
automation automation is key it's

326
00:14:11,449 --> 00:14:16,069
important that's where cloud formation

<font color="#E5E5E5">I build this in production I can also</font>

334
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:32,209
through that<font color="#CCCCCC"> whole design and deployment</font>

335
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:35,959
process again I use I use a confirmation

336
00:14:32,209 --> 00:14:39,680
templates and immediately it spun out so

337
00:14:35,959 --> 00:14:41,750
let's go<font color="#CCCCCC"> through a typical user</font>

338
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:44,420
connection here<font color="#CCCCCC"> users going to go out</font>

00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:45,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> connect to route 53 it's going to</font>

342
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:55,459
to the cloud front where I've got my CD

343
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:57,139
and content and then if the if<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

344
00:14:55,459 --> 00:14:59,569
doesn't have the content obviously<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

345
00:14:57,139 --> 00:15:01,880
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to send it on to my load balancers</font>

346
00:14:59,569 --> 00:15:04,219
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> take that request sent</font>

347
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:06,199
it to my web application firewall the

348
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:07,880
decide whether this request as malicious

349
00:15:06,199 --> 00:15:10,008
or not malicious if it isn't it's going

350
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:12,290
to forward<font color="#E5E5E5"> it on to my second load</font>

351
00:15:10,009 --> 00:15:15,199
balancer which is then going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to send it</font>

352
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:17,810
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> to my application servers and if they</font>

353
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:19,639
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to deliver the databases and then</font>

354
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:23,779
the reason and then the data goes back

355
00:15:19,639 --> 00:15:26,540
out the way it came in<font color="#E5E5E5"> also there may</font>

356
00:15:23,779 --> 00:15:28,790
you need for<font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to get updates</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

357
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:30,860
maybe my wife<font color="#E5E5E5"> needs to get updates</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me my</font>

358
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:35,779
app servers need to get updates<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I've</font>

359
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:37,430
set up<font color="#E5E5E5"> an at services devices as well so</font>

360
00:15:35,779 --> 00:15:40,399
that's our architecture now let's talk

361
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:42,199
about administration of this right my

362
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:43,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">administration I've got admins that are</font>

363
00:15:42,199 --> 00:15:44,990
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be able</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that they're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

364
00:15:43,339 --> 00:15:46,910
authenticate into my account they're

365
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:48,980
going to have username and passwords if

366
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:51,469
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> smart I'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to require my</font>

367
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:53,360
admin set multi factor amazon supports

368
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:55,730
this right so now<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to worry</font>

369
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:57,110
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> much about my admins but they if</font>

370
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:58,550
their username passwords could

371
00:15:57,110 --> 00:16:01,040
compromise<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't have to worry so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> much</font>

372
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:05,410
if they're compromised I'm in big

373
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:07,759
trouble if I also set things up properly

374
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:09,439
everybody that logs into<font color="#CCCCCC"> my system is</font>

375
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:10,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to get assigned a role that role</font>

376
00:16:09,439 --> 00:16:12,199
is going to tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> them what privileges</font>

377
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:15,980
they have and what privileges they don't

378
00:16:12,199 --> 00:16:19,459
have alternatively there are these

379
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:21,319
things called a WS access keys which are

380
00:16:19,459 --> 00:16:24,229
basically a really long username and

381
00:16:21,319 --> 00:16:26,029
password if I have that access key I no

382
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:28,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">longer have to have multi-factor</font>

383
00:16:26,029 --> 00:16:30,529
authentication that's a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing for</font>

384
00:16:28,069 --> 00:16:33,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">automation that's a bad thing if those</font>

385
00:16:30,529 --> 00:16:35,480
keys get compromised but<font color="#E5E5E5"> again those</font>

386
00:16:33,079 --> 00:16:36,888
when i authenticate with those keys this

387
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:38,660
is what I'm we used from right my

388
00:16:36,889 --> 00:16:40,370
automation right this is what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have to</font>

389
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:42,230
use for automation so the security of

390
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:44,089
that stuff is very important again I'm

391
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:45,949
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get assigned</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a role I'll be</font>

392
00:16:44,089 --> 00:16:48,350
able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do things within that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Amazon</font>

393
00:16:45,949 --> 00:16:50,449
account now we<font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't talked about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

394
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:52,519
instances or the machines themselves in

395
00:16:50,449 --> 00:16:54,258
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> case whenever I spin up a new</font>

396
00:16:52,519 --> 00:16:56,870
instance amazon goes ahead and creates

397
00:16:54,259 --> 00:16:59,360
an ssh key that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i can i can decide which</font>

398
00:16:56,870 --> 00:17:01,160
one they're going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> use with that ssh</font>

399
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:03,500
key i'll log into my<font color="#E5E5E5"> bastion and i'll be</font>

400
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:07,220
able to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> into all my internal host to</font>

401
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:09,530
do whatever management<font color="#CCCCCC"> i want so those</font>

402
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:13,159
<font color="#CCCCCC">are some key things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to think about in</font>

403
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:16,879
measuring so how do we go<font color="#CCCCCC"> about securing</font>

404
00:17:13,159 --> 00:17:22,549
this simple architecture we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

405
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:24,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">take the traditional strategy that we</font>

406
00:17:22,549 --> 00:17:25,490
here<font color="#CCCCCC"> in security right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> monitor assess</font>

407
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:28,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">the fan we're going to start out with</font>

408
00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:30,380
monitoring right detection is important

409
00:17:28,099 --> 00:17:32,120
most of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> time people are missing just</font>

410
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:33,340
on the detected piece alone so that's

411
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:36,379
where we're going to focus on first

412
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:37,520
detection is important and that has<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

413
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:39,140
be built on a foundation of

414
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:41,930
if i am not collecting logs from

415
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:44,150
absolutely everywhere my<font color="#E5E5E5"> ability to go</font>

416
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:46,070
to detect and then maybe even forensic

417
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:48,740
eight if I maybe I did tech I've just

418
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:55,669
just gone out the window so those are

419
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:57,470
those are crucial pieces whoops secondly

420
00:17:55,670 --> 00:17:59,810
assess and test right<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to be able</font>

421
00:17:57,470 --> 00:18:01,040
to evaluate my security controls but

422
00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:02,360
there's we are on dangerous ground

423
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:04,010
because now we've got all of our

424
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:06,050
infrastructure running on a service

425
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:08,120
provider we need to make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

426
00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:09,919
we're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> when we do that and finally</font>

427
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:11,419
defense right we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> raise the bar</font>

428
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:12,920
we want to prevent things from from

429
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:15,680
coming into being attacks being

430
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:18,470
successful so let's focus<font color="#E5E5E5"> in on monitor</font>

431
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:19,940
first<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right we're basically we</font>

432
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:21,830
started out with that stack we're going

433
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:24,080
to start at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> top generally speaking</font>

434
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:25,399
and drill down because as we as we

435
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:29,840
talked out before that's where my

436
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:31,520
highest risk saw risks are so obviously

437
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:33,649
we created our web application firewall

438
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:35,570
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to turn it on so that we can</font>

439
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:38,870
catch bursting threshold so if we see

440
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:41,450
like maybe evidence of denial of service

441
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:43,520
attack going on that I can detect that

442
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:45,560
I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to have it configured around</font>

443
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:47,420
the OS top 10 and I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go to</font>

444
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:48,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">that too much detail here and we're</font>

445
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:50,120
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have it tuned to the</font>

446
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:52,460
application laughs is going to be

447
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:54,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">absolutely no value to me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or my</font>

448
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:56,860
organization if I haven't taken the time

449
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:59,149
to tune my web application firewall

450
00:18:56,860 --> 00:19:01,760
we've talked about collecting logs and

451
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:04,730
we collect those logs from my

452
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:06,670
application from my our ds's<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm really</font>

453
00:19:04,730 --> 00:19:08,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look at authorization</font>

authentication<font color="#CCCCCC"> authorization logs right</font>

455
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:12,920
we talked about stolen creds was number

456
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:15,200
two on the list of<font color="#E5E5E5"> what people are going</font>

457
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:16,580
to go after so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to want to make</font>

458
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:18,730
me feel the bass line and figure out

459
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:21,770
what is regular behavior and what is

460
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:25,580
anomalous behavior I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to collect</font>

461
00:19:21,770 --> 00:19:27,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">them</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ylb elastic load balancer logs as</font>

462
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:30,590
well right and really what I'm looking

463
00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:32,600
for there is I<font color="#E5E5E5"> need feedback into my lap</font>

464
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:34,730
how effectively is my wife is it

465
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:36,290
configured properly am<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was finding the</font>

466
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:38,390
right things what things am I missing if

467
00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:41,470
I don't have that feedback I've got an

468
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:41,470
unstable system there

469
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:53,210
that's going to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> something them an</font>

470
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:55,730
export<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll talk about that so another</font>

471
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:58,160
thing we talked about s 3 s 3 is simple

472
00:19:55,730 --> 00:20:01,730
storage service right I can put data in

473
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:03,800
there as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well s3 access logging is not</font>

474
00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:05,840
part of cloud try logging it's something

475
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:09,260
that I need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go turn on individually</font>

476
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:11,570
in my s3 buckets and then I've also got

477
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:12,680
cloud watch up your dev ops team are

478
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:14,419
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very interested in cloud</font>

479
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:15,710
watching because that's how they're

480
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:22,240
going to measure the availability and

481
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:24,620
performance of their or application<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

482
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:28,280
next thing we talked about cloud<font color="#E5E5E5"> roll a</font>

483
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:29,570
whole lot we talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know we're</font>

484
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:31,970
looking at what sort of things we want

485
00:20:29,570 --> 00:20:35,689
to monitor we want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> use the oh oh</font>

486
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:37,400
shoot principal right if there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are there</font>

487
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:39,800
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> certain things that if that happens</font>

488
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:42,770
if I get my users are getting 404 errors

489
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:44,510
I'm like oh darn you know that's that's

490
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:49,460
that's I probably want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to take care</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

491
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:53,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">that if I see like delete VPC show up</font>

492
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:56,300
that's an that's an oh shoot situation

493
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:58,370
right and so when I build<font color="#E5E5E5"> my monitoring</font>

494
00:20:56,300 --> 00:21:00,169
I want to start at those oh shoot

495
00:20:58,370 --> 00:21:02,590
moments right where those where those

496
00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:05,210
things are really going to impact me the

497
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:08,720
Amazon root account is the count that

498
00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:10,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">has all privileges and if you go in and</font>

499
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:12,679
try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take privileges away</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from that</font>

500
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:14,630
they just<font color="#E5E5E5"> ignore you have all privileges</font>

501
00:21:12,679 --> 00:21:16,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">with that root account so that is one</font>

502
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:19,040
account that I want to make sure is

503
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:20,689
locked down<font color="#E5E5E5"> that will make sure that for</font>

504
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:22,850
the most part it's never used if I see

505
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:26,210
my cloud trail logs if I see that<font color="#CCCCCC"> root</font>

506
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:27,740
account any activity<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a phone call</font>

507
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:29,030
I need to call someone find out what's

508
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:30,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">going on with that because that should</font>

509
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:32,660
be that should be multi-factor

510
00:21:30,410 --> 00:21:35,020
authentication and probably someone else

511
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:37,370
should have the hardware token to that

512
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:39,650
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other thing that would be very</font>

513
00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:41,510
interested in is if someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> goes in and</font>

514
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:44,480
turns off logging for a minute right

515
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:46,070
luckily amazon will send you the message

516
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:48,770
before it stops logging but that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

517
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:50,300
important same same if I got somebody

518
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:52,429
maybe a little bit sneaky maybe they

519
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:54,710
update where that cloud<font color="#E5E5E5"> trail is logging</font>

520
00:21:52,429 --> 00:21:56,360
and logging to an s3 bucket if they

521
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:58,549
change it to log two different buck

522
00:21:56,360 --> 00:22:03,439
maybe that's another way<font color="#CCCCCC"> died so that's</font>

523
00:21:58,549 --> 00:22:04,910
another thing create<font color="#CCCCCC"> VPC that's a bad</font>

524
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:09,010
day in the cloud if you see that event

525
00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:09,010
come across your screen have a question

526
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:25,010
you're absolutely absolutely want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

527
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:27,350
test me so the question<font color="#CCCCCC"> is is how often</font>

528
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:28,970
do we do testing and we should be

529
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:30,290
testing all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> time on the security</font>

530
00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:33,380
team you should<font color="#CCCCCC"> have operations team</font>

531
00:22:30,290 --> 00:22:35,059
saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> hey is this still firing and then</font>

532
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:37,309
also you know when you're building this

533
00:22:35,059 --> 00:22:39,168
when you're setting this up you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

534
00:22:37,309 --> 00:22:41,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">ask the question this is what I'm</font>

535
00:22:39,169 --> 00:22:43,640
expecting but when<font color="#E5E5E5"> puts in real use is</font>

536
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:45,380
is what am<font color="#E5E5E5"> I expecting what am I seeing</font>

537
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:47,710
the same thing and<font color="#E5E5E5"> how is that changing</font>

538
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:51,200
over time and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so yes obviously</font>

539
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:55,130
continuously continuous testing is very

540
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:56,600
important create access key amazon

541
00:22:55,130 --> 00:22:58,790
access keys we're going to talk a lot

542
00:22:56,600 --> 00:23:01,580
about this<font color="#E5E5E5"> right those are essentially</font>

543
00:22:58,790 --> 00:23:02,720
if I depending on the privileges given

544
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:05,299
to them the role that's given<font color="#CCCCCC"> to them</font>

545
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:06,890
right but those are keys into my data

546
00:23:05,299 --> 00:23:08,270
center they can spin up instances they

547
00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:10,280
can delete instances they can do

548
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:11,690
whatever they want you know those are

549
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:14,510
key those are virtual keys into your

550
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:16,100
data center so<font color="#CCCCCC"> anytime an access key is</font>

551
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:17,240
created I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to investigate</font>

552
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:18,678
that I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to say hey was this</font>

553
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:20,480
expected who has it what are the

554
00:23:18,679 --> 00:23:22,130
privileges on it those types of things

555
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,270
and it's sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of privilege role</font>

556
00:23:22,130 --> 00:23:25,850
assignment I should be probably

557
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:28,879
following up on that<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at some of</font>

558
00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:30,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">the route 53 delete hosted zone so a lot</font>

559
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:34,160
of my dns entries if I see an event like

560
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:36,169
that what's going on you know change

561
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:38,500
resource record set again changes not

562
00:23:36,169 --> 00:23:40,370
maybe deleting it but changes to it

563
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:42,919
another really interesting we're gonna

564
00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:45,439
hit thing is we're gonna hit upon this

565
00:23:42,919 --> 00:23:48,320
again later is run instance I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

566
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:50,270
look at how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> new VM images are being</font>

567
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:53,629
started up right if that<font color="#E5E5E5"> dramatically</font>

568
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:55,850
increases<font color="#CCCCCC"> did</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> someone just have their</font>

569
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:57,620
account compromised or did we just lose

570
00:23:55,850 --> 00:23:59,600
some AWS access keys or someone's

571
00:23:57,620 --> 00:24:01,340
account compromised and maybe someones

572
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:03,320
now spinning up instances to do Bitcoin

573
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:05,540
mining we'll talk about that in a minute

574
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:07,280
as well and it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> sort of a public</font>

575
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:09,080
security group those groups around are

576
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:09,480
instances any modification to those and

577
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:11,460
that

578
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:16,290
zone that's probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> something I want to</font>

579
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:19,070
investigate on top of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we talked</font>

580
00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:21,659
about I<font color="#CCCCCC"> am is very important access keys</font>

581
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:23,428
I'm not going to be able to inventory

582
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:25,410
any of that stuff of cloud trail again

583
00:24:23,429 --> 00:24:27,059
it's just telling me the changes I'm

584
00:24:25,410 --> 00:24:30,120
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to spin up a security instance</font>

585
00:24:27,059 --> 00:24:32,340
here in my application that i can go in

586
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:35,719
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can use</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> amazon</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> api so i can go in</font>

587
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:38,428
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> do i can go in and take a look at</font>

588
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:40,980
the access keys who are the owners who's

589
00:24:38,429 --> 00:24:42,570
in who's the owner was the last date

590
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:43,710
that key was recycled because i'm

591
00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:48,030
probably going to want to recycle those

592
00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:49,230
every 60 to 90 days all those types of

593
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:51,418
things are going to be interested in

594
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:54,929
let's go down the stack a little bit OS

595
00:24:51,419 --> 00:24:58,500
instances we talked about the cloud we

596
00:24:54,929 --> 00:25:00,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">talked about agility right if we're</font>

597
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:04,500
these OS instances are going to be spun

598
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:06,809
up spun down based on the load that's

599
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:08,970
coming to<font color="#E5E5E5"> my application as a security</font>

600
00:25:06,809 --> 00:25:10,889
expert I need to be able to<font color="#CCCCCC"> support my</font>

601
00:25:08,970 --> 00:25:13,620
development of my death my ops team and

602
00:25:10,890 --> 00:25:15,179
I have to treat those instances there's

603
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:17,159
a perfect quote that we've used in the

604
00:25:15,179 --> 00:25:18,750
church we have to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to treat them</font>

605
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:21,870
as cattle if we're treating them as pets

606
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:25,140
we're doing it wrong so our security

607
00:25:21,870 --> 00:25:27,090
strategy has to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to meet meet the</font>

608
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:30,390
new the changes of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the cloud is pushing</font>

609
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:32,040
at us and one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the ways that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

610
00:25:30,390 --> 00:25:35,160
really makes sense is file integrity

611
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:36,389
monitoring for a long time i looked at

612
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:39,630
file integrity monitoring<font color="#E5E5E5"> i said this</font>

613
00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:41,340
makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> sense but it is really hard here's</font>

614
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:43,140
a here's a situation or a scenario where

615
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:45,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">i think voluntary monitoring makes sense</font>

616
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:47,490
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> i want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> take those instances</font>

617
00:25:45,690 --> 00:25:49,320
those am wise that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i want to</font>

618
00:25:47,490 --> 00:25:50,970
snap shot them write these things are

619
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:53,220
going to be spun up automatically spun

620
00:25:50,970 --> 00:25:54,630
down automatically I should it should be

621
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:56,790
easy for me to tell if one of these

622
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:59,730
things is not like the others<font color="#E5E5E5"> right and</font>

623
00:25:56,790 --> 00:26:01,190
if it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is if it isn't then that's</font>

624
00:25:59,730 --> 00:26:03,390
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> I probably want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to investigate</font>

625
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:04,590
it's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> require me to put a little</font>

626
00:26:03,390 --> 00:26:06,480
more process be a little bit more

627
00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:08,399
discipline right<font color="#CCCCCC"> anytime I have new code</font>

628
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:11,010
deployed anytime we start using new am

629
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:13,080
wise patching<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to keep those up</font>

630
00:26:11,010 --> 00:26:15,620
to date but again<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's just here's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font>

631
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:18,240
here's my image boom if it changes I

632
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:19,500
need to be aware of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> right I'm also</font>

633
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:21,540
going to want to collect syslog and

634
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:22,429
event logs because if something does

635
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:26,928
occur I mean want

636
00:26:22,429 --> 00:26:28,460
do some<font color="#E5E5E5"> forensic Sarah</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so we</font>

637
00:26:26,929 --> 00:26:30,619
talked about the event monitoring system

638
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:33,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">I call it event monitoring system</font>

639
00:26:30,619 --> 00:26:35,449
because I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think in the cloud it makes a</font>

640
00:26:33,049 --> 00:26:36,559
lot of sense<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the events and the</font>

641
00:26:35,450 --> 00:26:38,929
things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at from a</font>

642
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:42,168
security perspective is also available

643
00:26:38,929 --> 00:26:44,299
to my my developer my operations team

644
00:26:42,169 --> 00:26:46,909
right there's a good synergy there oops

645
00:26:44,299 --> 00:26:47,960
good synergy there that they were want

646
00:26:46,909 --> 00:26:50,059
to they're going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> wanna</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look at their</font>

647
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:51,619
logs for operational performance I'm a

648
00:26:50,059 --> 00:26:53,570
wild look for security if we can bring

649
00:26:51,619 --> 00:26:56,059
those things together that makes a lot

650
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:58,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">of sense in my mind again we talked</font>

651
00:26:56,059 --> 00:26:59,539
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that oh shoot principal that's the</font>

652
00:26:58,369 --> 00:27:01,519
type of those are the things I'm going

653
00:26:59,539 --> 00:27:02,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">to want to start looking at and then</font>

654
00:27:01,519 --> 00:27:05,720
once I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got those in place I'm gonna</font>

655
00:27:02,779 --> 00:27:08,419
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start looking looking down near</font>

656
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:12,230
the system moving forward let's go in to

657
00:27:08,419 --> 00:27:15,110
assess all right so do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you like working</font>

658
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:16,879
in the technology field you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep</font>

659
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:19,908
it that way you need to be very careful

660
00:27:16,879 --> 00:27:21,889
about how you do assessment in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cloud</font>

661
00:27:19,909 --> 00:27:24,499
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> running on someone else's</font>

662
00:27:21,889 --> 00:27:26,360
infrastructure and so you know if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

663
00:27:24,499 --> 00:27:29,360
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> go out there and do that you get</font>

664
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:31,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">yourself into a lot of trouble I'll you</font>

665
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:32,570
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> not just talking to the cloud</font>

666
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:34,669
provider you also need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk to the</font>

667
00:27:32,570 --> 00:27:36,470
organization you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> working at because</font>

668
00:27:34,669 --> 00:27:38,629
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> may have permission from the cloud</font>

669
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:39,889
provider but not from the organization

670
00:27:38,629 --> 00:27:43,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">that will give you two just as much</font>

671
00:27:39,889 --> 00:27:45,709
trouble right pen testers talk about

672
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:47,029
getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> written written permission they</font>

673
00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:49,070
call that<font color="#E5E5E5"> their get out of jail free</font>

674
00:27:47,029 --> 00:27:50,629
card right if I have that written

675
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:52,490
permission that tells me<font color="#CCCCCC"> what I can do</font>

676
00:27:50,629 --> 00:27:56,178
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have been given that</font>

677
00:27:52,490 --> 00:27:59,990
authorization to do it so weird<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

678
00:27:56,179 --> 00:28:02,720
warning to you<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so let's let's start</font>

679
00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:06,950
looking at assess and test I'm going

680
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:10,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">back down through our step or stack so</font>

681
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:11,659
static code analysis there are a lot of

682
00:28:10,369 --> 00:28:13,490
tools out there that you can buy right

683
00:28:11,659 --> 00:28:15,710
now that will do static code analysis

684
00:28:13,490 --> 00:28:17,690
look for secure coding practices look

685
00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:19,519
for plain text credentials we're also

686
00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:22,519
going to want to look for plain text

687
00:28:19,519 --> 00:28:25,039
access keys in there right if those

688
00:28:22,519 --> 00:28:27,889
access keys are in there then anybody

689
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:29,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">who has access to that code they can get</font>

690
00:28:27,889 --> 00:28:33,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">those keys</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and I'm going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have an</font>

691
00:28:29,090 --> 00:28:37,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">ocean moment for sure right we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talked it</font>

692
00:28:33,570 --> 00:28:39,450
we talked about DevOps all the time but

693
00:28:37,530 --> 00:28:41,850
why don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> we insert security into that</font>

694
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:43,950
whole process<font color="#E5E5E5"> who on my debt and my dev</font>

695
00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:46,889
ops team is the belly<font color="#CCCCCC"> button the person</font>

696
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:48,240
responsible<font color="#E5E5E5"> for security I think that's</font>

697
00:28:46,890 --> 00:28:49,440
something that we got to look at when we

698
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:51,000
move to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cloud we should have we</font>

699
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:52,590
could have risk<font color="#E5E5E5"> manager we have security</font>

700
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,810
architects<font color="#E5E5E5"> that these people can come to</font>

701
00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:57,120
and talk to but when it comes down to

702
00:28:54,810 --> 00:28:59,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">who is responsible for security on that</font>

703
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:01,050
dev team and as they're building this as

704
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:02,430
a right in their code as they're doing

705
00:29:01,050 --> 00:29:03,960
all these things who's responsible make

706
00:29:02,430 --> 00:29:07,830
sure that<font color="#E5E5E5"> all those security task gets</font>

707
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:09,510
done cloud formation templates we talked

708
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:14,879
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the ability to spin the</font>

709
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:16,980
Creator our application<font color="#E5E5E5"> out there in the</font>

710
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:18,510
cloud we could have a process<font color="#E5E5E5"> about you</font>

711
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:22,130

00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:24,390
and pushing things out into production

713
00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:27,120
drilling down a little bit we talked

714
00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:29,850
about this before incident Identity and

715
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:31,500
Access Management we should be looking

716
00:29:29,850 --> 00:29:33,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what roles and who has the</font>

717
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:34,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">responsibility to make sure that those</font>

718
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:37,139
roles assigned are people moving in and

719
00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:41,220
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the development team make sure</font>

720
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:44,700
that that's up to date remember<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font>

721
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:47,160
cloud users and instances can<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

722
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:49,890
privileged roles and if I am maybe a

723
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:53,310
user that<font color="#CCCCCC"> has lower roles but I haven't</font>

724
00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:55,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">I can ssh into an instance that has</font>

725
00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:58,370
elevated roles I just got elevation of

726
00:29:55,530 --> 00:30:00,570
prints by SS aging to that application

727
00:29:58,370 --> 00:30:02,070
so i should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at real closely</font>

728
00:30:00,570 --> 00:30:04,439
what type of roles i'm assigning to my

729
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:06,450
instances and what's going on<font color="#CCCCCC"> there and</font>

730
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:07,860
another important thing is separation of

731
00:30:06,450 --> 00:30:08,910
duties this is not anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> new to</font>

732
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:10,560
anybody here we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to talk about</font>

733
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:16,380
why that's really important in the cloud

734
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:18,090
though one thing again<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is something</font>

735
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:19,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we should be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> able to automate in</font>

736
00:30:18,090 --> 00:30:22,590
the cloud we have those api's we have a

737
00:30:19,890 --> 00:30:24,690
CLI this is not<font color="#CCCCCC"> a manual process we need</font>

738
00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:27,870
to think about making<font color="#E5E5E5"> this an automated</font>

739
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:29,430
process that way it's done automatically

740
00:30:27,870 --> 00:30:32,610
I don't have to spend a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of time or</font>

741
00:30:29,430 --> 00:30:34,290
resources in order to do this<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay we</font>

00:30:32,610 --> 00:30:38,459
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at the am wise Amazon</font>

744
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:41,580
we're looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at those see what ones are</font>

745

out there they're built by other people

00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:47,280
we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know who those people are that</font>

748
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:50,129
we start using those what

749
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:52,649
what sort of risk that we just exposed

756
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:12,230
amazon has another thing called trusted

one thing really well if it's doing up a

00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:57,240
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of things and is relying on state on</font>

00:35:13,410 --> 00:35:18,250
right talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to me about that after</font>

851
00:35:16,690 --> 00:35:21,160
because pci is gonna be a little bit

852
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:23,559
different I know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that people are making</font>

853
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:26,319
peace are achieving pci compliance in

854
00:35:23,559 --> 00:35:29,049
the cloud but that's that's a pretty

855
00:35:26,319 --> 00:35:39,308
involved response i think so let's talk

856
00:35:29,049 --> 00:36:05,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">about that after right they do have that</font>

857
00:35:39,309 --> 00:36:07,780
service right so looking at our

858
00:36:05,559 --> 00:36:09,460
application we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to hit up on</font>

859
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:11,799
this again web application firewall we

860
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:13,569
had it out<font color="#E5E5E5"> there and monitor mode if you</font>

861
00:36:11,799 --> 00:36:14,980
need in order to really defend our

862
00:36:13,569 --> 00:36:16,900
organization we need to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> it to</font>

863
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:19,540
blocking mode that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> again going to</font>

864
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:22,660
require some discipline on me working

865
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:25,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">with or whoever it is that handles the</font>

866
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:26,379
web application for<font color="#CCCCCC"> our firewall working</font>

867
00:36:25,089 --> 00:36:28,299
with the dev team making sure that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

868
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:29,740
in the change control process so

869
00:36:28,299 --> 00:36:34,119
<font color="#CCCCCC">nighttime they roll something out I'm</font>

870
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:36,098
there with my new laughs policy and they

871
00:36:34,119 --> 00:36:37,540
were able to validate that right you

872
00:36:36,099 --> 00:36:39,250
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to block obviously the malicious</font>

873
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:42,880
traffic and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> get this into blocking</font>

874
00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:45,160
mode you know if I get like a denial of

875
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:47,109
a surf denial of service attack coming

876
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:49,629
to me and I blocked that at my wife

877
00:36:47,109 --> 00:36:53,890
firewall then I am<font color="#E5E5E5"> not spinning up</font>

878
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:55,480
instances behind my back end web

879
00:36:53,890 --> 00:36:56,980
application servers I'm not spinning

880
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:59,829
those up and paying those additional

881
00:36:56,980 --> 00:37:02,290
charges to service that additional

882
00:36:59,829 --> 00:37:03,940
traffic I have to do that well with my

883
00:37:02,290 --> 00:37:06,569
web application firewall but I don't

884
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:09,640
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that in two places so</font>

885
00:37:06,569 --> 00:37:11,049
again rate limiting being able to if I'm

886
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:13,950
getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same IP hit me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> over and over</font>

887
00:37:11,049 --> 00:37:16,420
again and turn it on save some money

888
00:37:13,950 --> 00:37:18,640
now let's let's talk about a little bit

889
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:22,090
about evaluating our<font color="#E5E5E5"> waffe effectiveness</font>

890
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:23,710
through or HTTP<font color="#CCCCCC"> request logs I think</font>

891
00:37:22,090 --> 00:37:26,109
maybe this<font color="#E5E5E5"> may be a common practice but</font>

892
00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:29,050
do you ever take a look at your request

893
00:37:26,109 --> 00:37:30,670
logs and let's say that<font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to</font>

894
00:37:29,050 --> 00:37:32,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">do is I just want to see the length of</font>

895
00:37:30,670 --> 00:37:36,190
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> request like maybe the full URL</font>

896
00:37:32,410 --> 00:37:38,560
request the URL and the query screen and

897
00:37:36,190 --> 00:37:40,750
I just want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do a histogram plot of</font>

898
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:42,960
that let's say that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I see the average</font>

899
00:37:40,750 --> 00:37:45,609
the average request that I'm seeing is

900
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:47,109
50 bytes those are usually 50 bytes long

901
00:37:45,609 --> 00:37:49,270
I'm just totally making that up right

902
00:37:47,109 --> 00:37:51,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">and that's the majority</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of it then i</font>

903
00:37:49,270 --> 00:37:53,680
have this corner case where it's a whole

904
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:56,590
lot more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than 50 bytes maybe it's 200</font>

905
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:58,089
bytes or something like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so</font>

906
00:37:56,590 --> 00:38:00,700
maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> I focus in on that wow that's</font>

907
00:37:58,090 --> 00:38:02,349
abnormal behavior let's take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a look at</font>

908
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:04,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">that data let's take a look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at let's</font>

909
00:38:02,349 --> 00:38:07,119
also throw in what the status code is

910
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:11,170
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's a 200</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ok because of the</font>

911
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:13,150
404 is it a 500 error let's take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a look</font>

912
00:38:11,170 --> 00:38:15,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">at those status codes oh wow I've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> got a</font>

913
00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:17,710
whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> bunch of 500 error codes or maybe</font>

914
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:19,810
no responses or stuff like that let's

915
00:38:17,710 --> 00:38:22,089
drill into those oh well I've got sequel

916
00:38:19,810 --> 00:38:24,070
injection going on there or<font color="#CCCCCC"> I may have</font>

917
00:38:22,089 --> 00:38:28,869
cross-site scripting I may<font color="#E5E5E5"> have someone</font>

918
00:38:24,070 --> 00:38:31,089
trying to upload a malicious file let's

919
00:38:28,869 --> 00:38:34,630
go back and see Hayes or wife catching

920
00:38:31,089 --> 00:38:40,119
that is it seeing that you know good

921
00:38:34,630 --> 00:38:42,089
feedback test there<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so let's let's</font>

922
00:38:40,119 --> 00:38:46,060
move back down to our application far

923
00:38:42,089 --> 00:38:49,089
application frame framework right who

924
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:51,460
here has time to manage to identity

925
00:38:49,089 --> 00:38:54,400
provider right we talked<font color="#CCCCCC"> about how we</font>

926
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:56,520
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am out there in Amazon you also</font>

927
00:38:54,400 --> 00:39:00,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">have the stuff that you have work well</font>

928
00:38:56,520 --> 00:39:02,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">amazon has made possible for you to use</font>

929
00:39:00,339 --> 00:39:03,759
things like sam'l authentication so you

930
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:05,980
can authenticate to your own identity

931
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:08,440
provider and enjoy your roles<font color="#CCCCCC"> your group</font>

932
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:10,210
memberships there and then take that and

933
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:12,730
then when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you authenticate your up your</font>

934
00:39:10,210 --> 00:39:14,830
IDP gives you back your saml token you

935
00:39:12,730 --> 00:39:16,599
then pass that<font color="#E5E5E5"> on to amazon says hey</font>

936
00:39:14,830 --> 00:39:19,000
here's my saml token and that gives you

937
00:39:16,599 --> 00:39:20,530
a signed your role and then with that

938
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:26,320
role<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can go in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and do whatever</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i need</font>

939
00:39:20,530 --> 00:39:27,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">to also i can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> take that and i can do the</font>

940
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:32,080
same sort of thing

941
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:35,770
with my API or<font color="#CCCCCC"> my API authentication or</font>

942
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:37,540
my or my CLI authentication where I can

943
00:39:35,770 --> 00:39:40,720
authenticate it will give<font color="#CCCCCC"> me back a</font>

944
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:43,690
temporary access token that usually is

945
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:46,000
about has a maximum life of an hour so

946
00:39:43,690 --> 00:39:48,370
now with all my DevOps rather than

947
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:50,350
giving them permanent access keys and

948
00:39:48,370 --> 00:39:53,190
give them temporary access keys that

949
00:39:50,350 --> 00:39:56,710
have an expiration date on awesome right

950
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:58,870
my applications not all applications are

951
00:39:56,710 --> 00:40:00,280
to this point yet but they need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get</font>

952
00:39:58,870 --> 00:40:02,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">to this point where they can use those</font>

953
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:05,280
ec2 instances remember we can assign

954
00:40:02,350 --> 00:40:07,839
those a role to give them specific

955
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:12,010
capabilities permissions to do things on

956
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:13,750
amazon cloud or amazon services<font color="#CCCCCC"> i should</font>

957
00:40:12,010 --> 00:40:16,180
be all my applications should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> using</font>

958
00:40:13,750 --> 00:40:18,850
those instance rolls again those

959
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:21,250
incidents<font color="#E5E5E5"> rolls have an access key that</font>

960
00:40:18,850 --> 00:40:24,610
they can access<font color="#E5E5E5"> from essentially there</font>

961
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:27,340
amazon environment that expire so every

962
00:40:24,610 --> 00:40:28,930
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know and they have a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know</font>

963
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:31,210
what the expiration is probably about

964
00:40:28,930 --> 00:40:32,890
eight hours I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that those are</font>

965
00:40:31,210 --> 00:40:34,210
constantly recycled here now I'm

966
00:40:32,890 --> 00:40:38,279
reducing the number of keys have to

967
00:40:34,210 --> 00:40:41,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">generate that is a very good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing and</font>

968
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:42,820
I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> even read so so much that if you're</font>

969
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:46,299
not using those tooth if you're you're

970
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:49,120
you're sorry your applications are not

971
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:50,980
using the<font color="#E5E5E5"> roles you're doing cloud wrong</font>

972
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:53,230
because now you have another<font color="#E5E5E5"> manual</font>

973
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:55,330
process to making sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that those keys</font>

974
00:40:53,230 --> 00:40:57,520
are on your am wise as those get spun up

975
00:40:55,330 --> 00:40:59,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's just creating more nightmare for</font>

976
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:03,240
you right to do it right use the roles

977
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:06,220
or provided to<font color="#CCCCCC"> get to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the instance</font>

978
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:07,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">anytime I have to there's there's always</font>

979
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:09,669
going to be those cases where I have to

980
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:11,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">create permanent access keys anytime I</font>

981
00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:13,420
do that I'll make sure I do least

982
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:15,190
privilege I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that where</font>

983
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:16,780
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> at where they have elevated</font>

984
00:41:15,190 --> 00:41:19,420
privileges that I rotate those keys

985
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:21,510
regularly right and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> awk we talked</font>

986
00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:23,740
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this before scour code configs</font>

987
00:41:21,510 --> 00:41:26,140
looking for those things<font color="#E5E5E5"> and making sure</font>

988
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:29,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">that those are taken care of alright</font>

989
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:31,150
said we talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe few no</font>

990
00:41:29,290 --> 00:41:35,320
presentations good without a few

991
00:41:31,150 --> 00:41:38,110
interesting stories right here we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

992
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:39,760
developer that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was going out he was one</font>

993
00:41:38,110 --> 00:41:40,839
he<font color="#E5E5E5"> was excited to learn about the cloud</font>

994
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:43,719
he was he was

995
00:41:40,839 --> 00:41:46,569
what he could do he was deploying code

996
00:41:43,719 --> 00:41:49,390
out there and took his credentials put

997
00:41:46,569 --> 00:41:51,999
him checked his code in back into github

998
00:41:49,390 --> 00:41:54,700
and thought for a minute oh wait what

999
00:41:51,999 --> 00:41:56,890
did I just do there well look looked in

1000
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:59,200
his code did I put<font color="#CCCCCC"> my access keys in</font>

1001
00:41:56,890 --> 00:42:01,989
there yeah they're there he had him

1002
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:03,489
removed within five minutes sigh oh good

1003
00:42:01,989 --> 00:42:06,789
I got him doubted<font color="#E5E5E5"> there pretty quickly</font>

1004
00:42:03,489 --> 00:42:08,769
right the next morning he woke up for

1005
00:42:06,789 --> 00:42:10,749
emails from amazon one phone call saying

1006
00:42:08,769 --> 00:42:12,758
hey something's going on with your

1007
00:42:10,749 --> 00:42:15,368
account we think you<font color="#E5E5E5"> got to take a look</font>

1008
00:42:12,759 --> 00:42:18,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">at her right 140 strippers were spun up</font>

1009
00:42:15,369 --> 00:42:20,739
probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bitcoin mining and he was</font>

1010
00:42:18,609 --> 00:42:23,499
stuffed with the 2,300 2,300 dollar bill

1011
00:42:20,739 --> 00:42:26,109
right luckily he's able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to explain to</font>

1012
00:42:23,499 --> 00:42:29,828
<font color="#E5E5E5">Amazon what was going on and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they were</font>

1013
00:42:26,109 --> 00:42:31,359
kind you know this list one time<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll</font>

1014
00:42:29,829 --> 00:42:34,180
drop<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> charges I don't think Amazon's</font>

1015
00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:37,269
going to do that through infinity right

1016
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:39,848
<font color="#E5E5E5">so access key is a management is very</font>

1017
00:42:37,269 --> 00:42:43,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">important just a developer right not</font>

1018
00:42:39,849 --> 00:42:45,219
even an organization all right we talked

1019
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:47,589
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this a lot and when head on and</font>

1020
00:42:45,219 --> 00:42:50,319
again right multi-factor authentication

1021
00:42:47,589 --> 00:42:52,210
is important defensive measure it should

1022
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:53,319
be done on my<font color="#CCCCCC"> root account</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> any highly</font>

1023
00:42:52,210 --> 00:42:55,200
privileged account should require

1024
00:42:53,319 --> 00:42:57,190
multi-factor authentication as well

1025
00:42:55,200 --> 00:43:00,009
separation of duties is going to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

1026
00:42:57,190 --> 00:43:01,239
key in the cloud and<font color="#E5E5E5"> making sure that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

1027
00:43:00,009 --> 00:43:02,710
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> leads privileged and we're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1028
00:43:01,239 --> 00:43:05,529
talk about why that's important to say

1029
00:43:02,710 --> 00:43:09,640
in a second access<font color="#E5E5E5"> to that backup data</font>

1030
00:43:05,529 --> 00:43:14,259
is he another<font color="#E5E5E5"> great story right code</font>

1031
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:15,999
spaces one day the employees came into

1032
00:43:14,259 --> 00:43:19,799
work and notice they had a ransom note

1033
00:43:15,999 --> 00:43:22,089
on their website right hey contact us

1034
00:43:19,799 --> 00:43:25,900
you pay us a whole bunch of money<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

1035
00:43:22,089 --> 00:43:28,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">won't take you down Oh crud what are we</font>

1036
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:30,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to do well they started to take</font>

1037
00:43:28,869 --> 00:43:32,979
evasive action right we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to try</font>

1038
00:43:30,549 --> 00:43:34,960
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> lock this guy out the attacker said</font>

1039
00:43:32,979 --> 00:43:38,529
go yeah I expected you<font color="#CCCCCC"> guys to do that</font>

1040
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:39,789
deleted all of their data they didn't

1041
00:43:38,529 --> 00:43:41,589
have good what they didn't could have

1042
00:43:39,789 --> 00:43:45,160
they didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have good separation of</font>

1043
00:43:41,589 --> 00:43:46,960
duties so that attacker had access to

1044
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:49,569
all that<font color="#E5E5E5"> believed that all our data at</font>

1045
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:51,130
which point what do you do you know all

1046
00:43:49,569 --> 00:43:54,308
our<font color="#E5E5E5"> data is gone get too close our doors</font>

1047
00:43:51,130 --> 00:43:59,589
right separate separation of duties

1048
00:43:54,309 --> 00:44:02,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">ken MacLeod one additional note on</font>

1049
00:43:59,589 --> 00:44:04,869
incident response right when you when

1050
00:44:02,949 --> 00:44:06,670
you see something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> indicates hey we</font>

1051
00:44:04,869 --> 00:44:08,109
may be compromised here this makes good

1052
00:44:06,670 --> 00:44:10,150
sense in an organization that's

1053
00:44:08,109 --> 00:44:11,799
especially true in the cloud right

1054
00:44:10,150 --> 00:44:13,779
investigate without trying to tip off

1055
00:44:11,799 --> 00:44:19,719
the attacker because if the attacker

1056
00:44:13,779 --> 00:44:21,640
sees hey I've been discovered or it's

1057
00:44:19,719 --> 00:44:25,420
any sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of indication of that his</font>

1058
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:27,759
response is probably or is most likely

1059
00:44:25,420 --> 00:44:29,349
going to be automated so that you type

1060
00:44:27,759 --> 00:44:30,910
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the command line is not going to be</font>

1062
00:44:30,910 --> 00:44:37,058
response as organizations we when we

1063
00:44:34,119 --> 00:44:39,369
discover things our response should also

1064
00:44:37,059 --> 00:44:42,609
include automation automation is key in

1065
00:44:39,369 --> 00:44:45,969
the cloud<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay let's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about</font>

1066
00:44:42,609 --> 00:44:49,839
operating systems we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure</font>

1067
00:44:45,969 --> 00:44:52,150
we use trusted and wise right I if I

1068
00:44:49,839 --> 00:44:54,308
some am<font color="#E5E5E5"> wise that are out there if I go</font>

00:44:52,150 --> 00:44:55,809
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> there and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get that a my today and</font>

1070
00:44:54,309 --> 00:44:57,999
there are new patches tomorrow some of

1071
00:44:55,809 --> 00:44:59,559
those am wise will be kept updated I

1072
00:44:57,999 --> 00:45:01,718
don't have to patch my am eyes I just

1073
00:44:59,559 --> 00:45:08,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">have to go get the new am wise great</font>

1074
00:45:01,719 --> 00:45:10,779
great way of planning for your your

1075
00:45:08,140 --> 00:45:13,199
architecture in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the cloud marketplace</font>

1076
00:45:10,779 --> 00:45:15,009
has distinct compliant am wise as well

1077
00:45:13,199 --> 00:45:16,449
great you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to build those</font>

1078
00:45:15,009 --> 00:45:18,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">yourself</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you can just go out there and</font>

1079
00:45:16,449 --> 00:45:22,329
buy those right<font color="#E5E5E5"> you pay an hourly rate</font>

1080
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:25,150
on we talked about if if our film<font color="#E5E5E5"> tests</font>

1081
00:45:22,329 --> 00:45:26,769
fell investigate first right what's

1082
00:45:25,150 --> 00:45:30,130
going on we understand what's really

1083
00:45:26,769 --> 00:45:32,410
going on<font color="#CCCCCC"> here once we got an idea you</font>

1084
00:45:30,130 --> 00:45:33,789
know blow<font color="#CCCCCC"> that old instance away its</font>

1085
00:45:32,410 --> 00:45:37,328
cattle which we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to treat</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

1086
00:45:33,789 --> 00:45:39,339
as pet<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's cattle isolate it blown away</font>

1087
00:45:37,329 --> 00:45:41,799
if I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do forensics on it I can do</font>

1088
00:45:39,339 --> 00:45:45,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">that and then auto scaling we're just</font>

1089
00:45:41,799 --> 00:45:45,029
going to spin<font color="#CCCCCC"> up a new instance right</font>

1090
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:48,459
again when we look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> our am wise we</font>

1091
00:45:47,259 --> 00:45:51,420
want to make sure that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was scaling is</font>

1092
00:45:48,459 --> 00:45:53,529
using that<font color="#E5E5E5"> one we talked about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ssh-keys</font>

1093
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:56,619
here's here's a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a headache</font>

1094
00:45:53,529 --> 00:45:58,900
and cloud right we want to be able to

1095
00:45:56,619 --> 00:46:04,029
treat these instances of cattle you need

1096
00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:05,799
have a good<font color="#CCCCCC"> SSH key management strategy</font>

1097
00:46:04,029 --> 00:46:08,049
in place maybe I manage that at the

1098
00:46:05,799 --> 00:46:10,179
bastion maybe I manage that

1099
00:46:08,049 --> 00:46:12,429
pradhan on prod level that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i have ssh</font>

1100
00:46:10,179 --> 00:46:14,439
keys for product maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> I spin up an</font>

1101
00:46:12,429 --> 00:46:16,900
instance that I can do some identify<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1102
00:46:14,439 --> 00:46:18,759
have an active directory I'm instance

1103
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:21,579
out there in my environment that uses

1104
00:46:18,759 --> 00:46:23,849
that for authentication something that

1105
00:46:21,579 --> 00:46:25,809
definitely needs to be looked at

1106
00:46:23,849 --> 00:46:27,999
probably the worst case scenario is

1107
00:46:25,809 --> 00:46:29,529
managed that on an ami<font color="#CCCCCC"> by mi basis as</font>

1108
00:46:27,999 --> 00:46:33,399
people leave your organization i'm at to

1109
00:46:29,529 --> 00:46:40,719
update my am<font color="#E5E5E5"> i have new keys but that's</font>

1110
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:43,049
better<font color="#E5E5E5"> than not doing that okay really</font>

1111
00:46:40,719 --> 00:46:45,759
quickly let's talk about Napoli and

1112
00:46:43,049 --> 00:46:50,259
security groups Naples and I spent a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot</font>

1113
00:46:45,759 --> 00:46:51,489
of time on these are stateless these are

1114
00:46:50,259 --> 00:46:54,910
stateless that can have them inbound

1115
00:46:51,489 --> 00:46:57,339
outbound I'm limited<font color="#CCCCCC"> to 20 per subnet 20</font>

1116
00:46:54,910 --> 00:46:58,868
inbound 20 outbound since they're

1117
00:46:57,339 --> 00:47:00,459
stateless I have to open<font color="#CCCCCC"> up the</font>

1118
00:46:58,869 --> 00:47:02,199
ephemeral port it's not going to be a

1119
00:47:00,459 --> 00:47:03,489
great solution for me but don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> lose</font>

1120
00:47:02,199 --> 00:47:07,749
hope yet let's look look at security

1121
00:47:03,489 --> 00:47:11,039
groups<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok nackles we like we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> save or at</font>

1122
00:47:07,749 --> 00:47:13,839
the subnet level at security groups

1123
00:47:11,039 --> 00:47:16,689
these are stateful inbound outbound<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

1124
00:47:13,839 --> 00:47:21,009
can apply them to a single instance or a

1125
00:47:16,689 --> 00:47:22,868
group<font color="#E5E5E5"> of instances and AWS put some</font>

1126
00:47:21,009 --> 00:47:24,969
limits on them and it really isn't it

1127
00:47:22,869 --> 00:47:27,369
depends on how many security groups you

1128
00:47:24,969 --> 00:47:28,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">have how many rules you have for</font>

1129
00:47:27,369 --> 00:47:30,179
security group and you have to really

1130
00:47:28,539 --> 00:47:32,999
<font color="#CCCCCC">look at their documentation understand</font>

1131
00:47:30,179 --> 00:47:35,109
how to do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> for how to manage</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1132
00:47:32,999 --> 00:47:36,819
but let's take let's just take a look

1133
00:47:35,109 --> 00:47:39,179
<font color="#CCCCCC">here let's just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do a couple of examples</font>

1134
00:47:36,819 --> 00:47:42,489
right I've got my elastic load balancer

1135
00:47:39,179 --> 00:47:45,429
that expose exposed on the external site

1136
00:47:42,489 --> 00:47:46,959
I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to allow 80 and 443 in from</font>

1137
00:47:45,429 --> 00:47:49,299
anywhere i'm going to allow ping in and

1138
00:47:46,959 --> 00:47:51,910
anywhere<font color="#CCCCCC"> else and anything else</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> when</font>

1139
00:47:49,299 --> 00:47:54,969
didn't die with my security group<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can</font>

1140
00:47:51,910 --> 00:47:57,129
say hey i don't want my elastic load

1141
00:47:54,969 --> 00:47:59,170
balancers going to my app servers

1142
00:47:57,130 --> 00:48:01,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">without going through my lap so I</font>

1143
00:47:59,170 --> 00:48:03,999
created a<font color="#CCCCCC"> a rule that only allows that</font>

1144
00:48:01,989 --> 00:48:06,099
those to talk to my lap with application

1145
00:48:03,999 --> 00:48:09,339
firewalls this gives us very granular

1146
00:48:06,099 --> 00:48:11,759
control a network layer of who can talk

1147
00:48:09,339 --> 00:48:14,109
to who within my within my application

1148
00:48:11,759 --> 00:48:17,019
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to skip the laughs I'm</font>

1149
00:48:14,109 --> 00:48:19,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to jump right down into my</font>

1150
00:48:17,019 --> 00:48:20,890
application servers and I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1151
00:48:19,359 --> 00:48:21,490
allow my application servers to talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1152
00:48:20,890 --> 00:48:24,069
my own data

1153
00:48:21,490 --> 00:48:25,868
cases obviously and I can call I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

1154
00:48:24,070 --> 00:48:27,580
have to call these out by IP address I

1155
00:48:25,869 --> 00:48:30,190
can call<font color="#CCCCCC"> them out by security group name</font>

1156
00:48:27,580 --> 00:48:32,110
so i don't have to say app servers of

1157
00:48:30,190 --> 00:48:33,700
this you know are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be able</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> aoud</font>

1158
00:48:32,110 --> 00:48:35,320
to talk to these IP addresses I and say

1159
00:48:33,700 --> 00:48:38,230
anybody that's in the database security

1160
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:40,210
group they can<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk to right and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I can</font>

1161
00:48:38,230 --> 00:48:42,070
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> my database security group spawn</font>

1162
00:48:40,210 --> 00:48:45,180
both availability zones so that I don't

1163
00:48:42,070 --> 00:48:48,130
have to create<font color="#E5E5E5"> one per availability zone</font>

1164
00:48:45,180 --> 00:48:53,529
so some great capabilities there as far

1165
00:48:48,130 --> 00:48:56,410
as writing network controls a couple

1166
00:48:53,530 --> 00:48:58,960
last notes right the bastion host that's

1167
00:48:56,410 --> 00:49:00,520
if I don't have a VPN connection from my

1168
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:02,250
network or anything like that I have

1169
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:04,960
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> batch and total sitting out there</font>

1170
00:49:02,250 --> 00:49:05,920
when I splenda not before it took you

1171
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:08,230
guys that are all familiar with this

1172
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:10,060
within five minutes people<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to log</font>

1173
00:49:08,230 --> 00:49:11,590
into that right if you don't need the

1174
00:49:10,060 --> 00:49:13,330
bastion host you don't need to miss for

1175
00:49:11,590 --> 00:49:14,740
anything you can just turn it off you

1176
00:49:13,330 --> 00:49:19,060
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> put</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it in a stopped state vintage</font>

1177
00:49:14,740 --> 00:49:20,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's not there but let's let's take this</font>

1178
00:49:19,060 --> 00:49:22,990
may be one step further right is there

1179
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:25,330
such a thing as cloud<font color="#E5E5E5"> nirvana where</font>

1180
00:49:22,990 --> 00:49:27,609
nobody needs to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have access to my</font>

1181
00:49:25,330 --> 00:49:29,230
environment I see a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of posts out</font>

1182
00:49:27,609 --> 00:49:31,960
there on the internet they say

1183
00:49:29,230 --> 00:49:33,880
everything in my environment needs to be

1184
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:36,340
automated it has to be automated in

1185
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:38,410
order for me to be able to scale at that

1186
00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:41,290
point who really needs to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1187
00:49:38,410 --> 00:49:45,129
access<font color="#CCCCCC"> my pradhan Viron one blogger</font>

1188
00:49:41,290 --> 00:49:46,990
talked about how if he s as to<font color="#CCCCCC"> ssh</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

1189
00:49:45,130 --> 00:49:49,000
an instance to start doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

1190
00:49:46,990 --> 00:49:51,399
configuration he has to see says<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font>

1191
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:53,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing this wrong what do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i need to do to</font>

1192
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:55,540
automate this right that's from an

1193
00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:57,310
operational standpoint right from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1194
00:49:55,540 --> 00:49:59,710
security standpoint that gives us a lot

1195
00:49:57,310 --> 00:50:01,810
of extra assurances as well but my pride

1196
00:49:59,710 --> 00:50:04,090
environments that<font color="#E5E5E5"> out there I don't have</font>

1197
00:50:01,810 --> 00:50:05,830
to worry about my admins being able to

1198
00:50:04,090 --> 00:50:07,930
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> into that and do things right I have</font>

1199
00:50:05,830 --> 00:50:11,940
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> manage the processes around that but</font>

1200
00:50:07,930 --> 00:50:14,470
not that instance itself those that that

1201
00:50:11,940 --> 00:50:17,080
environment itself if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can do that if I</font>

1202
00:50:14,470 --> 00:50:20,618
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> that automation put in place I also</font>

1203
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:25,020
can now spin up take that exact thing

1204
00:50:20,619 --> 00:50:27,670
spin up a test environment spin up a new

1205
00:50:25,020 --> 00:50:29,280
environment out in Africa or wherever

1206
00:50:27,670 --> 00:50:31,630
else I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start doing businesses</font>

1207
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:32,680
all automated I can probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1208
00:50:31,630 --> 00:50:34,630
within

1209
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:38,190
minutes right or that the worst-case

1210
00:50:34,630 --> 00:50:42,339
hours bring up a whole new environment

1211
00:50:38,190 --> 00:50:43,900
so additional resources amazon has a

1212
00:50:42,339 --> 00:50:47,020
whole bunch of<font color="#E5E5E5"> security white papers</font>

1213
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:51,160
they're updating these constantly if you

1214

1223
00:51:12,490 --> 00:51:17,229
