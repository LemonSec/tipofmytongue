what I was going to go over I love

24
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:10,110
network security monitoring it's what I

25
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:11,850
do for a living so so first off I<font color="#E5E5E5"> got to</font>

categories cover everybody and that's

39
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">what I really like about honey pot so</font>

40
00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:43,860
you don't have to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a ton of</font>

41
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:48,539
experience to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get into them and you</font>

42
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:50,399
could learn<font color="#E5E5E5"> a heck of a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them so</font>

43
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:51,930
I'm talking I'm talking to the noobs

44
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:53,939
that was their first security con

45
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:57,090
b-sides last year was my very first

46
00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:59,008
security con and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> remember I was amazed</font>

47
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:00,960
by<font color="#CCCCCC"> all I still have but i would just</font>

48
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:02,520
remember my mind being blown by every

49
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,729
talk that I listened<font color="#CCCCCC"> to it besides last</font>

50
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:07,210
year I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

51
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:09,759
do that no way anyway it's also kind of

52
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:12,310
depressing because it's like oh I<font color="#E5E5E5"> fight</font>

53
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:16,090
you guys for a living and yet you're way

54
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:17,470
ahead of me in the game so anyway also

55
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:19,450
those looking to get into the honey pot

56
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:21,490
/ threat intelligence communities and

57
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:25,060
those that may already have experienced

58
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:27,220
honey potting what I really like it I

59
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:29,290
love<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking to other people that have</font>

60
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:31,990
experience with honey pots that do their

61
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:34,269
own research on<font color="#E5E5E5"> them because we always</font>

62
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:35,710
bounce ideas off of each other I always

63
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:38,830
learned something new almost every time

64
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:40,450
I talk to somebody I'm actually I'm

65
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:44,110
actually doing some research with a

66
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:46,269
group that there's let's see I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

67
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:49,420
there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> like 18 19 of us and we're all</font>

68
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:51,220
collectively doing we have a ton of

69
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:53,739
honey pots collectively and we're doing

70
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:55,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">research I think we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 40 house</font>

71
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:59,170
now and I'll talk a little bit about

<font color="#CCCCCC">its true like Who am I to stand up a ton</font>

112
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:48,160
of vulnerable hosts and then say oh I'm

getting attacked from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the from this IP</font>

114
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:52,090
with this malware and you should watch

00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:54,430
out for it like that's not real threat

116

really like<font color="#E5E5E5"> this meme as well bred</font>

119
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:06,130
intelligence it's just a stupid RSS feed

120
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,620
found it on Twitter I had to do some

121
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:12,909
editing there was another<font color="#CCCCCC"> word in there</font>

122

sure some of you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys sought anyway it</font>

123
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:16,840
threat intelligence has become one of

124
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:19,510
those buzzwords that you hear and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

125
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:20,710
already<font color="#E5E5E5"> said it like 20 times so you I'm</font>

127
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:27,669
some drinks but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> almost like cloud</font>

128
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:31,419
and big data heartbleed you know there's

129
00:05:27,669 --> 00:05:38,320
some more drinks go for it anyway but

130
00:05:31,419 --> 00:05:40,510
it's it honey potting can lead to high

131
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:43,390
integrity<font color="#CCCCCC"> thread</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> intelligence if you put</font>

00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:20,759
this threat intelligence but it's unless

146
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:23,099
<font color="#CCCCCC">you're willing to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pay a ton of money</font>

147
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:26,160
it's never really targeted threat

148
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:27,479
intelligence right it's never it you you

149
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,130
may have a completely<font color="#E5E5E5"> different</font>

environment than the environment<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

151
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:35,190
they're that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're monitoring right</font>

152
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:37,740
head<font color="#E5E5E5"> them out maybe there mate maybe</font>

153
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:39,169
they're selling you<font color="#E5E5E5"> Intel for windows</font>

154
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:42,630
malware and maybe you got an entire

155
00:06:39,169 --> 00:06:45,330
Linux environment you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know or vice versa</font>

156
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:46,650
or whatever it may be it's it's

<font color="#E5E5E5">oftentimes very hard to get some</font>

158
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:53,549
tailored intelligence this article

159
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:56,159
showed up in dark reading it was like

160
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:57,570
two years ago but it was a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a</font>

161
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,389
good article five reasons why every

162
00:06:57,570 --> 00:07:02,550
company should have a honey pot and and

163
00:07:00,389 --> 00:07:06,300
it just<font color="#E5E5E5"> goes through and it talks about</font>

164
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:07,889
how that you can like what I was<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

165
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:11,729
saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can get tailored intelligence</font>

166
00:07:07,889 --> 00:07:15,030
you stand up a host<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is vulnerable</font>

167
00:07:11,729 --> 00:07:17,070
and you could go in there and if you do

168
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:18,869
it right and you don't make it<font color="#E5E5E5"> obvious</font>

169
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:22,139
that it's a honey pot and they actually

170
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:23,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">try</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and exploit your network your you</font>

171
00:07:22,139 --> 00:07:25,110
could have an entire honey network and

172
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:27,389
have multiple boxes that they can pivot

173
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:31,050
to and exploit and stuff you're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

174
00:07:27,389 --> 00:07:33,539
be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see what kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of attackers</font>

175
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:37,650
are specifically targeting your company

176
00:07:33,539 --> 00:07:39,900
or or whatever it may be right and and

177
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:42,359
once and then also if they are targeting

178
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:44,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">you you'll be able to see what they do</font>

179
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:46,830
when they get<font color="#E5E5E5"> in what what it what are</font>

180
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:48,599
they trying to accomplish now<font color="#CCCCCC"> there I</font>

181
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:50,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">mean don't get me wrong there's tons of</font>

182
00:07:48,599 --> 00:07:52,710
cyber criminals out there that don't

183
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,969
necessarily have a target<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess</font>

184
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:55,620
they're not cyber criminals and more

185
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:56,940
script kiddies but then they're just

186
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:59,159
scanning the entire internet trying to

187
00:07:56,940 --> 00:08:01,050
find vulnerable vulnerable boxes and pop

188
00:07:59,159 --> 00:08:02,909
as many boxes as they can then brag

189
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:07,620
about it on Twitter and call it

190
00:08:02,909 --> 00:08:13,710
hacktivism but thanks for the sympathy

191
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:15,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">laugh whoever anyway so yeah I i would</font>

192
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:16,590
highly recommend a honeypot so let's go

193
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:17,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">through the different types</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of honey</font>

194
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:20,630
pots

195
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:24,510
how many of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys have ever heard of</font>

196
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:25,950
honey drive okay we got<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> few in the</font>

197
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:29,219
room how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> have actually deployed it</font>

198
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:32,309
any of you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys you back there what do</font>

199
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:37,080
you think it's sweet what<font color="#CCCCCC"> do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you what do</font>

200
00:08:32,309 --> 00:08:39,329
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> like about it yeah it's true that's</font>

201
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:44,340
very very true or do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have multiple</font>

202
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:46,380
instances of it or now tell me this did

203
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:48,690
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have multiple of the honey pots</font>

204
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:52,860
running at the same time on there<font color="#CCCCCC"> or did</font>

205
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:54,960
you kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of alternate just one or the</font>

206
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:57,120
other<font color="#CCCCCC"> see and that's kind of a honey</font>

207
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:58,770
honey drive is really so hold on let me

208
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,540
tell you what honey drive is first of

209
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:01,980
all it's a it's a Linux they call it a

210
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:03,420
distro but really it's just<font color="#CCCCCC"> DuPont 2</font>

211
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:07,530
with a ton of honey pots pre-installed

212
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:10,260
on to it and you deploy that you deploy

213
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:14,220
the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISO and it comes pre-installed</font>

214
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:15,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> kippo died on the way I forget eyes</font>

215
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:18,450
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the house announced that honey d</font>

216
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:21,140
glass top F<font color="#CCCCCC"> con-con pot thug and it also</font>

217
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:23,370
comes with some visualization

218
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:27,750
applications such as<font color="#CCCCCC"> kippa graph honey</font>

219
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:29,550
deep is Diane<font color="#CCCCCC"> Anand away I'm sorry</font>

220
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:32,840
whoever the developer<font color="#CCCCCC"> is I'm totally</font>

221
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:37,459
butchering the name and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Elks elk stack</font>

222
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:39,690
anyway so my beef<font color="#CCCCCC"> with honey drive is</font>

223
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:42,180
it's super super<font color="#CCCCCC"> good if you're just</font>

224
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:44,340
trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get into the scene and and</font>

225
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:47,839
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably hope who they tailored</font>

226
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:51,750
it towards<font color="#CCCCCC"> were people like that but if</font>

227
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:56,880
you have if you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> port 22 and port 80</font>

228
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:58,260
and 443 import 123<font color="#E5E5E5"> and 53 open all open</font>

229
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,850
on one IP address and they're all

230
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:01,890
exploitable and they're super easy to

231
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:05,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">get into they're going to know that</font>

232
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:07,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're in a honeypot right the that so</font>

233
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:09,780
so your net they realistically you're

234
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:12,720
never going to run every single one of

235
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:16,020
those at the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> time and honestly like</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">I said it's an ubuntu distro so a lot of</font>

242
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:33,339
some boxes that only have 250

243
00:10:31,209 --> 00:10:35,258
six mega RAM I've been tinkering with

244
00:10:33,339 --> 00:10:38,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">the idea of running up trying to get it</font>

245
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:40,959
to run excuse me on some boxes that only

246
00:10:38,439 --> 00:10:42,670
have 128<font color="#CCCCCC"> Megson ramp</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I was talking to</font>

247
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:45,459
the developer and he said that that

248
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:48,790
would be pushing pushing it a little but

249
00:10:45,459 --> 00:10:50,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">I want to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> try it nonetheless so honey</font>

250
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:51,459
drive I would recommend<font color="#CCCCCC"> it if you're</font>

251
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:53,439
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get in the scene because like</font>

252
00:10:51,459 --> 00:10:55,118
he said all the hard work is done it

253
00:10:53,439 --> 00:10:59,769
kind of the all the honey pots are

254
00:10:55,119 --> 00:11:05,470
installed you just gotta do<font color="#CCCCCC"> / start Sh</font>

255
00:10:59,769 --> 00:11:07,480
and there you<font color="#E5E5E5"> go so so there are low</font>

256
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:11,589
interaction and high interaction honey

257
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:13,929
pots and each have their purposes low

258
00:11:11,589 --> 00:11:16,800
interaction is typically a simulation

259
00:11:13,929 --> 00:11:20,709
it's probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> like a virtual environment</font>

260
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:22,029
with incomplete functionality for

261
00:11:20,709 --> 00:11:23,439
instance if you hop on and we're going

262
00:11:22,029 --> 00:11:24,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">to go over a lot of this here in a</font>

263
00:11:23,439 --> 00:11:27,519
little bit but you won't be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> run</font>

264
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:30,279
all the commands<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you normally would</font>

265
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:33,100
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to on if it was a Windows host</font>

266
00:11:30,279 --> 00:11:36,429
or Linux or whatever it is you can't

267
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:37,959
can't really be used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to exploit other</font>

268
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:39,189
vulnerabilities because you don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

269
00:11:37,959 --> 00:11:41,319
whole lot of functionality in there

270
00:11:39,189 --> 00:11:42,399
unless they learn<font color="#CCCCCC"> how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to pop the honey</font>

271
00:11:41,319 --> 00:11:43,569
unless<font color="#E5E5E5"> they know that they're in the</font>

272
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:45,129
honey pot and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> they learn</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to pop</font>

273
00:11:43,569 --> 00:11:48,699
the honey pot than your host is screwed

274
00:11:45,129 --> 00:11:51,730
right then they could<font color="#E5E5E5"> take over that</font>

275
00:11:48,699 --> 00:11:55,149
whole network anyway used to observe

276
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:58,029
behavior right so a script<font color="#E5E5E5"> katie gets in</font>

277
00:11:55,149 --> 00:11:59,649
he download some malware you go in you

278
00:11:58,029 --> 00:12:02,230
could reverse reverse engineer that

279
00:11:59,649 --> 00:12:04,420
malware there were a couple really good

280
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:07,089
malware talks at this conference that i

281
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:10,118
went to i would<font color="#E5E5E5"> highly recommend going</font>

282
00:12:07,089 --> 00:12:12,220
back and looking at them i i've recently

283
00:12:10,119 --> 00:12:15,730
gotten into malware analysis however<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font>

284
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:19,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">still such a noob at it but those talks</font>

285
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:21,459
got me really excited about it it's an

286
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:24,670
example<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a low interaction honeypot</font>

287
00:12:21,459 --> 00:12:26,559
would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> kippo and then there's also</font>

288
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:28,389
high interaction where high interaction

289
00:12:26,559 --> 00:12:31,689
is an actual machine they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

290
00:12:28,389 --> 00:12:33,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">have full capability and somehow you're</font>

291
00:12:31,689 --> 00:12:35,259
either like tapping the line of all and

292
00:12:33,819 --> 00:12:36,729
<font color="#CCCCCC">getting all the traffic that's going to</font>

293
00:12:35,259 --> 00:12:39,819
that box or whether you have some sort

294
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:41,199
of proxy that's decrypting the traffic

295
00:12:39,819 --> 00:12:42,639
if it's encrypted or just picking it up

296
00:12:41,199 --> 00:12:44,709
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> logging it all and sending it back</font>

297
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:47,500
to you somehow a

298
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:49,870
I haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen a ton of these developed</font>

299
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:52,150
unless it's like I would imagine if it

300
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:55,030
was like<font color="#E5E5E5"> in house like it like a big</font>

301
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:57,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">Enterprise they they threw out they</font>

302
00:12:55,030 --> 00:13:00,160
duplicated their web server and then

303
00:12:57,130 --> 00:13:01,900
just tap the line and made that that

304
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:05,350
particular IP address vulnerable and

305
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:07,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">whatnot there's a lot of ways that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

306
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:09,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">could go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about doing it they're used</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

307
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:12,120
absorb targeted attacks you're going to

308
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:15,880
get a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> higher integrity threat Intel</font>

309
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:18,550
from from that and they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not supposed</font>

310
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:22,450
to be easily detectable and at<font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font>

311
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:23,859
example is of one<font color="#E5E5E5"> that actually it's an</font>

312
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:26,320
alpha testing right now it's called

313
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:29,320
Bifrost I was really<font color="#CCCCCC"> hoping to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> try and</font>

314
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:30,880
get it deployed before b-sides so I can

315
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:33,370
talk a little bit about it<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I have</font>

316
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:36,910
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> been able to yet but i will probably</font>

317
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:40,060
blog about it when<font color="#CCCCCC"> i do so if you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> guys</font>

318
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:42,069
want to check out that out so capo let's

319
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:43,390
go<font color="#E5E5E5"> over kit boat like i said</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this isn't</font>

320
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:45,070
this is the one that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> running</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

321
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:46,990
currently have five host running hippo<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

322
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:48,280
had six but then one completely got

323
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:51,100
hosed and I didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have time to get it</font>

324
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:52,930
back up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and running before</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> besides and</font>

325
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:55,300
it was not because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I got pwned it just</font>

326
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:57,520
the hard drive failed I was running it

327
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:59,020
on my home network by the way if you run

328
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:00,520
and on your home network I was<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

329
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:02,560
running honey drive so maybe honey drive

330
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:04,360
did it anyway if you run<font color="#E5E5E5"> it on your home</font>

331
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:07,329
network make sure you firewall that

332
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:09,580
sucker<font color="#E5E5E5"> and make make sure that it cannot</font>

333
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:12,130
get out to your actual home network

334
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:13,960
because that would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be very bad</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I would</font>

335
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:17,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">recommend Indian firewall or pfsense</font>

336
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:19,750
anyway hippo is a medium interaction<font color="#CCCCCC"> ssh</font>

337
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:21,880
honeypot designed to log brute force

338
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:23,320
attacks and most importantly the entire

339
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:27,070
shell interaction performed by the

340
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:32,440
attacker that's straight from the github

341
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:35,860
the capo github bike it says it logs the

342
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:37,540
entire shell session right there and it

343
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:39,490
sends<font color="#E5E5E5"> it back to analog there are</font>

344
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:41,530
several tools that you could use<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

345
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:43,120
visible visualization that will kick

346
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:45,490
back the logs to you and show you

347
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,750
exactly what the attacker did and you

348
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:49,150
can see if it tried<font color="#CCCCCC"> to download it</font>

349
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:51,430
malware or fee trying to download an

350
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:53,500
entire windows iso and totally hosed

351
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:55,780
your entire machine that's if you're

352
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:58,630
running small<font color="#E5E5E5"> on small boxes that which</font>

353
00:14:55,780 --> 00:15:02,900
has happened to me before so

354
00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:05,029
anyway so<font color="#E5E5E5"> how Kipple works does anybody</font>

355
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:08,150
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> familiar with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Kip oh how many</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

356
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:09,980
you have had you skip bo<font color="#E5E5E5"> youtube</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

357
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:13,699
<font color="#CCCCCC">we're you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> guys</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> familiar with how it</font>

358
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:17,990
works yeah so basically hippo<font color="#CCCCCC"> just runs</font>

359
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:20,990
in a virtual<font color="#E5E5E5"> Python environment and it</font>

360
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:25,520
simulates a debian<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think it's a debian</font>

361
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:28,850
five or maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> w in six box and and it's</font>

362
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:31,579
it's programmed to respond to the basic

363
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:36,589
linux commands such as LS pain ifconfig

364
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:39,740
you name<font color="#CCCCCC"> PS all your basics has admin</font>

365
00:15:36,589 --> 00:15:42,650
stuff it's it's a it's programmed to

366
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:44,600
respond to that but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

367
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:47,569
the outputs of that command of all of

368
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:50,089
those commands are static so it's really

369
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:51,680
easy to tell if it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> Kip oh they're just</font>

370
00:15:50,089 --> 00:15:54,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">sitting there just sitting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in a file</font>

371
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:58,819
that the script calls and just outputs

372
00:15:54,230 --> 00:16:00,770
that file right so so and we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> get into</font>

373
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:03,530
how easy it is to detect also you could

374
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:06,710
it depends<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a file called the FS</font>

375
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:09,319
pickle file which is what simulates the

376
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:12,020
file<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Debian file system</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and you can</font>

377
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:14,960
create your<font color="#CCCCCC"> own FS pickle file pretty</font>

378
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:19,730
easily I did mine in like two minutes

379
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:22,190
and I'll go over how to do that too ok

380
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:24,080
so how to detect hippo this is these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

381
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:27,260
some fun interesting example so you'll

382
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:29,510
see<font color="#CCCCCC"> here in the top the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> top right you'll</font>

383
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:32,839
see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the server prompt the command</font>

384
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:34,610
prompt is root at server 03 that is the

385
00:16:32,839 --> 00:16:38,330
prompt for kippo right out of the box so

386
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:40,640
if you do not change anything and the

387
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:43,190
hippo is so widespread<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's so many</font>

388
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:45,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">house on the internet that anybody's</font>

389
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:46,760
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> log in sea route at server 03</font>

390
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:47,930
and they're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> hop right out like</font>

391
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:52,430
that is the first thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I would</font>

392
00:16:47,930 --> 00:16:54,560
change if I were you also you'll see

393
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:56,689
below<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I was able to ping nein nein</font>

394
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:59,270
nein nein nein nein nein nein nein nein

395
00:16:56,690 --> 00:17:05,569
nein nein and it somehow resolved to<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2 3</font>

396
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:07,910
6 203 so and you'll also notice that I

397
00:17:05,569 --> 00:17:08,250
actually I had the count flag on there

398
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:10,740
too

399
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:12,900
only send three packets at sent six so

400
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:15,319
until I and I actually had to<font color="#E5E5E5"> stop it i</font>

401
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:19,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">think that's ctrl-c somewhere in there</font>

402
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:21,780
anyway<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then also</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i have config so it</font>

403
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:24,839
was actually meta cortex that pointed

404
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:27,329
this out to me if you do an ayah so

405
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:28,770
you'll see here<font color="#CCCCCC"> i did an ifconfig twice</font>

406
00:17:27,329 --> 00:17:32,010
and those of you who aren't familiar

407
00:17:28,770 --> 00:17:34,560
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> i have configured it shows you your</font>

408
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:41,160
network status your IP address your mac

409
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:43,620
address and here at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> bottom it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> has</font>

410
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:46,080
the RX bikes and bites and TX bites and

411
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:49,139
if you're logged in via ssh to a box if

412
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:52,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">you did I have config twice those should</font>

413
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:54,780
change but you'll see they<font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't so</font>

414
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:56,910
that's also a super<font color="#CCCCCC"> easy way there's a</font>

415
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:58,200
ton of other easy ways to and we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font>

416
00:17:56,910 --> 00:18:03,540
a little bit up about as it goes on

417
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:05,250
there's several<font color="#E5E5E5"> metasploit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> metasploit</font>

418
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:08,790
modules that will detect it before the

419
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:10,470
user even logs in before logging I'm not

420
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:13,379
so I'm not nearly smart enough to know

421
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:16,110
how exactly that works a friend of mine

422
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:18,120
andrew morris he does a lot of work with

423
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:21,959
<font color="#CCCCCC">Kip oh and he actually wrote the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> most</font>

424
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:24,899
recent<font color="#CCCCCC"> one and that one has since been</font>

425
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:27,870
patched<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was going to pull up his blog</font>

426
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:29,310
article about that but his blog is down

427
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:35,070
for some<font color="#CCCCCC"> reason so when it comes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> back up</font>

428
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:36,899
i'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> tweet it out or something yeah so</font>

429
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:39,409
there's some really really simple ways

430
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:41,970
to hide kippo make it less detectable

431
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:45,600
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> said the first thing i do is i</font>

432
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:47,940
change that<font color="#E5E5E5"> hostname add a login banner</font>

433
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:50,240
so when I first deployed kippo and I was

434
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:52,770
getting ready and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> first time</font>

435
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:55,230
and I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to gather all this data</font>

436
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:56,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">and research I just deployed it right</font>

437
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:59,640
out of the box i didn't change anything

438
00:18:56,610 --> 00:19:02,399
just default settings I didn't have a

439
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:04,140
single<font color="#E5E5E5"> well I had some successful logins</font>

440
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,400
but they they logged in then hopped

441
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:07,290
right back out right they didn't even

442
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:10,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">run any commands because they were so</font>

443
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:12,720
obviously there's a hippo box i added a

444
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:17,310
login banner change the hostname like

445
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:19,640
within an hour i had i had i had

446
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:21,690
scripted malware attacks coming in

447
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:24,900
and they were trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to download</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

448
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:27,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">this stuff and really cool so so just</font>

449
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:30,080
those two while there's it's still not

450
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:33,530
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be incredibly high integrity</font>

451
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:37,050
malware or threat Intel they do a lot

452
00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:39,300
edit the user DB text the user DB text

453
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:41,430
file so what capo depends on for the

454
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:44,340
credentials right out of the box it

455
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:47,940
accepts well depending on what for keep

456
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:50,580
pull from but the original one accepted

457
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:52,550
only<font color="#E5E5E5"> routes as the username and then one</font>

458
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:56,250
two three<font color="#E5E5E5"> four five six is the password</font>

459
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:59,580
then the most the most<font color="#E5E5E5"> commonly used</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

460
00:19:56,250 --> 00:20:02,640
cup kippo now accepts anything but that

461
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:04,230
combination that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> also a super</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> easy way</font>

462
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,910
to detect if you're in a honey box if it

463
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:08,220
accepted two different credentials for

464
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:09,930
the same user or two different<font color="#E5E5E5"> passwords</font>

465
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:12,270
for the same user<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that's a red flag</font>

466
00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:13,740
right change the file system so there's

467
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:19,860
a really sit there is a really<font color="#CCCCCC"> awesome</font>

468
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:24,090
script called create FS<font color="#E5E5E5"> pie basically so</font>

469
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:25,560
and and it will take any mounted any

470
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:27,899
amounts at hard drive any mounted file

471
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:29,310
system and it will create the<font color="#E5E5E5"> FSF pickle</font>

472
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:31,190
file out of it so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just fun up in</font>

473
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:35,909
Ubuntu VM that was serving up some dns

474
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:37,290
and ran that script and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had a new FSF</font>

475
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:40,020
a profile and all<font color="#E5E5E5"> sudden my capo</font>

476
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:42,810
instance was was simulating an ubuntu

477
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:47,280
box on how the debian box that can do a

478
00:20:42,810 --> 00:20:49,710
lot however it<font color="#CCCCCC"> I now get into this it's</font>

479
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:53,220
arguable if changing the file system is

480
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:55,950
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> what it really helps you because</font>

481
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:58,350
so much of its scripted edit that etsy

482
00:20:55,950 --> 00:21:00,210
password and the etsy shadow files and

483
00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:03,810
edit the script output edit the ifconfig

484
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:07,430
output edit the PS output that's another

485
00:21:03,810 --> 00:21:09,750
thing the PS output is is a static and

486
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:11,940
we all know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the PDF output should</font>

487
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:13,260
be changing if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you it processes are</font>

488
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:18,210
always ending and running and everything

489
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:20,640
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so this is this is the exciting</font>

490
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:23,850
part here<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to go into my</font>

491
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:27,690
findings what I found like I said<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have</font>

492
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:29,580
been running five hippo boxes for a

493
00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:31,110
couple of months now<font color="#E5E5E5"> well I spun some</font>

494
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:34,860
blow up at different times but

495
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:36,540
doing it for a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> here I I just</font>

496
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:39,240
find really cheap hosting you're a

497
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:42,500
really cheap VPS and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I buy it and then I</font>

498
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:46,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">just I throat hit bow on it and and then</font>

499
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:49,170
make my modifications and and observe so

500
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:54,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">I have I have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two in the United States</font>

501
00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:57,080
to in Canada and one in Europe and these

502
00:21:54,450 --> 00:22:00,030
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> my two two boxes they're both in LA</font>

503
00:21:57,080 --> 00:22:02,669
you'll see that the top graph so they us

504
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:05,460
these are graphs of login attempts

505
00:22:02,670 --> 00:22:09,840
versus<font color="#E5E5E5"> login successes the blue is login</font>

506
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:11,460
attempts the yellow is login successes

507
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:14,370
there's a whole lot more blue than

508
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:16,740
yellow right so you'll see the top one

509
00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:20,070
hat this is this is over the past 30

510
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:21,360
days so from I pulled these last night

511
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:23,809
at like two in the morning of this

512
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:28,409
morning I like two in the morning and

513
00:22:23,809 --> 00:22:30,990
you'll see that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's at the top one has</font>

514
00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:33,090
had five hundred and what in 19 total

515
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:36,390
attempts and<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten successes and the</font>

516
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:39,780
bottom one is at 3924 a total attempts

517
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:42,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">and two successes how does that seem</font>

518
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:49,470
high or low to you guys low why does it

519
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:56,309
seem low who said that wait why is that

520
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:58,260
well yeah so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not gonna lie and I</font>

521
00:22:56,309 --> 00:22:59,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't know what r at that I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> haven't done</font>

522
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:01,710
it I'm had enough time to do enough

523
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:04,260
research to know exactly why those two

524
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:06,419
boxes are getting the data that maybe

525
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:07,590
they've I don't know maybe there's some

526
00:23:06,419 --> 00:23:10,530
underground community and they do

527
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:12,209
they've been flagged as if in flag does

528
00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:17,460
honey pots of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> late I doubt that's</font>

529
00:23:12,210 --> 00:23:18,809
the case anyway but so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bottom one</font>

530
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:19,919
there's only two there's only two

531
00:23:18,809 --> 00:23:23,879
successes though and there's a reason

532
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:27,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">for that so I change the credentials on</font>

533
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:29,970
the one at the bottom graph the one that

534
00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:32,370
had the least amount of successful

535
00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:34,530
logins so the top graph I just left<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

536
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:36,719
at the default route 1 2 3 4<font color="#E5E5E5"> 5 6 and</font>

537
00:23:34,530 --> 00:23:38,250
make it in and a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of times that's a</font>

538
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,780
red flag for people it's like oh that's

539
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:43,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">definitely a honeypot if it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that easy</font>

540
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:48,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">to get into actually you never know</font>

541
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:49,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">wait so I know there's tons of sis</font>

542
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:53,160
admins in here that know exactly what

543
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:55,830
I'm talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the bottom one I</font>

544
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:58,320
change it to only accept a 14 character

545
00:23:55,830 --> 00:24:01,770
password for the root user 14 character

546
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:05,340
password how hard is that to crack it's

547
00:24:01,770 --> 00:24:07,710
crazy crazy hard unless unless you do

548
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:09,000
something my boss is actually really

549
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:10,860
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> good at password cracking and</font>

550
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,450
he's cracked I think he claims to have

551
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:17,399
practice<font color="#E5E5E5"> 16 character passwords and</font>

552
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:19,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">whatnot anyway so I actually you'll see</font>

553
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:21,960
it says<font color="#E5E5E5"> I leaked the the password there</font>

554
00:24:19,530 --> 00:24:24,330
what i did is i leaked the the fortune

555
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:28,200
character password to the honey pot on

556
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:30,149
hey spin just<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see what happened what</font>

557
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:31,799
what would happen<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was just really</font>

558
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:34,320
curious i had a buddy do the same thing

559
00:24:31,799 --> 00:24:36,480
and you'll see that's the format i did

560
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:38,580
it in i just<font color="#E5E5E5"> listed the IP listed the</font>

561
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:40,650
user listed the password and just act

562
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:42,540
and through some leet language in there

563
00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:45,179
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretended like I was a hacktivist</font>

564
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:50,309
that that just phoned this box or

565
00:24:45,179 --> 00:24:52,559
whatever and so I posted that at 114

566
00:24:50,309 --> 00:24:55,139
a.m. mountain standard time any guesses

567
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:58,820
as to how long it took before I get<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

568
00:24:55,140 --> 00:25:02,520
saw log in 30 seconds Wow who said that

569

572
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:17,970
under two minutes that the paste bin had

573
00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:19,830
over 100 views and that just because

574
00:25:17,970 --> 00:25:23,040
there's so many bots mining paceman for

575
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:24,809
credentials right so you guys actually I

576
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:27,120
thought I didn't know anyone was gonna

577
00:25:24,809 --> 00:25:28,710
guess as fast as you guys did but in two

578
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:31,350
hours of 35 minutes I thought that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

579
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:34,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">crazy fast that I saw a successful login</font>

580
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:36,540
and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know I so I saw that 349 from a</font>

581
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:38,418
Romanian IP address that had malicious

582
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:40,740
intent with a 14 character password

583
00:25:38,419 --> 00:25:43,410
logging into a box with malicious intent

584
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:44,760
you know that they saw that link on

585
00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:46,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">basement there's no way that they</font>

586
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:47,970
cracked it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so happens that</font>

587
00:25:46,770 --> 00:25:51,900
cracked in two hours<font color="#CCCCCC"> and 35 minutes</font>

588
00:25:47,970 --> 00:25:53,040
after I after I posted that and that was

589
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:55,890
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> first time I'd ever seen that IP</font>

590
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:59,110
can't comment any of my boxes

591
00:25:55,890 --> 00:26:01,630
like that that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> that slide is wrong I</font>

592
00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:05,530
said it had over a hundred views in two

593
00:26:01,630 --> 00:26:07,180
minutes I saw five different logins from

594
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:09,399
three distinct IP addresses over the

595
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:12,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">course of 12 hours</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and then I didn't see</font>

596
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:15,550
any more Intel just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like last week I got</font>

597
00:26:12,010 --> 00:26:17,890
two more log into that box<font color="#E5E5E5"> but that so</font>

598
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:20,110
the the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> two IP addresses they were</font>

599
00:26:17,890 --> 00:26:22,690
just they had like no malicious intent

600
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:24,879
they just hopped on the box or like yeah

601
00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:27,010
look at me I'm so awesome i'm on a box

602
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:32,770
somebody else with box you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know so i</font>

603
00:26:27,010 --> 00:26:36,900
made this meme in their honor whoever

604
00:26:32,770 --> 00:26:36,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">you guys are that's what i think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of you</font>

607
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:48,010
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my stats login attempts versus</font>

608
00:26:46,090 --> 00:26:50,199
successes in the past 30 days on two

609
00:26:48,010 --> 00:26:53,080
boxes I having Canada what first<font color="#E5E5E5"> off</font>

610
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:59,590
what stands out to those two graphs see

611
00:26:53,080 --> 00:27:05,199
you guys boom yeah and that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is what we</font>

612
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:08,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">call a hosting problem you get what you</font>

613
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:12,250
pay for cloud it<font color="#E5E5E5"> costs super cheap but</font>

614
00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:13,750
you get what you pay for right so these

615
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:16,750
boxes were actually seeing super steady

616
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:18,490
attacks and so look so rather than<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

617
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:22,090
this being 30 day data this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is more like</font>

618
00:27:18,490 --> 00:27:25,240
15 day data or so I didn't look exactly

619
00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:28,629
but anyway the top one had<font color="#CCCCCC"> two 255,000</font>

620
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:30,700
attempts with 79 successes and the

621
00:27:28,630 --> 00:27:34,870
bottom one had 282,000 with zero

622
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:38,350
successes and there's a reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the</font>

623
00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:39,820
zero success one and that and B are

624
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:41,730
these more that who said that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

625
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:44,230
wouldn't expect that low on my other

626
00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:46,510
American boxes yeah is this kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of what</font>

627
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:48,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">you would expect for four total attempts</font>

628
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:50,170
and successes and whatnot yeah this is I

629
00:27:48,190 --> 00:27:52,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">mean there are like I said there are</font>

630
00:27:50,170 --> 00:27:54,370
people from<font color="#CCCCCC"> all over the world not it</font>

631
00:27:52,810 --> 00:27:56,989
believe it or not it doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> just happen</font>

632
00:27:54,370 --> 00:28:03,449
in China happens elsewhere

633
00:27:56,989 --> 00:28:06,570
yes brute yeah yeah exactly that

634
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:10,529
actually type in a password username and

635
00:28:06,570 --> 00:28:12,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">a password if I did scans oh my gosh the</font>

636
00:28:10,529 --> 00:28:15,869
number would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be way bigger than this way</font>

637
00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:17,190
bigger I think last I checked I one of

638
00:28:15,869 --> 00:28:19,289
<font color="#CCCCCC">my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> honey pots was like averaging like</font>

639
00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:23,999
40,000 scans a day or<font color="#E5E5E5"> something like</font>

640
00:28:19,289 --> 00:28:25,350
that I could get<font color="#E5E5E5"> that data for you so</font>

641
00:28:23,999 --> 00:28:27,119
yeah these are actually when I say login

642
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:29,009
attempts they actually enter a username

643
00:28:27,119 --> 00:28:34,918
and a password and either succeeded or

644
00:28:29,009 --> 00:28:37,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">failed so anyway so let's take a look at</font>

645
00:28:34,919 --> 00:28:40,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">why I saw more logins on one than the</font>

646
00:28:37,379 --> 00:28:42,509
other so i changed the user DB text on

647
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:46,109
one and the one on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> top graph I you I</font>

648
00:28:42,509 --> 00:28:50,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">I said it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to only to reject</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the top 100</font>

649
00:28:46,109 --> 00:28:51,899
passwords that I got from a buddy the DA

650
00:28:50,009 --> 00:28:57,929
667 on twitter if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you guys are familiar</font>

651
00:28:51,899 --> 00:29:00,299
with him he lent me<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and and then</font>

652
00:28:57,929 --> 00:29:02,129
combined with the top 10<font color="#E5E5E5"> username so any</font>

653
00:29:00,299 --> 00:29:05,399
combination of those 100 passwords and

654
00:29:02,129 --> 00:29:08,369
10 usernames it just rejected it but

655
00:29:05,399 --> 00:29:10,439
anything else it would take so I'm kind

656
00:29:08,369 --> 00:29:13,080
of running a so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> running a risk there</font>

657
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:14,429
because it's possible to<font color="#CCCCCC"> log in as the</font>

658
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:16,918
same user with two different passwords

659
00:29:14,429 --> 00:29:18,389
right so that but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just doing</font>

660
00:29:16,919 --> 00:29:19,980
research trying to see what kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of data</font>

661
00:29:18,389 --> 00:29:21,600
i get see what different behaviors give

662
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:24,090
me what different actions give me what

663
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:26,309
different behaviors and whatnot<font color="#CCCCCC"> so the</font>

664
00:29:24,090 --> 00:29:29,488
other one only accepts the seven

665
00:29:26,309 --> 00:29:31,559
character password from five different

666
00:29:29,489 --> 00:29:36,179
usernames so it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> user</font>

667
00:29:31,559 --> 00:29:38,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">names</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are like root ftp and like John</font>

668
00:29:36,179 --> 00:29:40,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">and Bob or something like that I don't</font>

669
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:42,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">know any way I could go in and look but</font>

670
00:29:40,049 --> 00:29:44,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's a seven character password I had a</font>

671
00:29:42,210 --> 00:29:46,169
thought I had like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a six character</font>

672
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:50,340
password on another box and it was

673
00:29:46,169 --> 00:29:53,159
cracked and like in like four days but

674
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:58,259
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> one is yet to be cracked I actually</font>

675
00:29:53,159 --> 00:30:01,139
leaked a keylogger dump of an of a vm

676
00:29:58,259 --> 00:30:04,830
that I just span up spun up SS aging

677
00:30:01,139 --> 00:30:06,299
into this honey pot and it and so the

678
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:08,158
<font color="#E5E5E5">keylogger had the creds in there and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

679
00:30:06,299 --> 00:30:10,480
leaked that on pastebin rather than

680
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:11,980
explicitly saying a the

681
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:13,360
to the creds to this IP address i just

682
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:15,490
did the keylogger<font color="#CCCCCC"> dumb</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just to see what</font>

683
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:19,899
I get I<font color="#CCCCCC"> dumped that this morning at 753</font>

684
00:30:15,490 --> 00:30:22,510
still haven't seen anything but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

685
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:25,660
definitely will either tweaked or blog

686
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:27,790
about it when I do also on these two

687
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:29,380
boxes I chip<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is where I change the</font>

688
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:32,350
fs pickle the story that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I told you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

689
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:36,340
I went up an ubuntu box ran that script

690
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:39,399
and and substitute that I'm yet to see

691
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:41,980
any different results but like I<font color="#E5E5E5"> said</font>

692
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:44,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">everything is so scriptlet everybody's</font>

693
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:46,179
scanning the internet all day every day

694
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:48,730
and then as<font color="#E5E5E5"> soon as they get into a box</font>

695
00:30:46,179 --> 00:30:50,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">there so their scan is scripted and then</font>

696
00:30:48,730 --> 00:30:52,090
again into a box and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the execution</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

697
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:53,049
the commands<font color="#E5E5E5"> is all scripted to they</font>

698
00:30:52,090 --> 00:30:57,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> even bother in the file system</font>

699
00:30:53,049 --> 00:31:00,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">mostly and i'll definitely blog about</font>

700
00:30:57,190 --> 00:31:03,190
that as well so so here's my box in

701
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:04,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">europe login attempts to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> vs. successes</font>

702
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:08,140
in the past 30 days I think I stood this

703
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:09,250
one up like a little bit less than<font color="#E5E5E5"> 30</font>

704
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:11,610
days ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that's why you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't see</font>

705
00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:18,549
data right there at the very<font color="#E5E5E5"> beginning</font>

706
00:31:11,610 --> 00:31:22,449

an eight character password um and it's

709
00:31:25,059 --> 00:31:33,610
been and it ya see how to be crack this

710
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:35,860
is in the heart of Europe it is my most

711
00:31:33,610 --> 00:31:37,479
attack box but but I the buddies that

712
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:39,790
I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing research with they have a ton</font>

713
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:48,460
of boxes in Asia and it's not an attack

714
00:31:39,790 --> 00:31:50,320
as much as those boxes<font color="#E5E5E5"> are and just yeah</font>

715
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:52,120
yeah yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have a slide about this at</font>

716
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:55,389
the end<font color="#CCCCCC"> but this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> particular one is a</font>

717
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:57,610
time for VPS EU and i just<font color="#E5E5E5"> paid nine</font>

718
00:31:55,390 --> 00:32:01,179
euros<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten euros which right now the</font>

719
00:31:57,610 --> 00:32:05,110
euros super low so it's a good deal and

720
00:32:01,179 --> 00:32:07,720
I got that for a whole year and and

721
00:32:05,110 --> 00:32:10,689
because it's in it because it's in in

722
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:12,640
Europe I put the login banner in Spanish

723
00:32:10,690 --> 00:32:14,410
because I speak Spanish and I just

724
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:15,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">wanted to see if there was any any</font>

725
00:32:14,410 --> 00:32:18,280
correlation I don't know how I measure

726
00:32:15,790 --> 00:32:22,270
that but it's being having<font color="#E5E5E5"> fun you know</font>

727
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:24,668
so so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what a typical malicious</font>

728
00:32:22,270 --> 00:32:27,668
session looks like

729
00:32:24,669 --> 00:32:30,730
usually they hop in they<font color="#CCCCCC"> W get and curls</font>

730
00:32:27,669 --> 00:32:34,899
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> subscript or executable</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bitch mod</font>

731
00:32:30,730 --> 00:32:36,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">it execute it and delete it ninety-nine</font>

732
00:32:34,899 --> 00:32:39,100
percent of the time<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is all scripted</font>

733
00:32:36,129 --> 00:32:41,889
you can see these attacks the<font color="#CCCCCC"> W get dash</font>

734
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:45,340
C and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then a downloads that script that</font>

735
00:32:41,889 --> 00:32:46,869
1818 script mods it<font color="#E5E5E5"> then runs it this</font>

736
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:50,139
particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> guy didn't try and delete it</font>

737
00:32:46,869 --> 00:32:53,559
but usually<font color="#CCCCCC"> they will hand and they hop</font>

738
00:32:50,139 --> 00:32:56,309
off that's all I do and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a lot</font>

739
00:32:53,559 --> 00:33:01,119
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the time that it's like some</font>

740
00:32:56,309 --> 00:33:02,859
malicious binary or a ton of the time

741
00:33:01,119 --> 00:33:05,949
it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> an IRC bot that they're trying</font>

742
00:33:02,859 --> 00:33:11,139
to executing and and recruit for their

743
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:12,970
botnet which is fun actually learn learn

744
00:33:11,139 --> 00:33:19,508
<font color="#E5E5E5">this tactic from a co-worker is actually</font>

745
00:33:12,970 --> 00:33:21,159
in the room to analyze the IRC to see

746
00:33:19,509 --> 00:33:23,529
what what what server<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're logging to</font>

747
00:33:21,159 --> 00:33:26,019
be our IRC and join that chat room and

748
00:33:23,529 --> 00:33:27,399
see what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going on with chakra that's a</font>

749
00:33:26,019 --> 00:33:30,730
lot of fun sometimes you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could even find</font>

750
00:33:27,399 --> 00:33:34,299
the guy that's running it and I had a I

751
00:33:30,730 --> 00:33:37,960
had a<font color="#E5E5E5"> friend who actually he he logged</font>

752
00:33:34,299 --> 00:33:39,908
into the IRC server he found the guy

753
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:42,399
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was running the botnet and he</font>

754
00:33:39,909 --> 00:33:43,809
convinced him to like shut<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> down it it</font>

755
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:47,369
was a really<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting experience</font>

756
00:33:43,809 --> 00:33:49,539
apparently<font color="#CCCCCC"> is super persuasive over IRC</font>

757
00:33:47,369 --> 00:33:51,220
he's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> good friend I like him a lot</font>

758
00:33:49,539 --> 00:33:56,080
occasionally you'll get a whole lot more

759
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:57,489
commands and like this these are the

760
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:59,980
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular session there was over a</font>

761
00:33:57,489 --> 00:34:03,899
hundred commands and that's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a list</font>

762
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:06,399
of 20 right there still still malicious

763
00:34:03,899 --> 00:34:07,899
this is a typical detection if they

764
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:10,750
don't detect it before they<font color="#CCCCCC"> login</font>

765
00:34:07,899 --> 00:34:12,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">they'll usually cat something like proc</font>

766
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:18,040
CPU info which is also static or they'll

767
00:34:12,730 --> 00:34:21,030
do a PSA<font color="#CCCCCC"> aux or they'll do you name our</font>

768
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:23,829
is actually probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> most common one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> IC</font>

769
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:28,389
sees it as a default<font color="#E5E5E5"> hippo content and</font>

770
00:34:23,829 --> 00:34:34,389
then they will hop out so hippo visible

771
00:34:28,389 --> 00:34:35,679
visualization the old and the new you

772
00:34:34,389 --> 00:34:37,000
guys that have deployed kippo before

773
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:38,590
what are you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys using sir</font>

774
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:42,850
using for visualization using Kip oh

775
00:34:38,590 --> 00:34:46,470
crap yeah anybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> not using excuse me</font>

776
00:34:42,850 --> 00:34:52,449
anybody not using kippo graph nope

777
00:34:46,469 --> 00:34:54,609
anybody ever used mhm in no I don't have

778
00:34:52,449 --> 00:34:57,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">any experience of that anyway this is</font>

779
00:34:54,610 --> 00:35:02,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is a this is a capo graph just runs</font>

780
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:04,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">a an HTTP server on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the same box as your</font>

781
00:35:02,590 --> 00:35:07,900
Kip oh honey pot and it grabs the stats

782
00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:12,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">for you it's just some HTML throwing</font>

783
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:14,170
together and this this is coop this is

784
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:16,629
my<font color="#E5E5E5"> favorite thing about kippo graph is</font>

785
00:35:14,170 --> 00:35:18,790
that it<font color="#E5E5E5"> will actually play back the</font>

786
00:35:16,630 --> 00:35:22,930
entire session for you in real time and

787
00:35:18,790 --> 00:35:24,730
type it out like<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it will even like</font>

788
00:35:22,930 --> 00:35:27,700
if they pause for a minute in the middle

789
00:35:24,730 --> 00:35:29,170
of typing then it will and then pick it

790
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:31,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">back up it will wait for as long as we</font>

791
00:35:29,170 --> 00:35:33,100
pause right and it hits funny to see

792
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:34,360
it's funny<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see the scripted ones that</font>

793
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:35,920
are just running like a hundred command

794
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:37,330
and like it's coming up with<font color="#E5E5E5"> all these</font>

795
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:40,510
errors because<font color="#E5E5E5"> kippo doesn't know that</font>

796
00:35:37,330 --> 00:35:43,870
command but it's just still going like

797
00:35:40,510 --> 00:35:46,090
yeah this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a script that's just an</font>

798
00:35:43,870 --> 00:35:48,880
example of the graph<font color="#CCCCCC"> that hippo will</font>

799
00:35:46,090 --> 00:35:51,070
give you how many of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys have seen</font>

no instances of that that's why it's

847
00:38:11,739 --> 00:38:16,089
showing no results he's got the session

848
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:17,950
play log he doesn't have the capability

849
00:38:16,089 --> 00:38:19,180
he doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the capability that capo</font>

850
00:38:17,950 --> 00:38:21,399
graph does of actually being able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

851
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:22,989
play it back for<font color="#E5E5E5"> you in real time but as</font>

852
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:25,269
long as<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can see the commands I</font>

853
00:38:22,989 --> 00:38:27,309
personally don't really care so you'll

854
00:38:25,269 --> 00:38:29,828
see it gives a session ID to each

855
00:38:27,309 --> 00:38:31,749
session so you could<font color="#E5E5E5"> you could search</font>

856
00:38:29,829 --> 00:38:33,190
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> splunk for that session ID and bring</font>

857
00:38:31,749 --> 00:38:35,558
up everything that that had to do with

858
00:38:33,190 --> 00:38:38,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">that session it has the attacker IP the</font>

859
00:38:35,559 --> 00:38:40,089
sensor that it<font color="#CCCCCC"> hit the message count</font>

860
00:38:38,319 --> 00:38:44,079
message count is how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> commands will</font>

861
00:38:40,089 --> 00:38:45,489
run in that session and then in this

862
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:48,519
dashboard you could also go in and

863
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:51,940
select the HP<font color="#CCCCCC"> LA with you that's my</font>

864
00:38:48,519 --> 00:38:53,379
that's a one of my honey pots and it

865
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:54,999
pulls up all the sessions<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it saw in</font>

866
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:56,410
you see<font color="#E5E5E5"> that last 12 hours that's</font>

867
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:59,049
pulling up all the sessions that<font color="#E5E5E5"> saw for</font>

868
00:38:56,410 --> 00:38:59,359
that honey pot in that particular time

869
00:38:59,049 --> 00:39:01,700
for

870
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:03,920
it shows you when the session time

871
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:05,660
started shows at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the end time shows you</font>

872
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:08,000
the durations shows you the passwords

873
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:10,009
accepted if any more passwords were

874
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,600
attempted see no other passwords were

875
00:39:10,010 --> 00:39:14,090
tempted by one except<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one two three</font>

876
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:18,830
four<font color="#CCCCCC"> five six obviously honey pot right</font>

877
00:39:14,090 --> 00:39:22,610
maybe and this guy just he did he echoed

878
00:39:18,830 --> 00:39:24,620
LS and then he's logged out did he

879
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:26,120
download anything no he's<font color="#CCCCCC"> catted the</font>

880
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:29,870
known hosts which i believe is also

881
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:34,009
static so let's go look at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> attacker</font>

882
00:39:29,870 --> 00:39:38,630
profile now any<font color="#E5E5E5"> questions about the app</font>

883
00:39:34,010 --> 00:39:41,960
so far no<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay this is its first demo so</font>

884
00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:43,790
yes sir<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was I was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a big part of the of</font>

885
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:48,350
the testing of it or he actually

886
00:39:43,790 --> 00:39:50,480
submitted it so let's see so I'm good I

887
00:39:48,350 --> 00:39:52,250
am going back to grab an IP<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I</font>

888
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:55,040
need to provide that dashboard with an

889
00:39:52,250 --> 00:39:57,380
ITP of an attacker here so just going to

890
00:39:55,040 --> 00:40:11,470
copy and paste it here and there<font color="#CCCCCC"> will</font>

891
00:39:57,380 --> 00:40:15,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">see dia the results you know um I think</font>

892
00:40:11,470 --> 00:40:16,609
your honey pot pushes it but I'm not one

893
00:40:15,170 --> 00:40:21,050
hundred percent sure it very well could

894
00:40:16,610 --> 00:40:25,460
be polling I could ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> Brian let me call</font>

895
00:40:21,050 --> 00:40:27,290
him up just kidding if you but if you

896
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:28,400
hit me up like on IRC or Twitter on

897
00:40:27,290 --> 00:40:31,009
Monday I can answer that question<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

898
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:33,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">you so I don't know if you guys saw but</font>

899
00:40:31,010 --> 00:40:34,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">it pulled</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up the set all the sessions</font>

900
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:35,810
that that particular attacker had done

901
00:40:34,610 --> 00:40:39,110
in that time frame it shows you where

902
00:40:35,810 --> 00:40:44,930
the attack was coming from and in a

903
00:40:39,110 --> 00:40:47,060
bunch of other stuff so here I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

904
00:40:44,930 --> 00:40:51,770
grabbing a session ID for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next</font>

905
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:54,320
dashboard or an IPO I'm grabbing a

906
00:40:51,770 --> 00:40:56,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">Chinese IP because we all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know that what</font>

907
00:40:54,320 --> 00:41:00,470
Chinese are all malicious and when it

908
00:40:56,690 --> 00:41:06,590
comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> to to this stuff right everything</font>

909
00:41:00,470 --> 00:41:08,770
is China if your main you know if you

910
00:41:06,590 --> 00:41:08,770
live

911
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:14,480
oh yeah I'm bringing up a one that I

912
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:17,390
thought may<font color="#CCCCCC"> have just showing you that</font>

913
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:18,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was it'll bring up different IP</font>

914
00:41:17,390 --> 00:41:21,129
addresses i was hoping with that guy had

915
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:24,860
multiple attacks then it will show you

916
00:41:21,130 --> 00:41:26,870
what not oh no yeah right<font color="#E5E5E5"> there at the</font>

917
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:29,780
bottom it'll show the files downloaded

918
00:41:26,870 --> 00:41:35,240
and it'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> give you the shot 256 hash of</font>

919
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:36,830
that file and coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> up here he actually</font>

920
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:39,470
has a dashboard that will go out and

921
00:41:36,830 --> 00:41:42,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">call the virus total</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> API and submit that</font>

922
00:41:39,470 --> 00:41:43,970
hashed of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Irish total and and then it</font>

923
00:41:42,290 --> 00:41:47,570
will tell you if it's been seen by

924
00:41:43,970 --> 00:41:50,660
anybody else or not pretty cool so this

925
00:41:47,570 --> 00:41:55,310
is session analysis human human vs<font color="#E5E5E5"> bots</font>

926
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:58,460
identification<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not too sure exactly</font>

927
00:41:55,310 --> 00:42:00,110
what he does to determine that but I

928
00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:02,030
could have definitely ask him if

929
00:42:00,110 --> 00:42:03,500
anyone's curious those are rare commands

930
00:42:02,030 --> 00:42:06,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">inter during the session that we don't</font>

931
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:08,600
see very often obviously that the

932
00:42:06,230 --> 00:42:10,040
executable of that 1818 I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

933
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:19,130
the only time that big it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was only</font>

934
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:20,960
download<font color="#CCCCCC"> onto one honey pot so so we're</font>

935
00:42:19,130 --> 00:42:22,310
going to so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is just going to show</font>

936
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:25,040
you the top countries<font color="#E5E5E5"> of login top</font>

937
00:42:22,310 --> 00:42:26,540
countries scanning so look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> it look at</font>

938
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:31,190
the top country scanning am I<font color="#CCCCCC"> not right</font>

939
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:32,930
everything is<font color="#E5E5E5"> China so anyway I'm going</font>

940
00:42:31,190 --> 00:42:39,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">to pause this video and go to the next</font>

941
00:42:32,930 --> 00:42:41,930
one if you guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't mind here this</font>

942
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:43,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">one's a little shorter this is going</font>

943
00:42:41,930 --> 00:42:44,930
through the file analysis that I was

944
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:48,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">just telling you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will call</font>

945
00:42:44,930 --> 00:42:50,540
out to virustotal so I'm pullet so I'm

946
00:42:48,770 --> 00:42:54,710
pulling up all the latest file downloads

947
00:42:50,540 --> 00:43:02,720
from the past seven days just waiting

948
00:42:54,710 --> 00:43:03,800
for the data to populate here and those

949
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:05,540
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the files that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> were down by the</font>

950
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:08,300
last seven days keep in mind this is

951
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:09,710
only monitoring five honey pots in our

952
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:10,730
environment where we have 40 feeding

953
00:43:09,710 --> 00:43:14,090
into our small<font color="#CCCCCC"> environment you see a</font>

954
00:43:10,730 --> 00:43:17,240
whole lot more and it's got the shot 256

955
00:43:14,090 --> 00:43:20,060
hash the attacker IP the sensor that it

956
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:22,609
was downloaded<font color="#CCCCCC"> on to the session ID and</font>

957
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:23,900
then you'll see this<font color="#CCCCCC"> drop down</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> window it</font>

958
00:43:22,610 --> 00:43:26,569
auto fills with

959
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:28,400
the top<font color="#CCCCCC"> sha256 hashes and then you know</font>

960
00:43:26,569 --> 00:43:30,410
this particular hash it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> out to</font>

961
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:32,089
virustotal and you'll see all<font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

962
00:43:30,410 --> 00:43:33,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">vendor signatures it's been submitted</font>

963
00:43:32,089 --> 00:43:36,078
<font color="#E5E5E5">virustotal before so it's not unique</font>

964
00:43:33,740 --> 00:43:37,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's been seen before however this one</font>

965
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:39,380
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm pulling up right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now has not</font>

966
00:43:37,490 --> 00:43:42,078
you'll see the<font color="#E5E5E5"> danger signatures unknown</font>

967
00:43:39,380 --> 00:43:44,299
it's that was not submitted virustotal

968
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:45,619
before which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is pretty cool but it's</font>

969
00:43:44,299 --> 00:43:49,279
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a variant of some other</font>

970
00:43:45,619 --> 00:43:50,569
piece of<font color="#E5E5E5"> malware or something top</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 10</font>

971
00:43:49,279 --> 00:43:52,339
malware saying there's a scene over time

972
00:43:50,569 --> 00:43:57,259
because pulling that from from

973
00:43:52,339 --> 00:43:58,609
virustotal i believe the genomic malware

974
00:43:57,260 --> 00:44:02,359
<font color="#CCCCCC">seen i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not super familiar with what</font>

975

he's trying to do their potential

00:44:02,359 --> 00:44:06,950
malware files the ones that result

977
00:44:04,369 --> 00:44:10,099
didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> result didn't come back with any</font>

978
00:44:06,950 --> 00:44:11,868
results from<font color="#E5E5E5"> virustotal</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then we got</font>

979
00:44:10,099 --> 00:44:14,930
Malware campaigns that this doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> come</font>

980
00:44:11,869 --> 00:44:16,220
up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with anything he looks at the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> URLs if</font>

they're coming<font color="#CCCCCC"> from the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> same URLs if</font>

it's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same type of camp at the same</font>

983
00:44:17,930 --> 00:44:23,089
type of malware the same basically the

1048
00:47:29,450 --> 00:47:32,118
they're they're scanning the internet

1049
00:47:30,980 --> 00:47:34,970
anyway there are peas are going to get

1050
00:47:32,119 --> 00:47:37,640
scanned anyway and it's if any data gets

1051
00:47:34,970 --> 00:47:39,410
lost its I hope they're doing a good

1052
00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:41,029
enough job<font color="#E5E5E5"> of selling it in my data you</font>

1056
00:48:01,359 --> 00:48:07,598
with other honey Potter's is mainly

1057
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:09,609
independent researchers and but I would

1058
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:11,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">imagine that there are enterprises that</font>

1059
00:48:09,609 --> 00:48:15,190
are doing that it sounds like a really

1060
00:48:11,829 --> 00:48:17,619
really good idea so it would so I

1061
00:48:15,190 --> 00:48:19,599
personally<font color="#CCCCCC"> have not know but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I but it</font>

1062
00:48:17,619 --> 00:48:23,849
sounds<font color="#CCCCCC"> like a great idea there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

1063
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:42,220
another<font color="#E5E5E5"> question no any other questions</font>

1064
00:48:23,849 --> 00:48:44,289
yes so I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> if they're downloading a</font>

1065
00:48:42,220 --> 00:48:50,259
wheel confident yeah I guess I could get

1066
00:48:44,289 --> 00:48:53,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">in trouble but so I mean again so</font>

1067
00:48:50,259 --> 00:48:58,089
they're obviously able to download but

1068
00:48:53,829 --> 00:49:00,849
they have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to actually get I'm sorry no</font>

1069
00:48:58,089 --> 00:49:03,009
but you can I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> personally no but</font>

1070
00:49:00,849 --> 00:49:05,680
the fork of kippo that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I use does</font>

1071
00:49:03,009 --> 00:49:07,509
support SFTP and so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do that</font>

1072
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:24,308
that's a good question do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

1073
00:49:07,509 --> 00:49:26,380
question does someone yeah yeah for sure

1074

and that's like my that's my favorite

1075
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:29,980
part about honey potting actually I

1076
00:49:27,910 --> 00:49:32,379

1079
00:49:33,759 --> 00:49:41,950
case but i'm andrew morris the<font color="#E5E5E5"> guy that</font>

1083
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:51,819
through a lot of malware together and

1084
00:49:48,430 --> 00:49:52,859

1087
00:49:55,739 --> 00:50:00,420
we may it we may even execute it in in a

1088
00:49:58,410 --> 00:50:02,069
sandbox environment and run wireshark

1089
