00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,800
I guess I should stay lit<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the mic</font>

2
00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:12,719
over here<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so my name is Adam</font>

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:15,660
Fisher I've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the security</font>

4
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:17,820
industry now about<font color="#E5E5E5"> eight years have</font>

5
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:20,850
focused a lot on<font color="#E5E5E5"> identity and access</font>

6
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:24,960
management hence the topic here that

7
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:26,880
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to discuss today I spent a</font>

8
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,500
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of time in the enterprise space so</font>

9
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,410
I've dealt with a lot of large companies

10
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:34,010
a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> fortune 500 fortune fortune</font>

11
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:36,210
hundred fifty we're going to call it and

12
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:38,099
have had an opportunity<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work abroad</font>

13
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:41,399
so I've lived in England for 18 months

14
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:43,440
and so not<font color="#E5E5E5"> only learn about how access</font>

15
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:45,420
control is managed<font color="#CCCCCC"> here in the States</font>

16
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:48,390
but also how it may in other countries

17
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:51,840
look at it as well and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we want to cover</font>

18
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:54,840
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to kind of give us a background</font>

19
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:57,239
here a little bit on<font color="#E5E5E5"> Y axis control kind</font>

20
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:58,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the history of what we see kind of</font>

21
00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:00,599
how we<font color="#CCCCCC"> got to where we are today some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

22

the decisions that were made that<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">of put</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> us where we're at we're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

24
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:05,640
go look here then about how where it's

25
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:08,040
going right so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the traditional</font>

26
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:09,360
security model and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> what it's going</font>

27
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:12,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">to take for us to look</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in the move ahead</font>

in the new world of business kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

29
00:01:12,229 --> 00:01:17,220
difference<font color="#CCCCCC"> between roles and attributes</font>

30
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:19,439
and especially kind of health security

31
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:21,450
has always taken a no answer<font color="#E5E5E5"> to things</font>

32
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:23,039
right we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to secure things the</font>

33
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:24,869
answer's no really we<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

34
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,119
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a knowledge idea about who our users</font>

with our organization with our<font color="#E5E5E5"> business</font>

37
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:35,159
so one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the key points</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and this</font>

38
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:38,250
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of a growing trend that we see</font>

39
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:40,110
right in the world of enterprise in the

00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:43,140
world<font color="#E5E5E5"> of business security isn't just a</font>

41
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:44,310
tool it's not just an organization but

42
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:46,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's something that needs to be</font>

43
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:48,740
leveraged to increase the way that

44
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,899
businesses interact with their customers

45
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:54,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">and how they're going to really protect</font>

not only their brand but the data that

47
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:59,369
their customers hold with the open

48
00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:02,520
enterprise that's that's a that's around

49
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:03,869
us we're sharing more data now than we

50
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:07,798
ever have and we still have to be able

51
00:02:03,869 --> 00:02:10,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">to control</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and secure that so an</font>

52
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:12,420
indication of this is some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the new</font>

53
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:13,990
reality some of these numbers<font color="#CCCCCC"> here that</font>

54
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:16,179
we that we see

55
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:18,130
in front<font color="#E5E5E5"> of us here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so we got you know</font>

56
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:21,280
seventy-nine percent of organizations

57
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:23,640
are are using secure cloud<font color="#E5E5E5"> application</font>

00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:27,060
SAS application services in the cloud

59
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:32,070
you know we see the growing social trend

60
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:34,450
the number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of devices</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that are that</font>

61
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:37,269
applications now<font color="#E5E5E5"> our business</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> crate</font>

62
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:38,829
for mobile devices especially look at

63
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:41,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">API is not going to talk about api's</font>

64
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:43,420
today but especially around how that is

65
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:45,100
a you know increasing the amount of data

66
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:49,119
that we share across stuff business

67
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:50,500
lines and then and all<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's going to</font>

68
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,510
continue right so this is what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font>

69
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:55,860
facing this is kind of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the growth</font>

70
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:59,459
here and so with this right we've seen

the side and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know you're thinking</font>

143
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:29,350
Ellen what if I forget my combination

144
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:31,450
well if you order now you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can put it</font>

145
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:37,330
there it's the password mine to protect

146
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:38,950
reminder the one place to keep your

147
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:40,960
password my to protect your combination

148
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:42,370
and I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> one more special offer if you</font>

149
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:45,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't feel</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like writing down your</font>

150
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:47,580
passwords send them<font color="#E5E5E5"> to me and for ten</font>

151
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:49,570
dollars<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll write them down for you</font>

152
00:08:47,580 --> 00:09:01,660
don't worry about sending<font color="#E5E5E5"> me your credit</font>

153
00:08:49,570 --> 00:09:03,520
card information I'll figure it out so

154
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:06,760
what's funny about that right is that

155
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:09,510
it's real<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay that's an actual product</font>

156
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:12,910
that existed is about is about<font color="#E5E5E5"> 2011-2012</font>

157
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:16,960
and it's real right and so that's the

158
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:18,280
environment<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are our users you know</font>

159
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:20,380
it's the vets<font color="#E5E5E5"> the environment the public</font>

160
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:23,589
lives in right believe it or not and

161
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:25,570
people buy that kind of crap yeah I'll

162
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:26,890
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> one for you just let me give me a</font>

163
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:29,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">five dollar bill right I'll run down for</font>

164
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:31,810
you right and so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> guy this is where</font>

165
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:33,460
we're at so you know and moving through

166
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:35,560
that right so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to it we're</font>

167
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:38,440
looking here as a ways<font color="#CCCCCC"> to secure our</font>

168
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:42,880
access to control it in ways better than

169
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:44,200
this and so what were some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the you</font>

170
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:46,900
know what are ways here that we're

171
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:48,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">moving forward then alright</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just to set</font>

172
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:49,959
the stage<font color="#E5E5E5"> here then we're going to talk</font>

173
00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:52,450
a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> about moving for years an access</font>

174
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:55,390
control<font color="#E5E5E5"> model</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> alright and this is simply</font>

175
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:58,390
a framework<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the tix how us all</font>

176
00:09:55,390 --> 00:10:00,340
users access an object<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right it's</font>

177
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:02,170
that simple some of the first ones here

178
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:04,630
that we that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we came across right was</font>

179
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:08,310
discretionary access control<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right</font>

180
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:11,290
we see this a lot on linux unix is

181
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:13,209
decentralized owner discretion<font color="#CCCCCC"> rice's</font>

182
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:15,939
kind where the term data owner came from

183
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:17,880
right so i own a file<font color="#E5E5E5"> i can then</font>

184
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:20,920
determine who gets access to that file

185
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:23,500
okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> readwrite control access control</font>

186
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:26,060
lists permission rules are attached

187
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:28,670
directly to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> object</font>

188
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:32,599
right so pros of this easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> to implement</font>

189
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:35,479
great flexibility it's built into nearly

190
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:37,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">every operating system but the cons and</font>

191
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:40,160
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> definitely a big one here we see</font>

192
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:43,370
around enterprise level where they have

193
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:46,040
thousands<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2,000 4,000 work to the</font>

194
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:48,590
organization<font color="#CCCCCC"> and had 250,000</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> UNIX</font>

195
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:51,020
servers<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't scale well</font>

196
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:53,090
right when you're doing everything is

197
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:56,150
assigned on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the object across all those</font>

198
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:57,710
servers right there's no central

199
00:10:56,150 --> 00:11:00,230
implementation hence what we have now

200
00:10:57,710 --> 00:11:03,380
the UNIX ad integration Active Directory

201
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:06,770
Integration ldap Kerberos all of that is

202
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:09,320
to centralize those logins and because

203
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:11,600
there is so much manual task in there

204
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:13,490
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not centralized I've been out about</font>

205
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:16,730
you but how<font color="#E5E5E5"> many people have changed the</font>

206
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:19,100
permissions across their whole you know

207
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:20,480
root file structure or thought they

208
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:23,510
digital one folder but there went your

209
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:25,100
whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> ads edirectory or and so here we</font>

210
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:28,430
go right so that those types of things

211
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:30,710
prone for mistakes another thing that

212
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:32,479
came route around early on was mandatory

213
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:34,730
access control<font color="#CCCCCC"> they'd write some mac</font>

214
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:37,130
stuff and so we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting to data</font>

215
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:38,830
classification<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right and this is</font>

216
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:41,090
obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that the government</font>

217
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:42,650
uses Defense Department users we're all

218
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:46,130
familiar with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the top secret secret</font>

219
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:49,730
classified unclassified level here the

220
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:52,760
of the data and so what's good about

221
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:55,670
this right is subjective clearance the

222
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:57,260
same or above the object has access to

223
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:58,729
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> object so if I've got top secret</font>

224
00:11:57,260 --> 00:12:02,630
level clearance I give everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> down</font>

225
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:04,100
below right<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can read I can read</font>

226
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:06,080
everything on below and i can write top

227
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:08,030
secret but<font color="#E5E5E5"> if another level to</font>

228
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:10,630
unclassified I can't read above and I

229
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:12,470
can only<font color="#E5E5E5"> write unclassified information</font>

230
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:15,260
that's where the management access

231
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:18,050
control comes in so it's more secure it

232
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:20,900
scales easier but limited user

233
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:22,609
functionality expensive to implement and

234
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:24,110
obviously there's a high administration

235
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:25,850
overhead because are constantly looking

236
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:27,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">at that data that's classified and</font>

237
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:31,910
you're updating that classified

238
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:34,280
information<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and now this brings us</font>

239
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:37,219
to really where we're at here with

240
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:39,779
role-based access control<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright</font>

241
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:41,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">role-based access control came around</font>

242
00:12:39,779 --> 00:12:45,250
really kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of round whenever directory</font>

243
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:47,380
information came<font color="#E5E5E5"> around so first was DAP</font>

244
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:51,610
around 89 90 maybe even earlier than

245
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:53,230
that and which was a directory access

246
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:55,540
protocol and then the ldap came around

247
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:59,380
with the lightweight directory access

248
00:12:55,540 --> 00:13:01,779
protocol and what<font color="#CCCCCC"> that brought into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

249
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:04,360
brought into the realm here was really

250
00:13:01,779 --> 00:13:06,370
the ability for us to start classifying

251
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:09,089
almost like an intermediary layer with

252
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:11,529
groups ok and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so groups became very</font>

253
00:13:09,089 --> 00:13:13,089
influential in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the MU ldap</font>

254
00:13:11,529 --> 00:13:17,439
infrastructure<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we're able</font>

255
00:13:13,089 --> 00:13:19,000
to classify users not just by you know

256
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:21,550
perhaps their name but we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to</font>

257
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:24,390
classify them by a role<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we're able</font>

258
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:28,329
to centralize this information easier

259
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:30,699
role permissions are enforced as wealth

260
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:32,410
or an ACL but the big the big<font color="#E5E5E5"> ticket</font>

261
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:34,540
number here right was the user could be

262
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:37,930
member<font color="#CCCCCC"> of more than one role more than</font>

263
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:40,390
one group at a time right so it was easy

264
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:42,459
for us to then<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll just add the user to</font>

265
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:44,770
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> group he's got the access we don't</font>

266
00:13:42,459 --> 00:13:47,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">even think about it further okay another</font>

267
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:49,060
higher level layer of abstraction so we

268
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:53,709
kind of go through here<font color="#E5E5E5"> and take a look</font>

269
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:55,199
at this and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we look to build out a role</font>

270
00:13:53,709 --> 00:13:58,930
model right we're looking to find

271
00:13:55,200 --> 00:14:00,970
patterns between our users and so you

272
00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:02,500
know starting with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this type of type of</font>

273
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:05,140
a scale here simply have users on the

274
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:08,589
left the systems on the right and not

275
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:11,620
going to get my users over there<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

276
00:14:08,589 --> 00:14:14,110
if I was to do it without you know much

277
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:15,730
much fanfare<font color="#E5E5E5"> I kind of go through what</font>

278
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:17,980
does he need what does he need and

279
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:20,830
perhaps he<font color="#E5E5E5"> needs</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ivory system perhaps</font>

280
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:22,329
can you just a few but if we're to do

281
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:25,380
this normally right kind of what we're

282
00:14:22,329 --> 00:14:27,550
seeing here through you know a

283
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:30,490
discretionary model this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of what</font>

284
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:32,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">look like we kind of can see that</font>

285
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:34,810
doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> look too pretty right we've got</font>

286
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:35,649
so we got<font color="#E5E5E5"> some issues there and so we</font>

287
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:37,270
need we need another layer

288
00:14:35,649 --> 00:14:40,690
classification so<font color="#CCCCCC"> if want to do a</font>

289
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:41,890
general employee BAM we have a general

290
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:43,690
employee model<font color="#E5E5E5"> right we hear this</font>

291
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:46,949
referred to an industry as birthright

292
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:50,470
access all right I hire a new employee

293
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:53,290
what basic access does he need corporate

294
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:56,350
network access to the directory email

295
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:58,060
okay BAM is what he gets<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right but</font>

296
00:14:56,350 --> 00:15:00,160
perhaps<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have other classifications</font>

297
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:02,018
of users and what else are<font color="#CCCCCC"> they going to</font>

298
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:04,540
need all right<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we start looking at</font>

299
00:15:02,019 --> 00:15:05,800
the finance<font color="#E5E5E5"> role rights to see people</font>

300
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:08,439
are specifically in the finance

301
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:11,050
department moving<font color="#E5E5E5"> forward same thing</font>

302
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:13,839
with the sales department<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so we can</font>

303
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:16,149
start sigra<font color="#CCCCCC"> Gator our users a little bit</font>

304
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:20,170
better and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I kind of can see where this</font>

305
00:15:16,149 --> 00:15:21,910
goes we get to a point here where now<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

306
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:25,540
have a higher higher level layer of

307
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:28,810
abstraction and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> worked great this</font>

308
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:31,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">worked great for a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of instances and</font>

309
00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:34,209
security whenever everybody was in house

310
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:36,970
whenever everybody pretty much came to

311
00:15:34,209 --> 00:15:40,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">the office set down and that's where</font>

312
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:43,060
they access the data right there was

313
00:15:40,029 --> 00:15:45,449
none none of this mobile interaction

314
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:48,369
there was none of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this partnership</font>

315
00:15:45,449 --> 00:15:51,099
Federation I don't have contractors that

316
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:52,870
need my date I don't have partners that

317
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:55,000
I need their data from right everything

318
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:58,510
is is in our tight little data center

319
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:00,310
and this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> working great and you can</font>

320
00:15:58,510 --> 00:16:02,439
see here right so the everything from

321
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:05,229
the roll to the right is nice and clean

322
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:07,930
you know not a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of mess over there</font>

323
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:10,480
it's fairly it's it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> well-defined</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

324
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:12,969
know exactly what access each roles in a

325
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:16,540
give over on the left i still have my

326
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:18,040
thousands of users but that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay right</font>

327
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:21,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">because once i get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the role</font>

328
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:24,399
everything's clean and so what does this

329
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:28,899
give here so you know the pros<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

330
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:30,670
scalable to some degree and you know the

331
00:16:28,899 --> 00:16:32,829
second point here for the pro right was

332
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:35,800
really really kind of nice great for

333
00:16:32,829 --> 00:16:37,870
organizations with high turnover gone

334
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:39,670
are the<font color="#CCCCCC"> days right Amelius ferocity we</font>

335
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:42,670
we move around between companies kind of

336
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:44,680
more frequently definitely more<font color="#CCCCCC"> than</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

337
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:47,589
know the my my father's generation<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

338
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:49,479
sure yours as well and so<font color="#CCCCCC"> organizations</font>

339
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:53,139
are experiencing more of this turnover

340
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:56,110
and simply stated right user to roll

341
00:16:53,139 --> 00:16:58,800
membership changes frequently but<font color="#CCCCCC"> rolled</font>

342
00:16:56,110 --> 00:17:01,750
to object permission does not and

343
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:05,459
because of that the role our back has

344
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:07,119
has taken a big spot a big place in

345
00:17:05,459 --> 00:17:10,780
organizations in an access

346
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:13,510
control but simply sitting here on the

347
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:16,389
con side there's a possibility of roll

348
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:18,099
explosion<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right and roll explosion</font>

349
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:20,740
is simply the case where become so

350
00:17:18,099 --> 00:17:23,919
dependent on rules that we defeat<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

351
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:27,130
purpose<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay there's too many exceptions</font>

352
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:29,950
to the role rule right so you're part of

353
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:32,260
the finance department oh but but he's

354
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:34,740
an admin in the finance department okay

355
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:37,360
so now we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a finance admin role oh</font>

356
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:40,440
but we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have a finance dev role</font>

357
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:43,840
now now I have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a finance test</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> role and</font>

358
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:47,740
I've worked<font color="#E5E5E5"> in organizations where five</font>

359
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:50,470
thousand users 10,000<font color="#E5E5E5"> roles wait a</font>

360
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:52,990
second<font color="#CCCCCC"> right how does</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that work what's</font>

361
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:55,090
the purpose of a role model if that's

362
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:57,160
what we're creating I've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

363
00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:59,199
organizations where literally they broke

364
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:01,660
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Active Directory you didn't think</font>

365
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:04,330
it'd be possible but yes Active

366
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:06,850
Directory can no longer function because

367
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:10,990
a user has so many group memberships at

368
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:12,428
the Kerberos ticket is too large to pass

369
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:16,420
to the network<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they change to the</font>

370
00:18:12,429 --> 00:18:18,220
TCP port 88 to handle that right and

371
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:19,900
that's what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're talking about the role</font>

372
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:22,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">of explosions so there's not enough</font>

373
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:24,510
admin oversight there's a planning but

374
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:27,070
we see that and that's exactly why

375
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:30,309
things are limiting things are going

376
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:33,639
this direction we're no longer in a

377
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:35,800
traditional security model right so you

378
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:37,900
have the bad guys and we build up this

379
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:39,460
big wall right we dig a moat you put up

380
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:42,100
our castle walls we have a nice big

381
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:44,800
firewall it's sitting there everything

382
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:47,290
in its secure but how does that enable

383
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:48,970
the business is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that business agility or</font>

384
00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:51,040
stagnation right how<font color="#CCCCCC"> are we going to</font>

385
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:53,110
work with<font color="#E5E5E5"> our customers how are we going</font>

386
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:55,178
to market how are we going to partner

387
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:57,280
how we're going to have any type of

388
00:18:55,179 --> 00:18:59,500
influence in the marketplace that that's

389
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:03,220
what we continue to move with now this

390
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:05,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">is okay right because you know coming</font>

391
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:07,929
<font color="#CCCCCC">this way pretty much everybody came down</font>

392
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:10,899
it was a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> easier</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to say no here right</font>

393
00:19:07,929 --> 00:19:12,970
nope you're not going to have your

394
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:15,370
corporate email on your tablet on your

395
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:16,740
smartphone on your<font color="#CCCCCC"> blackberry right we</font>

396
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:18,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">all went through the blackberry stage</font>

397
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:20,380
people started getting these fancy new

398
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:20,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">BlackBerry devices they wanted email</font>

399
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:23,980
along

400
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:25,360
the wall starts coming down and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font>

401
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:28,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">where we're at now right that wall is</font>

402
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:30,750
down so how do we secure it now now<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

403
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:33,310
the business is open how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we secure</font>

404
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:35,610
what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> inside how do we secure our data</font>

405
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:38,169
how do you protect the company image I

406
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:48,419
can tell you right now it doesn't work

407
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:48,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">like this and there we go</font>

408
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:14,750
oh I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

409
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:42,309
and your security software protect your

410
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:48,629
whole business shut your 12 now secure

411
00:20:42,309 --> 00:20:51,760
not just pieces ours can see<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right</font>

412
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:54,670
so little you know that's funny we laugh

413
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:55,900
at it but isn't that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> truth this is</font>

414
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:57,940
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of how we look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at things right</font>

415
00:20:55,900 --> 00:21:00,360
as long as it's outside of the perimeter

416
00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:03,610
as long as it's outside of<font color="#E5E5E5"> where I focus</font>

417
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:05,110
is it still my concern you know I

418
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:08,320
guarantee target<font color="#CCCCCC"> probably said that</font>

419
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:11,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">right our perimeter is secure I won't</font>

420
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:13,990
care about<font color="#CCCCCC"> my HVAC vendor I'm good right</font>

421
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:16,600
but those days are gone right<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay we</font>

422
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:18,190
see what happens when we take that

423
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:21,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">stance right so we have to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> look beyond</font>

424
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:27,250
just what we control but our data

425
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:31,928
controls we see this happening because

426
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:35,590
where we're at now and<font color="#CCCCCC"> so I really like</font>

427
00:21:31,929 --> 00:21:37,450
this graph and I think this you know

428
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:39,668
indicates here what we're seeing as far

429
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:43,900
as our digital footprint and what's

430
00:21:39,669 --> 00:21:46,840
happening uh and and so really here over

431
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:49,299
the last couple years there's you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

432
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:51,520
we're up to ninety three percent now of

433
00:21:49,299 --> 00:21:54,820
information stored on stored digitally

434
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:56,470
as opposed back to in 1988 when

435
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:58,540
informations point seven percent will

436
00:21:56,470 --> 00:22:00,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">store it digitally think about</font>

437
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:04,418
everything that we access now is either

438
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:07,299
internet-based is you know it's sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

439
00:22:04,419 --> 00:22:10,330
a hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> drive somewhere right I mean when</font>

440
00:22:07,299 --> 00:22:12,549
was the last I mean least for me you

441
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:14,770
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> I that's pretty much</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly how</font>

442
00:22:12,549 --> 00:22:15,970
how everything is going when we see what

00:22:14,770 --> 00:22:17,080
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> healthcare</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> records</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> now write</font>

447
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:27,100
we're seeing this spike here in all of

448
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:29,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">this and so with that we need an access</font>

control model that isn't focused that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

450
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:34,450
more focused on digital information<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

451
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:36,790
what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> still information digital</font>

452
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:38,799
information is attributes we're looking

<font color="#E5E5E5">for information on the digital data</font>

454
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:43,570
that's where the access control needs to

455
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:46,840
reside<font color="#CCCCCC"> if that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what we're here talking</font>

456
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:48,850
now about what's coming next which is an

457
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:50,320
attribute based access control model

458
00:22:48,850 --> 00:22:52,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay</font>

459
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:55,269
why is this good okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> because we were</font>

00:22:57,539 --> 00:23:04,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay it's much easier for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me to apply</font>

473
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:33,610
I'm sorry more expressive and can

477
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:41,860
here as well write it avoids the need to

assign explicit authorizations before

here<font color="#CCCCCC"> the right then it becomes more of</font>

with a group membership and so will kind

506

of look at the ABAC timeline that's

507
00:24:52,509 --> 00:24:57,330
really sort of kicking off around 2009

514
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:12,280
2011 and this is where<font color="#CCCCCC"> a back was</font>

515
00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:13,840
recommended as the axis control model

00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:16,060
for promoting information sharing

between diverse and disparate

518
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:22,000
organizations and from there it

519
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:24,130
continues to<font color="#E5E5E5"> grow last year there was</font>

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> NIST guide to a back which is very</font>

00:25:27,970 --> 00:25:32,860
found<font color="#E5E5E5"> it interesting within it even now</font>

523
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:35,110
it's gained enough traction in five

524
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:38,020

00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:43,450
that by 2020 seventy percent of all

528
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:47,860
we can see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> shift in the amount of</font>

530
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:54,909
we have to control access to the digital

536
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:06,880
exciting if your identity junkie

537
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:10,300
hopefully is exciting for<font color="#E5E5E5"> you as well</font>

538
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:11,950
and so let's take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a look at some of the</font>

539
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:14,110
hindrances some of the things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> five</font>

540
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:16,230
cam brought out that said this is where

541
00:26:14,110 --> 00:26:18,250
we're seeing roadblocks<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

542
00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:19,720
traditionally access control has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font>

543
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:22,270
based on the identity<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the user</font>

544
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:25,900
requesting execution of a capability to

545
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:28,090
perform an operation on an object either

546
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:30,490
directly or through predefined at you

547
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:33,760
type such as roles or groups we know

548
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:35,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">that practitioners have noted this that</font>

549
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:38,710
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> approach</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to access control is often</font>

550
00:26:35,890 --> 00:26:41,080
cumbersome to manage given the need to

551
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:42,880
associate capabilities directly to users

552
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:45,610
or the roles<font color="#E5E5E5"> or groups that's absolutely</font>

553
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:47,650
true absolutely true<font color="#E5E5E5"> especially when you</font>

554
00:26:45,610 --> 00:26:49,750
have you know a number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of users of a</font>

make it<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple it makes it complex it</font>

560
00:26:59,290 --> 00:27:02,889
has also been noted that the qualifiers

561
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:04,780
of identity groups and roles are often

562
00:27:02,890 --> 00:27:08,200
insufficient in the expression<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> real</font>

564
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:13,150
here right the alternative is to grant

565
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:15,250
or deny user requests based on arbitrary

and so here we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking right it right</font>

569
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:23,349
again about<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's the attributes of the</font>

00:27:25,059 --> 00:27:30,749
access how we access that information

573
00:27:27,629 --> 00:27:32,978
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> often this approach is a back and</font>

574
00:27:30,749 --> 00:27:34,779
so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is going to be some advantages</font>

575
00:27:32,979 --> 00:27:36,580
here of a back then right so access

576
00:27:34,779 --> 00:27:38,440
control policies that can be implemented

577
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:40,928
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a back are limited only by the</font>

578
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:44,080
computational language and richness of

579
00:27:40,929 --> 00:27:46,749
the available attributes<font color="#CCCCCC"> avac enables</font>

580
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:48,840
precise access control it allows<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

581
00:27:46,749 --> 00:27:51,009
higher number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of discrete inputs</font>

582
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:53,349
providing a bigger set of possible

583
00:27:51,009 --> 00:27:55,119
combinations of those variables to

584
00:27:53,349 --> 00:27:56,950
reflect larger and more definitive set

585
00:27:55,119 --> 00:27:59,379
of possible rules to express policies

586
00:27:56,950 --> 00:28:01,840
basically it's more scalable<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok it's</font>

587
00:27:59,379 --> 00:28:04,539
more scalable it allows<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the for us</font>

588
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:07,238
to simplify<font color="#E5E5E5"> an environment as it gets</font>

589
00:28:04,539 --> 00:28:08,979
more complex this flexibility enables

590
00:28:07,239 --> 00:28:10,899
the greatest breadth of subjects to

591
00:28:08,979 --> 00:28:13,479
access the greatest breadth of objects

592
00:28:10,899 --> 00:28:14,889
without specifying individual

593
00:28:13,479 --> 00:28:17,259
relationships we don't have to be so

594
00:28:14,889 --> 00:28:19,389
fine grained but we still gain that

595
00:28:17,259 --> 00:28:22,479
ability to implement<font color="#E5E5E5"> fine grained</font>

596
00:28:19,389 --> 00:28:24,488
controls and so I bolted this here under

597
00:28:22,479 --> 00:28:26,289
a back access decisions<font color="#CCCCCC"> can't change</font>

598
00:28:24,489 --> 00:28:29,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">between requests by simply changing</font>

599
00:28:26,289 --> 00:28:31,960
attribute values without<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to change</font>

600
00:28:29,259 --> 00:28:35,440
the subject object relationships to find

601
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:37,090
an underlying rule sets and so why is

602
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:39,729
that important because it's a lot easier

603
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:41,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">for me to change an attribute why</font>

604
00:28:39,729 --> 00:28:44,320
because I usually comes<font color="#CCCCCC"> from an HR</font>

605
00:28:41,289 --> 00:28:46,809
system usually comes from a job change

606
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:52,090
right so if I change jobs my<font color="#E5E5E5"> department</font>

607
00:28:46,809 --> 00:28:53,289
changes immediately my access changes so

608
00:28:52,090 --> 00:28:55,330
I don't know about<font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but when I</font>

609
00:28:53,289 --> 00:28:57,669
work at a lot of customer sites that's

610
00:28:55,330 --> 00:29:00,580
the biggest thing I see a job change

611
00:28:57,669 --> 00:29:02,739
happens and what happens he maintains

612
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:04,029
his last<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> years worth of access</font>

613
00:29:02,739 --> 00:29:06,460
because nobody takes him out of the

614
00:29:04,029 --> 00:29:09,070
freaking group right when<font color="#CCCCCC"> Allers no</font>

615
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:11,919
group to change he changes his attribute

616
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:13,239
his access changes it's that<font color="#CCCCCC"> simple we</font>

617
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:15,460
don't have to change<font color="#CCCCCC"> the rule set that</font>

618
00:29:13,239 --> 00:29:18,190
implements<font color="#E5E5E5"> us either write the rule set</font>

619
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:20,679
is static we set the rule you're in this

620
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:23,399
department you get this access now my

621
00:29:20,679 --> 00:29:25,800
department changes the access is gone

622
00:29:23,399 --> 00:29:29,429
it's that simple

623
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:33,610
right and so just<font color="#E5E5E5"> because he has another</font>

624
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:34,960
layer of access inside an apartment all

625
00:29:33,610 --> 00:29:36,550
that is we're going to take a<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at</font>

626
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:40,300
this a little bit later another line in

627
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:42,240
the ruleset<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay all right and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so kind</font>

628
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:44,770
of what brought us here right so now

629
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:47,290
traditional security and removing into

630
00:29:44,770 --> 00:29:49,690
an attribute based identity security

631
00:29:47,290 --> 00:29:51,520
model and why so take a look read these

632
00:29:49,690 --> 00:29:54,310
I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> these are you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't like</font>

633
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:55,960
using Dilbert as proof points but these

634
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:58,720
really relate relates what I have to say

635
00:29:55,960 --> 00:30:04,210
right so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're pretty</font>

636
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:06,460
effective you know and we we joke about

637
00:30:04,210 --> 00:30:09,370
it but I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's because we've all</font>

638
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:13,330
experienced this right you know I'm back

639
00:30:09,370 --> 00:30:15,070
in like 02 03<font color="#CCCCCC"> I lived in you know i was</font>

640
00:30:13,330 --> 00:30:17,199
i was working environment like the first

641
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:18,669
one here right people were coming to us

642
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:21,130
and saying hey we want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an email</font>

643
00:30:18,670 --> 00:30:23,620
on this new blackberry that I got you

644
00:30:21,130 --> 00:30:25,300
know I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> access you</font>

645
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:27,669
know this from home I've got a broadband

646
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:30,879
connection it's up all the time<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want</font>

647
00:30:27,670 --> 00:30:32,950
to access is from home right and now

648
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:36,160
everything's gone mobile you know and

649
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:38,590
really him I mean my son<font color="#E5E5E5"> right he goes</font>

650
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:40,090
he's my laptop he's four years old does

651
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:41,560
he<font color="#E5E5E5"> reached for the mouse or is he</font>

652
00:30:40,090 --> 00:30:43,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">reached to touch the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> freaking screen of</font>

653
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:46,230
my laptop he flips to touch the screen

654
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:50,440
right and that's exactly how we're going

655
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:53,740
so we're in<font color="#E5E5E5"> an open business and so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now</font>

656
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:55,810
that wall is gone right so how do we

657
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:59,020
protect it we can't have a big you know

658
00:30:55,810 --> 00:31:00,429
a big massive castle in front of our

659
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:01,930
business anymore we've had too many

660
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:06,130
holes through it to call it a firewall

661
00:31:01,930 --> 00:31:09,340
to begin with and so<font color="#CCCCCC"> now yet the</font>

662
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:10,960
security has to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be on the identity</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

663
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:13,659
and that's and that's what we're talking

664
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:16,390
about attribute security right and the

665
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:18,790
beauty part about about this is even now

666
00:31:16,390 --> 00:31:20,440
from an insider threat perspective I'm

667
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:23,500
supposed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have a desk in the office</font>

668
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:25,390
I'm supposed to walk in there and but

669
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:28,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">now you know I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like you anymore</font>

670
00:31:25,390 --> 00:31:29,200
take<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sony for instance right I don't</font>

671
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">like it I'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to screw up your</font>

672
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:34,090
systems but<font color="#CCCCCC"> even from an insider threat</font>

673
00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:37,600
perspective from a perspective of least

674
00:31:34,090 --> 00:31:38,918
privilege this covers the entire threat

675
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:41,498
basis as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well</font>

676
00:31:38,919 --> 00:31:42,909
okay so protecting the shared account

677
00:31:41,499 --> 00:31:45,580
passwords we're controlling the

678
00:31:42,909 --> 00:31:48,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">privileged identities where you can</font>

679
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:50,109
record the access and so what this allow

680
00:31:48,489 --> 00:31:54,309
us to do is implement least<font color="#CCCCCC"> privilege</font>

681
00:31:50,109 --> 00:31:55,960
reduce the risk and improve

682
00:31:54,309 --> 00:31:57,850
accountability to our administrators and

683
00:31:55,960 --> 00:32:00,700
so forth that's what we're after here

684
00:31:57,850 --> 00:32:05,139
with identity perspective this brings us

685
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:06,940
to where we find<font color="#E5E5E5"> security now we're no</font>

686
00:32:05,139 --> 00:32:10,539
less<font color="#E5E5E5"> is more that's the common thing we</font>

687
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:12,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">still face the same type of requirements</font>

688
00:32:10,539 --> 00:32:14,499
right we sought to enable the business

689
00:32:12,190 --> 00:32:16,509
while we protect<font color="#E5E5E5"> the business and that's</font>

690
00:32:14,499 --> 00:32:17,710
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of with the open</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> enterprise</font>

691
00:32:16,509 --> 00:32:21,309
everything we hear about<font color="#E5E5E5"> an open</font>

692
00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:23,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">business now Security's responsibility</font>

693
00:32:21,309 --> 00:32:26,230
to enable the business to perform to

694
00:32:23,769 --> 00:32:28,269
increase revenue is really taking a

695
00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:31,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">different view right has taken a</font>

696
00:32:28,269 --> 00:32:33,789
different look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> security and so we've</font>

697
00:32:31,779 --> 00:32:35,590
gone from<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> situation where we say no to</font>

698
00:32:33,789 --> 00:32:37,929
everything or protect the business no

699
00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:39,309
you can't have your blackberry or or<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

700
00:32:37,929 --> 00:32:40,899
know what I phones came out everything

701
00:32:39,309 --> 00:32:43,869
every got an iPhone they wanted this and

702
00:32:40,899 --> 00:32:46,959
that too how<font color="#CCCCCC"> are we going to enable our</font>

703
00:32:43,869 --> 00:32:49,299
users enable the business in a situation

704
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:52,269
of security<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay how are we going to</font>

705
00:32:49,299 --> 00:32:54,039
secure<font color="#E5E5E5"> the data so that they can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use it</font>

706
00:32:52,269 --> 00:32:57,519
on their phones so they can be more

707
00:32:54,039 --> 00:33:01,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">productive so we can interface with our</font>

708
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:02,950
partners so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can interface with our</font>

709
00:33:01,169 --> 00:33:08,200
contractors and have secure

710
00:33:02,950 --> 00:33:10,149
relationships<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and so let's take a</font>

711
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:12,489
look here<font color="#CCCCCC"> then a little bit on the five</font>

712
00:33:10,149 --> 00:33:14,320
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> fine-grain level here of a payback</font>

713
00:33:12,489 --> 00:33:16,169
from an attribute based control what are

714
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:18,999
the what are the pieces in place

715
00:33:16,169 --> 00:33:21,909
implement an attribute based control

716
00:33:18,999 --> 00:33:23,320
system<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not going to follow the terms</font>

00:33:21,909 --> 00:33:25,779
on the left<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll just follow</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the diagram</font>

718
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:28,119
here the terms are enough abetik order

719
00:33:25,779 --> 00:33:30,460
but first we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a policy enforcement</font>

720
00:33:28,119 --> 00:33:31,779
point this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> simply an endpoint</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

721
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:35,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">right so this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something i'm going to</font>

722
00:33:31,779 --> 00:33:38,799
log into that has you know either an

723
00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:40,779
agent a connector or a tie-in to the PDP

724
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:42,220
is number of ways there's no solutions

725
00:33:40,779 --> 00:33:45,070
commercial solutions that will implement

726
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:47,859
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> a higher level of pp is simply an</font>

727
00:33:45,070 --> 00:33:49,539
endpoint policy enforcement<font color="#E5E5E5"> point it's</font>

728
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:51,549
someplace that's implemented a back

729
00:33:49,539 --> 00:33:54,489
control whether that's files

730

server a window share web server

731
00:33:54,489 --> 00:33:59,830
whatever it may be the decision point is

732
00:33:58,419 --> 00:34:02,499
the rules right so this is what's

733
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:04,539
storing the rules<font color="#CCCCCC"> that evaluates my</font>

734
00:34:02,499 --> 00:34:06,789
access<font color="#E5E5E5"> request so it looks for my</font>

735
00:34:04,539 --> 00:34:08,949
attributes it looks for the objects

736
00:34:06,789 --> 00:34:11,020
attributes and whatever other additional

737
00:34:08,949 --> 00:34:14,379
parameters that we've set in the rule

738
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:16,359
will take a look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

739
00:34:14,379 --> 00:34:17,859
really then ties back the decision point

740
00:34:16,359 --> 00:34:19,779
I mean kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of look at the decision</font>

741
00:34:17,859 --> 00:34:20,859
point as a service he's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be</font>

742
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:23,159
sitting<font color="#E5E5E5"> there running looking for</font>

743
00:34:20,859 --> 00:34:26,049
requests and it's going to process those

744
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:29,139
it's basically a tie MN to a<font color="#E5E5E5"> policy</font>

745
00:34:26,049 --> 00:34:32,319

752
00:34:43,989 --> 00:34:48,069
create the<font color="#CCCCCC"> rule set</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ok and so now</font>

753
00:34:46,659 --> 00:34:50,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">instead of me going to active directory</font>

754
00:34:48,069 --> 00:34:53,889
and saying you know make me a member<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

create a new create a new attribute rule

758
00:34:58,230 --> 00:35:03,280
maybe we do have a new department coming

759
00:35:00,549 --> 00:35:05,410
on we've had<font color="#E5E5E5"> an M&A activity acquired a</font>

761
00:35:05,410 --> 00:35:08,859
will create those that's really good to

762
00:35:07,450 --> 00:35:12,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">do that now they leave those groups</font>

763
00:35:08,859 --> 00:35:14,920
along<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right and so come into coming</font>

764
00:35:12,490 --> 00:35:18,040
back to this slide now instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

765
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:20,920
middle really becomes one big box it

766
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:23,049
becomes the policy decision point<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

767
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:26,349
and in there<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to have those</font>

770
00:35:28,569 --> 00:35:33,220
all sits right there<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have one place to</font>

771
00:35:30,730 --> 00:35:36,309
go to make the change I have one place

<font color="#CCCCCC">to go to address the attribute needs of</font>

773
00:35:36,309 --> 00:35:40,960
my organization and then that is pushed

774
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:43,229
out to the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> point systems I go that</font>

775
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:48,099
for the request the request is<font color="#E5E5E5"> granted</font>

776
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:49,690
I'll gain my access<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so the standard</font>

777
00:35:48,099 --> 00:35:52,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">that is implementing attribute based</font>

778
00:35:49,690 --> 00:35:57,160
access control is referred to as exact

779
00:35:52,599 --> 00:35:59,950
amor<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay extensible access control</font>

780
00:35:57,160 --> 00:36:04,000
markup language and a<font color="#CCCCCC"> high-level</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

781
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:05,270
defines it defines the the XML and I

782
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,010
defines the rule set

783
00:36:05,270 --> 00:36:10,580
what format the<font color="#E5E5E5"> XML needs to be aim to</font>

784
00:36:07,010 --> 00:36:12,340
be consumed<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and so to look at here</font>

785
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:15,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is a simple access control rule</font>

786
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:17,450
okay you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and there's a key thing</font>

787
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:19,009
here though and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's it's what kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

788
00:36:17,450 --> 00:36:22,069
gets referred to and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is a primary</font>

789
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:24,230
attribute the policy so policy role

790
00:36:22,070 --> 00:36:27,320
equals manager<font color="#E5E5E5"> action equals view</font>

791
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:30,320
resource type equals a document rule<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

792
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:32,660
deny at the document<font color="#E5E5E5"> over is not this</font>

793
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:35,360
user ID so we're saying whoever is user

794
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:42,799
ID it is specifically that's who can get

795
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:44,840
it rule 2 is permit but what's the first

796
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:47,360
line here right roll it was manager

797
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:48,890
that's a common misconception when we

798
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:50,710
say we're moving to an attribute based

799
00:36:48,890 --> 00:36:52,520
access<font color="#E5E5E5"> controls that rolls are gone</font>

800
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:54,680
obviously we're not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be deleting</font>

801
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:58,820
groups they became they become what we

802
00:36:54,680 --> 00:37:02,450
call<font color="#E5E5E5"> a primary attribute so it may still</font>

803
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:04,790
be easier for<font color="#CCCCCC"> me to put you know a group</font>

804
00:37:02,450 --> 00:37:07,730
of 10 managers that span over a course

805
00:37:04,790 --> 00:37:10,720
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 departments into a specific role</font>

806
00:37:07,730 --> 00:37:13,010
and then I<font color="#E5E5E5"> could say row locals manager</font>

807
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:15,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">all right so if I'm in the manager raw</font>

808
00:37:13,010 --> 00:37:17,810
can still get there really I see this

809
00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:20,240
going away eventually I don't think

810
00:37:17,810 --> 00:37:22,340
roles will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be in there because then what</font>

811
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:26,029
happens well now we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a generic term</font>

812
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:28,340
to refer it back to groups okay but for

813
00:37:26,030 --> 00:37:30,770
sake of migration purposes and so people

814
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:32,720
that like our back don't get offended we

815
00:37:30,770 --> 00:37:34,580
allow<font color="#CCCCCC"> them to find a role in there okay</font>

816
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:36,859
and I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's how we see this</font>

817
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:40,430
transfer migration process moving

818
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:43,670
forward by just leveraging currently

819
00:37:40,430 --> 00:37:45,589
what's to sign their my roles in<font color="#E5E5E5"> khane</font>

820
00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:48,050
so what happens if there is two or more

821
00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:49,370
roles<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wanted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cover this because</font>

822
00:37:48,050 --> 00:37:51,800
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a common thing where you might</font>

823
00:37:49,370 --> 00:37:54,770
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know an ounce of role explosion</font>

824
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:56,450
you have rule explosion there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> always</font>

825
00:37:54,770 --> 00:37:59,780
going to be some level of complexity out

826
00:37:56,450 --> 00:38:02,629
there but<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is another example here</font>

827
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:05,720
or refer to<font color="#CCCCCC"> us permit overrides so we</font>

828
00:38:02,630 --> 00:38:07,160
can be able to define you know specific

829
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:11,569
rules that have higher priority than

830
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:14,420
others to implement those and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

831
00:38:11,570 --> 00:38:17,960
makes it you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know makes it easy to</font>

832
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:21,140
be able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> limit the amount of you know</font>

833
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:24,619
I guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> rule explosion that we would</font>

834
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:26,420
expect to see and so a couple of the

835
00:38:24,619 --> 00:38:28,339
ABAC implementations currently out there

836
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:30,109
we see a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this coming on board so</font>

837
00:38:28,339 --> 00:38:32,930
Microsoft Windows Server 2012 was

838
00:38:30,109 --> 00:38:35,450
implemented a form of it and claim claim

839
00:38:32,930 --> 00:38:37,069
based access control<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right we're</font>

840
00:38:35,450 --> 00:38:39,290
essentially they're passing around in

841
00:38:37,069 --> 00:38:41,740
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> acclaim that they referred to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as an</font>

842
00:38:39,290 --> 00:38:44,779
ACL which is really<font color="#E5E5E5"> an attribute rule</font>

843
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:49,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">fedora 33 which is nice giving up on on</font>

844
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:51,170
that implementation as well and there's

845
00:38:49,490 --> 00:38:55,279
lots of third-party companies such as

846
00:38:51,170 --> 00:38:58,690
axiomatic<font color="#CCCCCC"> sava tier that have you know</font>

847
00:38:55,280 --> 00:39:02,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">commercial off-the-shelf type solutions</font>

848
00:38:58,690 --> 00:39:05,180
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> lay can leverage so with that</font>

849
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:24,950
open up any questions or comments<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

850
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:26,480
we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah right right so so not so</font>

851
00:39:24,950 --> 00:39:28,970
much with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the claim but what we see here</font>

852
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:31,579
the policy decision point is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

853
00:39:28,970 --> 00:39:34,069
validate the insertion against what<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

854
00:39:31,579 --> 00:39:35,780
see from the policy repository so it's

855
00:39:34,069 --> 00:39:37,099
going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a you know it has the list</font>

856
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:39,710
it has the information in the repository

857
00:39:37,099 --> 00:39:59,089
that we've defined sort of that rule set

858
00:39:39,710 --> 00:40:00,410
is and<font color="#E5E5E5"> bases it off of that correct yeah</font>

859
00:39:59,089 --> 00:40:02,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">very good point yeah we're not talking</font>

860
00:40:00,410 --> 00:40:04,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">about using passwords here they can get</font>

861
00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:07,099
authenticated somewhere else this is

862
00:40:04,790 --> 00:40:09,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">another step</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> farther down on that chain</font>

863
00:40:07,099 --> 00:40:11,349
of authorization where and what we refer

864
00:40:09,890 --> 00:40:13,640
to this is almost like<font color="#CCCCCC"> fine-grained</font>

865
00:40:11,349 --> 00:40:16,520
authorization swinging it very specific

866
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:20,078
on on who's accessing was so you may be

867
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:20,079
authenticated but not authorized

868
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:50,880
yeah very good<font color="#E5E5E5"> so Samuel to delvia the</font>

869
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:53,830
federation standard we see currently

870
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:56,350
what it has those attributes and then we

871
00:40:53,830 --> 00:41:12,730
can put a lot in that insertion a good

872
00:40:56,350 --> 00:41:15,190
point other questions so<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay good</font>

873
00:41:12,730 --> 00:41:17,050
question good question so dynamic rat

874
00:41:15,190 --> 00:41:18,880
the authorizations more<font color="#CCCCCC"> bass because</font>

875
00:41:17,050 --> 00:41:21,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's coming from me so from a static</font>

876
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:24,280
perspective roles are static I have to

877
00:41:21,490 --> 00:41:27,100
manually be added to that role whereas

878
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:29,230
for me my attributes changes that can be

879
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:31,660
that can be a<font color="#CCCCCC"> dynamic process as soon as</font>

880
00:41:29,230 --> 00:41:33,460
it happens it's already updated on the

881
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:35,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">endpoint right all right my</font>

882
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:37,570
authorization is already updated so

883
00:41:35,950 --> 00:41:40,210
there's no there's no middle step that I

884
00:41:37,570 --> 00:41:41,859
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to a rule like so my</font>

885
00:41:40,210 --> 00:41:44,140
attributes can change but my act my

886
00:41:41,859 --> 00:41:46,180
authorization will be the same right

887
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:49,740
somebody has to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that go to a role</font>

888
00:41:46,180 --> 00:42:00,339
and pull me out remove me<font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a group</font>

889
00:41:49,740 --> 00:42:03,430
does that answer your question I mean

890
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:05,920
most likely<font color="#CCCCCC"> not but possibly I don't see</font>

891
00:42:03,430 --> 00:42:09,490
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> happening</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> no but usually give</font>

892
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:11,710
comment on this<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay now so yeah no I</font>

893
00:42:09,490 --> 00:42:14,859
wouldn't expect<font color="#E5E5E5"> a user to necessarily go</font>

894
00:42:11,710 --> 00:42:18,750
in and change their job title to CEO and

895
00:42:14,859 --> 00:42:18,750
then have that happen

896
00:42:44,750 --> 00:42:49,440
so I mean from<font color="#E5E5E5"> ident dynamic perspective</font>

897
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:53,040
the way I have the way I viewed

898
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:55,250
attribute best is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there once that</font>

899
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:58,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">change happens on my user attributes</font>

900
00:42:55,250 --> 00:43:01,559
there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> another change so from a role</font>

901
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:03,359
perspective my attributes can change but

902
00:43:01,559 --> 00:43:06,180
then I also have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go and make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a change</font>

903
00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:08,970
of the role rats from an attribute

904
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:11,129
perspective I change the attributes it's

905
00:43:08,970 --> 00:43:19,189
done there isn't that second step<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go</font>

906
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:19,190
to a rule then also make a change<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

907
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:55,619
so I mean there's still there still

908
00:43:53,250 --> 00:43:59,040
going to be a data owner of work we're

909
00:43:55,619 --> 00:44:01,680
still going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have you no access to to</font>

910
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:03,779
information that's going to be stored i

911
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:05,339
would say kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of how it probably</font>

912
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:07,349
currently is so whatever whatever

913
00:44:05,339 --> 00:44:10,558
business process you currently have in

914
00:44:07,349 --> 00:44:13,049
place that manages your<font color="#CCCCCC"> sharepoint files</font>

915
00:44:10,559 --> 00:44:14,640
it manages your document of insulation

916
00:44:13,049 --> 00:44:17,700
whatever gets read write and create

917
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:19,680
access that's you know that's still

918
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:21,509
going to be there but what this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is going</font>

919
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:23,640
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> allow</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> us to do is we basically have</font>

920
00:44:21,510 --> 00:44:25,430
that call out<font color="#CCCCCC"> that says should</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I have</font>

921
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:28,020
this access or not so perhaps we don't

922
00:44:25,430 --> 00:44:30,598
leverage the internal mechanisms there

923
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:34,740
and we and we implement an access model

924
00:44:30,599 --> 00:44:36,090
like this so I mean

925
00:44:34,740 --> 00:44:50,279
that's that's kind of how<font color="#E5E5E5"> I see that</font>

926
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:53,040
going forward but mmhmm yeah I agree

927
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:54,810
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that so you look at from man from a</font>

928
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:55,980
new perspective you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know if we have</font>

929
00:44:54,810 --> 00:44:58,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">somebody soon they're typing on a</font>

930
00:44:55,980 --> 00:44:59,550
keyboard that enters in data we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

931
00:44:58,170 --> 00:45:02,160
assume a three percent error rate which

932
00:44:59,550 --> 00:45:04,710
is not going to help help at all so from

933
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:06,930
an automation perspective there the you

934
00:45:04,710 --> 00:45:09,360
know for so I mean I work for a company

935
00:45:06,930 --> 00:45:11,190
that has a solution that does this

936
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:13,350
automation for us so it can manage the

937
00:45:11,190 --> 00:45:15,990
the attributes that change it can manage

938
00:45:13,350 --> 00:45:18,630
that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> information there's lots of i</font>

939
00:45:15,990 --> 00:45:20,580
would say options out there that provide

940
00:45:18,630 --> 00:45:36,480
for the automatic changes of these

941
00:45:20,580 --> 00:45:38,009
attributes and so forth so I mean

942
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:40,980
there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> still going to be a level of</font>

943
00:45:38,010 --> 00:45:42,570
human interaction with<font color="#E5E5E5"> any system right</font>

944
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:45,000
we have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> put the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> data in there we can</font>

945
00:45:42,570 --> 00:45:46,320
create it magically right we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to we</font>

946
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,910
have to put in the fields but there's

947
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:50,040
there there's obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> options we can</font>

948
00:45:47,910 --> 00:45:51,690
make it more static so somebody's not

949
00:45:50,040 --> 00:46:02,279
typing in a manager they have to select

950
00:45:51,690 --> 00:46:04,109
it right stuff like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay no no sew</font>

951
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:06,630
samples of Federation standards so

952
00:46:04,109 --> 00:46:09,390
whenever I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to federate with another</font>

953
00:46:06,630 --> 00:46:13,010
company another partnership that is that

954
00:46:09,390 --> 00:46:15,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">Samuel insertion has my user attributes</font>

955
00:46:13,010 --> 00:46:17,550
exact mo is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the standard that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font>

956
00:46:15,380 --> 00:46:19,859
facilitate<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay what are those</font>

957
00:46:17,550 --> 00:46:22,050
attributes and you see allowed do we

958
00:46:19,859 --> 00:46:30,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">have do they match up do they meet the</font>

959
00:46:22,050 --> 00:46:32,700
role that we have here yeah so right<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

960
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:34,410
this is this is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little higher level I</font>

961
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:36,930
didn't put I didn't put the other stuff

962
00:46:34,410 --> 00:46:38,750
in there yeah but I mean it's it's

963
00:46:36,930 --> 00:46:41,149
similar to this so I'm there's a good

964
00:46:38,750 --> 00:46:44,690
Fedora site that has a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the good</font>

965
00:46:41,150 --> 00:46:44,690
good<font color="#E5E5E5"> write-up on it</font>

966
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:53,320
so from I mean in the enterprise space

967
00:46:51,010 --> 00:46:56,200
definitely axiomatic has been in the

968
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:59,530
forefront of a battery based access

969
00:46:56,200 --> 00:47:03,100
control they've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been around since</font>

970
00:46:59,530 --> 00:47:05,560
probably bout to 2010 and then i would

971
00:47:03,100 --> 00:47:09,160
say probably microsoft with the claims

972
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:11,759
based access and fedora around you know

973
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:16,540
shortly after that is when they came in

974
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:19,090
yeah but yeah so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think probably the</font>

975
00:47:16,540 --> 00:48:04,600
leader right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> is axiomatic is the big</font>

976
00:47:19,090 --> 00:48:07,000
one pushing so<font color="#CCCCCC"> um</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not getting into the</font>

977
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:09,580
complexity of of you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know the rules that</font>

978
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:11,590
we can configure it's easier to

979
00:48:09,580 --> 00:48:15,279
configure the exceptions i would say an

980
00:48:11,590 --> 00:48:18,100
exact more to handle those then then<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

981
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:20,590
a role-based scenario i think if we come

982
00:48:18,100 --> 00:48:22,750
back and look at this slide here right

983
00:48:20,590 --> 00:48:25,090
even if there is more complexity there's

984
00:48:22,750 --> 00:48:27,250
still one place that work<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can put</font>

985
00:48:25,090 --> 00:48:28,900
that there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> still one location where</font>

986
00:48:27,250 --> 00:48:31,960
that can be stored on the policy

987
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:33,490
decision point we're not increasing the

988
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:36,850
number of groups we're not increasing

989
00:48:33,490 --> 00:48:40,569
the number of you know objects in our

990
00:48:36,850 --> 00:48:42,880
directories to handle the exceptions<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

991
00:48:40,570 --> 00:48:45,370
think from any standpoint we usually

992
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:47,290
look at having about<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a two to twenty</font>

993
00:48:45,370 --> 00:48:48,330
percent coverage with any access model

994
00:48:47,290 --> 00:48:53,279
right

995
00:48:48,330 --> 00:48:55,560
but you know that being said<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

996
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:58,050
for any type of extreme one-offs right

997
00:48:55,560 --> 00:49:00,029
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just put we have to do it statically</font>

998
00:48:58,050 --> 00:49:02,970
and put it on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the hood on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actual</font>

999
00:49:00,030 --> 00:49:04,500
object but from<font color="#CCCCCC"> what I've seen</font>

1000
00:49:02,970 --> 00:49:07,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">definitely from this this eliminates</font>

1001
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:09,750
that incidence of having a role

1002
00:49:07,170 --> 00:49:11,130
explosion scenario where<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have double</font>

1003
00:49:09,750 --> 00:49:12,780
the amount of groups<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we have our</font>

1004
00:49:11,130 --> 00:49:29,730
users because we've tried<font color="#CCCCCC"> to capture all</font>

1005
00:49:12,780 --> 00:49:32,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">the exceptions right yeah good question</font>

1006
00:49:29,730 --> 00:49:34,530
so I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> personally I haven't you know</font>

1007
00:49:32,550 --> 00:49:37,350
I haven't implemented this per se<font color="#E5E5E5"> to any</font>

1008
00:49:34,530 --> 00:49:40,260
customer site but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> will say that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

1009
00:49:37,350 --> 00:49:43,110
those organizations you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know i'm working</font>

1010
00:49:40,260 --> 00:49:44,550
with a large chip manufacturer and<font color="#E5E5E5"> boise</font>

1011
00:49:43,110 --> 00:49:47,070
you guys are familiar with the company

1012
00:49:44,550 --> 00:49:49,380
like that in<font color="#E5E5E5"> boise but they I mean</font>

1013
00:49:47,070 --> 00:49:53,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's a common example where they've</font>

1014
00:49:49,380 --> 00:49:55,890
had a massive overhaul of groups and why

1015
00:49:53,370 --> 00:49:58,380
is that because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean lots of companies</font>

1016
00:49:55,890 --> 00:50:00,690
like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> then they provide to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the end</font>

1017
00:49:58,380 --> 00:50:02,820
user the ability to request a group and

1018
00:50:00,690 --> 00:50:04,410
have that be created and so then you

1019
00:50:02,820 --> 00:50:07,770
have duplicate groups left and right all

1020
00:50:04,410 --> 00:50:09,720
over<font color="#CCCCCC"> the place and whenever I'm</font>

1021
00:50:07,770 --> 00:50:12,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">unfortunately can't just drop a bomb and</font>

1022
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:13,830
start over but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's almost what it</font>

1023
00:50:12,060 --> 00:50:16,650
takes whenever you get into a really bad

1024
00:50:13,830 --> 00:50:18,210
roll situation because there's no

1025
00:50:16,650 --> 00:50:24,560
oversight there's no<font color="#E5E5E5"> management across</font>

1026
00:50:18,210 --> 00:50:24,560
at all yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay one last question</font>

1027
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:53,930
correct so really<font color="#E5E5E5"> really it all depends</font>

1028
00:50:52,700 --> 00:50:56,029
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> a login system right so if I'm</font>

1029
00:50:53,930 --> 00:50:57,230
logging in with you know integrated

1030
00:50:56,030 --> 00:50:59,780
windows authentication I'm going to

1031
00:50:57,230 --> 00:51:01,310
bring some attributes with me there so

1032
00:50:59,780 --> 00:51:03,770
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe that is just an Active</font>

1033
00:51:01,310 --> 00:51:05,210
Directory attribute change directory

1034
00:51:03,770 --> 00:51:07,070
change whatever it may be wherever the

1035
00:51:05,210 --> 00:51:08,150
attributes coming from and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1036
00:51:07,070 --> 00:51:10,970
other thing you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't care where it</font>

1037
00:51:08,150 --> 00:51:12,800
comes from as long as we get<font color="#CCCCCC"> it but from</font>

1038
00:51:10,970 --> 00:51:14,569
an IT perspective it would either

1039
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:16,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">neither</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be that either we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to change</font>

1040
00:51:14,570 --> 00:51:18,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">the attributes oh maybe we've added</font>

1041
00:51:16,130 --> 00:51:20,120
another attribute to the user that

1042
00:51:18,100 --> 00:51:23,540
determines what system he should get

1043
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:28,490
access to or we set up another rule that

1044
00:51:23,540 --> 00:51:31,910
catches that so instead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> creating a</font>

1045
00:51:28,490 --> 00:51:33,529
role maybe we create a rule but from

1046
00:51:31,910 --> 00:51:36,109
what I've seen them but<font color="#E5E5E5"> when I've seen</font>

1047
00:51:33,530 --> 00:51:37,790
before<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've read the the rule-based</font>

1048
00:51:36,110 --> 00:51:40,340
scenario allows us to create much more

1049
00:51:37,790 --> 00:51:43,640
of a static rule that then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> might add</font>

1050
00:51:40,340 --> 00:51:45,950
a attribute on to the user you know then

1051
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:47,690
and from<font color="#CCCCCC"> my perspective is there's</font>

1052
00:51:45,950 --> 00:51:50,359
there's plenty of attributes that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

1053
00:51:47,690 --> 00:51:52,780
add or that we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> change on the user to</font>

1054
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:52,780
modify it
