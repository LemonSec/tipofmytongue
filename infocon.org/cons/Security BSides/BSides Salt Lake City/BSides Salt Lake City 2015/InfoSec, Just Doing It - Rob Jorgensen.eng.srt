16
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:44,460
into cyber security how you get into

17
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:46,649
infosec you know what can you do I have

18
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:49,140
a lot of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who are students who</font>

19
00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:50,760
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really have any experience but i</font>

20
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:53,699
also have a talk to a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people who</font>

21
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:55,230
are system engineers you know system

22
00:00:53,699 --> 00:00:57,510
administrators network administrators

23
00:00:55,230 --> 00:01:00,120
who say<font color="#E5E5E5"> i really want to be in security</font>

24
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:03,390
but my you know my company won't support

25
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:06,298
me<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know what to do and</font>

26
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:07,650
a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people basically like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i can't</font>

27
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:09,150
afford<font color="#E5E5E5"> it because everyone thinks that</font>

28
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:11,220
if you want to be an infosec you've got

29
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:13,439
to go take a five-thousand-dollar<font color="#E5E5E5"> sans</font>

30
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:17,520
course is anyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> here taking a stance</font>

31
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:21,000
course what was it good<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah great</font>

32
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:23,158
courses but expensive right so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

33
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,470
so this comes up a lot and one of the

34
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:27,960
things I I say is well you know there

35
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:29,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">are things you can do and one of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the big</font>

36
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,960
things is setting up a virtual lab and

37
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:33,540
that's kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> where this started out</font>

38
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:36,720
with but then I realized that that

39
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:38,009
wasn't really the place to start so the

40
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:41,189
<font color="#CCCCCC">question is why are we going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to set up</font>

41
00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:43,049
the labs and where to<font color="#CCCCCC"> start and so one</font>

42
00:01:41,189 --> 00:01:47,130
of the big questions is you actually

43
00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:49,490
want to work in infosec does everyone

44
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:52,589
here one work in infosec cybersecurity

45
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:54,570
anyone not sure this is a question

46
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:56,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">because some people they want to you</font>

47
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:58,289
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> hack</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they want to tinker they want</font>

48
00:01:56,189 --> 00:02:00,199
to get into various things but they may

49
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:02,369
<font color="#CCCCCC">not actually want to do it as a job and</font>

50
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:04,469
then the question is do you actually

51
00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:07,229
like doing infosec or do you like the

52
00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:10,410
idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing it</font>

53
00:02:07,229 --> 00:02:12,850
is everyone recognized that distinction

54
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:16,570
it's like hookah wants to be a pen

55
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:25,079
tester our hacker anyway who here likes

56

58
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:34,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">get that on camera so let's kind of zoom</font>

59
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:37,600
out a little bit so to the general

60
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:39,010
public what do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> do right if you're</font>

00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:46,780
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same thing with security a lot of</font>

86
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:49,600
people think oh you know there's a

they're all weird

93
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:12,090
so with security people that can't be

94
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:15,420
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like oh I want to be a security</font>

95
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:17,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">person and so what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> questions is what</font>

96
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:19,229
do you want to do in security you know

97
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:20,880
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to be a pen tester if you</font>

want to you know do things with snore so

100
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:27,930
the really question is you know what's

101
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:29,609
your passion what moves you you know

102
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:34,170
what are what are you really interested

103
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:36,090
in you know what makes you want to learn

104
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:37,260
more and what gives<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a rush does</font>

105
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:39,270
anyone ever get that rush when they're

106
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:41,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">working on something and they they</font>

107
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:42,750
figure it out there there you know

108
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:44,340
popping a box or they're writing a query

109
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:46,290
or you know they're getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> some code to</font>

110
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:49,530
work and some place a comma you know

111
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:52,350
everything works at angels sing right

112
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:54,179
and that's a good feeling right if you

113
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:57,320
never get that maybe this isn't the

114
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:59,940
thing for you if you're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like all</font>

115
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:01,860
writing I guess it worked time to go

116
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:07,230
punch the clock it's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a</font>

117
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:10,940
really really long you know career I

118
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:13,080
guess so and the thing is what<font color="#E5E5E5"> was you</font>

119
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:17,060
do you ever read about something<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago</font>

121
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:49,490

124
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:00,030

125
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,620

something awful I mean people who do say

143
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:55,570
that end up in a situation like this

144
00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:06,250

00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:49,330
especially as geeks a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of us are</font>

295
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:52,410
introverts right like me I'm obviously

very introverted and shy as my bio said

297
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:57,689
but this is a chance<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to people</font>

304
00:17:09,579 --> 00:17:14,500
in fact i would rather usually chat in

305
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:19,600
the halls of people then go to the talks

306

<font color="#E5E5E5">the talk i do recommend going to defcon</font>

Con is ok so def con is not for

317
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:57,370
everybody is that an understatement it's

318
00:17:54,610 --> 00:17:59,350
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> for everybody but it's really</font>

319
00:17:57,370 --> 00:18:01,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">eye-opening to go to in fact I worked</font>

320
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:03,219
with a guy who went to DEFCON a couple

321
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:06,280
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> years ago well more than a couple</font>

322
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:08,080
years<font color="#E5E5E5"> now and you know I said well so</font>

323
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:11,080
what you think your first Def Con he's

324
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:12,689
like I guess it's good to see what those

325
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:16,860
people do

326
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:18,300
all right and it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> easy oh</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you kind of</font>

327
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:20,870
had a little snare<font color="#E5E5E5"> he's like I don't</font>

328
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:23,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">yeah like I don't like those people um</font>

329
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:26,550
what he doesn't realize is some of those

330
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:27,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">people are his</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> co-workers and while</font>

331
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:29,340
there's a lot of black t-shirts and

332
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:31,290
mohawks there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of good</font>

333
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:32,939
information there and you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

334
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:36,899
get exposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to things that you normally</font>

335
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:42,360
wouldn't see the downside is it's huge

336
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:44,580
and chaotic and hot and you know it's

337
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:51,360
def con but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd recommend anyone from</font>

338
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:55,649
Utah especially go why from Utah<font color="#CCCCCC"> CCA to</font>

339
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:59,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">one party ah well there is that yes it's</font>

340
00:18:55,650 --> 00:19:01,350
what driving distance so there are

341
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:04,350
people who come from around the world<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

342
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:07,199
go to DEFCON people who drive across the

343
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:09,510
country fly in from Asia whatever for us

344
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:11,760
it's it's an hour-and-a-half flight or

345
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:15,870
you know a five and a half hour drive

346
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:19,350
it's also a cheap conference right how

347
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:21,570
much does it cost to get into DEFCON 2

348
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:22,649
20 so about two hundred dollars they

349
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:26,909
wonder what<font color="#E5E5E5"> it costs to get into black</font>

350
00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:29,670
hat seventeen hundred dollars<font color="#CCCCCC"> are essays</font>

351
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:32,580
about the same most of the bigger

352
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:36,270
conferences are pretty expensive DEFCON

353
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:38,460
two hundred bucks not too much you know

354
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:41,340
that may not be<font color="#CCCCCC"> something your employer</font>

355
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:43,200
will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be willing to pick up but often</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

356
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:44,879
can work on something like saying well

357
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:49,350
how<font color="#CCCCCC"> about I go and don't use vacation</font>

358

time anyone ever pulled that one yeah so

359
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:55,649
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not very expensive and then you can</font>

360
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:58,530
stay in Vegas for very little money i'm

361

367
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:19,110
thing is<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can eat cheaply</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> vague</font>

368

385
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:04,980
some smaller conferences that are really

386
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:06,750
great because one of the things about a

387
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:13,290
great big conference like Def Con is

388
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:15,800

392
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:29,879
you know hook up with people to visit

393
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:32,280
there's one<font color="#CCCCCC"> guy that I've been</font>

totally made up at Def Con and with all

398
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:42,240
the chaos and all that we basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> got</font>

399
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:43,800
a handshake in passing you know in 24

400
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:48,690
days because there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just so many things</font>

401
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:50,730
booked up so the downside<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that so the</font>

402
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:53,970
upside is everybody's at Def Con the

403
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:55,790
downside is everybody's at Def Con but

404
00:21:53,970 --> 00:22:02,270
there's these smaller cons you can go to

405
00:21:55,790 --> 00:22:06,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">jerk on z100 gherkin know it oh you have</font>

conferences in in Colorado but<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

412
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:28,290
smaller conferences are great because

413
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:29,939
usually there's not as many people you

414
00:22:28,290 --> 00:22:34,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">know the speaker quality varies a lot</font>

415
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:35,460
and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there what's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to one</font>

the conferences and watching these talks

418

is a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> times the topic when you're</font>

for can be colored by the speaker right

421
00:22:47,429 --> 00:22:52,320
there are some really really good

422
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:55,649
speakers who could make really really

423
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:58,649
boring topics super interesting there

424
00:22:55,649 --> 00:23:00,748
are some<font color="#E5E5E5"> really terrible speakers that</font>

426
00:23:00,749 --> 00:23:06,269
just incredibly arduous to watch so

427
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:08,369
that's a good reason to sample a lot of

431
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:17,309
of you who've gone to Def Con and you

432
00:23:15,389 --> 00:23:19,019
know waited in line for half an hour an

433

walks out or actually besides last year

437
00:23:27,379 --> 00:23:34,559
will call out that<font color="#E5E5E5"> person Danny yeah so</font>

451
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:21,809
want to learn malware in analysis and

452
00:24:17,850 --> 00:24:23,699
reverse engineering and he was really

453
00:24:21,809 --> 00:24:29,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">into he saw some talks at Def Con and</font>

454

what did<font color="#CCCCCC"> you do Jeff start playing Val</font>

malware analyst Jeff fully dove in to

461
00:24:47,009 --> 00:24:50,800
malware he's like hey this Bauer stuff

462
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:52,659
is pretty cool

466
00:24:57,730 --> 00:25:01,930
to try a little malware<font color="#E5E5E5"> analysis and the</font>

467
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:04,930
nice thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is is that you can go you</font>

472
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:28,780
with feeling right so it's not just

473
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:30,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">enough to read something once or watch</font>

474
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:32,680
something once right hopefully what this

475

is doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> is this is kindling something</font>

476
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:36,520
inside of you you're saying you know

477
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:38,590
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I really like malware analysis or I</font>

478
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:42,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">really like IDs or I really like</font>

479
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:44,020
breaking stuff or whatever it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is and so</font>

480
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:46,030
you get in deeper right you read you

481
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:47,770
find some books on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the topic you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

482
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:51,730
check<font color="#E5E5E5"> out OpenCourseWare is everyone</font>

483
00:25:47,770 --> 00:25:54,760
familiar OpenCourseWare is anyone

484
00:25:51,730 --> 00:25:57,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">familiar with OpenCourseWare few of you</font>

485
00:25:54,760 --> 00:26:00,190
so there so you've got MOOCs right I'll

486
00:25:57,550 --> 00:26:01,510
talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about those in a second but one of</font>

the are in RSA right what anyone think

495
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:29,320
it'd be cool to take a security<font color="#E5E5E5"> class</font>

496
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:34,020
from ron rivest you know does anyone

497
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:36,520
know who he's affiliated with MIT<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

498
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:39,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">there they're kind of like slick but in</font>

Massachusetts

500
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:47,200
so they have<font color="#CCCCCC"> ron rivest security course</font>

501
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:49,750
up on their website on the MIT

502
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:51,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">opencourseware site we even go out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

503
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:54,510
and download lectures and assignments

from what you know one of the leading

505
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:59,950
cryptographers out there doing research

506
00:26:56,500 --> 00:27:02,140
they have<font color="#E5E5E5"> tons and tons of courses some</font>

familiar of course era or EDX these are

522

cryptography courses anyone tried to

528
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:16,840
Stanford cryptography course what<font color="#CCCCCC"> do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

529

00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:37,120
damn bone but Boehner scores<font color="#CCCCCC"> Boehner</font>

name Bona but it's it's a really cool

539
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:45,790
horse and it dives into a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of theory</font>

540
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:48,310
and the mathematics behind crip devil

541
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:50,320
but there's courses out there on all

542

kinds of things risk analysis ethical

543
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,980

546
00:28:56,800 --> 00:29:01,990
things and one thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I don't have</font>

547
00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:04,210
up here that is really important is they

548
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:05,800
also have courses on speaking writing

549
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:08,260
things like that because one of the

550
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:10,060
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> I run into a lot what I'm talking</font>

551
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:11,770
to employers is there like this guy is

552
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:15,610
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> good at technical stuff but he</font>

553

here who likes to write documentation

555
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:21,520
for fun so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that that's something you</font>

556
00:29:20,110 --> 00:29:23,199
could work on with that because

557
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:25,180
basically if you can't communicate the

558
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:32,560
technical ideas<font color="#CCCCCC"> it doesn't matter how</font>

559
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:33,730
good<font color="#E5E5E5"> you are what's that was that</font>

00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:34,990
actually a commenters I just like

more<font color="#E5E5E5"> sources for that you can dive</font>

570
00:29:59,290 --> 00:30:04,899
deeper you can get black hat DVDs you

571
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:08,410

575
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:20,290
is big right does anyone here work with

576
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:22,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">anybody on something not necessarily for</font>

577
00:30:20,290 --> 00:30:25,899
their job but just something they're

578
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:31,150
interested in projects view people right

579
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:34,200

580
00:30:31,150 --> 00:30:34,200
interactive part you can talk

<font color="#E5E5E5">and you know go deeper but it also has</font>

584
00:30:53,970 --> 00:30:58,680
the kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the effect of you help each</font>

585
00:30:56,130 --> 00:31:00,720
other right and<font color="#E5E5E5"> plus you know for those</font>

586
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:02,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">of us are a little competitive you kind</font>

587
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:06,660
of don't want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be the worst guy on the</font>

588
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:09,360
team right the other thing the talk is

589
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:12,210
to give a talk who here is presented at

590
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:15,090
the conference before was<font color="#CCCCCC"> it a good</font>

591
00:31:12,210 --> 00:31:20,700
experience how did you feel about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

592
00:31:15,090 --> 00:31:26,459
topic you had like before and after any

593
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:27,690
difference no difference was it an<font color="#CCCCCC"> awful</font>

594
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:34,680
experience and you're never doing it

595
00:31:27,690 --> 00:31:38,190
again this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> awkward note for next</font>

596
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:41,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">time take presenta talk off and maybe</font>

597
00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:43,110
not present anymore um no so when you

598
00:31:41,490 --> 00:31:45,150
when you put together your talk did it

599
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:47,550
did you learn<font color="#CCCCCC"> anything more did it make</font>

600
00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:49,800
you think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about some things you know</font>

601
00:31:47,550 --> 00:31:51,600
it's different<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you know just kind of</font>

602
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:53,430
doing something by yourself we're

603
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:56,490
actually having<font color="#E5E5E5"> to stand up and you know</font>

604
00:31:53,430 --> 00:31:58,800
have slides or have slides and do a demo

605
00:31:56,490 --> 00:32:03,440
right all right is anyone done a live

606
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:03,440
demo on a talk how that<font color="#CCCCCC"> go</font>

607
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:15,510
good good man yes the demo gods are

608
00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:17,070
never in your favor but yeah so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

609
00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:18,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">need was a talk is that you go a little</font>

610
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:21,510
further right you dig a little deeper

611
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:22,650
and and you want to be competent you

612
00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:27,170
don't want to get up here and look like

613
00:32:22,650 --> 00:32:30,900
an idiot as this example seems to show

614
00:32:27,170 --> 00:32:33,210
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay but one of the things we get</font>

615
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:36,650
into is I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't understand</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talking</font>

616
00:32:33,210 --> 00:32:39,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right the I'm not that that ready</font>

617
00:32:36,650 --> 00:32:42,510
you know I don't know x does anyone run

618
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:44,220
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> that like hey I want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do this but</font>

619
00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:48,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">I have no idea how to do it where to</font>

620
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:50,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">start so my suggestion is that you play</font>

621
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:53,309
that's one of the great things is that

622
00:32:50,309 --> 00:32:56,760
with this you can mess around with it

623
00:32:53,309 --> 00:33:00,960
like for<font color="#CCCCCC"> example if you guys want to do</font>

624
00:32:56,760 --> 00:33:05,840
malware analysis what would you do right

625
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:10,559
now anybody who download malware<font color="#E5E5E5"> uh-huh</font>

626
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:16,949
you can in fact hello malware<font color="#E5E5E5"> download</font>

627
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:20,330
malware ? ? ? profit and then what would

628
00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:20,330
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do after you download your malware</font>

629
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:31,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay good good this is the stuff you</font>

630
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:35,250
should enjoy right you should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be like</font>

631
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:37,290
excited<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get malware not necessarily</font>

632
00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:39,480
on your production box well you<font color="#E5E5E5"> should</font>

633
00:33:37,290 --> 00:33:42,330
be like yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> awesome I found the malware</font>

634
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:44,390
or I I trigger this alarm or I pop this

635
00:33:42,330 --> 00:33:47,879
box something should grab your attention

636
00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:51,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay and i've got some suggestions on</font>

00:34:38,889 --> 00:34:46,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing learn Linux um this was the text I</font>

00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:49,480
got a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ago from someone</font>

653
00:34:46,389 --> 00:34:51,850
in this room<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not going to point out</font>

654
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:56,620
who it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> unless he wants to out</font>

655
00:34:51,850 --> 00:35:00,279
himself so he's not going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do it okay</font>

656
00:34:56,620 --> 00:35:03,460
that's fine<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not saying he's in the</font>

657
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:05,530
second row and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they ride or anything so</font>

658
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:09,640
news and they must<font color="#CCCCCC"> see what the problem</font>

659
00:35:05,530 --> 00:35:11,710
is with this I'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> read it for those in</font>

660
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:15,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">the back the message I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> got was</font>

661
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:16,720
apparently tar-gash CBF star file dot

662
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:19,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">are hoses</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the first file in the</font>

663
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:25,390
directory oops and my sympathetic reply

664
00:35:19,690 --> 00:35:27,160
was ha ha ha ha ha ha ha and then I

665
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:29,529
point out the first<font color="#CCCCCC"> Arg after the f is</font>

666
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:32,589
the file name of the new tat all because

667
00:35:29,530 --> 00:35:35,200
auto corrects for with the win and then

668
00:35:32,590 --> 00:35:37,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">tar ball and this was information that</font>

669
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:39,460
would have been useful two hours<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago so</font>

670
00:35:37,870 --> 00:35:44,319
what happened<font color="#CCCCCC"> does anyone know what that</font>

671
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:47,920
could handle do what does that command

672
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:48,940
do notice i'll call out Justin Larson

673
00:35:47,920 --> 00:36:04,900
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not going to call out your name</font>

674
00:35:48,940 --> 00:36:07,270
on the video right so so so it expands

675
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:08,620
out that and then tries<font color="#CCCCCC"> to put</font>

676
00:36:07,270 --> 00:36:10,570
everything in the first file name it

677
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:12,100
expands<font color="#E5E5E5"> because the dash</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> f is what the</font>

678
00:36:10,570 --> 00:36:14,020
file is going to be so it basically

679
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:15,819
takes all the files and dumps them into

680
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:17,860
the first file which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is really bad if</font>

681
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:21,280
this is you know has crypto information

682
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:22,109
for a hardware security module now

683
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:27,359
that's what

684
00:36:22,109 --> 00:36:31,019
happened so learning it's not the only

685
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:32,400
metal boxes that<font color="#E5E5E5"> will act by someone who</font>

686
00:36:31,019 --> 00:36:37,288
doesn't know linux who hears good with

687
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:39,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">linux who wishes they were better right</font>

688
00:36:37,289 --> 00:36:42,869
who messes with<font color="#E5E5E5"> linux a lot with was</font>

689
00:36:39,539 --> 00:36:47,039
their security job right<font color="#CCCCCC"> you do a lot</font>

690
00:36:42,869 --> 00:36:48,890
with linux<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I mean you just need to</font>

691
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:51,989
learn Linux so many tools run on Linux

692
00:36:48,890 --> 00:36:54,538
if you don't need to figure out<font color="#E5E5E5"> how to</font>

693
00:36:51,989 --> 00:36:59,279
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> something it will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> save you so much</font>

694
00:36:54,539 --> 00:37:00,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">time right and I had somebody who who</font>

695
00:36:59,279 --> 00:37:02,339

699
00:37:12,599 --> 00:37:19,019
which comes in to learn to automate

700
00:37:14,849 --> 00:37:20,099
right scripting is your friend when

701
00:37:19,019 --> 00:37:22,258
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> learning these things you should</font>

702
00:37:20,099 --> 00:37:23,789
<font color="#CCCCCC">learn how to script in some language</font>

703
00:37:22,259 --> 00:37:31,069
anyone have the favorite scripting

704
00:37:23,789 --> 00:37:32,730

00:37:32,730 --> 00:37:37,440
these days so I mean it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was kind of a</font>

710
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:50,279
pretty useful on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> pen testing side so</font>

711
00:37:47,819 --> 00:37:53,609
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> thanks Microsoft that was a</font>

712
00:37:50,279 --> 00:37:56,069
double-edged<font color="#CCCCCC"> sword so learn to script</font>

713
00:37:53,609 --> 00:37:59,119
learn to automate there are so many cool

714
00:37:56,069 --> 00:38:02,069
things you can do and the command line

715
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:04,499
you know you know for linux you could

716
00:38:02,069 --> 00:38:06,420
also do cool things with powershell but

717
00:38:04,499 --> 00:38:08,788
learn how to automate these tasks a lot

718
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:10,769
of the things we do are repetitive and

719
00:38:08,789 --> 00:38:14,309
you don't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you know have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to type</font>

720
00:38:10,769 --> 00:38:16,618
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> in over and over again there are tons</font>

721
00:38:14,309 --> 00:38:18,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">of tutorials if you look for bash</font>

722
00:38:16,619 --> 00:38:21,089
scripting tutorial or<font color="#E5E5E5"> python scripting</font>

723
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:23,700
or anything there's tons of cool things

724
00:38:21,089 --> 00:38:26,269
and it becomes useful even at lower

725
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:33,629
levels like<font color="#E5E5E5"> zen yusuke p for anything</font>

727
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:37,030
is

728
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:38,560
crafting module four packets yeah it's a

729
00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:41,080
packet crafting module it lets you do

730
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:44,200
really really granular things with

731
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:47,380
packets through<font color="#CCCCCC"> Python another</font>

732
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:49,839
recommendation learn a debugger right

733
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:52,119
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't necessarily need to be able to</font>

734
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:54,520
do you know a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of stuff but if you</font>

735
00:38:52,119 --> 00:38:57,270
have some idea of what debugging looks

736
00:38:54,520 --> 00:39:00,190
like it makes a lot more sense right

737
00:38:57,270 --> 00:39:03,840
like you see you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at a trace</font>

738
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:12,940
and you see a lot of nine zeros in it

739
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:15,600
right in X 90 anybody<font color="#CCCCCC"> knobs</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah</font>

740
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:17,470
so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't you know those</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things are</font>

741
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:20,740
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of tools out there I</font>

742
00:39:17,470 --> 00:39:23,319
mentioned it later but<font color="#CCCCCC"> korlann de has</font>

743
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:29,799
tons of great tutorials as Amon been out

744
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:40,330
to the korlann site good next big one

745
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:42,190
learn tracer<font color="#CCCCCC"> tea if that's why they make</font>

746
00:39:40,330 --> 00:39:44,290
you laugh go back to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk step and</font>

747
00:39:42,190 --> 00:39:50,670
ask somebody notice I didn't say

748
00:39:44,290 --> 00:39:57,279
somebody old this time tracer<font color="#E5E5E5"> tita</font>

00:39:50,670 --> 00:39:59,260
tracer<font color="#E5E5E5"> tea right but don't serve it was</font>

750
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:04,690
tracer t it it shows you everyone's

751
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:06,430
connection to google slowly what we need

752
00:40:04,690 --> 00:40:10,380
to just play the tracer<font color="#E5E5E5"> t video for an</font>

753
00:40:06,430 --> 00:40:13,419
hour it next<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing find some challenges</font>

754
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:15,040
challenge<font color="#CCCCCC"> yourself right make a game out</font>

755
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:19,180
of it is anyone familiar with the term

756
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:23,800
gamification turning stuff into a game

757
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:25,629
it and I mean of the you know I feel bad

758
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:27,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">saying this but it's something I use</font>

759
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:30,910
with my kids all the time right let's

760
00:40:27,609 --> 00:40:32,560
see who can<font color="#CCCCCC"> stay quiet the longest or</font>

761
00:40:30,910 --> 00:40:34,779
let's say you can put away their toys

762
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:38,560
the fastest right you turn things into a

763
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:42,460
game and suddenly it's fun right it's

764
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:44,109
also kind of manipulative but but there

765
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:46,470
are tons of challenges out there there's

766
00:40:44,109 --> 00:40:48,210
lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of online</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ctfs</font>

767
00:40:46,470 --> 00:40:50,399
there's you know a lot of conferences

768
00:40:48,210 --> 00:40:52,650
contests have archives of things to do

769
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:55,140
you know here if you want to find

770
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:56,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">something a great</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> place to start</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is some</font>

771
00:40:55,140 --> 00:41:00,410
place<font color="#E5E5E5"> where someone has actually put</font>

772
00:40:56,730 --> 00:41:03,330
something to find does<font color="#E5E5E5"> that make sense</font>

773
00:41:00,410 --> 00:41:04,770
so you go<font color="#CCCCCC"> out there you capture the</font>

774
00:41:03,330 --> 00:41:06,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">packet people you can go up and get</font>

775
00:41:04,770 --> 00:41:09,180
their network captures and look through

776
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:12,480
them and they've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> years of archives</font>

777
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:14,848
up there dc3 dot bill was supposed to

778
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:18,570
release their forensic challenges they

779
00:41:14,849 --> 00:41:22,770
haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> so far but they should have that</font>

780
00:41:18,570 --> 00:41:25,190
as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well so now we're to where I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

781
00:41:22,770 --> 00:41:27,990
starting with this build that lab right

782
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:29,250
virtual machines are your friends is

783
00:41:27,990 --> 00:41:34,310
there anyone who doesn't know how to use

784
00:41:29,250 --> 00:41:36,840
virtualization in here an tastic

785
00:41:34,310 --> 00:41:46,609
virtualization is pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> awesome for</font>

786
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:50,940
this stuff why isolation what else

787
00:41:46,609 --> 00:41:54,089
Kostya you don't have to own it right

788
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:56,339
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> like you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 15 years</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ago</font>

789
00:41:54,089 --> 00:41:58,500
where if you want to tap a linux box at

790
00:41:56,339 --> 00:42:00,270
a windows box and a<font color="#E5E5E5"> client all that you</font>

791
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:02,580
needed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have you know five different</font>

792
00:42:00,270 --> 00:42:04,530
desktops and you had<font color="#E5E5E5"> all these crappy p</font>

00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:07,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">to s and P threes that you'd cobbled</font>

794
00:42:04,530 --> 00:42:10,859
together to try to network no you can

795
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:14,339
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know this mac with has 16 gigs</font>

796
00:42:10,859 --> 00:42:17,790
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> ram you know I have another laptop</font>

797
00:42:14,339 --> 00:42:20,580
that's got 32 gigs of ram i can put lots

798
00:42:17,790 --> 00:42:22,680
and lots of machines on there and the

799
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:24,660
best<font color="#E5E5E5"> part about the VMS is that when i</font>

800
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:27,890
mess them up which you invariably will

801
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:32,700
when you're playing what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do</font>

802
00:42:27,890 --> 00:42:34,319
revert to snapshot right so yeah if if

803
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:39,680
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not using virtual machines you're</font>

804
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:39,680
doing it wrong so where do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> VMs</font>

805
00:42:40,490 --> 00:42:47,390
AWS sure if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to pay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for it some</font>

806
00:42:44,339 --> 00:42:47,390
of us are made of money apparently

807
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:53,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">14 cents an hour where am I going to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> get</font>

808
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:55,440
that kind of money what's that

809
00:42:53,570 --> 00:42:57,320
virtualbox you VMware Workstation

810
00:42:55,440 --> 00:43:00,810
there's plenty of<font color="#CCCCCC"> things out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there on</font>

811
00:42:57,320 --> 00:43:04,200
hyper-v I guess one of the problems is

812
00:43:00,810 --> 00:43:13,200
though so what about<font color="#E5E5E5"> Windows VMs can you</font>

813
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:16,350
get windows<font color="#E5E5E5"> VMs anywhere sure no no how</font>

814
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:18,660
about legit windows<font color="#E5E5E5"> VMs we get in there</font>

815
00:43:16,350 --> 00:43:27,420
modern<font color="#CCCCCC"> ie has anyone heard of this</font>

816
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:30,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">website what what is it right it's for</font>

817
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:32,970
its from Microsoft it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> designed for web</font>

818
00:43:30,180 --> 00:43:34,950
developers to test their their stuff but

819
00:43:32,970 --> 00:43:38,640
what versions of Windows doesn't have up

820
00:43:34,950 --> 00:43:40,230
there all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of it well not all of them I</font>

821
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:44,520
mean it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> like it's got 311 and</font>

822
00:43:40,230 --> 00:43:46,230
you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got to use like you I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

823
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:49,259
think of a browser from then but there's

824
00:43:46,230 --> 00:43:51,150
like you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> nzs a mosaic window it</font>

825
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:53,520
does not have that but it goes all the

826
00:43:51,150 --> 00:43:56,369
way back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to XP right if for some reason</font>

827
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:58,580
you want a windows XP machine with ie6

828
00:43:56,369 --> 00:44:02,280
you can just go download it from there

829
00:43:58,580 --> 00:44:04,380
it's a time bomb demo but on the desktop

830
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:09,300
it actually has the instructions on how

831
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:11,250
to rearm it so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty cool for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

832
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:14,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">while it was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not patched and you could</font>

wanted to look cool sometime around

835
00:44:16,790 --> 00:44:22,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">November they fix that because they</font>

836
00:44:19,290 --> 00:44:26,369
wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make my demo fail but you can</font>

837
00:44:22,950 --> 00:44:29,520
remove one security patch and it's

838
00:44:26,369 --> 00:44:33,869
vulnerable again there's windows XP

839
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:35,280
Windows 7 there's vista in case you want

840
00:44:33,869 --> 00:44:37,800
to test your website against the seven

845
00:44:44,250 --> 00:44:48,690
they're legitimate versions you can't

846
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:52,200
test your web app with right my web app

847

happens to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> metasploit sometimes so</font>

848
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:55,109
that's a good<font color="#CCCCCC"> place I mean you can</font>
