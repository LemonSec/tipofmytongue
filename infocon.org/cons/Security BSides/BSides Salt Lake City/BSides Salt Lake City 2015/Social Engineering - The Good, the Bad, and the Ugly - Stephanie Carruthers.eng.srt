2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:06,270
Stephanie and this is the good the bad

3
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:07,500
and the ugly of social engineering first

4
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:11,190
I'm gonna do a quick little introductory

5
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:12,929
about myself i am a<font color="#CCCCCC"> utah transplant a</font>

lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people wonder what brought us</font>

7
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:18,150
here before moving here we were briefly

8
00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:20,669
in DC and before that in<font color="#CCCCCC"> san diego</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

9
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:23,189
husband and I are both consultants so we

10
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:25,920
had the ability to pretty much move

11
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:28,080
wherever you want so we decided to play

12
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,859
a game<font color="#CCCCCC"> of chance we narrowed it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> down to</font>

13
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:34,760
two US cities which was between here and

also a place hotter than hell in Arizona

16
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:43,860

44
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:51,898
I hear why companies aren't actually

45
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:54,929
having dedicated social engineering and

46
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:56,520
has I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to wrap it all up and show</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">actually gotten to see the competition</font>

00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:13,770
the social drink captured by oh yeah

53
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:15,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright so before I jump into it I kind</font>

54
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:18,120
wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to define what social engineering</font>

55
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:20,310
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> just so we're on the same page social</font>

56
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:23,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">engineering at its core is manipulation</font>

57
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:25,470
it is manipulating people into doing or

58
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:29,130
saying things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> may or may</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not be in</font>

59
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:31,050
their best interests all right about the

60
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:33,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">competition the social engineering</font>

61
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:36,030
captured a flag or I'll also<font color="#E5E5E5"> refer to it</font>

62
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:37,920
as<font color="#CCCCCC"> the SEC TF it's held yearly at Def</font>

63
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:39,480
Con and what a lot of people don't

64
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:42,679
realize<font color="#CCCCCC"> is there's actually two phases</font>

65
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:44,700
to it<font color="#E5E5E5"> before the live calls there is a</font>

66
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:46,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">information gathering a reporting face</font>

67
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:48,839
and then whoever has the highest

68
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:52,790
combined scores of both<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the phases is</font>

69
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:55,950
the winner last year marked the

70
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:58,769
five-year anniversary for having the<font color="#CCCCCC"> SEC</font>

71
00:02:55,950 --> 00:03:00,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">TF and they decided to kind of mix it up</font>

72
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:03,030
a little bit instead of it being a solo

73
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:05,160
competition they made an attack team so

74
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:08,490
once you were chosen to<font color="#E5E5E5"> compete you</font>

75
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:09,990
receive your target um your target<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

76
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:12,450
then also<font color="#E5E5E5"> you received any random</font>

77
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:15,060
teammate and there were nine teams

78
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:17,579
competing seven of the nine teams were

79
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:21,540
female<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mel combinations and then the</font>

80
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:22,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">other two</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are Mel Mel about the flag so</font>

81
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:24,989
the flags were pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much broken up</font>

82
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:27,500
into three categories which was IP

83
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:29,730
information vendor information and

84
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:32,100
employee information but when i say

85
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:34,200
employee information we<font color="#E5E5E5"> weren't looking</font>

86
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:35,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">for things like their passwords or their</font>

87
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:38,579
social security<font color="#CCCCCC"> card numbers this</font>

88
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:40,230
competition it targets the company not

89
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:44,040
its employees so nobody was getting

90
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:45,840
victimized and then for scoring the

91
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:47,459
higher<font color="#CCCCCC"> the risk the higher rewards so</font>

92
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,650
something like what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> your schedule like</font>

93
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:51,840
maybe only<font color="#E5E5E5"> five points but if you can</font>

94
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:56,310
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> get the version of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> browser</font>

95
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:57,870
that's worth 15 points<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right any</font>

96
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:59,100
guesses what the highest value<font color="#E5E5E5"> flag</font>

97
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:00,600
might be what's something kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

98
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:03,209
malicious you guys think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we could</font>

99
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:05,700
get someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do over the phone no</font>

100
00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:07,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">guesses all right password well we were</font>

101
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:08,670
victimizing but that's a good guess we

102
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:11,790
were<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually seeing if we can get</font>

103
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:13,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">someone to go to a specific URL so on</font>

104
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:16,079
the phone having them type it in<font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font>

105
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:19,350
teammate and I were able to do that four

106
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:21,228
times<font color="#E5E5E5"> during our calls and so phase one</font>

107
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:23,610
this is the information<font color="#E5E5E5"> gathering phase</font>

108
00:04:21,228 --> 00:04:25,919
we had four weeks to collect as many

109
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:27,540
flags as we can find but we couldn't

110
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:30,450
actually go to our<font color="#E5E5E5"> target</font>

111
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:33,510
me in person or call them up we had to

112
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:35,099
find it all on the line online document

113
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:38,460
it and for every flag we were able to

114
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:39,990
find we<font color="#E5E5E5"> got half-credit and when I say</font>

115
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:41,969
open source intelligence the way we

116
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:45,450
gather things<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's information that's</font>

117
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:47,850
available online its public so places

118
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:50,940
like Google and social media<font color="#CCCCCC"> and even</font>

119
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:53,220
the company's own website this is a

120
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:54,960
graph i actually used in my report it

121
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:59,130
kind of breaks down the sources of how<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

122
00:04:54,960 --> 00:05:01,080
found all of my flags so about 75% was

00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:03,090
between<font color="#E5E5E5"> google and social</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> media and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

130
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:22,470
minutes total time to actually make our

131
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:24,990
calls to gather as much information as

132
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:27,780
many flags as we could but one of the

133
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:29,100
rules this year was no skol spoofing so

134
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:31,830
if someone calls you the first thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

135
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:33,660
do is you look to see<font color="#CCCCCC"> who it is that was</font>

136
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:35,490
working against us most employees know

137
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:37,710
or it corporate is this phone number<font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font>

138
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:39,240
at least<font color="#CCCCCC"> its area code but that was</font>

139
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:42,330
already<font color="#E5E5E5"> working against us and then also</font>

140
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:44,940
because of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the tag team we had to tag</font>

141
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:46,590
out or just transfer the call at least

142
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:48,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">one time during our call and then every</font>

00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:56,040
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> got an additional 10 points okay so</font>

145
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:58,380
20 minutes before<font color="#CCCCCC"> my scheduled time to</font>

146
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:59,640
actually make my calls I'm texting my

147
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:01,380
partner trying to get<font color="#CCCCCC"> a hold</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of them and</font>

148
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:05,130
he finally replies that he is way too

149
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:08,400
hungover to leave his hotel room I was

150
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:09,990
pissed<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I freaked out I tried to get</font>

151
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,969
my husband to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be on my team but he was</font>

152
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:13,470
already competing so I wouldn't work but

153
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:16,470
it won't be disqualified I had to find

154
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:17,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">someone so i was asking around and my</font>

155
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:19,410
husband got<font color="#E5E5E5"> his phone and called when</font>

156
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:21,659
his friends<font color="#CCCCCC"> who's at the competition and</font>

157
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:23,010
said hey<font color="#CCCCCC"> I need you here right away so</font>

158
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:26,610
he shows up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I explained my situation</font>

159
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:28,590
and he decided to help me<font color="#E5E5E5"> out so we were</font>

160
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:31,260
given a few extra<font color="#E5E5E5"> minutes to kind of go</font>

161
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:34,289
over our pretext<font color="#E5E5E5"> our target and what</font>

162
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:36,300
flags were going to be going<font color="#E5E5E5"> after so</font>

163
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:38,460
the pretext we use is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> background</font>

164
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:40,480
story<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's who we were pretending to be</font>

165
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:42,130
why we were pretending to call

166
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:44,710
and then also what flags were trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

167
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:47,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">gather so I already knew I was going to</font>

168
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:48,820
have red flags<font color="#E5E5E5"> going off with no call</font>

169
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:51,880
spoofing so I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to try to make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

170
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:53,800
seem<font color="#E5E5E5"> as realistic as possible so I</font>

171
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:56,290
decided we should play stereotypical

172
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:58,480
roles I being the female doing more of

173
00:06:56,290 --> 00:07:00,580
an administrative type position and then

174
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:03,310
Steve<font color="#E5E5E5"> being the male more of an IT guy</font>

175
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:06,250
kind of fits I mean no red flags and

176
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:08,370
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was doing my information</font>

177
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:10,600
gathering stage I was able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> find</font>

178
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:12,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">information on each store that we call</font>

179
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:15,040
it so I found<font color="#CCCCCC"> the managers full name I</font>

180
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:18,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">found the store number and i also found</font>

181
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:20,730
internal lingo so we were able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make</font>

182
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:23,650
five successful calls in or 30<font color="#E5E5E5"> minutes</font>

183
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:25,600
gathering us a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> points and then</font>

184
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:28,150
here's a picture of<font color="#E5E5E5"> us actually in the</font>

185
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:30,640
soundproof booth if we look scared it's

186
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:33,729
because we were it is very intimidating

187
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:35,469
<font color="#CCCCCC">not only is it like hot and dark you can</font>

188
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:36,790
kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of see you see the reflection you</font>

189
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:39,430
see all the people sitting on the ground

190
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:42,400
this competition has became so popular

191
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:44,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">DEFCON that there's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually a line last</font>

192
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:47,890
year there's a line 45 minutes just to

193
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:50,440
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the competition and this is a</font>

194
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:52,240
cool graph that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I got from the DEFCON 22</font>

195
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:54,040
social<font color="#E5E5E5"> injuring capture the flag report</font>

196
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:57,630
just kind of showing you the total teams

197
00:07:54,040 --> 00:08:00,040
and my team was smooth operators and

198
00:07:57,630 --> 00:08:01,719
then another graph from the same report

199
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:03,190
from high to low it shows you which

200
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:07,240
companies gave up the<font color="#E5E5E5"> most information</font>

201
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:10,690
during both phases pics or<font color="#E5E5E5"> it didn't</font>

202
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:13,450
happen this is us at DEFCON closing

203
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:15,280
ceremonies get<font color="#E5E5E5"> my black badge and then</font>

204
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:17,409
another picture so this kind of wraps up

205
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:19,599
the good my experience with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> sole</font>

206
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:22,150
shanira capture the flag so now let's

207
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:24,160
move on<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the bad i'm going to show you</font>

208
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:27,250
some big boner abilities that i'm

209
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:28,480
finding when I do my<font color="#CCCCCC"> se pentas but first</font>

210
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:31,030
I want to clear up a common

211
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:32,500
misconception so you hear all the time

212
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:34,659
that humans are<font color="#E5E5E5"> the weak link which is</font>

213
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:36,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">true but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you'll hear things like you</font>

214
00:08:34,659 --> 00:08:39,189
can't patch stupid or users are stupid

215
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:41,890
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's not true people are smart we</font>

216
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:43,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">hire them to do specific jobs because</font>

217
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:45,610
they know what they're doing but<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

218
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:48,520
can't expect them to know about security

219
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:51,310
if we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not training them properly all</font>

220
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:52,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">right so when I do my sea pen test I</font>

221
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:53,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">always start with Ellison whether i'm</font>

222
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:56,949
doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> vision</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fish</font>

223
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:58,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> physical security or security</font>

224
00:08:56,949 --> 00:09:00,729
awareness training so I look and I see

225
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:04,149
what information I<font color="#CCCCCC"> can find and gather</font>

226
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:07,269
on these people so when I do physical

227
00:09:04,149 --> 00:09:09,100
security look at badges I mostly look at

228
00:09:07,269 --> 00:09:11,529
them so I could replicate them I get the

229
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:14,589
orientation of how the layout is where

230
00:09:11,529 --> 00:09:16,240
pictures are placed their logo kind of

231
00:09:14,589 --> 00:09:17,860
that film and I also look for trappings

232
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:20,589
I look for how your employees are

233
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:22,269
dressed is it casual is formal things

234
00:09:20,589 --> 00:09:25,269
that I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to blend in you can also see</font>

235
00:09:22,269 --> 00:09:26,410
she has um her badge on her hip that's

236
00:09:25,269 --> 00:09:28,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">something i'd prefer because it's</font>

237
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:31,569
further away from the I it's a little

238
00:09:28,029 --> 00:09:33,730
less it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> your face I also look if</font>

239
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:35,680
they have any additional credentials so

240
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:38,230
not only<font color="#E5E5E5"> does she have a badge she also</font>

241
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:41,560
had the name tag that has two logos her

242
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:44,110
name and her position another giveaway

243
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:46,029
is lanyards you want to make sure you're

244
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:48,010
blending in so you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see if there</font>

245
00:09:46,029 --> 00:09:50,470
are company lanyards or if their

246
00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:52,300
personal lanyards if I would<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the</font>

247
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:54,579
time or budget to actually recreate a

248
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:56,500
company lanyard I would try to do

249
00:09:54,579 --> 00:09:58,920
something like<font color="#E5E5E5"> at least get the same</font>

250
00:09:56,500 --> 00:10:01,060
color and try to get the same thickness

251
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:03,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">all right this person works in the</font>

252
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:04,930
medical field and when you're looking at

253
00:10:03,339 --> 00:10:07,269
badges you really want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pay attention</font>

254
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:10,180
to symbology<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's letters numbers</font>

255
00:10:07,269 --> 00:10:12,430
colors symbols all these<font color="#CCCCCC"> things on these</font>

256
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:15,399
badges and they all have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a purpose so</font>

257
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:17,229
you can see the S on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> corner by her</font>

258
00:10:15,399 --> 00:10:19,209
picture let's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say that stood for</font>

259
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:22,149
the south wing of the hospital so if i

260
00:10:19,209 --> 00:10:23,439
were to replicate this badge I wouldn't

261
00:10:22,149 --> 00:10:25,449
show up in the north wing the hospital

262
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:27,970
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know people question me it</font>

263
00:10:25,449 --> 00:10:31,120
could<font color="#CCCCCC"> mean she has access to sensitive</font>

264
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:32,740
data or maybe a secure area and you

265
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,380
could see it how they yell on it this

266
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:37,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">just could be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the standard input on</font>

267
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:39,910
standard employee badge or it could mean

268
00:10:37,329 --> 00:10:42,010
that maybe it's she's a nurse so it's

269
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:45,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">all our sorts yellow or doctors have</font>

270
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:46,449
green you want a trend as many badges as

271
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:49,719
possible so you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

272
00:10:46,449 --> 00:10:51,250
general overview<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right visitor</font>

273
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:53,949
badges this is something else I look for

274
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:55,750
if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going into a small company</font>

275
00:10:53,949 --> 00:10:57,490
they're going to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pick you out</font>

276
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:59,260
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're trying to be pretend to be one</font>

277
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:00,639
of their employees<font color="#E5E5E5"> so this one actually</font>

278
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:02,709
has a lot of stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> going out for a</font>

279
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:04,329
visitor bad you can see the QR code and

280
00:11:02,709 --> 00:11:05,410
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> barcode so you definitely want to</font>

281
00:11:04,329 --> 00:11:07,479
scan those to see what<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

282
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:07,949
information<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're putting out before you</font>

283
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:10,710
go try

284
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:13,590
your pen test this one I show you what

285
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:16,080
sponsors name if I'm in this position I

286
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:18,240
like to<font color="#CCCCCC"> use someone like CEO or the CFO</font>

287
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:20,520
as a sponsor because nobody will

288
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:24,180
question you nobody will mess with the

289
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:25,560
CEOs<font color="#CCCCCC"> guests and looks the more likely to</font>

290
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:29,310
comply if I ask them for a favor<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

291
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:32,339
question this badge will not be the

292
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:34,619
heart to looking again<font color="#E5E5E5"> paying attention</font>

293
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:36,270
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> detail the actual date is in the top</font>

294
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:39,180
but the expiration<font color="#E5E5E5"> date is the next day</font>

295
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:42,060
I personally would take off the<font color="#CCCCCC"> X court</font>

296
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:46,079
required because I wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want an</font>

297
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:48,839
escort and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> workstation for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever</font>

298
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:51,050
reason people are putting pictures of

299
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:54,240
their workstations on social media<font color="#E5E5E5"> sites</font>

300
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:55,949
which I look for and all these pictures

301
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:58,140
by the way are things that I've found

302
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:59,970
off the internet they're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> clients</font>

303
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:02,069
pictures but<font color="#E5E5E5"> this picture is actually</font>

304
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:04,020
more of a placeholder reminds me<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

305
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:07,290
similar story that I couldn't use the

306
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:09,150
picture form so my<font color="#E5E5E5"> client they had their</font>

307
00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:11,969
company logo set for all the desktop

308
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:14,160
pictures how do you guys know the decal

309
00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:15,960
the bad boy peeing on something it's

310
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:18,089
only<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a different like four or</font>

311
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:19,590
things like that so he cropped the

312
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:21,780
picture of the bad boy peeing<font color="#E5E5E5"> onto the</font>

313
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:24,510
company logo and he<font color="#E5E5E5"> took a picture just</font>

314
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:26,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">like this and posted it on Twitter or no</font>

315
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:29,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's facebook so a couple days later</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

317
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:33,530
number and called him from<font color="#E5E5E5"> my team I</font>

318
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:36,719

319
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:38,910
he's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> in and changing settings so</font>

320
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:41,430
as she's scared he's more likely to

321
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:43,530
comply so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> say since I have you since</font>

322
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:46,829
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> messed with settings we need to kind</font>

323
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:47,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">of go over and do a quick audit to make</font>

324
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:51,870
sure you haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> changed anything else</font>

325
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:56,370
crazy for<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever reason this person</font>

326
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:58,950
took a picture of their outlook I see I

327
00:12:56,370 --> 00:13:04,620
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> even know why like the hashtag was</font>

328
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:06,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">workflow so uh what I would do if this</font>

329
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:08,880
was yeah so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would do is I would</font>

330
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:11,160
get all the information<font color="#E5E5E5"> on here which is</font>

331
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:12,330
their vendor what they're ordering and

332
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:14,850
the bottom you can see the account

333
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:17,430
number all this information and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would</font>

334
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:19,590
call up this employee and myself as the

335
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:22,979
vendor and get as much information as I

336
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:25,770
could out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them this guy is an actual</font>

337
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:27,450
government contract employee if I he's

338
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:29,640
taken a picture of his cool<font color="#E5E5E5"> healthy ish</font>

339
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:32,040
lunch it's healthy because it's sure if

340
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:34,260
the rebel<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess and what he didn't</font>

341
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:37,740
realize is what he left was his VPN

342
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:42,870
credentials this was on<font color="#E5E5E5"> Facebook guys</font>

343
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:44,790
his VPN credentials<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok so I also look</font>

344
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:47,400
for vendors there's a reason why vendors

345
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:50,640
are a whole category in the social

346
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:52,350
engineering um capture the<font color="#CCCCCC"> flag and the</font>

347
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:54,720
reason why we look for vendors like

348
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:56,340
let's say best<font color="#E5E5E5"> buy with my client I want</font>

349
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:59,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">to see who's associated with them so I</font>

350
00:13:56,340 --> 00:14:03,660
can replicate their uniform or I want to

351
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:05,280
see um<font color="#CCCCCC"> I must see companies who are</font>

352
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:08,400
bragging like these are all my employees

353
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:10,800
so not<font color="#E5E5E5"> only can you duplicate their</font>

354
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:14,520
uniform you can use this information for

355
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:17,280
fishing or fishing my last client<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was</font>

356
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:19,199
able to find 10 of their vendors sewn

357
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:21,180
addition<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> janitors or pest control</font>

358
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:23,580
like this company there's also lawyers

359
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:26,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">food service vending machine companies</font>

360
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:29,160
trash companies even shredded what if I

361
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:31,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">found out someone you shred it I could</font>

362
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:33,510
locate their uniform show up and think

363
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:36,240
of all the information I can get just

364
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:37,770
from those bins<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right let's talk</font>

390
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:48,599
employees or<font color="#E5E5E5"> co-workers putting this</font>

00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:54,450
things that are right next to cat bites

393
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:57,839

394
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:59,250
they're not they're not trained well so

00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:02,220
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> Twitter set</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> likes the point those</font>

people put<font color="#CCCCCC"> up of their credit cards and</font>

398
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:08,189
this is actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> me blocking now is</font>

399
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:10,830
employed people don't realize the risk

400
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:12,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">involved so for this thread for example</font>

401
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:13,530
someone said<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh thanks for the</font>

402
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:15,869
information I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to go shopping now</font>

403
00:16:13,530 --> 00:16:18,510
and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> person who idea haha you don't</font>

404
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:20,580
have those ccv codes but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's not true</font>

405
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:21,870
they don't realize the risk you can go

406
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:25,950
there's a number of sites where you

407
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:30,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't need the ccv code</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> alright let's</font>

408
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:33,180
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about fishing traditional physical</font>

409
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:36,060
security<font color="#CCCCCC"> or and sorry traditional tests</font>

410
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:37,349
with fishing<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not early social</font>

411
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:38,849
engineering there's no back-and-forth

412
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:40,560
communication you just send out an email

413
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:43,400
and see how<font color="#E5E5E5"> many people click a link or</font>

414
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:46,170
how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people will download something</font>

415
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:48,150
so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is kind of a story that's been a</font>

416
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:50,400
big fish<font color="#E5E5E5"> has been going around to ACH</font>

417
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:53,160
transaction it's been big for about two

418
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:55,860
years now so what these bad guys do is

419
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:57,959
they send out emails to your co-workers

420
00:16:55,860 --> 00:17:00,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">to your employees and what they're</font>

421
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:02,820
looking for is they're giving a sense of

424
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:09,480
information as they can then they create

425
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:12,208
this fake email thread which is pretty

426
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:14,189
much<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the CEO to the CFO and it's</font>

427
00:17:12,209 --> 00:17:16,020
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> back and forth and it starts with</font>

428
00:17:14,189 --> 00:17:18,209
like I'm so sorry we got this new vendor

429
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:20,579
and you kind of seem going back forth

430
00:17:18,209 --> 00:17:23,819
for a little bit and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> one of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

431
00:17:20,579 --> 00:17:25,919

434
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:33,240

435
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:34,950
taken care of so the CFO will actually

436
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:36,900
take this whole thread and email to

437
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:39,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">someone in accounts payable and say I</font>

440
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:45,200
the time they do<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so that's a really</font>

441
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:48,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">big fish that's going on right now</font>

442
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:50,720
it's more<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a social engineering one</font>

443
00:17:48,279 --> 00:17:52,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay wishing also known as voice</font>

444
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:55,760
phishing but it's pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> much social</font>

445
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:58,880
engineering over the phone for one of my

446
00:17:55,760 --> 00:18:01,460
clients<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was using the pretext I was</font>

447
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:03,049
calling from IT so I needed their phone

448
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:05,029
number so i was able to<font color="#CCCCCC"> spoof it I</font>

449
00:18:03,049 --> 00:18:07,789
couldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> find it online so i thought</font>

450
00:18:05,029 --> 00:18:09,889
maybe i can just call the receptionist

451
00:18:07,789 --> 00:18:11,539
and get the phone number before

452
00:18:09,889 --> 00:18:14,029
finishing my sentence she just

453
00:18:11,539 --> 00:18:17,149
transferred me to help this so Andrew

454
00:18:14,029 --> 00:18:18,889
answers the phone and I explained to him

455
00:18:17,149 --> 00:18:20,719
I'm sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think I might have gotten a</font>

456
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:23,090
wrong number what number is this so that

457
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:25,580
way<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had a number he said hold on I'm</font>

458
00:18:23,090 --> 00:18:27,799
new and I like Wanda pause the phone so

459
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:29,960
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> could squeeze</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for a second i love new</font>

460
00:18:27,799 --> 00:18:32,059
people and interns they give me the most

461
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:34,250
information so once he got back on the

462
00:18:32,059 --> 00:18:37,668
<font color="#E5E5E5">phone and gave me the number</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i went on</font>

463
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:39,919
to say my computer's acting crazy and my

464
00:18:37,669 --> 00:18:41,840
boss said just call IT and carry out

465
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:44,450
what they're using so you know to mimic

466
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:45,949
it and use<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same stuff he</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was so</font>

467
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:48,799
excited<font color="#CCCCCC"> to help me he spent 10 mins in</font>

468
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:51,380
detail going<font color="#CCCCCC"> over all the software</font>

469
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:53,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">versions and he said make sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

470
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:55,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">using internet explorer 9</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

471
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:57,649
internet explorer 10 is wonky with some

472
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:59,330
of our stuff so we ended the call with

473
00:18:57,649 --> 00:19:01,760
him actually giving me the SSID and

474
00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:06,168
<font color="#E5E5E5">wireless password because apparently i</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">just get passwords that's just strictly</font>

478
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:16,460
what percentage of their employees will

479
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:18,289
give me<font color="#E5E5E5"> the password so i made my list</font>

00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:19,940
of names and numbers i was going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

481
00:19:18,289 --> 00:19:22,070

482
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:24,169
employee and I like giving passwords

483
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:26,330
because not only like is it a challenge

484
00:19:24,169 --> 00:19:28,730
it's also kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of funny what people have</font>

485
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:32,178
their passwords s so I go through my

486
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:33,590
whole pretext of we ran patches and it

487
00:19:32,179 --> 00:19:35,360

<font color="#E5E5E5">me nervous when people are quite but</font>

496
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:55,820
before I<font color="#E5E5E5"> can open my mouth and explain</font>

497
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:57,649
keep going just seeing what I can get

498
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:59,149
out for him he said<font color="#CCCCCC"> he starts to whisper</font>

499
00:19:57,649 --> 00:20:00,949
I have people

500
00:19:59,149 --> 00:20:05,689
in the room and my password contains

501
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:07,249
profanity so I you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know try not to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> laugh</font>

502
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:09,589
and then I<font color="#E5E5E5"> said let me just walk you</font>

503
00:20:07,249 --> 00:20:10,519
through how to change your password so

504
00:20:09,589 --> 00:20:12,678
that way it's something you feel

505
00:20:10,519 --> 00:20:14,299
comfortable<font color="#E5E5E5"> so not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> only that funny to</font>

506
00:20:12,679 --> 00:20:15,739
see what people have their passwords as

507
00:20:14,299 --> 00:20:17,479
it's funny to see what they'll change

508
00:20:15,739 --> 00:20:19,369
them to when they think that they're

509
00:20:17,479 --> 00:20:20,869
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be giving it to IT so he</font>

510
00:20:19,369 --> 00:20:25,699
changed his<font color="#CCCCCC"> past or two I love my job</font>

511
00:20:20,869 --> 00:20:27,289
<font color="#CCCCCC">for P so that was actually learning</font>

512
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:28,639
experience for me from<font color="#E5E5E5"> that last client</font>

513
00:20:27,289 --> 00:20:31,190
I was able to get fifty nine percent of

514
00:20:28,639 --> 00:20:32,809
passwords but I realized people aren't

515
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:34,279
comfortable telling me<font color="#E5E5E5"> the password a</font>

516
00:20:32,809 --> 00:20:36,049
lot of time their personal things or

517
00:20:34,279 --> 00:20:37,700
their<font color="#CCCCCC"> grandma's names or maybe they're</font>

518
00:20:36,049 --> 00:20:39,979
stupid it doesn't matter they're not

519
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:41,419
comfortable so i changed my pretext up

520
00:20:39,979 --> 00:20:43,489
oh<font color="#CCCCCC"> i use the same warm with about the</font>

522
00:20:43,489 --> 00:20:47,089
how to change<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so once I did that on</font>

523
00:20:45,559 --> 00:20:50,200
the next client I was able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

524
00:20:47,089 --> 00:20:53,899
seventy eight percent of passwords

536
00:21:17,749 --> 00:21:21,440
the time I didn't realize I was doing it

537
00:21:19,879 --> 00:21:22,759
until I was explaining it to friend and

538
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:25,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">she's like oh you just did the psychic</font>

539
00:21:22,759 --> 00:21:29,809
paper trick so for my client they want

540
00:21:25,429 --> 00:21:31,639
to see if I could access get in through

541
00:21:29,809 --> 00:21:34,039
tailgating and things like that but<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

so I make it<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the bum certain floor I</font>

00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:21,379
with a box<font color="#CCCCCC"> of something you're probably</font>

563
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:23,389
going to hold the door open for me but I

564
00:22:21,379 --> 00:22:25,668
know if I'm coming at you<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a box of</font>

565
00:22:23,389 --> 00:22:27,889
<font color="#CCCCCC">donuts you'll probably ask me for one as</font>

566
00:22:25,669 --> 00:22:28,999
you're holding the door open so I have

567
00:22:27,889 --> 00:22:30,860
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make sure there's actually doughnuts</font>

568
00:22:28,999 --> 00:22:32,419
in the box but<font color="#E5E5E5"> if I were to give someone</font>

569
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:37,158
one they're more likely to help me<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

570
00:22:32,419 --> 00:22:40,399
later with a favor I wish it was it's

571
00:22:37,159 --> 00:22:42,860
easy sometimes sometimes tailgating and

572
00:22:40,399 --> 00:22:45,080
picking locks doesn't work so I kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

573
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:46,428
created my own<font color="#E5E5E5"> version of this does</font>

574
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:51,470
anything look weird with this picture

575
00:22:46,429 --> 00:22:54,769
other than the missing core what<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

576
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:57,019
now so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> how i added a UV marker</font>

577
00:22:54,769 --> 00:22:58,700
and a black light to my kit so when

578
00:22:57,019 --> 00:23:00,740
nobody's around<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the marker</font>

579
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:03,019
and make this drink down give it a

580
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:05,119
couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> um I just wait till a couple</font>

581
00:23:03,019 --> 00:23:06,769
people come in and out<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then I take</font>

582
00:23:05,119 --> 00:23:08,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">my flashlight and I see which ones at</font>

583
00:23:06,769 --> 00:23:09,980
the Markov I go back to my car and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

584
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:13,519
make a list of possible choices it could

585
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:15,289
be that's kind of my<font color="#E5E5E5"> version of finding</font>

586
00:23:13,519 --> 00:23:18,350
those all right<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's start</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with the</font>

587
00:23:15,289 --> 00:23:20,990
ugly these are excuses that I'm carrying

588
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:25,369
companies make why they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

589
00:23:20,990 --> 00:23:28,100
dedicated social<font color="#CCCCCC"> journey pentas they are</font>

590
00:23:25,369 --> 00:23:30,259
because it works we have a yearly

591
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:32,899
security awareness training in place or

592
00:23:30,259 --> 00:23:36,340
because it's too expensive and this is

593
00:23:32,899 --> 00:23:39,350
my response they don't make sense at all

594
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:41,990
so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> break it down because it works</font>

595
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:43,219
so you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> telling me because social</font>

596
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:46,669
engineering works you're not going to

597
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:48,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">train against it or don't you want to</font>

598
00:23:46,669 --> 00:23:52,340
know how it<font color="#E5E5E5"> works so you can train your</font>

599
00:23:48,169 --> 00:23:53,809
employees things to look out for or we

600
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:56,240
have a securely security awareness

601
00:23:53,809 --> 00:23:59,360
training already security awareness

602
00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:01,850
training stuck they are so bad<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going</font>

603
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:03,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">to get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit but you're</font>

604
00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:05,869
spending<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of this money on a</font>

605
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:08,360
mandatory security awareness training

606
00:24:05,869 --> 00:24:09,529
it's just a check in the box<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that</font>

607
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:11,809
brings<font color="#E5E5E5"> up the next point of spending</font>

608
00:24:09,529 --> 00:24:14,029
money so some companies are really

609
00:24:11,809 --> 00:24:16,580
expensive that's true but how much<font color="#E5E5E5"> did</font>

610
00:24:14,029 --> 00:24:18,889
you pay for your security guards for

611
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:20,240
your cameras for special locks<font color="#CCCCCC"> and all</font>

612
00:24:18,889 --> 00:24:22,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> much did you spend on it</font>

613
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:23,750
don't you want to validate it shouldn't

614
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:26,330
you test it to see if there's any

615
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:28,010
vulnerabilities also to get the most

616
00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:30,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">their money I think you should do a</font>

617
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:33,408
hybrid<font color="#CCCCCC"> approach which is not only</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> having</font>

618
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:38,539
your external yearly test but constantly

619
00:24:33,409 --> 00:24:40,130
be doing internal<font color="#E5E5E5"> tests and solutions</font>

620
00:24:38,539 --> 00:24:43,490
these are things that have helped some

621
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:46,220
of my clients in the past so to protect

622
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:48,169
all of your technology you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> ideas</font>

623
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:51,049
firewalls and the list goes on and on

624
00:24:48,169 --> 00:24:53,980
but what<font color="#E5E5E5"> about people you can't super</font>

625
00:24:51,049 --> 00:24:57,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">glue a firewall to a person's head</font>

626
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:58,940
unfortunately so what about people how

627
00:24:57,380 --> 00:25:01,580
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we protect people how do you patch a</font>

628
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:05,679
person let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> take it from nature how do</font>

629
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:09,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">we prevent crazy sorry prevent disease</font>

630
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:11,539
we vaccinate we slowly introduce the

631
00:25:09,529 --> 00:25:14,570
disease to the person's body to build

632
00:25:11,539 --> 00:25:16,309
immunity and this guy right here is

633
00:25:14,570 --> 00:25:19,820
Edward Jenner he created the first

634
00:25:16,309 --> 00:25:22,668
vaccine in the late 1700s I'm not saying

635
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:25,779
find some h1 cyber one and inject all of

636
00:25:22,669 --> 00:25:27,830
your employees<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm saying constantly</font>

637
00:25:25,779 --> 00:25:30,289
you're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> things to keep them</font>

638
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:32,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">security</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> minded constantly be testing</font>

639
00:25:30,289 --> 00:25:36,289
them it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a once a year thing</font>

640
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:40,039
so with testing have teachable moments

641
00:25:36,289 --> 00:25:41,510
this in itself will create such a

642
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:43,970
lasting memory with them it's a mini

643
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:46,100
training so<font color="#E5E5E5"> after</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I gather a password I</font>

644
00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:48,559
sit I explain<font color="#CCCCCC"> to someone hey I'm a good</font>

645
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:50,539
guy I could have easily been a bad guy

646
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:53,090
this is what you did wrong and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

647
00:25:50,539 --> 00:25:54,710
what you showed you and then when you

648
00:25:53,090 --> 00:25:57,080
test social during make sure you testing

649
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:58,580
all aspects you can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> just test fishing</font>

650
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:00,408
what if the bad guys are<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting in</font>

651
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:03,350
through physical security you need to

652
00:26:00,409 --> 00:26:04,610
see where your vulnerabilities are<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

653
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:08,029
then your security awareness training

654
00:26:04,610 --> 00:26:10,309
sucks it's bad it's distracting it's not

655
00:26:08,029 --> 00:26:12,740
engaging everyone here has<font color="#CCCCCC"> to take it</font>

656
00:26:10,309 --> 00:26:13,879
it's mandatory so just think about the

657
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:16,399
last time you took it you're sitting at

658
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:18,409
your desk your emails going<font color="#E5E5E5"> off your</font>

659
00:26:16,399 --> 00:26:20,510
boss<font color="#CCCCCC"> is calling your wife is texting you</font>

660
00:26:18,409 --> 00:26:23,659
to bring home diapers the list goes on

661
00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:25,760
and on you're distracted it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a one</font>

662
00:26:23,659 --> 00:26:28,700
size fits all thing different companies

663
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:30,200
have different vulnerabilities so what

664
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:31,789
they should have<font color="#CCCCCC"> they should be in</font>

665
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:34,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">person you need to be away from</font>

666
00:26:31,789 --> 00:26:36,679
distractions you also need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have</font>

667
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:38,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">real-life examples shown so like all</font>

668
00:26:36,679 --> 00:26:39,740
those pictures I showed you you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

669
00:26:38,690 --> 00:26:40,310
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> those in your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> security awareness</font>

670
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:42,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">string so</font>

671
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:44,780
people can realize oh I'm not supposed

672
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:46,070
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do this and you also need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to empower</font>

673
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:48,080
your employees to say no they need to

674
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:49,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">feel like if they get suspicious of a</font>

675
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:51,139
collar that you'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> have their back you</font>

676
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:53,990
need to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the CEO up there saying hey</font>

677
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:55,100
if you hang up on<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone that's okay if</font>

678
00:26:53,990 --> 00:26:57,530
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel uncomfortable that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right</font>

679
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:59,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't give them information and it's</font>

680
00:26:57,530 --> 00:27:01,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">this kind of the framework or lifestyle</font>

681
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:03,260
that life cycle that's helps on my place

682
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:06,200
so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have your external pen test once</font>

683
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:09,140
a year and then offer the risks you

684
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:10,780
create a customized training so they can

685
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:14,180
see<font color="#CCCCCC"> examples of what they're doing wrong</font>

686
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:17,420
but also internal you need to be testing

687
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:18,560
you need to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing training off of</font>

688
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:21,800
more vulnerabilities so that's

689
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:24,530
constantly going on<font color="#E5E5E5"> alright so let's do</font>

690
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:26,629
a quick recap<font color="#E5E5E5"> I talked about the good</font>

691
00:27:24,530 --> 00:27:28,850
which is my experience<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the socials</font>

692
00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:30,410
are in capture the flag I talked about

693
00:27:28,850 --> 00:27:32,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bad i showed you the samples of</font>

694
00:27:30,410 --> 00:27:34,850
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> people are putting out there that</font>

695
00:27:32,570 --> 00:27:37,700
they shouldn't be also talked about the

696
00:27:34,850 --> 00:27:39,800
ugly some excuses that we here I showed

697
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:42,620
you solutions so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how we change</font>

698
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:45,230
culture we need to make our employees

699
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:47,120
immune to this it has to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> just second</font>

700
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:49,130
nature to them so constantly testing

701
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:52,850
