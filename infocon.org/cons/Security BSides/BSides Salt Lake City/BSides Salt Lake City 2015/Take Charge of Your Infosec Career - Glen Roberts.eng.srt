1
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:07,830
ok guys so first of all I'd like to

2
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:09,600
thank all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the sponsors and the</font>

3
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:11,730
volunteers you know to set up this thing

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:13,020
it's been<font color="#CCCCCC"> a great conference so thank</font>

5
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:17,609
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I appreciate everyone that's</font>

6
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:19,140
attended as well so I've managed

7
00:00:17,609 --> 00:00:22,109
different structure and security

8
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:23,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">personnel for about 15 years and I've</font>

9
00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:26,220
learned<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things along the way</font>

10
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:27,538
and what I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> present is some of</font>

11
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:29,668
those key learnings and I hope<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you</font>

12
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:31,829
get some stuff out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it this should</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

13
00:00:29,669 --> 00:00:34,770
an interactive session so feel free<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

14
00:00:31,829 --> 00:00:37,140
just blurt out anything that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want at</font>

15
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:38,969
any time it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a big deal that should</font>

16
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:42,770
be encouraged it will sidetrack anything

17
00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:42,770
so we've got a<font color="#CCCCCC"> full hour here</font>

18
00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:52,510
to start out with now we're here to

19
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:54,550
develop our skills mostly technical and

20
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:58,620
most security conferences focus on the

21
00:00:54,550 --> 00:01:01,349
technical<font color="#E5E5E5"> I applied besides you know for</font>

22
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:03,910
taking on this presentation<font color="#E5E5E5"> which is a</font>

23
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:05,890
lot less technical and a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit more</font>

24
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:08,770
career sin trigger I think that's

25
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:11,680
something that's missing right now as an

26
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:15,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">example of the amount of attention and</font>

27
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:17,290
money we spend on conferences this is a

28
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:20,259
typical conference that's going on later

29
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:22,780
this year in Orlando it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> about five</font>

30
00:01:20,259 --> 00:01:24,190
thousand dollars for a class and then

31
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:28,270
you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> twenty six hundred dollars</font>

32
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:31,869
for the flight the hotel it's a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

33
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:34,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">money and it's it's worth</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> every penny</font>

34
00:01:31,869 --> 00:01:37,170
you know this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> something we're kind of</font>

35
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:40,000
used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to and it's good quality training</font>

36
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:42,280
but if we're willing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to spend that much</font>

37
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,930
money on a conference you know we<font color="#CCCCCC"> should</font>

38
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:46,690
be willing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to invest a little bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

39
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:48,640
time in our career as well to<font color="#E5E5E5"> supplement</font>

40
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:53,459
that we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go and talk through</font>

41
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:56,550
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of ideas for you to look at as</font>

42
00:01:53,459 --> 00:02:00,069
anybody spent seven thousand dollars

43
00:01:56,550 --> 00:02:07,860
travel and expenses course included

44
00:02:00,069 --> 00:02:13,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">before yeah more than 7,000 8,000 9,000</font>

45
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:17,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> eight thousand wow what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was the</font>

46
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:21,540
conference i sock a conference<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay note</font>

47
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:24,520
to self online training for aisaka

48
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:26,019
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright well it's pretty expensive and</font>

49
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:29,580
we spent<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of money like I said</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

50
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:32,440
security conferences and we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

51
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:35,680
but are<font color="#E5E5E5"> we also developing ourselves on</font>

52
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:38,620
our careers you know technologies are

53
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:40,060
constantly advancing and we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

54
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:42,879
learn those skills we need to stay

55
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:47,110
current but these technologies come and

56
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:49,329
go and if you strip away all those

57
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:52,209
technologies that are coming and going

58
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:54,760
you know we're still there and we need

59
00:02:52,209 --> 00:02:58,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to develop ourselves so that</font>

60
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:59,850
we're in it for the long haul so<font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font>

61
00:02:58,210 --> 00:03:02,230
I'm saying is

62
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:05,560
remember to develop yourself not just

63
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:07,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">your technical skills you know try to</font>

64
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:09,300
try to think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about when the last time</font>

65
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:11,950
was that you may be set down for<font color="#E5E5E5"> an hour</font>

66
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:13,570
even on a picnic table you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know just</font>

67
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:16,420
kind of sketching out your career path

68
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:17,709
like you know what an inventory of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

69
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:20,859
strengths you know where you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

70
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:22,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">with things and you know if it's been</font>

71
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:23,800
more than a year then then<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

72
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:27,160
definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> something you're going to</font>

73
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:29,050
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to focus on because you know you're</font>

74
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:32,560
the one constant in all of this you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

75
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:33,940
as the technologies come and go<font color="#CCCCCC"> so you</font>

76
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:38,170
know those technical skills are just one

77
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:39,550
piece<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a very big pie so to provoke</font>

78
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:43,329
you a little bit I've got a couple of

79
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:46,890
questions for<font color="#CCCCCC"> you who here is completely</font>

80
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:49,240
satisfied with their current employer

81
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:53,500
okay the guy in the back sitting next to

82
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:55,840
his boss<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay brown-noser okay okay but</font>

83
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:57,820
you know the truth<font color="#CCCCCC"> is you know there's</font>

84
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,470
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are satisfying about our</font>

85
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:01,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">jobs and there's also some things that</font>

86
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:04,660
aren't as satisfying and that's normal

87
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:06,070
but our goal should be to have a greater

88
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:08,320
percentage of the things that get us

89
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:10,359
jazzed<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyday and excited</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about our</font>

90
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:14,230
career the contributions were going to

91
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:16,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">make in the industry and such so other</font>

92
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:18,849
questions are you compensated based on

93
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:20,440
the value you deliver or you just come

94
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:22,600
in and punching the clock every<font color="#E5E5E5"> day and</font>

95
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:25,450
you know you could do a great job maybe

96
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:28,030
invent some really innovative technology

97
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:31,270
and not really<font color="#E5E5E5"> get any recognition or</font>

98
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:33,760
additional pay for it is what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you do on</font>

99
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:36,280
a daily basis is it making a difference

100
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:37,750
in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> world are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you feeling like it's</font>

101
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:40,510
making a difference you<font color="#E5E5E5"> are making a</font>

102
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:43,810
difference<font color="#E5E5E5"> and are you working on your</font>

103
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:47,560
life's work<font color="#E5E5E5"> and do you aspire for a more</font>

104
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:50,680
meaningful role so those are<font color="#CCCCCC"> just some</font>

105
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:57,390
provocative questions any questions to

106
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:57,390
reflect back to me right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now yeah</font>

107
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:26,750
no that's okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean I hey let me let</font>

108
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:30,080
me summarize the question and make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font>

109
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:32,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">that it's the right one but what I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

110
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:34,849
what you're saying is your job is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

111
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:37,400
a sliver maybe a large one but still

112
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:39,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's just a sliver of who you are as a</font>

113
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:41,359
<font color="#CCCCCC">person and where you're going long-term</font>

114
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:44,200
you've got some goals that are bigger

115
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:48,400
than just a job or a paycheck right

116
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:48,400
would you mind<font color="#E5E5E5"> sharing what that is okay</font>

117
00:05:48,910 --> 00:06:30,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">right on yep yeah it's a very good point</font>

118
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:32,180
i think it's it's different for everyone

119
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:35,750
i can tell you the way I deal with the

120
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:37,550
struggle is if I feel like I'm fighting

121
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:40,880
upstream all the time and I'm kind of

122
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:43,340
stressed out that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I know i'm i'm over</font>

123
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:46,219
allocating myself towards the job you

124
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:49,369
know when it becomes stressful instead

125
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:51,530
of passionate than I know I've gone too

126
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:54,470
far and maybe it's time<font color="#CCCCCC"> to take a break</font>

127
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:58,760
and reevaluate things you know take a

128
00:06:54,470 --> 00:07:00,530
break take a weekend but let's let's

129
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:02,560
continue on and let's see if<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of the</font>

130
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:04,789
bullets address<font color="#E5E5E5"> your concern I'm</font>

131
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">thinking in a couple of slides or maybe</font>

132
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:09,730
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's helpful but I</font>

133
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:09,729
appreciate<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> question</font>

134
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:15,979
so the whole point of this talk is

135
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:17,510
really empowering you and<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

136
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:18,980
getting in that mindset that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

137
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:21,349
you can take charge of your own

138
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:22,940
information security career there's some

139
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:24,650
things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you might be able to</font>

140
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:26,780
influence but there's a lot of things

141
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:30,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you can completely take ownership</font>

142
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:33,530
of and and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the majority of this</font>

143
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:35,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">topic so if you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not jazzed about what</font>

144
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:37,400
you do every day it's it's definitely

145
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:39,979
time for a change that doesn't mean you

146
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:41,390
need to go out and quit but there's

147
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:43,700
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> needs to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> change and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

148
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:47,240
could<font color="#CCCCCC"> be your attitude it could be that</font>

149
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:48,800
what you enjoy doing you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not doing as</font>

150
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:50,810
much of right now and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to talk</font>

151
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,250
to your<font color="#CCCCCC"> boss about a role change or</font>

152
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:55,970
propose a new role all together that

153
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:59,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">sort of thing but life is short and we</font>

154
00:07:55,970 --> 00:08:01,730
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the most of it and do what</font>

155
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:03,170
we love doing with the people<font color="#CCCCCC"> we love</font>

156
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:06,590
doing it with you know like this

157
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:09,980
security community so that should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

158
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:11,479
part of our goals<font color="#E5E5E5"> and living our purpose</font>

159
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:13,850
and focusing on delivering that life

160
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:16,940
life's work that's what your career

161
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:19,670
should be about and if you can get an

162
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:21,590
alignment between what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do in</font>

163
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:25,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">your life and what you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing in your</font>

164
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:27,200
career it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> really good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> feeling</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and I</font>

165
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:28,520
think that gives one purpose<font color="#E5E5E5"> and a</font>

166
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:32,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">feeling of confidence that they're on</font>

167
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:35,360
the right path you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are the main</font>

168
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:36,650
ingredient to your success so it's

169
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:43,400
important<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> take charge of that</font>

170
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:46,280
career<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so I've got two mindsets to</font>

171
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:48,319
compare here one of them is what i call

172
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:50,569
the victim hood mentality which is

173
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,460
obviously negative negative nancy kind

174
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:55,490
of stuff and the other is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that take</font>

175
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:58,250
charge mentality so just to compare that

176
00:08:55,490 --> 00:09:01,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">the two here with the take-charge</font>

177
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:05,060
mentality you have a vision to fulfill

178
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:07,430
with your career<font color="#CCCCCC"> and so your career is</font>

179
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:09,709
kind of a building block in your path

180
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:12,969
and so you're picking<font color="#E5E5E5"> your employer's</font>

181
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:15,680
based on how to further your life's work

182
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:18,080
the victim mentality side of things

183
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:21,140
would be you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> feeling like they have</font>

184
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,889
a vision<font color="#CCCCCC"> for you and they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are using up</font>

185
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:25,579
your career

186
00:09:21,889 --> 00:09:28,670
and perhaps wasting your time on the

187
00:09:25,579 --> 00:09:31,699
take-charge side you're maximizing your

188
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:35,059
impact in the world through<font color="#CCCCCC"> your career</font>

189
00:09:31,699 --> 00:09:37,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">on the victimhood side you feel like</font>

190
00:09:35,059 --> 00:09:39,259
you're not<font color="#CCCCCC"> good enough</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to make an impact</font>

191
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:43,009
how could you<font color="#E5E5E5"> possibly make an impact</font>

192
00:09:39,259 --> 00:09:46,790
you know that's sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of thinking on the</font>

193
00:09:43,009 --> 00:09:49,069
take-charge side you have a deliberate

194
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:52,069
effort to align your work with your

195
00:09:49,069 --> 00:09:53,660
career goals and it's a constant work

196
00:09:52,069 --> 00:09:56,479
kind of like trimming sails if you're

197
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:58,189
sailing on the victimhood side you're

198
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,529
doing what people<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell you to do and</font>

199
00:09:58,189 --> 00:10:01,939
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> going through the motions and you</font>

200
00:10:00,529 --> 00:10:05,779
just end<font color="#E5E5E5"> up wherever they throw you</font>

201
00:10:01,939 --> 00:10:07,790
wherever they need you and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the last one</font>

202
00:10:05,779 --> 00:10:10,459
on the on a take-charge side recognize

203
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:12,040
when it's time to<font color="#E5E5E5"> move on so that you</font>

204
00:10:10,459 --> 00:10:14,959
can continue<font color="#CCCCCC"> your growth on the</font>

205
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:17,509
victimhood side<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're stagnating at</font>

206
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:20,238
your current job you're just paralyzed

207
00:10:17,509 --> 00:10:22,809
by your fear of well what if I left you

208
00:10:20,239 --> 00:10:25,129
know am I going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get another job and</font>

209
00:10:22,809 --> 00:10:28,719
some things I saw on the slide i really

210
00:10:25,129 --> 00:10:31,040
think that the on the victimhood point<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

211
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:33,949
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we've all been here I know that I</font>

212
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:35,809
have but you're waiting for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a promotion</font>

213
00:10:33,949 --> 00:10:37,639
and maybe you're waiting for<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

214
00:10:35,809 --> 00:10:38,899
performance review cycle you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> waiting</font>

215
00:10:37,639 --> 00:10:40,999
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a promotion you're waiting for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

216
00:10:38,899 --> 00:10:45,379
raise you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> waiting for someone to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tell</font>

217
00:10:40,999 --> 00:10:47,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">you that you did a good job and you know</font>

218
00:10:45,379 --> 00:10:49,579
maybe the the corporation is offering

219
00:10:47,779 --> 00:10:51,529
some accouterments for you to stay with

220
00:10:49,579 --> 00:10:53,269
them<font color="#E5E5E5"> from a retention standpoint even</font>

221
00:10:51,529 --> 00:10:55,839
though you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> liking what</font>

222
00:10:53,269 --> 00:10:59,329
you're doing I consider that all

223
00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:01,040
victimhood and so the goal is to

224
00:10:59,329 --> 00:11:04,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">obviously be more on the take-charge</font>

225
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:25,849
mentality side of it any questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

226
00:11:04,069 --> 00:11:28,069
that yeah yeah so how do you balance the

227
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:29,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">the mantra of you know if you're not</font>

228
00:11:28,069 --> 00:11:33,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">enjoying what you're doing making a</font>

229
00:11:29,899 --> 00:11:35,270
change in moving on versus you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

230
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:37,790
there could be a danger of

231
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:41,800
moving on constantly and you know not

232
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:43,670
being able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hold a job I think that</font>

233
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:46,699
there's a whole lot that<font color="#CCCCCC"> goes into</font>

234
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:48,770
making the change so you know you have

235
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:51,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">to validate some assumptions when you</font>

236
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:53,810
set about making a change you need to

237
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:55,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">make sure that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> first of all the change</font>

238
00:11:53,810 --> 00:11:58,099
would really be in alignment with your

239
00:11:55,430 --> 00:12:00,680
career<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that means asking a potential</font>

240
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:02,660
employer and some of the employees some

241
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:04,339
really tough questions that you feel

242
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:05,870
uncomfortable doing that you might feel

243
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:07,880
like it's going to blow it on the

244
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:12,020
interview but you really<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to make</font>

245
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:14,990
sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's a good fit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and you know</font>

246
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:19,699
josh moore was on the podcast recently

247
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:22,040
and he wrote something about you know if

248
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:23,810
you share certain things with an

249
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:26,630
employer they may not call you in for an

250
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:29,359
interview such as you know your race or

251
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:31,370
you know gender things of this nature

252
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:34,040
would you know your true nature who you

253
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:39,080
are and I really thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was powerful</font>

254
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:42,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">when he said that if they don't like you</font>

255
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:44,600
for who you are then you shouldn't work

256
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:46,130
there anyway right because<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's just not</font>

257
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:48,760
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a good fit for whatever</font>

258
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:52,490
reason it is whether it's legal or not

259
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:55,550
so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think a lot of a lot of the ways to</font>

260
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:57,770
prevent thrashing when you're looking

261
00:12:55,550 --> 00:13:00,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> new jobs all the time is to make</font>

262
00:12:57,770 --> 00:13:03,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">sure it's a very deliberate move and you</font>

263
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:05,000
might have to sleep on<font color="#CCCCCC"> it I also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like it</font>

264
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:09,439
when I see people talking to other

265
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:11,660
people about the change and you know

266
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:13,610
mentorship and find out you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> bounce</font>

267
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:16,100
some ideas off them see what they think

268
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:18,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just get some independent views tap</font>

269
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:25,250
into that mastermind concept good

270
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:28,310
question so what I've got here are five

271
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:31,700
tips over the next few slides or owning

272
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:35,030
your info<font color="#E5E5E5"> set career and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's visualize</font>

273
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:37,820
your success create a plan builder brand

274
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:41,500
builder network and take action action

275
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:41,500
being a pretty important part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

276
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:46,160
on the first one to visualize your

277
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:48,859
success I've created this model here

278
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:51,620
that I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of think about and I</font>

279
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:54,940
call<font color="#E5E5E5"> it the pads model and it's a</font>

280
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:58,160
purpose which<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the most important part</font>

281
00:13:54,940 --> 00:14:00,710
having a definitive purpose you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

282
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:04,310
what you're passionate about what makes

283
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:08,450
you unique that sort of thing and having

284
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:10,489
a great<font color="#E5E5E5"> attitude and it's important to</font>

285
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:14,780
really focus on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the attitude I think in</font>

286
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:17,920
our space because a lot of what we do is

287
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:20,540
some of the darker side does anyone here

288
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:22,339
focus on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the darker side of infosec</font>

289
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:24,140
where you know you're reading<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

290
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:29,570
that you just<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't believe someone is</font>

291
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:30,980
doing yeah that kind of takes a toll on

292
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:32,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">your attitude and you got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to get</font>

293
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:36,710
refreshed you got to refill your your

294
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:40,130
attitudinal pot discipline<font color="#E5E5E5"> is pretty</font>

295
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:41,810
important too because some of the things

296
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:44,450
that's important to your career requires

297
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:48,469
a certain cadence you know like<font color="#E5E5E5"> keeping</font>

298
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:50,000
up relations with various friends former

299
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:52,130
co-workers that sort of thing that

300
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,890
requires a discipline it won't just

301
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:56,720
happen on its own left to your own

302
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:59,689
accord that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you probably wouldn't do</font>

303
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:02,540
those things discipline would be putting

304
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:06,050
a calendar invite for yourself to sit

305
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:07,880
down<font color="#CCCCCC"> for a one hour once a quarter to</font>

306
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:10,189
look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> your career plan figure out if</font>

307
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:12,020
the goals are still the same and where

308
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:14,870
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are relative to those goals and if</font>

309
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:17,780
you want to make some shifts at all and

310
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:20,390
of course skills it's I saved it for

311
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:21,770
last for a reason you know I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

312
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:23,360
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to dwell on the skills too much</font>

313
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:25,910
that i will say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's more than just</font>

314
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:27,440
the technical it's also the leadership

315
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:30,170
skills and building the next generation

316
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:36,350
of security professionals<font color="#E5E5E5"> that will come</font>

317
00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:38,329
after us so one of the things with this

318
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:42,230
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> triangle here the pads model is</font>

319
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:45,110
that I'm advocating that if you're only

320
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:47,660
focused on any one area of that triangle

321
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:49,250
you're not going to get it<font color="#E5E5E5"> done and if</font>

322
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:52,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">you do get something done it's not going</font>

323
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:53,990
to be complete to really<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a rich</font>

324
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:55,910
career you're going to have to focus on

325
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:57,620
all of them

326
00:15:55,910 --> 00:16:01,160
you ever known someone that had<font color="#E5E5E5"> great</font>

327
00:15:57,620 --> 00:16:03,290
skills but had a bad attitude you know

328
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:06,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's kind of career limiting I think</font>

329
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:09,140
we've all known people like that and

330
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:12,380
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> about someone who has great</font>

331
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:15,290
discipline skills but they had no

332
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:16,850
definitive purpose you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know this from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

333
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:19,219
profile perspective might be<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone</font>

334
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:21,920
that's new to<font color="#CCCCCC"> infosec and you know they</font>

335
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:23,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">can be counted on but they they're just</font>

336
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:28,880
kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> wandering they don't know where</font>

337
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:30,770
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going yet so you know the point</font>

338
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:34,310
is embrace embrace all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the challenges</font>

339
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:37,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">that come up with your attitude purpose</font>

340
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:40,239
skills discipline anything that<font color="#CCCCCC"> makes</font>

341
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:42,860
you uncomfortable in any of these areas

342
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:44,450
really focus on it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to do it</font>

343
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:48,620
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> that uncomfortable feeling is</font>

344
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:51,980
you growing so make the most of wherever

345
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:54,320
you are as well so your job if you're

346
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:56,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">not enjoying some aspects of your job</font>

347
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:58,880
make the most of<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you can with it</font>

348
00:16:56,630 --> 00:17:00,800
and I'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to you a little</font>

349
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:02,420
bit later about some things that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

350
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:06,139
do to have those<font color="#CCCCCC"> conversations with your</font>

351
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:08,389
boss etc to make that a better role but

352
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:13,910
just try to maximize all the experiences

353
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:20,450
that come your way so this slide here is

354
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:24,020
an interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> one the the plan consists</font>

355
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:27,170
of defining what your mission<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what</font>

356
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:28,730
your goals are identifying the gaps that

357
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:30,610
you have in yourself right now and your

358
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:33,110
experience maybe your resume and

359
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:35,919
developing an action plan to fill those

360
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:38,990
gaps and then taking<font color="#E5E5E5"> action and</font>

361
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:44,120
continually reassessing where you are

362
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:46,820
relative<font color="#CCCCCC"> to that plan so on the goals</font>

363
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:50,270
piece we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about short-term and</font>

364
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:52,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">long-term goals and when you're</font>

365
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:55,400
identifying gaps think of it in terms of

366
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:59,149
it could<font color="#E5E5E5"> be training gaps technical</font>

367
00:17:55,400 --> 00:18:04,490
skills interpersonal skills maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

368
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:06,830
presenting that sort of thing and on

369
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:09,740
your action plan I like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think in</font>

370
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:12,830
terms of one<font color="#E5E5E5"> year to year three or five</font>

371
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:15,200
10 20 and you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's why you have</font>

372
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:18,460
this cone this career cone here which

373
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm going to go over in just a second</font>

374
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:24,379
the the continual assessment part<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

375
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:27,350
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the most important piece</font>

376
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:28,809
because this is what determines how fast

377
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:31,699
you're going to advance in your career

378
00:18:28,809 --> 00:18:33,950
so the more frequently you assess where

379
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:36,020
you are relative<font color="#E5E5E5"> to your plan and start</font>

380
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:38,480
tweaking certain things if<font color="#CCCCCC"> they need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

381
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:40,010
be tweaked the more confident you're

382
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:42,530
going to be that your head at the right

383
00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:44,570
direction because you will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be you'll be</font>

384
00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:47,149
making changes ever so slightly along

385
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:50,480
the way it's important that when you try

386
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:53,870
certain things and it doesn't work out

387
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:55,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you get back up and try it again</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

388
00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:57,830
it's the right thing but maybe you do it

389
00:18:55,550 --> 00:19:00,879
a different way but the point is you

390
00:18:57,830 --> 00:19:03,199
don't give up you keep persevering and

391
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:05,410
making tweaks to the way that you

392
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:08,210
proceed and that's all part of the

393
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:13,250
continual assessment and feedback tube

394
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:17,559
lessons<font color="#CCCCCC"> learn so with the with the cone</font>

395
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:20,360
there this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just an example it doesn't</font>

396
00:19:17,559 --> 00:19:23,059
work this way for everyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> in security</font>

397
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:25,490
but imagine on the far left side of the

398
00:19:23,059 --> 00:19:28,490
cone you're starting out as a noob just

399
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:30,140
getting into<font color="#E5E5E5"> security and you're going</font>

400
00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:32,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">to progress through that cone all the</font>

401
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:35,450
way to see is<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh I'm not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> advocating that</font>

402
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:38,000
everyone should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> a CISO either this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

403
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:40,309
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> an example though if you were to</font>

404
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:44,540
lay out a career plan in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> fashion</font>

405
00:19:40,309 --> 00:19:48,050
similar to this and have a few steps in

406
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:50,149
between<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that it will inspire you</font>

407
00:19:48,050 --> 00:19:52,399
to come up with actions that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you should</font>

408
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:56,110
be taking along that road and those

409
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:58,370
actions along the top our experiences

410
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:59,809
connections you know making connections

411
00:19:58,370 --> 00:20:02,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">with people in the community could be</font>

412
00:19:59,809 --> 00:20:04,870
connections in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the business and</font>

413
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:06,590
knowledge skills abilities

414
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:09,469
accomplishments that would be expected

415
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:12,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">of you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> projects publications and</font>

presentations that you might deliver

417
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:19,250
these are things that I would say as a

418
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:21,650
noob as an analyst if you knew<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font>

were<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be a CISO I think it would</font>

00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:25,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">be a good idea</font>

421
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:26,850
way back there to have a bullet that

422
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:30,120
you're going to be bragging about when

423
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:32,730
you go to interview as a CISO so we're

424
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:37,168
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about maybe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there is a magazine</font>

425

be taking those steps all along also I

433
00:20:55,409 --> 00:21:00,840
like the analogy of lock-picking does

436
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:10,710
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are kind of pins these phases</font>

those pins and unlock your dreams on the

445
00:21:32,010 --> 00:21:38,220
subject<font color="#CCCCCC"> of building your brand I think</font>

446
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:39,780
it's important first of all to say we've

447
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:42,960
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> got a brand whether we know it or</font>

448
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:45,480
not and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just need to be conscious of</font>

449
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:48,270
it and whatever that brand is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we</font>

00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:53,400
who we really are and be authentic

452
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:55,169
because anything else just won't last

453
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:57,419
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know there's only</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what makes you</font>

456
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:05,940
it's good<font color="#E5E5E5"> to kind of focus on your</font>

uniqueness and some of the things that

00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:20,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can do to project your brand would</font>

00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:28,470
the presentations you might give

or get additional clients on building

472
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:58,950
your network I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that one of the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">most important things we can do in our</font>

build relationships<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you know cause</font>

476
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:10,080
those relationships to become deeper and

end<font color="#E5E5E5"> up working with them for them maybe</font>

480
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:17,970
they work for<font color="#E5E5E5"> you down the road but i</font>

481
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:21,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">think the relationships are everything</font>

482
00:23:17,970 --> 00:23:23,820
and the way to build those<font color="#E5E5E5"> relationships</font>

483
00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:26,460
is to think about<font color="#CCCCCC"> it as you're building</font>

484
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:27,899
your network and taking a genuine

485
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:29,640
interest<font color="#CCCCCC"> in people that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you meet and</font>

486
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:32,040
finding<font color="#E5E5E5"> out what they're skilled at</font>

487
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:36,000
maybe they have skills<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you don't</font>

488
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:38,250
and it complements you so you want to

489
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">build your relationships with others you</font>

490
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:42,780
could do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> by helping them adding</font>

491
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:46,950
value to them helping market their

492
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:50,129
skills provide introductions and help

493
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:53,310
others to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be successful</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in expanding</font>

494
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:55,380
their networks so it's important to

495
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:57,840
nurture the relationships as<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mentioned</font>

496
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:59,730
earlier and stay in constant<font color="#E5E5E5"> contact</font>

497
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:02,040
with these individuals<font color="#E5E5E5"> even if they no</font>

498
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:05,490
longer work at the place<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you were</font>

500

quotes is the sales guy<font color="#CCCCCC"> Zig Ziglar it</font>

501
00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:15,300
says you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> have everything in life you</font>

502

want if you'll just help enough other

503
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:20,460
people get what they want and I really

504
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:22,890
believe in that philosophy because I

505
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:28,230
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you know in service to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> others</font>

506
00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:30,000
a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of times we find</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ourselves and we</font>

507
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:39,410
also find that those other people<font color="#E5E5E5"> help</font>

508
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:45,530
us in our time of need the last

509
00:24:39,410 --> 00:24:48,620
up taking action so it's not enough<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

510
00:24:45,530 --> 00:24:51,670
know what to do and just<font color="#CCCCCC"> leave it as an</font>

511
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:54,560
idea you really have to take action and

512
00:24:51,670 --> 00:24:57,350
so you want to unleash your gifts<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

00:24:54,560 --> 00:25:00,649
world and deliver your life's work your

514
00:24:57,350 --> 00:25:04,189
art and to do that you have to

515
00:25:00,650 --> 00:25:06,740
constantly stay focused on taking action

516
00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:10,480
and knowing when good enough is good

517
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:15,320
enough<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have to seek perfection</font>

518

00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:27,309
call to action is to meet five people at

566
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:31,899
this conference that you don't already

567
00:27:27,309 --> 00:27:33,879
know and find a<font color="#CCCCCC"> way to interact</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

568
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:36,789
them get their contact information find

569
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:38,590
a way to help them so it could<font color="#CCCCCC"> be some</font>

570
00:27:36,789 --> 00:27:40,390
sort of a referral it could be<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

571
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:43,720
they're struggling with a piece of pipe

572
00:27:40,390 --> 00:27:46,330
on who knows what it could be but we're

573
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:48,429
all struggling with something so you

574
00:27:46,330 --> 00:27:50,590
know there's probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> some strength that</font>

575
00:27:48,429 --> 00:27:53,020
you have that can help someone<font color="#CCCCCC"> else has</font>

576
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:55,770
anyone here already met by people that

577
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:59,020
they did<font color="#CCCCCC"> not know before the conference</font>

578
00:27:55,770 --> 00:28:00,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so several of you that's one of the</font>

579
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:05,379
disadvantages of presenting on the

580
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:08,049
second day but what I'll say is I'll

581
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:12,039
give you two other<font color="#E5E5E5"> choices meet another</font>

582
00:28:08,049 --> 00:28:18,879
five people or try to get an awkward hug

583
00:28:12,039 --> 00:28:21,640
with Jason Street is that fair so I

584
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:23,679
really think that these types of

585
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:26,470
conferences especially besides just

586
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:28,690
phenomenal a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of work goes into it so</font>

587
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:30,760
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to recommend also that you</font>

588
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:34,330
find a way<font color="#CCCCCC"> to volunteer even if you're</font>

589
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:36,039
volunteering for next year right<font color="#E5E5E5"> now you</font>

590
00:28:34,330 --> 00:28:37,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">can get with some of the volunteers of</font>

591
00:28:36,039 --> 00:28:39,280
the conference and find out how you can

592
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:43,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">contribute and help the conference next</font>

593
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:43,918
year it's a great way to network right

594
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:51,270
any questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> on what we've discussed so</font>

595
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:51,270
far

596
00:28:59,299 --> 00:29:01,360
you
