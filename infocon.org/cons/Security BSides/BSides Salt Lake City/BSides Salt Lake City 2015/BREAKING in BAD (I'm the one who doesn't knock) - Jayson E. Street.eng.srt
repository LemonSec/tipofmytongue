42
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:15,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">seem really horrible and very unethical</font>

43
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:20,280
or very mean because some of the things

44
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:22,620
have been remember the kidneys I would

45

48
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:33,390
good reasons so the name of this talk is

49
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:35,580
breaking in bad i'm the one who doesn't

50

00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:39,770
going throughout this talk which

52
00:02:37,709 --> 00:02:42,660
actually plays into it

53
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:44,160
and basically I'm just gonna leave it at

69
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:18,290
at least 20 different ways just as soon

70
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:20,970
as I get there on how to destroy it

71
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:22,049
doesn't make me an artist it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like you</font>

good skill set of destroying things

74
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:26,880
doesn't mean i can create that stuff so

75
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:28,440
i<font color="#E5E5E5"> really like doing the blue team i like</font>

77
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:32,070
find<font color="#E5E5E5"> ways to stop that and then about</font>

78
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,410
twenty<font color="#CCCCCC"> percent of the time i am the red</font>

79
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:35,970
team guy<font color="#CCCCCC"> i like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to break in to help the</font>

80
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:37,710
blue team guys learn from those

81
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:39,570
vulnerabilities and fixed them become

82
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:41,130
more secure because of the fact that i

83
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:43,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">was able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to get in before an actual bad</font>

84
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:45,299
guy got in or sometimes at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same time</font>

85
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:48,359

86
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:50,250
awkward conversation so so I'm more of

00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:53,310
like a blue team red team I'm a corporal

101
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:26,310
persistent threat so in<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's all thank</font>

103
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:30,410
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to think about it being advanced</font>

104
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,670
we're still<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting owned by sequel</font>

105
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:34,560
injections we're still getting owned by

106
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:37,110
people clicking on links that's not

107
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,700
advance it's like let's start worrying

108
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:40,230
about the basic stuff the stuff that's

109
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:42,390
just basically destroying us it's like

110
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:45,810
and I call<font color="#E5E5E5"> it basic adorable destruction</font>

111
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:48,300
I just walk in and be bad you know it's

112
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:49,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">like I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go in and my whole</font>

113
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:52,350
goal is not to check to see it to your

114
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:55,260
PCI compliant my<font color="#E5E5E5"> hope goal is not just</font>

115
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:57,990
if you adhere to HIPAA policies my goal

116
00:04:55,260 --> 00:05:00,900
is to<font color="#CCCCCC"> fe up as much as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> possible there is</font>

117
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:03,780
no rhyme or reason it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just I'm going</font>

118
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:05,400
to be bad and so what I can do so here

119
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:08,489
<font color="#CCCCCC">are some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the key indicators for a</font>

120
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:12,239
person being bad it's like one is recon

121
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:14,580
mode<font color="#E5E5E5"> mal t go and show Dan and all those</font>

122
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:17,430
other cool<font color="#E5E5E5"> advanced leak you know recon</font>

123
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:20,909
tools and and and search algorithms are

124
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:23,430
really awesome and complicated and<font color="#CCCCCC"> time</font>

125
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:26,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">consuming and I've got way too much a</font>

126
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:29,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">DVD to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> deal with that so I limit myself</font>

127
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:31,710
to two hours on Google I spent two hours

128
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:33,780
on Google it's like I go on to victims

129
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:36,359
<font color="#CCCCCC">on website and quite frankly most of the</font>

130
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:39,960
stuff is on the victims website names of

131
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:42,960
the CEOs names of executives their

132
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:44,669
pictures usually I mean plenty of enough

133
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,900
information to get me<font color="#CCCCCC"> going if I really</font>

134
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:49,080
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do it it's like I can go to</font>

135
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:50,940
their careers page I can go to their HR

136
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:52,680
page and get any more info but usually

137
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:55,890
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just the main part of the website</font>

138
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:57,480
I've never used a full two hours yet an

139
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:58,409
hour and 45 minutes for<font color="#CCCCCC"> this one</font>

140
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:00,930
engagement that I'll talk about later

141
00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:03,930
was the longest<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've ever spent to get a</font>

142
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:05,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">successful compromise of a company</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> se</font>

143
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:07,560
mode is usually walking two victims

in a device to the victims computer

150

151
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:24,000
like most of the time<font color="#E5E5E5"> is with the help I</font>

that's always a good result of this

161
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:46,469

165
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:55,020
ways I usually<font color="#E5E5E5"> come in as a passive role</font>

166
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:58,979
it's like I there's a passive aggressive

186
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:42,659
ipv6 is not corresponding with ipv4 so

187
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:44,789
we can have all IP be happiness<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

188
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:48,390
cool let's do that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

189
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:50,130
works the second role is the auditor the

190
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:52,590
executive policy for someone that's in

191
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:54,870
has some acting at least they have some

192
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:57,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of authority that's one of my</font>

193
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:58,290
scariest modes not because I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to</font>

194
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,970
be authority but that means I'm usually

195
00:07:58,290 --> 00:08:01,350
in a suit and if I'm going to suit I'm

196
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:04,100
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to destroy you because you made me</font>

197
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:06,270
wear tie and that's all there is to that

198
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:08,520
and then three crazy off-the-wall

199
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:10,740
personalities not recommended if you

200
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:11,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">really want actual results or but</font>

201
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,900
totally recommend it if you just<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font>

202
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:15,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">have some fun</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and see if you can get</font>

203
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:18,000
away with it<font color="#E5E5E5"> 100 percent success rate so</font>

204
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:20,970
the answer is<font color="#CCCCCC"> yes and that means like I</font>

205
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:24,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">broken in two places in pajama bottoms</font>

206
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:27,180
and barefoot it's like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have broken in</font>

207
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:29,040
two places just saying I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> just off</font>

208
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:30,300
the wall thinks it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like it will go</font>

209
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,320
through one of those which made me feel

210
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:33,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">really bad but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> through one of</font>

211
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:37,770
those as well so what I'm going to do

212
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:39,599
now<font color="#CCCCCC"> is I picked three stories that I</font>

213
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:42,179
have from three financial institutions

214
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:44,370
from three countries the reason why I

215
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:46,319
pick financial institutions<font color="#CCCCCC"> is because</font>

216
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:48,300
like a certain bad guy once said it's

217
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,860
where the money is at right where the

218
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:53,969
regulations are it's where you expect it

219
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:55,140
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be more secure so I chose three three</font>

220
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:56,610
different stories and from three

221
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:58,080
different roles it's like the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first one</font>

222
00:08:56,610 --> 00:08:59,970
would use the passive role that I used

223
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:02,660
the second one I use more of an

224
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:06,390
authoritative role and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> third one</font>

225
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:08,640
unbelievable role<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay but I got ice</font>

226
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:10,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">cream so I got proof</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I did it so so</font>

227
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,569
these are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the river start off with over</font>

228
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:15,210
the passive role this is a job that I

229
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:16,250
did in a Beirut Lebanon I was hired to

230
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:18,620
break in

231
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:21,530
to a<font color="#E5E5E5"> financial institution a bank there</font>

232
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:22,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">and a couple things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about Beirut say</font>

233
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:24,560
first of all berries a beautiful place

234
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:26,300
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> like it's called the Paris of the</font>

235
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:29,150
Middle East for a reason wonderful place

236
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:31,370
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> friendly people I don't blend well</font>

237
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:34,069
in Beirut Lebanon I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't speak Arabic I</font>

238
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:36,020
don't speak French and so it's like so

239
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:37,580
it would receive how constrained it was

240
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:39,260
it's like people were like doubting if I

241
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:41,480
was able to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to manage this and</font>

242
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:43,580
the company wanted to know if I could

243
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:45,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually managed to do online</font>

244
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:47,120
transactions or I could do some things

245
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:48,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">that would affect their bottom line from</font>

246
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:51,170
just walking to branch what kind of

247
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:53,209
damage I could do and so I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> like well</font>

248
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:56,150
hey let's see what<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of damage I can</font>

249
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:58,400
do why<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't we do that so I chose a</font>

250
00:09:56,150 --> 00:10:00,230
random actually let them choose the this

251
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:02,120
this Bank branch it's like you know but

252
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:04,670
it sounds<font color="#CCCCCC"> like take me to a random bank</font>

253
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:06,470
branch and let me go in and there you

254
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:08,180

255
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:10,700
me walking in and if you'll notice the

256
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:14,540
time stamp that's me walking in for the

257
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:16,520
very first time I have zero recon<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

262
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:27,469
this branch<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I had zero knowledge</font>

263
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:29,329

264
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:31,280
hallway and there's the manager's office

265
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:33,200

266
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:35,660
walked the other way<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I'm like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> whoa</font>

283
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:14,540
executive lady's office and I walk in

284
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:15,800
saying yeah I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> here to look at your</font>

285
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:17,360
computers and<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff you know we're doing</font>

286
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">a gpo policy rights to make sure that</font>

287
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,600
USB rights and stuff you know are

288
00:11:18,709 --> 00:11:23,510
properly segmented and stuff from the

289
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:24,649
actual confluence of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the policy so it's</font>

290
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:26,510
likely we need to protect against that

291
00:11:24,649 --> 00:11:27,649
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I need to plug this USB device and</font>

292
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:30,439
yeah it's kind of a rubber ducky on the

293
00:11:27,649 --> 00:11:32,870
ignore that part but uh let me plug this

294
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:35,570
in and test the rights for you<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so I</font>

295
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:36,830
plug it in it's like this command prompt

296
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:38,120
pops up for some reason it's like oh

297
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:39,170
that was just<font color="#E5E5E5"> showing that it works it's</font>

298
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:41,570
all good let me<font color="#E5E5E5"> take a picture that real</font>

299
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:43,130
quick with a camera<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay cool not even</font>

300
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:46,520
just go to the other ones thank you for

301
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:49,430
your assistance now everybody has seen

302
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:50,600
me going to her office and they've seen

303
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:52,099
this like me doing something with her

304
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:54,560
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then I get out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so now I'm totally</font>

305
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:56,000
verified the key thing is always picking

306
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,709
the person that you think is most likely

307
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">to actually go along with it at the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

308
00:11:57,709 --> 00:12:02,060
beginning because once that person goes

309
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:04,430
along with it everybody else tends to do

310
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:06,260
it as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> so then I go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the next lady</font>

422
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:14,300
saddest moments like after the

423
00:16:12,199 --> 00:16:17,029
engagement<font color="#E5E5E5"> over we close just the</font>

424

425
00:16:17,029 --> 00:16:19,459
I've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> to translate it with me so</font>

426
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:21,949
everybody totally understands how

427
00:16:19,459 --> 00:16:25,069
horrible this is and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> proceeded to</font>

428
00:16:21,949 --> 00:16:28,399
explain to them what I did why I was

429
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:30,860
there and how bad<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was and halfway</font>

430
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:33,709
through this conversation the bank

431
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:41,290
manager raises his hand like a school

432
00:16:33,709 --> 00:16:41,290
kid and I'm like yes if he's like

433
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:52,290
are we still getting the equipment and

434
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:56,160
I'm like no<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm a horrible person I was</font>

435
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:58,589
lying to you I'm bad I felt<font color="#CCCCCC"> like I was</font>

436
00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:01,620

438
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:05,730

00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:07,140
there and I wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to I wanted to keep</font>

440
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:08,819

442
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:12,810
could I wire money how could I actually

443
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:15,000
show<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can get into your network so I've</font>

444
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:16,560
got three things out of<font color="#CCCCCC"> five right I've</font>

445
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,319
got the user ID i got the password the

446
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:22,919
smart card what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> next well</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i need a</font>

447

computer so what do i do<font color="#E5E5E5"> i go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to another</font>

448
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:27,720
branch they take me to a random branch

449
00:17:25,109 --> 00:17:29,429
and i walk in like I know exactly where

450
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:30,810
I'm going this time it led to the break

451
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:32,640
room it's like down this hallway that

452
00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:34,500
the toreador was to the left but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was</font>

453
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:36,060
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I ignored that for the second and I</font>

454
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:37,110
kept<font color="#E5E5E5"> going down the hallway to it ends</font>

455
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:38,399
you always been to the hallway<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

456
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:40,260
ends find a door that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can like</font>

457
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,490
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to give an appearance</font>

458
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:43,470
that you're there for something or

459
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:45,540
talking to somebody before they see you

460
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:47,370
again so it's like I go out<font color="#CCCCCC"> there and I</font>

461
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:48,870
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> some water I was little parched you</font>

462
00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:50,429
know it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like it was hard work ponies</font>

463
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:53,689
people so I drink a lil bit of water

464
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:58,260
from the break room and then I walk in

465
00:17:53,690 --> 00:18:03,630
to the teller area I am not even joking

466
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:07,140
or exaggerating I said<font color="#E5E5E5"> zero I did not</font>

467
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:11,400
talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to one person not one thing was</font>

468
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:13,290
uttered or said I walk<font color="#CCCCCC"> in to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> teller</font>

469
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:15,090
line still wearing the Thunder catch any

470
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:18,480
shoes in Def Con jacket as you can tell

471
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:22,740
and while this gentleman is conducting

472
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:27,300
business right beside me I proceeded to

473
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:29,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">steal the computer I've literally remove</font>

474
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:31,050
the computer<font color="#CCCCCC"> from behind the teller line</font>

475
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:36,360
and walk out with it and out of the

476
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:38,669
branch so now I've got user ID I've got

477
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:41,070
the password I've got the smart card and

478
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:43,350
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> computer the smart card goes into</font>

479
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:46,500
well it<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't really do good without</font>

480
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:51,620
network access right so we go to another

481
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:51,620
branch and guess what we got there

482
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:57,980
three branches and one of them was and

483
00:18:56,450 --> 00:18:59,210
with this one I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> told the lady i got</font>

484
00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:01,250
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> computer i'm pretty looking legit</font>

485
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:02,510
right so I'm here we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

486
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:04,310
some testing on the network

487
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:05,860
infrastructure I need to go in<font color="#E5E5E5"> and do a</font>

488
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:08,389
test on this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that fine hooker she</font>

489
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:12,770
opens up the network room for me it's

490
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:14,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">very nice but the key thing is they</font>

491
00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:16,460
weren't expecting that kind of attack

492
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:19,010
and most<font color="#CCCCCC"> people don't if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I would have</font>

493
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:22,180
gone in there with the machine gun at a

494
00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:24,170
ski mask I was going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have a bad day</font>

495
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:26,090
it's like you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> why</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's not</font>

496
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:27,860
just because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm in Beirut this I trust</font>

497
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:30,409
me you go to any bank branch anywhere in

498
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:33,530
the world and you show<font color="#CCCCCC"> up there with a</font>

499
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:35,030
shotgun and a ski mask and they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

500
00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:38,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">to know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you have ill intentions</font>

501
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:41,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay but they're also trained to respond</font>

502
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:43,490
to those we've trained them on that we

503
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:47,870
haven't trained them on how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to deal with</font>

504
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:49,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">the guy you know in the geek and I'll</font>

505
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:52,310
get a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about that later</font>

506
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:54,620
now this this engagement was in America

507
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:56,840
this was for a state treasury in America

508
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:59,439
and one of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to approach</font>

509
00:19:56,840 --> 00:20:03,649
before I even talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is that</font>

510
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:07,070
the scope how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people that do red</font>

511
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:10,720
team love doing scope work and creating

512
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:13,639
the actual scope of work with a client

513
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:17,150
there's that enjoyable because an

514
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:19,850
attacker scope is this this is our scope

515
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:21,710
right here and then you start talking to

516
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:23,209
the clients like well we need a scope of

517
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:24,650
work we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can actually act like an</font>

518
00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:27,470
attacker and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm like oh that's awesome</font>

519
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:29,240
that's exactly<font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you need to do but</font>

520
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:31,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">our</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> business hours only you know monday</font>

521
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:34,410
through friday

522
00:20:31,290 --> 00:20:35,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay it's like but but but but we got</font>

523
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:37,290
development stuff so you're gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

524
00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:40,410
to go in<font color="#E5E5E5"> toward the evening time like</font>

525
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:41,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay well we don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want you to affect</font>

526
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:44,670
the production servers because you know

527
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:46,919
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need those for business okay it's</font>

528
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:48,270
like and by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way we've got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this one</font>

529
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:50,490
development server if you want to go and

530
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:53,010
test it right there there's your scope

531
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:54,660
of work that should do it right because

532
00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:58,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's just exactly how an attacker sees</font>

533
00:20:54,660 --> 00:21:01,380
your network right and so sometimes you

534
00:20:58,230 --> 00:21:02,910
have to work<font color="#CCCCCC"> with that the key is you</font>

535
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:04,500
have to work with<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't to be happy</font>

536
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:08,070
with it you've got to try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> show your</font>

537
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:10,140
point by doing that so we were given

538
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:12,750
this job it's like I was subcontracted

539
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:14,160
out for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this job and the other team the</font>

540
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:16,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">network team had already totally</font>

541
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:18,660
destroyed their internal network but the

542
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:20,490
guys were saying yeah but you have to be

543
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:22,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">inside the network to get this kind of</font>

544
00:21:20,490 --> 00:21:23,430
access I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> like dude they weren't but</font>

545
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:24,629
it's a but but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was what they're</font>

546
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:26,460
sticking to imagine was actually sort of

547
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:28,170
buying it so they brought me in to show

548
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:31,050
how someone can physically get into it

549
00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:33,060
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> I go into the their main</font>

550
00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:34,320
headquarters and it turns out state

551
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:36,300
Treasuries are pretty secure for the

552
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:39,060
main headquarters they don't do a bad

553
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:40,470
job<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> find a way in there was like</font>

554
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:42,060
this basement and stuff you know if you

555
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:43,590
go into there's a there's a there was a

556
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:45,210
deli in the basement you could go down

557
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:47,070
this one side go to this one room and

558
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:48,540
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> was a dumbwaiter that's not used</font>

559
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:51,000

still the doors weren't nailed shut or

563
00:21:53,610 --> 00:21:56,550
anything like that I was like<font color="#E5E5E5"> but that</font>

567
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:07,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">they had another office they had a</font>

568
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:09,060
remote office that had a direct network

569
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:10,470
connection straight in bypassing all

570
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:12,840
firewalls everything else a direct

571
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:14,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">tunnel into their main office on to</font>

572
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:17,669
their main network and this was in<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

573
00:22:14,610 --> 00:22:19,740
office building<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah that sounds</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like a</font>

574
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:21,420
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> better let's try that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one and so I</font>

575
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:22,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">um I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> told it was like okay let me go</font>

576
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:25,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">into this office and see what I can find</font>

577
00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:28,910
out there like sure Jason that'll be

578
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:31,830
awesome break into the remote office um

579
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:35,880
but let's let's talk about scope for a

580
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:38,399
second you can only go in there after

581
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:41,040
five thirty at night because we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

582
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:43,389
disturb any of the tenants or employees

583
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:45,879
and by the way because

584
00:22:43,389 --> 00:22:47,079
after 5 30 at nine you can't talk to

585
00:22:45,879 --> 00:22:48,129
anyone coming in or out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the building</font>

586
00:22:47,079 --> 00:22:50,799
because you don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> if they're our</font>

587
00:22:48,129 --> 00:22:54,519
employees or not oh and you can't use

588
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:55,749
the cardboard or lock picks or anything

589
00:22:54,519 --> 00:22:57,669
like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go after and Jimmy the</font>

590
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:59,139
doors and some never worry about lock

591
00:22:57,669 --> 00:23:01,690
clicks I don't do lock dicks I'm Way

592
00:22:59,139 --> 00:23:04,658
better with cardboard and and then once

593
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:06,249
if you do get in you can't talk to

594
00:23:04,659 --> 00:23:10,029
anybody you only can stay in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> public</font>

595
00:23:06,249 --> 00:23:12,399
spaces inside the building but you can

596
00:23:10,029 --> 00:23:13,779
talk to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cleaning crew but they're</font>

597
00:23:12,399 --> 00:23:14,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">not part of our engagement they're not</font>

598
00:23:13,779 --> 00:23:19,719

604
00:23:30,309 --> 00:23:35,589

605
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:39,549
I didn't mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get it off that way I</font>

seven seconds seven seconds from when I

00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:47,000
all I did was stand outside with a foam

648
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:50,149
and waited for someone to go through it

649

710
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:20,740
like I had full access why did I have to

711
00:31:19,119 --> 00:31:23,019
go and attack your main headquarters

718
00:31:35,169 --> 00:31:36,879
stuff you know that's all their

719
00:31:35,889 --> 00:31:41,889
connections are running through and you

720
00:31:36,879 --> 00:31:44,019
can just tap that tap that you know it's

721
00:31:41,889 --> 00:31:45,879
not all about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the challenge people it's</font>

had to<font color="#CCCCCC"> call the client and tell them on</font>

977
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:15,530
the phone while we're driving back to

978
00:41:13,010 --> 00:41:17,450
headquarters I you're gonna have to call

979
00:41:15,530 --> 00:41:20,030
them<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I can't I can't I can't tell</font>

980
00:41:17,450 --> 00:41:21,589
them what I did I felt<font color="#E5E5E5"> really I still</font>

981
00:41:20,030 --> 00:41:23,210
always celebrate with ice cream after<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

982
00:41:21,589 --> 00:41:24,619
opponent company it's when the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first</font>

983
00:41:23,210 --> 00:41:28,700
times the ice cream<font color="#E5E5E5"> felt a little bitter</font>

984
00:41:24,619 --> 00:41:31,040
it's like it was bad so basically what

985
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:32,118
all this was trying to explain instead

986
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:35,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">of you know which every single scenario</font>

987
00:41:32,119 --> 00:41:38,569
is quite frankly it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not technological</font>

988
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:40,520
controls that failed and it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> really not</font>

989
00:41:38,569 --> 00:41:42,710
actual training the employees that

990
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:45,560
failed it's human nature<font color="#E5E5E5"> that failed</font>

991
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:47,599
because no matter how<font color="#E5E5E5"> ridiculous a story</font>

992
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:49,730
like a guy can launder money through

993
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:51,319
paypal because he's got a charity and

994
00:41:49,730 --> 00:41:53,990
stuff you know for his cancer you know

995
00:41:51,319 --> 00:41:57,859
treatment it's like we're willing to

996
00:41:53,990 --> 00:42:00,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">believe that right if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I can give you a</font>

997
00:41:57,859 --> 00:42:03,170
plausible or not so plausible reason

998
00:42:00,589 --> 00:42:06,020
while I'm there it is more acceptable

999
00:42:03,170 --> 00:42:08,630
than you realizing<font color="#CCCCCC"> the truth and that</font>

1000
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:12,500
truth is there is a bad guy doing

1001
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:15,800
something bad to you no one wants<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1002
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:17,210
wake up in the morning go what a great

1003
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:19,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">day I think someone's going to shoot me</font>

1004
00:42:17,210 --> 00:42:21,349
today yeah that's cool too so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

1005
00:42:19,310 --> 00:42:23,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">to work you know no one wants to think</font>

1006
00:42:21,349 --> 00:42:24,500
something bad happens<font color="#CCCCCC"> to them it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

1007
00:42:23,569 --> 00:42:27,050
it's always<font color="#E5E5E5"> happening to the other</font>

1008
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:29,540
people so if you can give<font color="#CCCCCC"> them a</font>

1009
00:42:27,050 --> 00:42:32,810
reasonable lie it's better<font color="#E5E5E5"> than the</font>

1010
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:34,220
harder truth and that's how it works so

1011
00:42:32,810 --> 00:42:35,990
what are<font color="#E5E5E5"> we going to do about that and</font>

1012
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:37,250
now remember I said it was you know

1013
00:42:35,990 --> 00:42:40,160
dessert and vegetables because here's

1014
00:42:37,250 --> 00:42:42,829
the vegetable time we need to start

1015
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:45,500
working<font color="#E5E5E5"> because it is up to us to</font>

1016
00:42:42,829 --> 00:42:48,500
information security people to actually

1017
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:50,960
start doing a better job at training our

1018
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:52,160
employees on how to be an asset to the

1019
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:54,230
company<font color="#E5E5E5"> from a security standpoint</font>

1020
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:55,759
instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> of just being able to blame them</font>

1021
00:42:54,230 --> 00:42:57,039
for being a stupid user for clicking on

1022
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:58,630
a link

1023
00:42:57,039 --> 00:43:00,759
that's what we need to change because

1024
00:42:58,630 --> 00:43:02,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'll see now look see no signal no one's</font>

1025
00:43:00,759 --> 00:43:04,089
chuckling on that one all of a sudden

1026
00:43:02,799 --> 00:43:08,949
some of the guide will be more serious

1027
00:43:04,089 --> 00:43:10,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">in here Zack wait yes it's like because</font>

1028
00:43:08,949 --> 00:43:12,729
<font color="#CCCCCC">we need to start doing something I call</font>

1029
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:14,410
this a 3 e's because<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm like to be</font>

off<font color="#E5E5E5"> with educating our employees and we</font>

1033
00:43:18,729 --> 00:43:22,419
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to educate them in the proper way</font>

1034
00:43:20,169 --> 00:43:24,219
it's like we<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't need to just do an</font>

1035
00:43:22,419 --> 00:43:25,479
education signature this is at one area

1036
00:43:24,219 --> 00:43:28,900
and out the other because<font color="#E5E5E5"> we like to</font>

just say this is your threats protect

1040
00:43:32,439 --> 00:43:37,239
employees against this you know but how

1041
00:43:36,189 --> 00:43:38,769
<font color="#CCCCCC">many times are you going to see an</font>

know a gun and the premise are being

1044
00:43:41,229 --> 00:43:45,218
threatened by that unless you live in

1045

Texas<font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll be other than that it's</font>

like<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm from Texas</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i can say that so</font>

1047
00:43:47,219 --> 00:43:51,039
what we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do is to our training</font>

1048
00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:53,439
our employees to be afraid of these

1049

people i'm especially<font color="#CCCCCC"> darren he's a</font>

little sketchy sorry dear had to be said

1051
00:43:56,229 --> 00:44:00,009
but we need to start<font color="#CCCCCC"> training them for</font>

1052
00:43:57,789 --> 00:44:01,900
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like this these are the attacks</font>

1053
00:44:00,009 --> 00:44:06,099
these are the current attack vectors

1054
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:08,890
these are where guns are great efficient

1055
00:44:06,099 --> 00:44:10,299
tools for crime during the age of you

1056
00:44:08,890 --> 00:44:12,129
and swords and bows and arrows right

1057
00:44:10,299 --> 00:44:14,439
there when guns got involved criminals

1058
00:44:12,130 --> 00:44:16,150
are like<font color="#E5E5E5"> well this is way more efficient</font>

1059
00:44:14,439 --> 00:44:19,328
to the dagger trying to rob somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1060
00:44:16,150 --> 00:44:21,549
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll start using a gun and then</font>

1061
00:44:19,329 --> 00:44:23,949
computers came around and criminals

1062
00:44:21,549 --> 00:44:26,259
started going wow this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is way more</font>

1063
00:44:23,949 --> 00:44:29,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">efficient and using the gun I think I'll</font>

1064
00:44:26,259 --> 00:44:30,429
start using this that's how<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is it's</font>

1065
00:44:29,229 --> 00:44:31,989
like it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not like hackers like Oh</font>

1066
00:44:30,429 --> 00:44:33,909
hackers have always been criminals<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

1067
00:44:31,989 --> 00:44:35,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">stuff no criminals got into the game of</font>

1068
00:44:33,909 --> 00:44:38,949
hacking because it's efficient for

1069
00:44:35,890 --> 00:44:40,658
committing crime so we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> start</font>

1070
00:44:38,949 --> 00:44:44,499
teaching and training our employees to

1071
00:44:40,659 --> 00:44:47,799
be aware of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's like what about</font>

on the first day grabbed a handful went

1077
00:44:58,869 --> 00:45:03,939
upstairs but malware on all of them came

1078
00:45:02,140 --> 00:45:05,910
back down and dropped them back in the

1079
00:45:03,939 --> 00:45:07,989
bowl

1080
00:45:05,910 --> 00:45:09,969

with a stack of<font color="#E5E5E5"> envelopes I go walking</font>

1085
00:45:18,190 --> 00:45:23,229
around so I see a desk with no one there

1086
00:45:20,650 --> 00:45:25,269
I see their name tag I write their name

1087
00:45:23,229 --> 00:45:28,149
on the envelope I put the USB<font color="#CCCCCC"> Drive in</font>

1088
00:45:25,269 --> 00:45:32,049
and leave it on their desk that's

1089
00:45:28,150 --> 00:45:33,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">usually all it takes it's like if you</font>

one of things we do in information

1103
00:46:02,769 --> 00:46:07,660
security we want to be able to confine

1104
00:46:04,390 --> 00:46:09,759
what our threats are we'd like to

1105

1157
00:47:58,150 --> 00:48:01,540
they hired me something go to catch out

1158
00:47:59,380 --> 00:48:09,550

so so and the great where the great

1162
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:17,980
thing on this one what I had this coated

1163
00:48:15,369 --> 00:48:19,300
to do was if it hit a Mac machine all

1164
00:48:17,980 --> 00:48:21,369
the windows would disappear off the

1165
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:22,630
screen and did I had to find<font color="#E5E5E5"> some way to</font>

1166
00:48:21,369 --> 00:48:25,330
explain that to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> persons that was</font>

00:48:26,710 --> 00:48:29,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">its effect it's like everything else is</font>

home and how to be thinking security

1219
00:50:24,420 --> 00:50:28,979
consciously at home and guess what

1220

<font color="#E5E5E5">happens when they go to work they still</font>

1222
00:50:31,289 --> 00:50:34,859
now security conscious so they will

1223
00:50:33,150 --> 00:50:38,400
protect it because that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is now their</font>

1224
00:50:34,859 --> 00:50:39,749
nature that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you have to do start</font>

1225
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:42,150
teaching them to care for their

1226
00:50:39,749 --> 00:50:44,279
immediate concerns and they'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> just take</font>

1227
00:50:42,150 --> 00:50:45,839
that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> go with it you have to drive</font>

1228
00:50:44,279 --> 00:50:49,170
home the<font color="#CCCCCC"> fact that stranger the worst</font>

1229
00:50:45,839 --> 00:50:51,029
thing in the industry besides no

1230
00:50:49,170 --> 00:50:54,119
security and there's a false sense of

1231
00:50:51,029 --> 00:50:55,890
security once<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have bypassed the</font>

1232
00:50:54,119 --> 00:51:01,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">visitor controls that have got me into a</font>

1233
00:50:55,890 --> 00:51:03,538
secured area it's open because<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

1234
00:51:01,109 --> 00:51:06,538
are thinking I'm protected here I'm safe

1235
00:51:03,539 --> 00:51:08,400
I had to show a badge there was a stern

1236
00:51:06,539 --> 00:51:11,309
looking security guy looking at me he

1237
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:12,959
was frightening so if I had to go

1238
00:51:11,309 --> 00:51:16,890
through all<font color="#E5E5E5"> that to get in no one else</font>

1240
00:51:16,890 --> 00:51:21,689
so you need to show them if you see

1241
00:51:18,869 --> 00:51:23,670
someone report it and that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

thing we talked about teaching you've

1243
00:51:23,670 --> 00:51:27,269
got to give them somewhere to react<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1244
00:51:25,559 --> 00:51:29,489
we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about that a bit more as well</font>

1245
00:51:27,269 --> 00:51:32,758
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> also have to create teachable events</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">year-round who does the online security</font>
