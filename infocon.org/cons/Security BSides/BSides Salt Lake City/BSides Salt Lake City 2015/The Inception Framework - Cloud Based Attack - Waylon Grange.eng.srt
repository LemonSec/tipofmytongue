1
00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:08,580
thank you um I'll try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep you</font>

2
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:11,790
entertained on a friday night<font color="#CCCCCC"> I hope</font>

3
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:14,639
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this goes well the smaller crowd so</font>

4
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:16,740
if you have questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> just feel right</font>

5
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:18,900
ahead to just jump right in I will open

6
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:19,948
<font color="#E5E5E5">it up to questions at the end but if you</font>

7
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:23,788
have something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to jump in</font>

8
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:27,480
right Emil middle that's fine so start

9
00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:32,250
off with what is inception last year

10
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:34,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">around August we found a targeted attack</font>

11
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:36,120
that was done by what looks to be a

12
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:37,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">nation-state</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't want to come out</font>

13
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:40,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">and say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was a native state but it's</font>

14
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:42,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">likely there was a nation-state attack</font>

15
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:44,219
and we called it inception because<font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font>

16
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">are so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> many layers to this when we get</font>

17
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:47,520
through<font color="#E5E5E5"> one layer we'd find there's</font>

18
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:48,930
another layer even deeper and as I go

19
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,750
through this presentation I hope you'll

20
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:53,879
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of appreciate why we named it this</font>

21
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:56,550
so based on information we were able to

22
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:58,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">gather these are the targets not all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

23
00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:00,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">them but the majority of them fall right</font>

24
00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:02,250
on this map in this region and you can

25
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,920
see there's a very<font color="#CCCCCC"> large cluster right</font>

26
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:06,420
over Moscow so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is who they were</font>

27
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:09,299
targeting and who their targets of

28
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:10,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">interests were also note the industries</font>

29
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:13,110
that they were after they were after

30
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:14,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">government they were up for embassies at</font>

31
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:17,520
a lot of the else embassies were in the

32
00:01:14,729 --> 00:01:20,310
Moscow area military secret space and

33
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:22,350
then towards the end of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the campaign we</font>

34
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:24,630
released this in we released our

35
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:26,759
findings in December and within 48 hours

36
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:27,929
they had shut the whole thing down but

37
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:30,450
towards the end of this campaign they

38
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:32,579
were targeting the world of Petroleum

39
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:36,420
Council and the United Nations members

40
00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:37,919
as well now their attacks were typically

41
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:40,610
started out with a phishing email but

42
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:44,790
they were<font color="#CCCCCC"> very specific phishing emails</font>

43
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:47,340
and if you look at these emails the one

44
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:50,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">furthest on the left is a United</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Nations</font>

45
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:52,500
document and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> it outlines an agenda</font>

46
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:54,149
for a meeting so you can assume<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

47
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:57,030
message would be<font color="#CCCCCC"> something to the extent</font>

48
00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:58,920
of there's been<font color="#E5E5E5"> an update to our meeting</font>

49
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:01,229
please see the updated agenda with this

50
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:02,549
attached word document<font color="#E5E5E5"> you'd open the</font>

51
00:02:01,229 --> 00:02:03,990
word document they would explore to you

52
00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:05,880
and then it would show one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these</font>

53
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:07,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">documents not so the user was not</font>

54
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:09,329
suspicious when word crash right it

55
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:11,310
would quickly launch another copy of

56
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:12,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">word and throw down these legit</font>

57
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:14,740
documents to kind

58
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:16,510
no high with ravine on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> background</font>

59
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:18,310
the one in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> middle shows Russian</font>

60
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:21,760
leadership it was sent<font color="#CCCCCC"> to Russian</font>

61
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:23,200
military personnel to one down<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

62
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:25,269
bottom is a diplomatic<font color="#E5E5E5"> car for sale</font>

63
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:27,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">obviously targeting a diplomat in that</font>

64
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:29,290
area which was Moscow this document over

65
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:31,060
on this side is one of my favorites you

66
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:33,400
can't see it but<font color="#CCCCCC"> it talks about diesel</font>

67
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:35,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">engines and it said it's a customer</font>

68
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:36,460
product saying hey we sell<font color="#E5E5E5"> these type of</font>

69
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:38,620
diesel engines here's our latest

70
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:40,720
brochure and so we start looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at who</font>

71
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:42,460
would be a customer of this size diesel

72
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,570
engine and we went<font color="#E5E5E5"> to that we went to</font>

73
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:45,250
their site<font color="#CCCCCC"> and try</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to find out</font>

74
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:46,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">information about the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> beast engines and</font>

75
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:47,680
it turned out that these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are huge</font>

76
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:49,990
engines these are the kinds that are

77
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:52,480
used in submarines and start nuclear

78
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:53,530
generators so these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are the people those</font>

79
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,959
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the types of people that this</font>

80
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:58,180
document was targeting I say there were

81
00:02:55,960 --> 00:03:01,330
all very targeted documents we see this

82
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:03,600
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lady here she didn't</font>

83
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:06,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">seem to be at such a targeted document</font>

84
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:08,829
just kind of talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe future</font>

85
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:10,540
Miss Russia but effective nonetheless

86
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:12,010
maybe they<font color="#CCCCCC"> did</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know their target and</font>

87
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:14,230
they knew they'd be<font color="#E5E5E5"> interested in such a</font>

88
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:17,620
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> but guys aren't the only one were</font>

89
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:19,690
susceptible deal for<font color="#E5E5E5"> Victoria's Secrets</font>

90
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:23,170
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> another attack they used and it also</font>

91
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:25,510
was successful so how the attack plays

92
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:27,790
out is they send an email that has this

93
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:30,190
attachment on it right the user<font color="#E5E5E5"> clicks</font>

94
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:32,230
the attachment which is a malicious word

95
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:34,209
document it exploited an exploit that

96
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:38,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">came out last April almost a year ago</font>

97
00:03:34,209 --> 00:03:40,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">now that it'll they get a shell prompt</font>

98
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:42,010
and when they get shelled access they do

99
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:43,959
two things they drop a vbscript and run

100
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:46,600
it and then they open<font color="#E5E5E5"> that decoy</font>

101
00:03:43,959 --> 00:03:48,940
document so to show the user that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

102
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:51,400
vbscript will then extract from within

103
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:53,740
itself two different files one dll and

104
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:55,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">another one is an aes encrypted file and</font>

105
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:58,390
drop both of them to disk and then

106
00:03:55,480 --> 00:04:01,510
execute and put the<font color="#E5E5E5"> dll in the startup</font>

107
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:03,579
that dll when it's run its a polymorph

108
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:05,470
dll it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a using a type of packer we</font>

109
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:07,300
haven't seen before it was unique only

110
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:09,880
to these guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it would every</font>

111
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:11,350
instance that<font color="#E5E5E5"> polymorphic vol was</font>

112
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:14,290
completely different<font color="#CCCCCC"> no matter what the</font>

113
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:15,579
underlying payload was it would inject

114
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:17,769
into itself functions that were

115
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:19,480
logarithmic or exponent functions and

116
00:04:17,769 --> 00:04:21,519
there were a lot of function trees that

117
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:22,930
were<font color="#E5E5E5"> just dynamic like the number of</font>

118
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:25,840
function arguments to these functions

119
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:27,310
was different between each pack so the

120
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:30,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm offering pecker they used was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

121
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:33,790
smooth really quite sophisticated excuse

122
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:35,770
me but nonetheless it once it finally

123
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:38,710
finish this thing it unpacked the dll in

124
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:41,198
memory and that<font color="#CCCCCC"> dll then would go find</font>

125
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:43,659
the encrypted blob that<font color="#E5E5E5"> dll had the aes</font>

126
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:45,940
key for that blob decrypt it which was

127
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:47,979
yet another dll and then load that into

128
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:50,290
memory and run in which was that was the

129
00:04:47,979 --> 00:04:52,000
actual payload to this tool the whole

130
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:54,130
chain here is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get to this base</font>

131
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,110
implant the base implant then had the

132
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:57,610
capability to call home say hey what do

133
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:59,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">you want me to do and it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> would pull down</font>

134
00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:03,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">additional capabilities and run them as</font>

135
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:06,070
as the targets as the attackers wished

136
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:07,719
interesting to point out is everything

137
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:09,669
below this red line only<font color="#CCCCCC"> exists in</font>

138
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:11,650
memory there's no forensic evidence for

139
00:05:09,669 --> 00:05:14,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">these files so all you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have on disk is</font>

140
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:17,380
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> AES encrypted blob which is good</font>

141
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:20,020
luck opening that and a polymorphic dll

142
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:21,669
they did very they did a lot of work to

143
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:23,740
protect their actual payload and hide

144
00:05:21,669 --> 00:05:25,479
what they're doing they didn't use a tip

145
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:27,039
a lot of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> typical malware tricks of</font>

you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> trying to hide from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a reverse</font>

147

148
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:34,240
think the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason that they didn't it</font>

149
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:35,919
because those tricks although they<font color="#CCCCCC"> slow</font>

150
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:38,229
down reverse engineers and buy them time

151
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:40,990
they're also very loud and say hey I'm

152
00:05:38,229 --> 00:05:43,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">trying to hide so they did this route</font>

153
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:46,300
instead to not raise suspicion upon

154
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:47,919
themselves so the base implant when it

155
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:50,020
would call home here's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of</font>

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> language of the user and just that's</font>

168
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:20,349

00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:22,479
to do to new things they task it to do a

complete der walk and give me domain

172
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:28,180
felt like they were still interested in

00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:30,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">that target then they did Vance to the</font>

third<font color="#CCCCCC"> and final stage that we saw which</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">were after</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> espeon they weren't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> after any</font>

kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of sabotage we didn't admit pneus</font>

182
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:48,970
any at least but they were clearly

183
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:50,979
looking to steal information from their

184
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:52,930
targets and they were very<font color="#E5E5E5"> cautious of</font>

185
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:55,690
who they were talking to targeting they

186
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:57,580
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> only expose or use these tricks on</font>

187
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:58,950
targets they knew they wanted during

188
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:02,469
during the<font color="#E5E5E5"> course of this investigation</font>

189
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:04,090
we tried to fish them right we tried to

190
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:05,470
set up in<font color="#E5E5E5"> these jeans and tried to get</font>

191
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:07,599
them to target us to see<font color="#E5E5E5"> what they would</font>

192
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:08,890
do and I could<font color="#E5E5E5"> never get them to bite so</font>

193
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:10,300
they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> very good at making sure they</font>

194
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:14,080
hit who they thought they<font color="#E5E5E5"> were trying to</font>

195
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:15,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">hit now how it talked home was really</font>

196
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,750
interesting for me because this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

197
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:18,760
something you typically see in malware

198
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:21,850
rather than you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know opening inner</font>

199
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:24,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">Explorer or using a socket what it did</font>

200
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:26,380
is it mapped a web dev drive right so

201
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:29,409
like if i did a net use on the machine

202
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:32,080
you'd see a web dab drive out to the

203
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:35,190
cloud and that through that drive it

204
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:38,590
would send up a file<font color="#E5E5E5"> or retrieve a file</font>

205
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:40,000
because you use a webdav drive the

206
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:41,739
connection doesn't come from the

207
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,590
malicious process the connection comes

208
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:46,540
from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> system itself furthermore it's</font>

209
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:48,820
Microsoft doing it right you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just say oh</font>

210
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:51,160
I've got a net drive right this file to

211
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:52,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">the drive and the system will go send</font>

212
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:55,090
the data up to the cloud<font color="#CCCCCC"> for you it's</font>

213
00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:57,790
very sly a lot of even products aren't

214
00:07:55,090 --> 00:08:00,010
looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> for this type of traffic now the</font>

215
00:07:57,790 --> 00:08:01,480
webdav provider they used is cloud me

216
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:04,930
which was something I had never<font color="#E5E5E5"> heard it</font>

217
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:09,100
before they are a Russian or sweet

218
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:10,210
excuse me cloud provider that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably</font>

219
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:12,160
why it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> didn't hear of them because</font>

220
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:14,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm not I'm not fluently in that area</font>

221
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">but how they designed the malware that's</font>

222
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:17,200
not hard coded in fact it could be

223
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:19,750
changed and it could have been changed

224
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:21,909
to any one of these providers that uses

225
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:24,520
webdav so it could have talked to<font color="#E5E5E5"> any</font>

226
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:26,860
one of these and you know the malware

<font color="#CCCCCC">Cottee interchangeably</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to set up if we</font>

00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:30,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">look at it I can show you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> exactly where</font>

229
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:32,680
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the configuration section every</font>

230
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:35,020
one of the palos we saw was almost the

231
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:37,750
same except for one section which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the</font>

232
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:40,630
config which was hard baked in it that's

233
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:42,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">really small but like a big outlines the</font>

234
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:45,189
URL to talk to which is the top one says

235
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:47,410
basically cloud me the username the

236
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:49,780
password and then the paths of where

237
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:52,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">Dipset survey data down and the path of</font>

238
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:53,050
where to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get my next tasking assignment</font>

239
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:54,250
from

240
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:56,410
then when<font color="#E5E5E5"> it writes files to the cloud</font>

241
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:58,120
has this last section it says use one of

242
00:08:56,410 --> 00:09:00,760
these extensions when you write the file

243
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:02,950
so that if i was to casually browse

244
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:04,930
cloud me<font color="#CCCCCC"> i would see all these files</font>

245
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:07,540
that looks like a<font color="#CCCCCC"> text file a WAV file</font>

246
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:09,579
right they clubbed<font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look just throws</font>

247
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:11,709
this icon up before you guessing based

248
00:09:09,579 --> 00:09:13,180
on the extension really all those are is

249
00:09:11,709 --> 00:09:15,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">that survey information that i showed</font>

250
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:16,989
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> before but encrypted and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> said on the</font>

251
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:20,199
cloud so that's kind of how they hide

252
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:22,720
this the factor there there so we

253
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:24,459
observed them and because every time<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

254
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,140
get held of sample i could see from that

255
00:09:24,459 --> 00:09:27,518
sample the username and password<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

256
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:29,709
they were<font color="#CCCCCC"> using so i wrote a python</font>

257
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:32,920
script just to check cloud me and say

258
00:09:29,709 --> 00:09:34,510
with this see see what gets uploaded and

259
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:36,490
see if<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're tasking this guy see what</font>

260
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:38,189
they're doing that exchange and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

261
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:40,240
started to build a collection of these

262
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:42,880
but then i started seeing something

263
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:45,459
strange happen in some cases they would

264
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:47,320
drop this SCCM executable on their

265
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:48,640
target and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i looked at that executable</font>

266
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:51,010
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i start taking apart and I</font>

267
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:53,890
recognized it immediately as a Chinese

268
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:56,410
piece of malware at known apt set from

269
00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:58,000
long ago and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> was and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not</font>

270
00:09:56,410 --> 00:10:00,610
particularly advanced piece of<font color="#E5E5E5"> malware</font>

271
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:04,060
in my mind<font color="#CCCCCC"> but compared to the inception</font>

272
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:06,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">setup it it's like like Miniature riots</font>

273
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:07,989
it doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a lot of these awesome</font>

274
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:11,380
capabilities it's loud it's obnoxious

275
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:13,540
and it<font color="#E5E5E5"> just doesn't make sense to load a</font>

276
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:15,640
backdoor on a system when I already have

277
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:17,770
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> really cool sophisticated backdoor</font>

278
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:20,230
like why would I set this really noisy

279
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:22,000
odd one down is it the Chinese like

280
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:23,079
experienced group teaching a younger

281
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,410
group are they kind of working together

282
00:10:23,079 --> 00:10:29,349
like I didn't understand why why why

283
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:31,750
they would do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this and then I started to</font>

284
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:33,820
look at what cases of where this was

285
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:36,640
being dropped and I noticed the pattern

286
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:39,699
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the survey files in the cases where</font>

287
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:41,230
that SCCM was being dropped the the

288
00:10:39,699 --> 00:10:43,930
survey was saying it was running<font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

289
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:45,670
eat one of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> processes in the cases</font>

290
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:47,439
where it wasn't being dropped this this

291
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:49,660
is a typical place where the malware

292
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,620
expects to be running<font color="#E5E5E5"> from but down here</font>

293
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:55,329
below<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know if you can read this</font>

294
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:56,769
<font color="#CCCCCC">its holy right or one dll 32 so what</font>

295
00:10:55,329 --> 00:10:58,569
they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to figure out based on</font>

296
00:10:56,769 --> 00:11:01,120
where the process was running they could

297
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:02,740
tell this is a cyst this is a researcher

298
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:05,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">on to our trail</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is a researcher</font>

299
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:06,700
looking at our stuff when there was a

300
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:07,930
researcher on to them

301
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:10,780
they would drop a piece of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Chinese</font>

302
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:13,750
malware oh where the Chinese look at who

303
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:15,339
we are that was that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> first clue</font>

304
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:16,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">that these guys</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are a little on top of</font>

305
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:18,520
their game right they know what they're

306
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:20,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">doing they know how to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> play with us and</font>

307
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:24,370
I thought okay this<font color="#CCCCCC"> little cat mouse</font>

308
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:25,900
game you're on right you're on so we

309
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:28,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">started to collect a number of samples</font>

310
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:30,850
and we gave<font color="#E5E5E5"> it a number of account</font>

311
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:32,530
information and we sent this we reached

312
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:34,870
up to cloud me and<font color="#E5E5E5"> told them hey your</font>

313
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:37,390
service is<font color="#CCCCCC"> being used by this apt to</font>

314
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:39,880
attack these large organizations would

315
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:41,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">you be willing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to share log data for</font>

316
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:42,880
these accounts<font color="#E5E5E5"> who's logging and we'd</font>

317
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:44,520
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find out who the attackers are</font>

318
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:47,320
that are at asking that these machines

319
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:48,610
luckily cloud me was willing luckily for

320
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:50,920
us cloud me was willing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to share and</font>

321
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:51,940
work with us they they worked to shut

322
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:53,620
down the accounts<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they work to</font>

323
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:55,600
provide the logs to those accounts that

324
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:58,290
we specified but<font color="#E5E5E5"> furthermore they said</font>

325
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:00,970
that's also matching a pattern of these

326
00:11:58,290 --> 00:12:03,790
hundred<font color="#E5E5E5"> some-odd other accounts that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

327
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:07,270
didn't list so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> rebuilt us these guys</font>

328
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:08,829
are huge when we got the logs back we

329
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:10,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">got the IPS and it was easy for us to</font>

330
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:13,720
tell who's a victim IP versus an

331
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:15,970
attacker IP based on user agent and what

332
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:18,640
actions what commands they used right

333
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:21,220
and we get<font color="#E5E5E5"> all these ip's but it turns</font>

334
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:23,170
out there was over a hundred IPS<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

335
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:24,670
the attackers were using and it was

336
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:27,099
crazy because the attackers would<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

337
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:28,510
it would connect to<font color="#E5E5E5"> cloud me check a few</font>

338
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:30,130
accounts and then connect from a

339
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:32,620
different IP check a few more it would

340
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:34,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">just bounce through these IPS like just</font>

341
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:37,090
jump every hour or so it would jump<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a</font>

342
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:38,530
new IP but<font color="#E5E5E5"> continue talking as if it was</font>

343
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:40,570
the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> connection we're like whoa</font>

344
00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:43,000
these guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this massive</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> network I</font>

345
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:44,920
was like it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably his tour no none</font>

346
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">of these IPS line</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up to be at or IP</font>

347
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:48,699
we're like well is it some kind of proxy

348
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:51,250
service they're not proxy IPS they were

349
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:53,950
not any<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of service or known proxy</font>

350
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:56,260
or open proxy that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we could find like</font>

351
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:58,060
well what is this<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mean a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of them</font>

352
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:59,650
were<font color="#CCCCCC"> in South Korea does that mean</font>

353
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:01,000
anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> because the rest of them are</font>

354
00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:03,730
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> over but there was a good portion</font>

355
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:06,460
that centered<font color="#E5E5E5"> around South Korea so we</font>

356
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:09,550
started to do just a light forensics on

357
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:11,590
the boxes<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it turned out they were</font>

358
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:14,020
all embedded systems they were all

359
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:15,850
embedded systems that these guys have

360
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:18,520
compromised and then we're using them to

361
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:19,690
cover their tracks right so the cloud me

362
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,439
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like oh these are just a bunch of</font>

363
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:23,170
home you

364
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:25,300
I peas these all belong to just use a

365
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:27,640
router IP addresses it looks perfectly

366
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:30,520
legit for a user to log ins sink a file

367
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:33,400
or two and shut it<font color="#E5E5E5"> down it was like whoa</font>

368
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:35,020
these guys are all like I thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have</font>

369
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:38,380
them<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then no all I get is a bunch of</font>

370
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:40,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">these router boxes so the good news for</font>

371
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:43,480
us as though we were able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to identify a</font>

372
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:44,829
customer<font color="#CCCCCC"> of our blue coat and we reached</font>

373
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:46,120
out and<font color="#E5E5E5"> asked for permission and we're</font>

374
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:50,800
able to get access to one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

375
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:52,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">devices so I get telnet or SSH access to</font>

376
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:55,359
one of these<font color="#CCCCCC"> boxes and I look you know I</font>

377
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:57,160
do a PS and I do a netstat and right

378
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:59,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">away something looks rather fishy this</font>

379
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:01,240
it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> small bust this tale dash</font>

380
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:03,729
the process called tell dash has a port

381
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:05,140
open yeah I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think tell should be</font>

382
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:07,090
listening on any port right that's

383
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:08,800
that's shady in an upsell<font color="#E5E5E5"> furthermore</font>

384
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:11,410
the process tell is running out of /

385
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:13,900
temp I'm like yeah this is wrong<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is</font>

386
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:16,270
my guy right here but then I'm like how

387
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:19,510
do i get an executable off this router<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

388
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:22,329
can't just stick a USB<font color="#E5E5E5"> drive in it maybe</font>

389
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:25,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">I could just SCP it to myself no this</font>

390
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:26,950
router is an embedded Linux it's not got

391
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:30,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">the full suite of things right it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

392
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:35,880
busybox even that slim down it doesn't

393
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:38,890
have SCP like well what about ftp tftp

394
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:41,560
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> i like echo it to a terminal and</font>

395
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:43,689
just cut and paste no that doesn't work

396
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:45,729
or knit cap doesn't even have a neck<font color="#CCCCCC"> CAD</font>

397
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:47,950
I couldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> even echo it to a terminal</font>

398
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:49,600
and there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the dash e option to</font>

399
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:51,400
escape the character so it doesn't beep

400
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:54,520
and do funky stuff no that won't work

401
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:57,010
I'm like great find the<font color="#E5E5E5"> super cool</font>

402
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:59,199
malware and I can't even copy the file

403
00:14:57,010 --> 00:15:01,120
off<font color="#CCCCCC"> the router like how dumb do I feel</font>

404
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:02,920
right so if you guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a cool answer</font>

405
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:05,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">for this I'd love</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to hear it afterwards</font>

406
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:06,670
I came<font color="#CCCCCC"> up with one but I don't think</font>

407
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,170
it's the most elegant so if you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got</font>

408
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:11,560
something better I'd love<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hear it</font>

409
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:13,599
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I ended up doing is I compiled a</font>

410
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:18,819
new version of busy box that had dubbed

411
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:22,000
that that had<font color="#E5E5E5"> netcat in it w gat w get w</font>

412
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:24,070
get the file down to the router and then

413
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,589
run that just to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get it Pat my for the</font>

414
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:27,940
malware off the router even then my

415
00:15:26,589 --> 00:15:30,880
pains weren't over because the router

416
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:33,010
runs MIPS right who the last time i

417
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:34,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">reversed myths assembly was like in</font>

418
00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:36,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">college because i had</font>

419
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:39,189
you like MIT sniffs is horrible but

420
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:41,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">anyways I took apart got it out and find</font>

421
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:43,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">out exactly what I thought it was it's a</font>

422
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:46,330
backdoor proxy on the router it<font color="#E5E5E5"> listens</font>

423
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:47,920
on a port for encrypted session that the

424
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:50,500
router the attacker will connect on that

425
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:52,810
port say hey open me up a proxy<font color="#CCCCCC"> to this</font>

426
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:54,430
address<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then it would proxy traffic</font>

427
00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:56,859
through<font color="#CCCCCC"> the router and that's how they</font>

428
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:58,329
were<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm asking their identity so to</font>

429
00:15:56,860 --> 00:16:00,990
kind of back up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and get the big picture</font>

430
00:15:58,330 --> 00:16:03,250
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we know so far right the victim</font>

431
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:05,590
connects to cloud me did yet its

432
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:08,050
commanding to get us<font color="#E5E5E5"> come out of control</font>

433
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:10,390
cloud me is connected to buy this one of

434
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:13,839
these huge internet of things that have

435
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:15,400
been hacked and i thought i got netstat

436
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:18,340
logs I can see who's connecting to those

437
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:19,569
routers well all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the connections to</font>

438
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:21,130
the routers come from one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of four</font>

439
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:23,620
servers that were all virtual private

440
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:25,630
servers rented in the cloud none of

441
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:27,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">those weary stop the providers</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ask for</font>

442
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:28,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">information they weren't really in share</font>

443
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:31,090
anything about their customers<font color="#E5E5E5"> so this</font>

444
00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:32,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">is their huge network that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we've devised</font>

445
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:34,210
and I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> even know what's on this</font>

446
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:36,730
half<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the field over here right I just</font>

447
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:39,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">know it stops there somewhere they could</font>

448
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:42,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">have four or five more layers I don't</font>

449
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:44,560
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just interesting to see</font>

450
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:47,740
how strong<font color="#CCCCCC"> and how big their network is</font>

451
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:50,140
right so I'm thinking k so I've got

452
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:52,080
control of one of these devices and I

453
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:54,910
can see the traffic going through it

454
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:57,810
what if I made that guy a double agent

455
00:16:54,910 --> 00:17:00,850
every time<font color="#E5E5E5"> he was tasked to go somewhere</font>

456
00:16:57,810 --> 00:17:04,240
everything he's doing send me a pcap

457
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:06,400
copy of wherever he goes<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so</font>

458
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:08,709
you always hear about nation-state

459
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,300
spying on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> little guys this time it's</font>

460
00:17:08,709 --> 00:17:13,330
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> little guy spying on the</font>

461
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:14,859
nation-state I kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of I get giddy even</font>

462
00:17:13,329 --> 00:17:16,869
talking about this now because it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

463
00:17:14,859 --> 00:17:18,369
kind of cool just to think aha this

464
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:20,829
whole campaign and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm watching</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

465
00:17:18,369 --> 00:17:23,079
whole thing go by so I knew all the

466
00:17:20,829 --> 00:17:24,970
connections to cloud me were encrypted

467
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:26,770
and so that I didn't expect<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see</font>

468
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:28,750
anything there but I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> wondering what</font>

469
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:31,090
else would I see and what I found out is

470
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:32,560
they had some rented email servers

471
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:34,389
whenever<font color="#E5E5E5"> they'd spend to send a spam</font>

472
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:36,520
they connect to the rented email server

473
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:39,490
through their Internet of Things network

474
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:41,680
and then send out the email so i could

475
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:43,360
get a wireshark capture of every attack

476
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:46,330
email that went through my one

477
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:48,010
particular router so here's here's an

478
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:50,679
example of one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

479
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:54,160
i blotted out who the target was but

480
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:55,990
other<font color="#E5E5E5"> than that I it was pretty cool i</font>

481
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:58,270
could see the attachment<font color="#E5E5E5"> i could see who</font>

482
00:17:55,990 --> 00:18:02,770
they were targeting this one was after

483
00:17:58,270 --> 00:18:06,639
uh who is this one<font color="#CCCCCC"> after i don't see it</font>

484
00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:08,470
readily but yeah i was able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see who</font>

485
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:10,780
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> was i was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> able to see who their email</font>

486
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:13,510
servers masqueraded as and they would

487
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:15,129
masquerade as as common UK customers

488
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:19,210
right so they were they were faking

489
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:22,000
sandy group code or sandy group com by

490
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:24,310
using the domain sanding group co uk for

491
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,020
somebody in the UK that address makes

492
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:27,730
sense so they were they were very good

493
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:30,310
as spoofing who they were trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

494
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:32,140
target and who they were coming from now

495
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:33,879
as I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> listening in on their network</font>

496
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:35,980
like this I saw a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of emails that</font>

497
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:37,300
match this set up with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> word document</font>

498
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:38,710
attached that exploited but then I

499
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:41,560
started<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see some emails that didn't</font>

500
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:43,870
match this pattern I saw a<font color="#E5E5E5"> small one</font>

501
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:46,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">liner</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> email no attachment it's just like</font>

00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:41,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">on why waste your time writing malware</font>

00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:43,149
for it so looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at that link it's</font>

00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:45,100
actually a bitly link<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's it was a</font>

524
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:47,050
bitly link that had this kind of pattern

525
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:49,600
that is you'd wind you to<font color="#E5E5E5"> this IP</font>

526
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:51,879
address and the URL had two things in it

527
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:53,590
had a target identify<font color="#CCCCCC"> erkki uniquely</font>

528
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:55,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">identify this email so the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> attacker</font>

529
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:57,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">could know which one's work and then an</font>

530
00:19:55,450 --> 00:20:00,940
action code the action code was either

531
00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:03,940
743<font color="#E5E5E5"> which means</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> served what's up app</font>

532
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:05,860
that I got or 124 which means serve the

533
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:08,890
malware disguised as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> viber update or</font>

534
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:13,209
another<font color="#E5E5E5"> number which meant serve the</font>

535
00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:15,970
fish mms fishing content the mms fishing

536
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:17,590
content would<font color="#CCCCCC"> look something like this</font>

537
00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:20,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">it would take you to this page that</font>

538
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:22,480
showed a televised logo and then a

539
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:24,010
password block and says get mms if you'd

540
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:26,830
put in the password and get<font color="#CCCCCC"> ms it would</font>

541
00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:28,690
get<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the malware but what we also</font>

542
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:30,820
found is they have logos for all<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

543
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:34,150
different carrier carriers so what we

544
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:35,740
pursue this was it was an mms fishy so

545
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:37,690
they'd send a message to the target

546
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:40,360
saying you've received an mms message

547
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:41,710
that's too big for your inbox right go

548
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:43,659
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> this link and download it your</font>

549
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:45,040
password is X<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then you go to that</font>

550
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:46,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">link and it would show</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you your</font>

551
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:48,820
carrier's logo<font color="#E5E5E5"> because they could figure</font>

552
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:50,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">out you know who they were targeting so</font>

553
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:52,240
you'd see a sprint logo or whatnot and

554
00:20:50,530 --> 00:20:54,639
unit of your password and<font color="#E5E5E5"> get and get</font>

555
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:57,610
nailed with the malware so they had us

556
00:20:54,640 --> 00:21:01,540
fish mms or SMS phishing<font color="#CCCCCC"> Kemet see the</font>

557
00:20:57,610 --> 00:21:03,219
mms fishing campaign as well now here's

558
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:06,070
the cool<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing about bit ly right it</font>

559
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:08,680
keeps statistics about links it keeps

560
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:10,990
who the user is this admitted ease so

561
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:15,550
when<font color="#CCCCCC"> i looked up the user</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i saw that he</font>

562
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:17,710
had over 10,000 links made on his site

563
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:20,590
since july of 14 and this was in

564
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:22,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">November when I looked this up so 10,000</font>

565
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:24,790
links in that short of time and they all

566
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:26,080
appeared to go to BBC right we<font color="#CCCCCC"> all know</font>

567
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:28,120
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> they were</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really doing on the back</font>

568
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:30,310
end furthermore<font color="#CCCCCC"> though bit ly will also</font>

569
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:32,320
tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> you how effective your links are</font>

570
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:34,960
being clicked on and by which countries

571
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:36,669
so I also<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit ly provided me statistics</font>

572
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,440
about how<font color="#E5E5E5"> big this campaign is and who</font>

573
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:40,690
they were targeting now this<font color="#CCCCCC"> maps going</font>

574
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:42,670
to be slightly<font color="#E5E5E5"> skewed because if you</font>

575
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:44,440
click the link<font color="#E5E5E5"> from your sprint phone</font>

576
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:47,710
it's going to go through your<font color="#E5E5E5"> carrier's</font>

577
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:49,270
location right so like Russia is a lot

578
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:50,980
lighter because Russia doesn't really

579
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:53,290
have that<font color="#E5E5E5"> many carriers located in</font>

580
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:55,540
Russia a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> their in the UK but they</font>

581
00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:57,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">provide services to Russia so the IPS</font>

582
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:59,080
are kind of being going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be skewed for</font>

583
00:21:57,190 --> 00:22:01,540
mobile but it gives<font color="#E5E5E5"> you still a rough</font>

584
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:03,659
idea of who's clicking their links and

585
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:06,580
that they are effective at<font color="#E5E5E5"> least to some</font>

586
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:11,230
so let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me dig into the malware a little</font>

587
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:13,480
bit the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Android malware it disguises</font>

588
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:14,740
itself as a wap update as soon as you

589
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:16,150
run it then it shows you this

590
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:17,650
nice little<font color="#E5E5E5"> screen that disappears and</font>

591
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:19,150
in the background<font color="#E5E5E5"> its installed itself</font>

592
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:20,770
as a background service it starts up

593
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:22,900
every time<font color="#E5E5E5"> the phone starts up it is</font>

594
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:26,710
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pull your location your contacts</font>

595
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:28,300
it's able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to record audio its are able</font>

596
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:30,910
to look at phone logs and the mess logs

597
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:32,980
the record audio is creepy man let's

598
00:22:30,910 --> 00:22:36,370
like just turn the mic on for<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> minutes</font>

599
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:38,200
tell me what I here and leave right they

600
00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:41,350
have location information so they could

601
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:43,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">be like oh look he's at location X we're</font>

602
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:46,360
really interested in location X turn on

603
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:48,100
the mic all right turn<font color="#CCCCCC"> it off we're good</font>

604
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:51,010
so they could do some really<font color="#E5E5E5"> creepy</font>

605
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:52,750
things and even<font color="#E5E5E5"> more is the malware it</font>

606
00:22:51,010 --> 00:22:55,240
was very sly about how it would call

607
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:57,730
home what it would do is it would go

608
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:59,620
look for a tumblr blog and it would look

609
00:22:57,730 --> 00:23:02,770
for a user's blog and read his blog post

610
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:04,659
this blog is<font color="#E5E5E5"> some guys poultice the post</font>

611
00:23:02,770 --> 00:23:06,129
and it starts out fine<font color="#E5E5E5"> but then there's</font>

612
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:07,420
you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know if you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> read it but</font>

613
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:09,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">this whole blog right here is just a</font>

614
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:11,220
bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of gibberish if you look at source</font>

615
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:13,390
code it's wrapped in HTML tags and the

616
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:15,730
android phone knows to look for those

617
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:18,429
tags decrypt the data in between those

618
00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:20,050
tags which is actually command and

619
00:23:18,429 --> 00:23:21,880
control information so this blog post

620
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:24,610
says your real command and control

621
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:27,250
server is located at X please use this

622
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:30,100
address and<font color="#E5E5E5"> these passwords to talk to</font>

623
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:32,559
the command and<font color="#E5E5E5"> control place so really</font>

624
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:34,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">what would happen is that was just the</font>

625
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:37,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">first tier it would redirect them to a</font>

626
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:39,910
hacked website which then they would use

627
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:41,380
to use the<font color="#CCCCCC"> come on you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know use a path</font>

628
00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:43,540
that the the user of that website

629
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:45,160
doesn't know about to communicate what

630
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:47,110
they want the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Android malware to do and</font>

631
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:48,640
it would check not just one blog post

632
00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:50,320
but it would check one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a number of</font>

633
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:53,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">different places to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get its</font>

634
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:54,730
configuration information so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> would</font>

635
00:23:53,050 --> 00:23:56,710
have to block this you'd have to block

636
00:23:54,730 --> 00:23:58,090
every one of those blog sites yeah good

637
00:23:56,710 --> 00:24:01,210
luck blocking tumblr<font color="#CCCCCC"> or not having</font>

638
00:23:58,090 --> 00:24:02,409
somebody complain and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> ah if you</font>

639
00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:03,460
could block<font color="#E5E5E5"> their hacked sites but if</font>

640
00:24:02,410 --> 00:24:05,110
you blocked a<font color="#E5E5E5"> hacked site they could</font>

641
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:06,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">just put a new hack side up and a new</font>

642
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:07,990
blog post telling the malware to go to

643
00:24:06,670 --> 00:24:09,760
the new hack site so it was really easy

644
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:11,740
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> them to change where the commander</font>

645
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:14,559
control was in case they get caught or

646
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:16,059
the site gets they get found out on<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

647
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:17,678
<font color="#E5E5E5">hack site they can just throw down a new</font>

648
00:24:16,059 --> 00:24:19,780
heck site and change where the malware's

649
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:22,650
communicating<font color="#E5E5E5"> really kind of a sly</font>

650
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:25,690
design I really it's kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of impressive</font>

651
00:24:22,650 --> 00:24:28,559
so the iOS malware<font color="#CCCCCC"> is also interesting</font>

652
00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:30,779
it did require the phone to be jailbroke

653
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:32,940
which I mean to us<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the u.s. like</font>

654
00:24:30,779 --> 00:24:34,440
jailbreaks our phone but it actually is

655
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:36,600
more common outside the US<font color="#E5E5E5"> jailbreak</font>

656
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:39,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">your phone than it is in the US but</font>

657
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:41,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">anyways so the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> android/ios malware</font>

658
00:24:39,149 --> 00:24:43,559
wasn't as rich as the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Android malware</font>

659
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:45,330
but it still could pull your basic

660
00:24:43,559 --> 00:24:47,309
iTunes information you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> pull your</font>

661
00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:49,740
contacts hardware information about the

662
00:24:47,309 --> 00:24:52,830
phone look at your SMS messages call<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

663
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:55,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">calendar that sort of thing now when you</font>

664
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:57,299
root your android phone android ir

665
00:24:55,860 --> 00:25:01,049
excuse me when you read your iOS phone

666
00:24:57,299 --> 00:25:03,990
iOS is really just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to support OS x</font>

667
00:25:01,049 --> 00:25:07,139
right and so<font color="#CCCCCC"> OS x still has some root in</font>

668
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:09,210
bsd and so when you reroute it it city

669
00:25:07,139 --> 00:25:11,519
allows you to install<font color="#E5E5E5"> debian installers</font>

670
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:14,279
and that's what a cydia package really

671
00:25:11,519 --> 00:25:16,850
is just a<font color="#E5E5E5"> debian package so the malware</font>

672
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:19,559
this is the breakdown of the malware

673
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:21,209
really all the control section is<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

674
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:23,730
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> telling the debian package how to</font>

675
00:25:21,210 --> 00:25:25,799
install it<font color="#CCCCCC"> and what to do once it's the</font>

676
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:26,999
files are dropped and this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

677
00:25:25,799 --> 00:25:29,100
the files like it dropped the<font color="#CCCCCC"> disks so</font>

678
00:25:26,999 --> 00:25:32,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's a skype app that gets dropped a</font>

679
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:37,049
binary called calm vibe and then another

680
00:25:32,809 --> 00:25:39,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">debian package DB so if we start to look</font>

681
00:25:37,049 --> 00:25:41,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">at this the the post install information</font>

682
00:25:39,779 --> 00:25:44,129
is basically just say hey once your

683
00:25:41,730 --> 00:25:46,379
installed change comes VIP to executable

684
00:25:44,129 --> 00:25:50,820
change its owner to will which is the

685
00:25:46,379 --> 00:25:53,340
root user on iOS and then run it so that

686
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:55,289
and all comms bib is is actually just a

687
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:57,720
small little script that says sleep for

688
00:25:55,289 --> 00:26:00,600
10 seconds and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then install the deb deep</font>

689
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:02,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">debian package so we look at the deb DD</font>

690
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:05,189
<font color="#CCCCCC">mcnamee package what's inside it well</font>

691
00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:09,090
again we've got another post install and

692
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:11,340
we have this a calm Apple tour plist

693
00:26:09,090 --> 00:26:13,649
file and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then a seed binary file to</font>

694
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:15,269
other little files by it so the post

695
00:26:13,649 --> 00:26:19,139
install this time<font color="#E5E5E5"> after you copy those</font>

696
00:26:15,269 --> 00:26:22,470
files down change this bin /c file to

697
00:26:19,139 --> 00:26:24,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">root owner make it executable change the</font>

698
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:27,659
permissions on the tour<font color="#CCCCCC"> Apple plist</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

699
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:30,090
then remove the<font color="#CCCCCC"> comms file that I'm</font>

700
00:26:27,659 --> 00:26:31,860
running right now remove<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Debian</font>

701
00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:34,110
package so it's just cleaning up the

702
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:36,360
first mess and then installing this

703
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:39,600
message now if you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> familiar with</font>

704
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:41,369
window with mac OS or iOS this launch

00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,480
damon's plist appeal list is like a

706

dictionary for<font color="#E5E5E5"> apple</font>

707

and that launched<font color="#E5E5E5"> Damien's is basically</font>

00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:48,690
say hey I want this to<font color="#E5E5E5"> run and start up</font>

710
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:50,549
and so we look at that and sure enough

711
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:53,280
that's what it says it says hey run user

712
00:26:50,549 --> 00:26:54,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">bin see on startup run it load every</font>

713
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:56,730
time the phone reboots run this program

714
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:59,040
in the background now with iOS you

715
00:26:56,730 --> 00:27:00,480
unless with its rooted you have to have

716
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:02,309
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of way of monitoring this but</font>

717
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:04,799
you typically aren't looking at<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

718
00:27:02,309 --> 00:27:06,270
system process or what threads are

719
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:08,429
running right so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is hiding in the</font>

720
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:09,780
background where nobody's going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see</font>

721
00:27:08,429 --> 00:27:12,570
it unless they're really trying to find

722
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:15,270
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> and sure enough we look at file see</font>

723
00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:17,909
and it is it's a mock<font color="#CCCCCC"> Oh binary it would</font>

724
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:19,620
work on interesting enough it was

725
00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:21,720
compiled it doesn't show you there

726
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:24,209
there's actually compiled for iOS 7 and

727
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:25,470
later so we can tell they were targeting

728
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:28,470
newer iPhones you gotta have at least a

729
00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:30,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">7 or newer for it to work but it did</font>

730
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:33,809
work on the 64 bit so it worked on the

731
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:34,919
really new stuff and then just in

732
00:27:33,809 --> 00:27:36,870
passing we'll talk about the blackberry

733
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:39,390
malware when I saw it like black there

734
00:27:36,870 --> 00:27:41,549
who writes malware from who uses a

735
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:43,140
blackberry anymore right like I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font>

736
00:27:41,549 --> 00:27:44,610
see these things very often and I it

737
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:46,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">took me a little bit to get my head</font>

738
00:27:44,610 --> 00:27:48,330
around reading the malware reading just

739
00:27:46,650 --> 00:27:51,780
reversing a blackberry app in the first

740
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:54,720
place it didn't have as many features as

741
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:56,820
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other it was really slim full</font>

742
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:58,320
account information what it<font color="#CCCCCC"> really could</font>

743
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:59,939
do is it could pull complete hardware

744
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:02,189
information I mean it could pull stuff

745
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:04,620
down<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the temperature</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the phone in</font>

746
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:06,000
your pocket why the attackers cared how

747
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:07,290
taught hot your phone is I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know</font>

748
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,730
maybe they wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know if you were</font>

749
00:28:07,290 --> 00:28:10,020
inside or outside so they knew if they

750
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:11,640
have missile would hit<font color="#CCCCCC"> you I don't know</font>

751
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:13,168
<font color="#E5E5E5">but they could pull such things and they</font>

752
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:15,600
did they pulled the temperature earphone

753
00:28:13,169 --> 00:28:17,309
they pull address book carrier

754
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:20,189
information and the list of installed

755
00:28:17,309 --> 00:28:22,260
apps so just kind of it I<font color="#E5E5E5"> never actually</font>

756
00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:24,210
saw<font color="#E5E5E5"> this one at a store used that they</font>

757
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:26,070
had the capability whether they ever

758
00:28:24,210 --> 00:28:30,330
found a target<font color="#E5E5E5"> that had a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> blackberry I</font>

759
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:32,309
don't know so as we started finding

760
00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:34,860
these malware pieces they have a lot of

761
00:28:32,309 --> 00:28:37,320
little tricks in them though that you

762
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:39,510
know once I saw<font color="#E5E5E5"> the SSC SCCM file that</font>

763
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:41,370
Chinese malware I knew that<font color="#CCCCCC"> these guys</font>

764
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:42,900
were sly and as we started to<font color="#E5E5E5"> find</font>

765
00:28:41,370 --> 00:28:43,979
artifacts<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know typically as a</font>

766
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:45,540
reverse order I'm looking for these

767
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:47,460
artifacts that clues to see who's behind

768
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:49,440
this but when I know they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> throwing</font>

769
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:52,080
things in there to throw<font color="#E5E5E5"> me off I have</font>

770
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:53,620
to double to have the second guess every

771
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:55,179
clue i see now because i did

772
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:57,370
throw that<font color="#E5E5E5"> in there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> purpose or was</font>

773
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:59,050
that in there to throw me off<font color="#E5E5E5"> and sure</font>

774
00:28:57,370 --> 00:29:01,209
enough there's a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these so the iOS</font>

775
00:28:59,050 --> 00:29:02,680
malware it had the compile path and in

776
00:29:01,210 --> 00:29:04,690
the Cabal path shows the user name<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

777
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:11,020
John clerk I could believe that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

778
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:13,720
plausible but the blackberry malware had

779
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:15,460
inside of it it used a string as a kind

780
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:18,850
of a key token that was god save the

781
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:20,559
queen like yeah I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that one's in</font>

782
00:29:18,850 --> 00:29:22,090
there is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> fake I'm just gonna put god</font>

783
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:25,059
save the queen in there because I'm so

784
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:27,580
patriotic i I don't I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that's in</font>

785
00:29:25,059 --> 00:29:29,590
there just<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of throw us off in the</font>

786
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:31,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">Android malware you would see some</font>

787
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:34,270
strings that are I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that one's</font>

788
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:36,370
Farsi so array wick do they have a ray

789
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:38,440
week developers working on this and then

790
00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:41,820
again in the blackberry malware and

791
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:46,710
another spot there was<font color="#CCCCCC"> Hindi characters</font>

792
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:49,360
so they have Hindi UK array vakh and

793
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:51,880
change like just getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to</font>

794
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:53,889
figure out who's behind this was<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

795
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:56,500
kind of shady I don't know if I can

796
00:29:53,890 --> 00:29:58,270
believe any of those tricks another one

797
00:29:56,500 --> 00:30:00,460
is they use this really long string

798
00:29:58,270 --> 00:30:03,639
which looks like a keyboard smash to

799
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:05,290
generate a hash for a password and based

800
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:06,910
on that keyboard smash the characters

801
00:30:05,290 --> 00:30:09,760
that are there it tells me<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they had</font>

802
00:30:06,910 --> 00:30:11,920
a US keyboard so right like the the

803
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:14,590
carrot the dollar signed the hash those

804
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:16,360
are only on the standard keyboard layout

805
00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:19,000
for a<font color="#CCCCCC"> u.s. or a US international</font>

806
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:21,850
keyboard maybe that's a clue maybe now I

807
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:25,679
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know these ones I all kind of had</font>

808
00:30:21,850 --> 00:30:28,510
to throw out<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just couldn't put any any</font>

809
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:31,059
trust into them but there were some

810
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:33,250
clues that I felt like I could get so

811
00:30:31,059 --> 00:30:35,950
with the cloud me accounts and I could

812
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:37,780
see when tasking was when they put up<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

813
00:30:35,950 --> 00:30:40,270
task for their malware I<font color="#CCCCCC"> could see what</font>

814
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:42,220
time of the day that was put there and I

815
00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:44,679
kind of gathered that information for

816
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:45,790
the periods of time and I noticed it<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

817
00:30:44,679 --> 00:30:48,400
corresponds to about an eight-hour

818
00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:50,620
window<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm like okay well what</font>

819
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:52,030
eight-hour window does that what time

820
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:54,340
zone does that eight-hour window line up

821
00:30:52,030 --> 00:30:56,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">from like eight to five and it turns out</font>

822
00:30:54,340 --> 00:31:00,809
that tunt that would line up with gmt to

823
00:30:56,500 --> 00:31:00,809
which is this red time zone right here

824
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:04,840
also

825
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:07,060
we'll just keep that<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mind we'll come</font>

826
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:08,919
back to that also<font color="#E5E5E5"> when they would at</font>

827
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:12,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">tasc their malware that the name</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

828
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:15,250
file would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be like but one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 1239 bin and</font>

829
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:17,860
then later we'd see one that's like one

830
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:21,370
one two three<font color="#CCCCCC"> I guess nothing about</font>

831
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:23,020
Frank 1131 bin and so they were kind of

832
00:31:21,370 --> 00:31:25,360
incrementing their files each time<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

833
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:27,910
do at asking now I didn't have privilege

834
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:29,620
to all their accounts but I check one

835
00:31:27,910 --> 00:31:31,060
one night and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then check again the next</font>

836
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:33,370
night and see how much that numbers

837
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:36,220
incremented and I'd be like okay so over

838
00:31:33,370 --> 00:31:37,870
that 24 power<font color="#CCCCCC"> 24 hour period</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it looks</font>

839
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:40,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">like they tasked a hundred different</font>

840
00:31:37,870 --> 00:31:42,820
samples so that means they've got at

841
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:44,379
least a hundred different active targets

842
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:46,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're working where they're working at</font>

843
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:48,850
this moment every day right by the<font color="#CCCCCC"> time</font>

844
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:51,310
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this thing was over that number was</font>

845
00:31:48,850 --> 00:31:53,260
up almost a 10,000 that's how many

846
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:55,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">different taskings they've done with</font>

847
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:57,340
their malware over those few months like

848
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:59,290
these guys were serious<font color="#E5E5E5"> and because I</font>

849
00:31:57,340 --> 00:32:00,639
knew they were targeted that meant they

850
00:31:59,290 --> 00:32:02,379
weren't just hitting everybody that they

851
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:03,520
had<font color="#E5E5E5"> that many specific targets that they</font>

852
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:07,950
were<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually able to get what they</font>

853
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:10,450
wanted from or at least getting it on um

854
00:32:07,950 --> 00:32:13,390
giudice everything on that<font color="#E5E5E5"> slide I think</font>

855
00:32:10,450 --> 00:32:16,680
so also there were some other

856
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:19,120
similarities to spur<font color="#CCCCCC"> skeet so we</font>

857
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:20,590
correlated with<font color="#CCCCCC"> first year</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we shared our</font>

858
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:22,090
notes before<font color="#CCCCCC"> release public and</font>

859
00:32:20,590 --> 00:32:23,800
kaspersky was kind enough to say you

860
00:32:22,090 --> 00:32:25,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">know what this resembles one of our</font>

861
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:27,340
previous campaigns that we discovered

862
00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:28,510
called<font color="#E5E5E5"> Red</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> October</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and we look and there</font>

863
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:30,310
are since there are some key

864
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:32,230
similarities first off these fishing

865
00:32:30,310 --> 00:32:34,600
documents look fairly similar but one is

866
00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:36,070
the one on the left is from Red October

867
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:38,350
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the one on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the right is from</font>

868
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:40,360
inception campaign<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right same kind</font>

869
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:42,340
of here here's a diplomatic car now

870
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:44,020
that's not a strong indicator because

871
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:46,179
it's easy for me<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take somebody else's</font>

872
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:48,310
malware repurpose it for my uses and

873
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:50,560
send it out there were also some

874
00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:53,050
indicators like they use this particular

875
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:55,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">string to key where their shellcode</font>

876
00:32:53,050 --> 00:32:56,919
wasn't in the document and that

877
00:32:55,030 --> 00:33:01,690
particular stream was the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> both</font>

878
00:32:56,920 --> 00:33:03,880
Red October and inception<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then there</font>

879
00:33:01,690 --> 00:33:05,470
was some code shared between them which

880
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:06,910
was used for compression that looked

881
00:33:05,470 --> 00:33:08,980
exactly the same same kind of function

882
00:33:06,910 --> 00:33:10,690
argument and the code library is the

883
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:12,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">same now that's not all three of those</font>

884
00:33:10,690 --> 00:33:14,440
aren't really strong sting indicators

885
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:16,590
but they are<font color="#CCCCCC"> pretty strong indicators</font>

886
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:18,650

you

00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:19,200
it was it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was pretty easy to detect when</font>

922
00:39:17,609 --> 00:39:20,730
that's dropped that file the leads

923
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:24,990
itself did I kick something else should

924
00:39:20,730 --> 00:39:27,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">I use this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ok yeah it was pretty easy to</font>

925
00:39:24,990 --> 00:39:29,939
detect when you knew had it when it runs

926
00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:33,210
it deletes itself so you have a small

927
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:36,480
window to hit it but vibrant av's should

928
00:39:33,210 --> 00:39:37,619
be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to catch</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that and the thing is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

929
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:40,290
don't these guys aren't active anymore

930
00:39:37,619 --> 00:39:42,030
right like we were watching their things

931
00:39:40,290 --> 00:39:43,500
and like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said 48 hours within the</font>

932
00:39:42,030 --> 00:39:45,480
release of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the report they shut it down</font>

933
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:47,190
a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the malware was still calling</font>

934
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:50,430
home but nobody<font color="#E5E5E5"> was answering and even</font>

935
00:39:47,190 --> 00:39:52,230
the proxies even the router my son<font color="#E5E5E5"> over</font>

936
00:39:50,430 --> 00:39:54,930
traffic through it anymore so they were

937
00:39:52,230 --> 00:39:56,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">they were</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very cautious and we knew once</font>

938
00:39:54,930 --> 00:39:58,200
released they'd probably shut down we

939
00:39:56,760 --> 00:40:05,250
knew that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they were so risk at first</font>

940
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:08,310
that that was that was their<font color="#E5E5E5"> Forte there</font>

941
00:40:05,250 --> 00:40:10,829
were the email server domain names those

942
00:40:08,310 --> 00:40:18,119
three domains we could have tried<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see</font>

943
00:40:10,829 --> 00:40:20,430
hold them but we didn't I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think part of</font>

944
00:40:18,119 --> 00:40:22,560
it is once so I'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> get your I gotta go</font>

945
00:40:20,430 --> 00:40:24,839
my question once we discovered the

946
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:27,839
mobile malware it was on their server

947
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:29,759
and so we did hit their server take

948
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:32,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">download that mobile malware and to get</font>

949
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:34,829
those lists of carriers and we did<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

950
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:36,810
on a Friday they noticed our traffic has

951
00:40:34,829 --> 00:40:39,390
shutdown<font color="#E5E5E5"> the mobile server that weekend</font>

952
00:40:36,810 --> 00:40:42,359
so at that point we knew we tip the Hat

953
00:40:39,390 --> 00:40:44,190
that we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> on to them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and now they know</font>

954
00:40:42,359 --> 00:40:47,880
it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we knew we really should</font>

955
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:49,680
really soon and<font color="#CCCCCC"> so we did and that's</font>

956
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:51,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">about the course of action that within a</font>

957
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:54,480
week or two we released our paper at

958
00:40:51,210 --> 00:40:57,510
that point so<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah I mean they're</font>

959
00:40:54,480 --> 00:41:00,109
watching it's hard<font color="#CCCCCC"> to watch them without</font>

960
00:40:57,510 --> 00:41:03,380
tipping the finger that we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> onto</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

961
00:41:00,109 --> 00:41:03,380
do you have a question

962
00:41:06,770 --> 00:41:12,990
so we noticed it in a sensor and it was

963
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:14,669
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> we were watching for that</font>

964
00:41:12,990 --> 00:41:16,770
exploit we knew that exploit come out in

965
00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:18,560
April we knew<font color="#E5E5E5"> it would be a hot topic so</font>

966
00:41:16,770 --> 00:41:21,150
we received was using adapted to exploit

967
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:25,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's looking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for documents that had that</font>

968
00:41:21,150 --> 00:41:29,660
signature it was an ollie overflow I

969
00:41:25,170 --> 00:41:29,660
don't I<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't give</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you the details 1761</font>

970
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:45,750
so so kind of a hard<font color="#CCCCCC"> cut</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> way I see stuff</font>

971
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:48,690
going up but it's encrypted it's all

972
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:51,930
encrypted unique to that guy right and

973
00:41:48,690 --> 00:41:53,760
in fact what we found out is so there

974
00:41:51,930 --> 00:41:56,580
was a username and<font color="#E5E5E5"> password for each</font>

975
00:41:53,760 --> 00:42:00,330
malware and then it had a path for

976
00:41:56,580 --> 00:42:02,250
upload and pad for demo and we kind of

977
00:42:00,330 --> 00:42:04,350
simply figured out or assumed or

978
00:42:02,250 --> 00:42:06,690
concluded that the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> username an</font>

979
00:42:04,350 --> 00:42:09,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">account was used for each target found</font>

980
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:10,830
like business but different paths were

981
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:12,240
used and different<font color="#E5E5E5"> Griffin keys for</font>

982
00:42:10,830 --> 00:42:13,830
different targets within that business

983
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:15,479
so a lot of times you'll be able to see

984
00:42:13,830 --> 00:42:18,960
a document going up but we wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

985
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:21,510
the key<font color="#CCCCCC"> to that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> document um in fact I</font>

986
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:28,500
never actually was able to get or see

987
00:42:21,510 --> 00:42:32,100
anybody's PDF or<font color="#E5E5E5"> Word docs decrypter so</font>

988
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:34,770
another we reached up any<font color="#E5E5E5"> of our clients</font>

989
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:36,210
that we knew had this but we also are

990
00:42:34,770 --> 00:42:37,980
released the samples that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are not</font>

991
00:42:36,210 --> 00:42:39,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">necessarily within our network and</font>

992
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:42,540
that's where<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm a lot of these samples</font>

993
00:42:39,210 --> 00:42:44,370
came from so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's cases where they're</font>

994
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:47,160
not our customer it's kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of hard to</font>

995
00:42:44,370 --> 00:42:49,500
reach out that hey I'm a cuz I'm a you

996
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:51,299
know I have a sales guy blues coat I

997
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:52,830
think you've got malware and you need to

998
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:54,270
turn this up they're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to leave</font>

999
00:42:52,830 --> 00:42:56,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">my email so it's hard to reach out to</font>

1000
00:42:54,270 --> 00:42:57,300
people that aren't directly my customers

1001
00:42:56,040 --> 00:43:00,110
but where they were our customer we

1002
00:42:57,300 --> 00:43:00,110
tried to reach out to them

1003
00:43:07,510 --> 00:43:20,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">uh-huh yeah that's kind of fuzzy yeah no</font>

1004
00:43:15,490 --> 00:43:23,899
no it in and of itself we could really

1005
00:43:20,210 --> 00:43:25,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">trust it at all because there was the</font>

1006
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:28,330
other factors that kind of hinted that

1007
00:43:25,790 --> 00:43:30,590
way we thought maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> we could trust it</font>

1008
00:43:28,330 --> 00:43:35,500
but you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> right that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> totally not</font>

1009
00:43:30,590 --> 00:43:35,500
something I can rely on at all you know

1010
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:47,060
yeah I could have been a little bit more

1011
00:43:43,790 --> 00:43:51,830
cautious hitting their server to pull on

1012
00:43:47,060 --> 00:43:55,430
the mobile malware it's kind of a

1013
00:43:51,830 --> 00:43:58,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">trade-off though you have to hit it one</font>

1014
00:43:55,430 --> 00:43:59,480
way or another to get the kawaii<font color="#CCCCCC"> ziff I</font>

1015
00:43:58,490 --> 00:44:01,069
never would have hit the server I never

1016
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:03,950
would have hit got in needham Oh little

1017
00:44:01,070 --> 00:44:05,690
samples so it's a trade-off of do I want

1018
00:44:03,950 --> 00:44:07,490
the sample and try to play it slow

1019
00:44:05,690 --> 00:44:09,380
because if i play it<font color="#E5E5E5"> slow and try to</font>

1020
00:44:07,490 --> 00:44:10,819
play it cautious I wouldn't maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll</font>

1021
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:12,680
they would find me still and I wouldn't

1022
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:14,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">get as much data and we went through out</font>

1023
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:16,430
is we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to try to harvest as much as</font>

1024
00:44:14,330 --> 00:44:17,930
we can as quick as we can and even then

1025
00:44:16,430 --> 00:44:31,430
we weren't done harvesting before they

1026
00:44:17,930 --> 00:44:33,500
shows<font color="#CCCCCC"> down no I don't know we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

1027
00:44:31,430 --> 00:44:35,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">assumed I don't know for sure how they</font>

1028
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:40,160
detected us I'm assuming they looked at

1029
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:43,190
their access logs and they noticed that

1030
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:47,109
somebody from not Russia was there

1031
00:44:43,190 --> 00:44:47,110
that's my guess I don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> for sure</font>

1032
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:58,000
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know to me am</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I still worth</font>
