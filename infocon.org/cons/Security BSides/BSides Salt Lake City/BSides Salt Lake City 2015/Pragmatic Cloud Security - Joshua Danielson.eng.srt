16
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:33,089
it's been an interesting challenge

17
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:34,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">because we've taken a traditional</font>

software company and tried porting him

00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:38,399
over to be a true cloud company so it's

20
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:41,670
been a very challenging interesting

thing people think<font color="#E5E5E5"> of when they think of</font>

cloud people<font color="#E5E5E5"> think secure right well</font>

34
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:16,110
yeah not so much despite all be all the

platform by and large but we all know

saying no<font color="#CCCCCC"> as a security failure we've</font>

buy some<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason all the security people</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">think a lot of you actually have as well</font>

there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very good reason security</font>

people hold things up they don't see

<font color="#CCCCCC">value add a lot of times and I think</font>

that's one in<font color="#E5E5E5"> our case is where we have</font>

and actually showing true value add to

one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first things we discuss in</font>

56
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,100
information security won't ever talk

57
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:04,320
about cloud is you can't outsource your

58
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:05,729
critical functions that's insane they

59
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">control the data you have no control</font>

60
00:02:05,729 --> 00:02:09,389
over it well we do these things every

61
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:11,670
single day right after all we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have</font>

62
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:13,350
a money under store in either mattress

00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:15,179
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> despite we know and trust the big</font>

we trust the overall governance in the

any way comparing it to something<font color="#E5E5E5"> much</font>

69
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:25,680
more to mature as far as the banking

70
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,660
industry we have the FDIC and all these

71
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:31,980
other kind of checks and balances but it

72
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:35,280
is getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> there this is one of my</font>

73
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:36,560
favorite quotes from from the CIO the

74
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,520
formerly with the US<font color="#CCCCCC"> government</font>

75
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:41,460
basically he summed it up<font color="#E5E5E5"> in one long</font>

76
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:43,140
sentence Amazon Web sevens on web

77
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:45,270
services google impute all these large

78
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:46,859
platform providers they have experts

79
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:48,930
that can do these things<font color="#CCCCCC"> and can focus</font>

80
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:50,580
on these security tasks better than any

81
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:53,040
any one of our groups that more than

82
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:54,450
likely<font color="#E5E5E5"> can so it's kind of more</font>

83
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,980
important thing and that's why some of

84
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:58,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">these organizations such as Amazon Web</font>

85
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:59,940

86
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:03,359
of platforms that we can piggyback off

87
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:06,120
of so I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to preface the rest of</font>

88
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,830
rest of everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm saying with an X</font>

89
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:09,180
way you we do use Amazon Web Services

90
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:10,980
I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to say they're the best</font>

91
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:13,320
cloud provider or they're the only one

92
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:14,880
if if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> in dog Gartner and all that</font>

93
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:16,430
a kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of marketing stuff there at the</font>

94
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:19,740
top right corner which is a good thing

95
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:20,940
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> just kind of one bird note I don't</font>

96
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:21,840
work with Amazon we don't have any

97
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:23,160
partner we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have any other</font>

98

00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:27,150
getting paid for<font color="#E5E5E5"> them but rest of my</font>

100
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:28,680
conversation will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be will be a lot of</font>

model this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is probably one of the few</font>

109
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:47,490
in and then we go through traditional

110
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:48,750
audit the hoops and whatnot and one

111
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:50,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">thing they'd actually don't understand</font>

112
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:52,380
is what you're responsible for as a

113
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:54,180
customer what the provider is possible

114
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:56,070
as a provider and what<font color="#CCCCCC"> our customers are</font>

115
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:57,480
responsible as a customer so you can

116
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:58,829
take a nice look right here this is one

117
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,820
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the things I stole from amazon web</font>

118
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:01,800
services they have a lot of

119
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:02,940
documentation a lot of white paper some

120
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,140
really good stuff if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're really</font>

125
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:12,149
security programs and recommendations so

00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:13,950
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> talked about the blue stack over here</font>

127
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:16,019
at the top of what they recommend you do

128
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:17,099
to do as well so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is kind of</font>

129
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:18,510
important distinction we're going to

130
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:19,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of strip away some of the layers of</font>

00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:22,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">cloud and explain why this is actually</font>

132
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:24,539
more important when we strip away the

layers<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> CloudStack you can see</font>

at the infrastructure as a platform

secure or unsecured cloud but a platform

that can be secure for certain use cases

189
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:23,609
when you use appropriately so a quick

over cloud principles understanding what

00:06:25,139 --> 00:06:28,410
a cloud actually looks like there's been

193
00:06:26,789 --> 00:06:30,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">a lot of misconception as far as what</font>

194
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:31,590
the cloud actually is I have to

195
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:33,150
constantly report back to my boss and

196
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:34,859
<font color="#CCCCCC">tell them all the crap that's coming out</font>

197
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:36,120
that is just complete garbage so all the

198
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:37,349
stuff that's coming out recently around

199
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:39,360
the business<font color="#E5E5E5"> side of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the house is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

200
00:06:37,349 --> 00:06:40,420
cloud is not cheaper in fact it's

201
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,370
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> more expensive</font>

202
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:43,480
well when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> called cloud</font>

203
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:45,670
washing you take your traditional

204
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:47,530
software you plop it on ec2 instance and

205
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:49,090
you call<font color="#CCCCCC"> yourself cloud oh yeah that's</font>

206
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:50,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">not actually cloud and actually spending</font>

207
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:52,989
more money well going<font color="#E5E5E5"> through a few more</font>

208
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:54,280
use cases you can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> take take</font>

209
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:55,480
advantage of the cloud principles and

210
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:57,520
you can have a really true cloud

211
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:59,740
solution so that's kind of an important

212
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:02,229
distinction we<font color="#CCCCCC"> talked about Claude 10 on</font>

213
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:04,540
that cloud 20 you will never do patching

214
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:07,330
again you<font color="#E5E5E5"> will never do vulnerability</font>

215
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:09,790
scanning again people never ever log in

216
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:11,800
or<font color="#E5E5E5"> SSH rdp are otherwise directly into a</font>

box<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm talking about admins route</font>

218
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:15,310
otherwise I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> not just talking about</font>

219
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:18,580
users I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about no one the ssh 22</font>

220
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:19,570

00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:21,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk about how everything kind of</font>

00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:23,530
merchants and blends<font color="#E5E5E5"> into a cloud dev</font>

psych ops model and then have you

224
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:28,059
actually manages a scalability when we

225
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:29,310
look at some of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the true unicorns in the</font>

226
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:32,080
industry right now if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to take</font>

232
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:44,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">pretty freaking insane how do you manage</font>

all<font color="#E5E5E5"> these systems that are coming up and</font>

00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:48,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">down so you have a Friday night comes up</font>

235
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:49,930
everyone turns on their house of cards

236
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:51,659
saturday morning around 1am everyone

237
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:54,280
spins it back down you have to stand up

238
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:56,290
hundreds of systems thousands<font color="#E5E5E5"> of systems</font>

239
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:57,640
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> could facilitate this so we'll</font>

240
00:07:56,290 --> 00:07:58,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk about how you actually manage that</font>

241
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:00,969
type of elasticity in these environments

242
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:03,419
and then a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little peek about what's</font>

243
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:03,420
coming next

244
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:12,260
principles the first one is service<font color="#CCCCCC"> base</font>

245
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:13,909
so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is this is commoditization of IT</font>

246
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:16,099
we all know what<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is you</font>

247
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:17,870
plug in your your lamp into the wall and

248
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:19,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">the electricity kind of works you plug</font>

249
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:21,170
this in you plug in your server and then

250
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:22,400
that kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of starts working and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font>

251
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:23,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">you start up your server and starts</font>

252
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,770
working automatically so that's kind of

253
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:27,680
service base we all know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what that one</font>

254
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:28,760
looks like scalable and elastic so this

255
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">is one of the things a lot of security</font>

256
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:32,179
people kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of fight with initially and</font>

257
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:33,590
say we can't<font color="#CCCCCC"> secure this systems are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

258
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:35,419
constantly<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming up and coming</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> down how</font>

259
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:36,560
do you actually secure this stuff well

260
00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:37,429
I'll tell you this is actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of</font>

261
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:39,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">the things that usually used to our</font>

00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:42,710
notified and everything came elwell

264
00:08:41,059 --> 00:08:44,089
shell-shocked a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> months</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ago they're</font>

00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:48,560
across their entire load balancers

267

269
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:53,720
patching patching anything in 3d is

270
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,310
absolutely ridiculous so this is but so

271
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:56,690
you entirely look at it what's something

272
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:59,000
that looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a disadvantage and you</font>

273
00:08:56,690 --> 00:09:00,740
turn it<font color="#CCCCCC"> into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an advantage so using the</font>

00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:05,330
advantage shared to some degree there's

276
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:07,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to be something that is all we</font>

just basically means you get a bill at

285
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:22,160
the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the month kind of like you</font>

286
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:23,689
get your electric<font color="#CCCCCC"> arel tricity bill or</font>

287
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,890
whatever it may be<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then you get only</font>

288
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:27,860
pay for what you use and you don't pay

289
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:29,030
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you don't when you're talking</font>

always tell my boss this is capex versus

00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:34,100
effects and he gets all excited in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:36,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">Google we only pay for what we use for</font>

294
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:37,460
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> what not so the business people kind</font>

295
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:40,400
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> love that term when you talk about</font>

297
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:44,360
technologies this is really leveraging

00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:45,560
open<font color="#E5E5E5"> api's this is using mobile and what</font>

299
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:49,640
not to take advantage of<font color="#CCCCCC"> some of these</font>

300
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:53,780
type of characteristics so we'll dive in

301
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:55,850
cloud 10<font color="#CCCCCC"> versus cloud to cloud 10 this</font>

302
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:57,170
is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> original model t it's good</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

303
00:09:55,850 --> 00:09:59,150
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was but it will no longer</font>

304
00:09:57,170 --> 00:10:00,860
suffice what does this<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually look</font>

305
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:03,140
like so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I was giving the example</font>

306
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:04,400
about cloud wash this is saw the

307
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:05,540
organization's right now that are just

308
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:07,640
taking traditional piece of software

309
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:09,050
they spin up an ec2 instance on amazon

310
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:10,850
web services and they install themselves

311
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:12,439
there and they call<font color="#E5E5E5"> themselves cloud or</font>

312
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:14,660
they come up<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a hardon appliance and</font>

313
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:17,970
they install into the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ada US marketplace</font>

314
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:20,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">and say we're in the cloud now yeah</font>

315
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:21,870
not really don't tell some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these</font>

316
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:25,110
vendors out there because<font color="#CCCCCC"> I want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to blow</font>

317
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:26,610
their mind<font color="#CCCCCC"> stepa with several releases</font>

318
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:28,139
annually we know what this<font color="#E5E5E5"> looks</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

319
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:29,189
whenever<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's an update of a database</font>

320
00:10:28,139 --> 00:10:30,689
when there's an update<font color="#E5E5E5"> of major</font>

321
00:10:29,189 --> 00:10:32,459
operating systems and a major update any

322
00:10:30,689 --> 00:10:34,110
type of software it's all hands on deck

323
00:10:32,459 --> 00:10:36,119
it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> pain in the ass for that whole</font>

324
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:37,560
week everyone's on call<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know it's</font>

325
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:39,480
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a pain we all know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what this</font>

326
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:41,219
<font color="#CCCCCC">looks like it's these huge massive</font>

327
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:42,240
updates that we no one knows what's

328
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:46,500
going to happen but you know something

329
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:48,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">bad is going to happen and cloud washed</font>

330
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:50,519
I mean this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of a marketing term</font>

331
00:10:48,209 --> 00:10:51,869
that is going thankfully starting to

332
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:53,040
become a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit more use and kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

333
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:55,620
calling out these people are<font color="#CCCCCC"> trying to</font>

334
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:58,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">be cloud but really actually aren't so</font>

335
00:10:55,620 --> 00:11:01,230
that's what cloud isn't what is cloud

336
00:10:58,110 --> 00:11:03,389
then so I cloud I say cloud<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1 dot 0 and</font>

337
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:04,920
cloud 20 cloud $1 really just porting

338
00:11:03,389 --> 00:11:06,629
your stuff over cloud<font color="#E5E5E5"> to da dough is</font>

339
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:08,128
really building your software on top of

340
00:11:06,629 --> 00:11:09,120
the platform to take advantage<font color="#CCCCCC"> of some</font>

341
00:11:08,129 --> 00:11:11,550
of the things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was describing</font>

342
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:13,649
earlier so this is building<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

343
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:15,508
software on top of the provider within

344
00:11:13,649 --> 00:11:17,129
amazon web services they have<font color="#E5E5E5"> different</font>

345
00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:19,410
types<font color="#E5E5E5"> of storage you can actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

346
00:11:17,129 --> 00:11:20,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can use local volumes called EBS</font>

347
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:21,839
volumes you can use something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

348
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:23,819
functions a little bit more<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a slower</font>

349
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:25,620
sand is called s3 and have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> long</font>

350
00:11:23,819 --> 00:11:27,389
one really for archival purposes called

351
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:28,860
the glacier if you can kind of tear out

352
00:11:27,389 --> 00:11:30,540
your stuff so we actually tear our logs

353
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:31,829
for example you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can actually better take</font>

354
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:33,660
advantage of that but you have to be

355
00:11:31,829 --> 00:11:39,378
able to custom create your applications

356
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:42,149
on top of this infrastructure as code as

357
00:11:39,379 --> 00:11:43,589
cloud it becomes much more<font color="#CCCCCC"> popular there</font>

358
00:11:42,149 --> 00:11:44,939
will be less<font color="#CCCCCC"> and less administrators and</font>

359
00:11:43,589 --> 00:11:46,800
will be much more type of developer

360
00:11:44,939 --> 00:11:48,449
types i could say right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm not a</font>

361
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,729
developer but i had to spend a lot more

362
00:11:48,449 --> 00:11:52,589
time learning JSON XML and<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatnot</font>

363
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:54,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">because guess what my job as</font>

364
00:11:52,589 --> 00:11:55,529
administrator and architect isn't going

365
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,629
to exist in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same way it does in</font>

366
00:11:55,529 --> 00:11:59,610
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> 5 10 years or so you have to learn</font>

367
00:11:57,629 --> 00:12:00,809
to code from where comes the rule sets

368
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:02,670
when it comes to embedding hardening

369
00:12:00,809 --> 00:12:03,930
baselines and<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatnot I'll going to get</font>

370
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:05,790
into cloud factory of how you embed

371
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:07,500
these things in by default so you no

372
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:11,099
longer have to do patching<font color="#E5E5E5"> you no longer</font>

373
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:13,470
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do one ability scanning stream</font>

374
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:15,269
streamlined agile processes this is

375
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:16,589
taking advantage<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some such things so</font>

376
00:12:15,269 --> 00:12:18,629
you don't have to do patching into

377
00:12:16,589 --> 00:12:19,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">whatnot so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm steel too much of the</font>

378
00:12:18,629 --> 00:12:21,779
thunder coming down<font color="#E5E5E5"> but i just want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

379
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:23,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">point that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out and what does this look</font>

380
00:12:21,779 --> 00:12:25,410
like several<font color="#E5E5E5"> releases the day so i know</font>

381
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:28,259
i said the example earlier with amazon

382
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:30,509
web services of how they actually patch

383
00:12:28,259 --> 00:12:31,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">shell-shocked win a few days some of</font>

384
00:12:30,509 --> 00:12:33,420
these<font color="#CCCCCC"> organizations are known for doing</font>

385
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:36,209
few hundred updates in a single day

386
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:37,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">opposed a few every single year if you</font>

387
00:12:36,209 --> 00:12:38,670
learn<font color="#CCCCCC"> to take advantage of those it'll</font>

388
00:12:37,709 --> 00:12:44,069
really change the<font color="#CCCCCC"> way you can actually</font>

389
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:45,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">manage your environments so what are a</font>

390
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:47,850
few traits of a successful cloud

391
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:49,050
security program some of this we all

392
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:51,149
know is kind of redundant so I'm not

393
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:52,589
gonna dive in that know what framework

394
00:12:51,149 --> 00:12:54,089
you're working with have some reference

395
00:12:52,589 --> 00:12:57,329
architectures<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know I mentioned a</font>

396
00:12:54,089 --> 00:12:59,899
little bit of<font color="#E5E5E5"> api's one thing I what</font>

397
00:12:57,329 --> 00:13:02,250
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of touch on is some of the logging</font>

398
00:12:59,899 --> 00:13:03,450
some organizations<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are truly cloud</font>

399
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:05,760
and when I really<font color="#E5E5E5"> take advantage the</font>

400
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:07,320
average lifetime for server is 22 days

401
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:09,149
that's kind of around the benchmark

402
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:12,570
that's around the threshold so no longer

403
00:13:09,149 --> 00:13:14,040
our servers these cuddly pets that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

404
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:16,470
keep forever and eventually they die<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

405
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:17,819
six or seven years there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that</font>

406
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:19,769
actually are constantly rotating on a

regular basis<font color="#E5E5E5"> so how do you actually</font>

monitor those how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you actually log</font>

because it got it terminated<font color="#E5E5E5"> Oh three</font>

any people have to do only this type of

process or ITIL and all these other

types of terms we all know we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

comply with configuration<font color="#E5E5E5"> items good no</font>

you spin up a new one in its place and

it gets stood up and it gets repeated in

00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:28,140
a few instances that's how<font color="#E5E5E5"> you actually</font>

do things and how that's how things<font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font>

442
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:33,839
change in that way um see I management

443
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:35,969
for the first time ever I came from

444

remember one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the biggest things i</font>

actually had there's always<font color="#CCCCCC"> some jerk in</font>

the coroner who decided<font color="#E5E5E5"> that he didn't</font>

00:14:47,999 --> 00:14:51,870
other personal laptop and whatnot<font color="#E5E5E5"> so for</font>

454
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:53,758
the first time ever in cloud you

455
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:55,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually know what you actually have in</font>

456
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:57,689
front of you so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a screenshot</font>

457
00:14:55,529 --> 00:14:59,399
that we have in a console you know

458
00:14:57,689 --> 00:15:00,930
exactly<font color="#CCCCCC"> what's in front of you that's a</font>

459
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:02,759
luxury i know i never<font color="#E5E5E5"> had in previous</font>

460
00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:04,258

461
00:15:02,759 --> 00:15:05,879
connecting what within your<font color="#E5E5E5"> environment</font>

462
00:15:04,259 --> 00:15:07,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">and we kind of take advantage of this</font>

463
00:15:05,879 --> 00:15:09,180
with our configuration management tool

464
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:10,290
we use puppet other people you chef and

465
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:11,670
what not the puppet worked in<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

469
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:18,170
something else and it's not enrolled

logging all of our hardening and whatnot

472
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:24,300
we get a notification in real time if

473
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:28,008
something isn't within<font color="#E5E5E5"> scope everything</font>

474
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:28,008
is being managed by our security teams

475
00:15:31,129 --> 00:15:38,069
so DevOps what is DevOps I'll be honest

476
00:15:36,209 --> 00:15:39,449
I've been working on cloud for dedicated

477
00:15:38,069 --> 00:15:42,059
for about three years now I still don't

478
00:15:39,449 --> 00:15:43,680
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually no I was doing some item</font>

479
00:15:42,059 --> 00:15:45,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">riding variety square coming out with a</font>

480
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:47,189
new cloud security certification and

481
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:48,870
they had<font color="#E5E5E5"> all these people from Miss in</font>

482
00:15:47,189 --> 00:15:50,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">ISO all arguing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with each other and</font>

483
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:53,120
they're arguing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the sea in cloud</font>

484
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:55,378
should be capitalized or lowercase I

485
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:57,149
like good<font color="#CCCCCC"> God</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these are supposed to be</font>

486
00:15:55,379 --> 00:15:58,679
the industry experts creating all the

487
00:15:57,149 --> 00:16:00,809
baselines and all the revisions<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see</font>

488
00:15:58,679 --> 00:16:02,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">firmness</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah that's the state of the</font>

489
00:16:00,809 --> 00:16:04,319
industry I'm sorry to say so when all

490
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:06,029
these people and my boss and all these

491
00:16:04,319 --> 00:16:09,179
other people start using these terms in

492
00:16:06,029 --> 00:16:11,249
cloud and whatnot start misusing them no

493
00:16:09,179 --> 00:16:12,689
one can argue if the sky is blue because

494
00:16:11,249 --> 00:16:14,339
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> all know it is and everyone says it</font>

495
00:16:12,689 --> 00:16:15,990
is isn't we know they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> crazy if</font>

496
00:16:14,339 --> 00:16:18,240
someone says cloud isn't cloud and

497
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:19,439
weirdness using things and kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of using</font>

498
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,629
these terms it's because<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

499
00:16:19,439 --> 00:16:23,339
defined yet even people<font color="#E5E5E5"> working on it</font>

500
00:16:21,629 --> 00:16:24,720
really don't have a good enough idea yet

501
00:16:23,339 --> 00:16:26,610
to come up with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a single</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> set of terms</font>

502
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:31,319
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> whatnot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I sing these people arguing</font>

503
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:32,879
it doesn't make you feel good but DevOps

504
00:16:31,319 --> 00:16:34,878
it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> just the it's a philosophy</font>

505
00:16:32,879 --> 00:16:37,740
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> how do you actually connect debe</font>

506
00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:39,660
development with operations we've we've

507
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:41,249
had a few successful experimentations in

508
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:42,929
this it's really just making everyone

509
00:16:41,249 --> 00:16:44,189
own to whole solutions instead of one

510
00:16:42,929 --> 00:16:45,929
group pointing four fingers at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the other</font>

511
00:16:44,189 --> 00:16:47,550
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> vice versa and what not is having</font>

512
00:16:45,929 --> 00:16:49,319
them kind of collaborate much more of a

513
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:50,279
collaborative type of culture and some

514
00:16:49,319 --> 00:16:52,469
things we've actually done to make this

515
00:16:50,279 --> 00:16:54,029
much more successful we've made<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of</font>

516
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:56,129
our developers be on call and fix

517
00:16:54,029 --> 00:16:57,569
operational issues we've taken some of

518
00:16:56,129 --> 00:16:58,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">our system administrators and we pour</font>

519
00:16:57,569 --> 00:17:00,270
them on the

520
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:02,400
a development side of the house<font color="#E5E5E5"> and may</font>

521
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:03,689
then write some code so having them have

522
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:05,099
dual ownership across the<font color="#E5E5E5"> board is</font>

523
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:06,390
really kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of critical to building that</font>

524
00:17:05,099 --> 00:17:07,560
culture of DevOps and making sure that

525
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:11,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">you actually build solutions that are</font>

526
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:11,810
much more robust much more<font color="#E5E5E5"> agile</font>

527
00:17:14,669 --> 00:17:18,610
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I talked about this before we're</font>

528
00:17:17,049 --> 00:17:21,189
really beginning to streamline and

529
00:17:18,609 --> 00:17:22,779
really assembly line driven asset

530
00:17:21,189 --> 00:17:24,250
management enroll used to this type of

531
00:17:22,779 --> 00:17:25,990
stuff as far as provisioning new system

532
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:26,949
and it comes down the line and six weeks

533
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:28,809
from now you get it racked and stacked

534
00:17:26,949 --> 00:17:29,889
you get it connected and then you can

535
00:17:28,809 --> 00:17:31,539
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of use it and we're like that's</font>

536
00:17:29,889 --> 00:17:32,889
that's assembly line use well then

537
00:17:31,539 --> 00:17:34,000
everyone kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of goes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in and a custom</font>

538
00:17:32,889 --> 00:17:36,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm talking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about a hundred percent</font>

539
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:39,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">managing customized from the get-go so</font>

540
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:40,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">like I said before instead of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

541
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:43,840
managing servers we don't manage any

542
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:46,600
service anymore we managed docker images

543
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:48,039
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> manage a fuse OpenStack we don't use</font>

544
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:49,959
OpenStack house but it's another one and

545
00:17:48,039 --> 00:17:51,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">then also cloud formation templates</font>

546
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:52,509
those are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the things you manage those</font>

547
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:53,830
are the things you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to scrutinize</font>

548
00:17:52,509 --> 00:17:55,809
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> make sure that people aren't going</font>

549

to messing with your servers<font color="#E5E5E5"> no one's</font>

constantly coming up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and down anyways</font>

552
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:02,740
those are no longer things you have to

00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:04,299
scrutinize and<font color="#E5E5E5"> worry about because you</font>

tagging logging metadata these are what

00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:16,210
your configuration items are there are

559

no more snowflakes<font color="#E5E5E5"> no longer out these</font>

floating in the corner by themselves and

that there's a one critical function so

564
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:25,719
don't touch it because everything is

565
00:18:23,169 --> 00:18:27,519
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to break this has a heavy reliance</font>

566
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:29,230
than<font color="#E5E5E5"> api's this is where we worked with</font>

567
00:18:27,519 --> 00:18:30,669
a lot of vendors so far and we really

568
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:32,879
<font color="#CCCCCC">haven't seen a lot of integration quite</font>

569
00:18:30,669 --> 00:18:35,289
yet we've had<font color="#E5E5E5"> to kind of build our own</font>

570
00:18:32,879 --> 00:18:37,600
so allowing all these kind of

571
00:18:35,289 --> 00:18:39,399
configuration uh to be synchronized with

576
00:18:44,529 --> 00:18:48,250
good job<font color="#E5E5E5"> at doing it but they gave me</font>

577
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:49,658
much more relying on these<font color="#E5E5E5"> api's we're</font>

579
00:18:49,659 --> 00:18:56,440
managing all these systems across the

but we're all used to server hugging

00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:17,678
idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> of them there static systems they</font>

they stay up for a few years and they're

595
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:22,178
used to staying there forever we never

596
00:19:20,649 --> 00:19:24,219
really moved them their shift them they

597
00:19:22,179 --> 00:19:25,960
stay the same there are snowflakes

598
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:27,160
they're all kind of sora one-offs each

599
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:31,000
server is different than the

600
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:33,760
and otherwise or looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at now is</font>

601
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:36,550
service orientated solutions not server

602
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:38,230
orientated solutions so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is where I</font>

603
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:40,629
peas and names you<font color="#CCCCCC"> come meaningless I</font>

604
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:41,980
don't even I can tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> you the ranges but</font>

605
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:43,510
I have absolutely<font color="#E5E5E5"> no clue what the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bot</font>

606
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:45,130
what our critical boxes energy<font color="#E5E5E5"> I peas</font>

607
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:47,440
are almost no one else in our

608
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:49,810
environment either<font color="#E5E5E5"> again these systems</font>

609
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:51,400
are ephemeral like I said servers are

610
00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:53,350
now lasting several days not several

611
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:55,930
years anymore these servers become

612
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:57,310
mechanized by code so I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

613
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:58,960
developer but I had to learn a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font>

614
00:19:57,310 --> 00:20:01,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the development JSON XML and</font>

615
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:02,980
otherwise to begin integrating a lot of

616
00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:04,540
these<font color="#CCCCCC"> components together you have to</font>

617
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:06,430
also be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to shoot the other node in</font>

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> head you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be able at any</font>

619
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:10,090
moment get rid of any air systems any of

620
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:12,280
your servers and know that they can be

621
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:14,199
resilient not to come<font color="#E5E5E5"> back into place I</font>

622
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:15,700
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I use netflix has a lot an example</font>

623
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:17,800
but they have a tool called a security

624
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:19,780
monkey I cheeks chaos monkey and it goes

625
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:21,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">around shutting off shutting off random</font>

626
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:23,170
service about the entire environment the

627
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:25,180
whole goal is that if you're resilient

628
00:20:23,170 --> 00:20:27,130
at any<font color="#CCCCCC"> given time when something that</font>

629
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:30,390
actually does happen you'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> be ready</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

630
00:20:27,130 --> 00:20:30,390
because you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> already been ready</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for it</font>

631
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:37,870
so managing scalability<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll give kind</font>

632
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:39,970
of a simplified version<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this but I</font>

633
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:42,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">think it's still pretty useful</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> oh we</font>

634
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:43,300
call it a Bluegreen deployment we've a

635
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">few other people actually using this</font>

636
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:46,870
environment to I haven't<font color="#CCCCCC"> seen it cut too</font>

637
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:48,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">much fire yet but you can find if you do</font>

638
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:50,620
a few searches for it basically it's

639
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:52,060
this you have a running stack you have

640
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:53,169
your green stack and it's running all

641
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:54,760
the stuff you currently need so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

642
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:58,240
is patch management this may be a dated

643
00:20:54,760 --> 00:21:00,250
version of open SSL a new vulnerability

644
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:02,290
comes out you have to create a new<font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font>

645
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:03,670
so you actually update a new a new<font color="#E5E5E5"> stack</font>

646
00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:05,440
and all this stuff is being<font color="#E5E5E5"> done in real</font>

647
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:06,790
time this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a whole bunch of server</font>

648
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">in whole bunch of time this is all being</font>

649
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:09,610
done in real time<font color="#CCCCCC"> in cloud formation</font>

650
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:11,320
templates it takes several minutes to

651
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:12,820
mimic a current environment of a few

652
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:14,200
hundred servers if this isn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> a whole</font>

653
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:17,439
manual process that has to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take a</font>

654
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:19,030
scrutiny week or so<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get done so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

655
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:22,150
stand up a new environment with the open

656
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:23,230
updated version openssl you swap this

657
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:24,940
through your load<font color="#E5E5E5"> balancers that you</font>

658
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:26,440
have in<font color="#E5E5E5"> front that's kind of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pron kind</font>

659
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:28,600
of tried anything looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing in front</font>

660
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:30,490
and you swap it to the new one and keep

661
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:32,290
in mind<font color="#E5E5E5"> your your static content</font>

662
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:33,370
whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe you can see the back end</font>

663
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:35,740
database on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the other side in the back</font>

664
00:21:33,370 --> 00:21:36,909
end that stays the same but your servers

665
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:39,250
that are just doing the processing those

666
00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:42,180
are ephemeral and then you get rid<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

667
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:42,180
the old dated version

668
00:21:44,759 --> 00:21:50,320
so kind of quickly touching on this as

669
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:51,279
far as<font color="#E5E5E5"> a security management I know I</font>

670
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:54,070
talked about vulnerability management

671
00:21:51,279 --> 00:21:55,570
patch management and<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatnot monitoring</font>

672
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:57,009
a little bit well but<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font>

673
00:21:55,570 --> 00:21:59,379
will begin to change you will never have

674
00:21:57,009 --> 00:22:02,109
to patch your systems again because

675
00:21:59,379 --> 00:22:04,599
there's no reason to you update the base

676
00:22:02,109 --> 00:22:06,129
image in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Amazon they call it a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mi and</font>

677
00:22:04,599 --> 00:22:08,019
Amazon machine image you upload that

678
00:22:06,129 --> 00:22:09,279
base image you shoot any type of servers

679
00:22:08,019 --> 00:22:10,869
you have in the head and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you replace</font>

680
00:22:09,279 --> 00:22:15,609
them you back<font color="#E5E5E5"> fill them all this happens</font>

681
00:22:10,869 --> 00:22:17,738
in a few minutes so what we do we

682
00:22:15,609 --> 00:22:20,019
actually have a cloud factory so I want

683
00:22:17,739 --> 00:22:20,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> give one specific example in here of</font>

684
00:22:20,019 --> 00:22:22,809
when we stand up a new customer

685
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:24,190
environment we have our base am I we

686
00:22:22,809 --> 00:22:26,019
have multiple products multiple types of

687
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:28,659
solutions but we have a base am I Amazon

688
00:22:26,019 --> 00:22:30,879
machine image we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have and it rolls down</font>

689
00:22:28,659 --> 00:22:32,559
to factory line and in there we're able

690
00:22:30,879 --> 00:22:34,809
to embed all of our security baseline

691
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:36,039
wearable ensured that<font color="#CCCCCC"> splunk forwarders</font>

692
00:22:34,809 --> 00:22:38,259
actually monitoring to our indexers

693
00:22:36,039 --> 00:22:39,399
properly we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to ensure we're</font>

694
00:22:38,259 --> 00:22:41,950
building out documentation for our

695
00:22:39,399 --> 00:22:42,939
customers that need that some have some

696
00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:45,070
specific requirements that have

697
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:46,659
everything that<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to be document some</font>

698
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:48,099
some governments and whatnot still want

699
00:22:46,659 --> 00:22:49,389
to ensure everything named everything's

700
00:22:48,099 --> 00:22:50,889
<font color="#CCCCCC">Probert will give it to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them we have</font>

701
00:22:49,389 --> 00:22:53,559
this all created this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> already</font>

702
00:22:50,889 --> 00:22:55,299
scripted as well we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have performance</font>

703
00:22:53,559 --> 00:22:57,158
testing integration testing across the

704
00:22:55,299 --> 00:22:58,210

the factory for the bakery floor it

721
00:23:25,809 --> 00:23:29,440
turns in these two instance you're able

722
00:23:27,729 --> 00:23:30,669
to insert any type of repositories

723
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:33,549
anything that's actually custom for that

724
00:23:30,669 --> 00:23:34,899
single a single solution back then at

725
00:23:33,549 --> 00:23:36,668
that point you're able to install the

726
00:23:34,899 --> 00:23:38,080
any type of custom applications in our

727

00:23:42,669 --> 00:23:47,609
rolls down and it<font color="#CCCCCC"> gets born into an ec2</font>

instance

733
00:23:51,010 --> 00:23:55,610
and then within the cloud formation

734
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:57,650
templates this fits into the bigger

735
00:23:55,610 --> 00:23:59,178
picture as I was describing before we're

back in its own front-end type of

739
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:06,080
systems you have its own virtual private

740
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:07,700
cloud as well so each new customer that

741
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:09,379
we provision has its own virtual private

742
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:10,460
cloud and this all comes together you

743
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:12,200
can see the left and right we have

744
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:15,470
different production systems this can<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

this is not manual type of hands on the

<font color="#E5E5E5">this before the best way to avoid</font>

752
00:24:28,090 --> 00:24:36,678
failure is to fail constantly and this

00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:37,879
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> i know i talked about security</font>

00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:43,220
many people here can say with confidence

if you go out<font color="#E5E5E5"> and plug one of your</font>

764
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:56,090
if something fails and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know it fails</font>

765
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:57,649
you can know what that looks like you

766
00:24:56,090 --> 00:25:04,370
can script it to automatically become

they've open source a lot of stuff

771
00:25:08,330 --> 00:25:11,720
they've come out with their whole simian

772
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:13,129
army they call it probably the biggest

773

00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:20,809
certain availability zones within each

777
00:25:19,130 --> 00:25:22,399
region and they have multiple regions

778
00:25:20,809 --> 00:25:23,870
throughout the entire<font color="#E5E5E5"> globe so in the</font>

another one for government up in Oregon

783
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:32,630
I think it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is so within a single</font>

788
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:41,750
have to shut down absolutely everything

789

that's running for you this came in

types of<font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font>

800
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:04,500
a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> things for embracing the DevOps</font>

801
00:26:02,910 --> 00:26:06,720
philosophy I encourage everyone to read

802
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:08,070
these aren't security Burke books per se

803
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,300
but they're really critical and

804
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:11,129
understanding<font color="#CCCCCC"> how you can better manage</font>

805
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:12,540
these types of denied dynamic

806
00:26:11,130 --> 00:26:14,940
environments probably the one<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would</font>

807
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:17,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">say is kind of security is anti fragile</font>

808
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:20,100
from the same to lib he describes a

809
00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:21,690
property of anti fragility or there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> no</font>

810
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:24,000
really word for being anti fragile we

811
00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:25,830
use words such as robust resilient to

812
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,780
describe things that you're resistant to

813
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:30,030
breaking so if i have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a steal a steal</font>

814
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:31,710
pot and I drop it may be resistant but

815
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:33,750
isn't anti fragile it doesn't become

816
00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:35,370
stronger because I did do that well

817
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:36,990
that's the types of environment were

818
00:26:35,370 --> 00:26:38,610
trying to build that do become stronger

819
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:42,800
because we<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually have it undergo</font>

820
00:26:38,610 --> 00:26:49,020
these types of stress stress tests and

what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> next a home or homomorphic</font>

encryption this is probably one of newer

823
00:26:50,970 --> 00:26:54,240
things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think will really start to</font>

824
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:55,620
get a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> things take enough in the</font>

few more updates on research<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've seen</font>

recently that this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> already</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

857
00:27:53,490 --> 00:27:56,940
happening it's nowhere near efficient

858
00:27:55,410 --> 00:28:00,650
but it's already<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually happening so</font>

859
00:27:56,940 --> 00:28:00,650
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> biggest hurdle has already been done</font>

00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:09,480
mine who actually runs the security team

862
00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:10,440
over there at a Microsoft and Azure he

863
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:12,960
doesn't hold<font color="#E5E5E5"> too much against me because</font>

864
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:14,220
we run amazon but one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the things he</font>

865
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,610
shared it was one of coolest things are

00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:16,500
doing

00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:18,059
there with endure us security operations

center<font color="#CCCCCC"> their sock was actually making</font>

869
00:28:18,059 --> 00:28:21,299

870
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:22,889
having<font color="#E5E5E5"> so much more data than ever</font>

871
00:28:21,299 --> 00:28:24,059
before how do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually respond how</font>

872
00:28:22,890 --> 00:28:25,920
do you actually alert to these<font color="#E5E5E5"> types of</font>

873
00:28:24,059 --> 00:28:27,240
things so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actual screen shot</font>

874
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:28,380
of one of the things that they're one of

00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:30,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">the panels they actually have in your</font>

sock you can actually see and hear

877
00:28:30,929 --> 00:28:34,350
events as they're happening in real<font color="#CCCCCC"> time</font>

878
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:35,490
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see is kind of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> analyst</font>

879
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:38,580
right there is kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of zooming into a</font>

880
00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:39,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">subsection within a greater spectrum you</font>

881
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:45,480
can actually see and hear these types of

882
00:28:39,870 --> 00:28:47,489
events happening in real<font color="#CCCCCC"> time so with</font>

883
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:48,510
that thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's everything</font>

884
00:28:47,490 --> 00:29:00,480
else i'm not sure if there's any

885
00:28:48,510 --> 00:29:04,220
questions but<font color="#CCCCCC"> uh no questions all right</font>

886
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:04,220
feel free to come<font color="#E5E5E5"> up i'll be around oh</font>

887
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:12,270
no you did not so one of the pieces that

888
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:13,260
for actually I had the slide in here too

889
00:29:12,270 --> 00:29:16,379
i think<font color="#E5E5E5"> last time i did this</font>

890
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:17,760
presentation i ran over a bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> more let's</font>

891
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:18,900
talk let's catch up after this because

892
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:20,580
it's probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of the ones i actually</font>

893
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:22,049
have a dedicated slide for this I ran

894
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:24,210
over last time as actually was giving

895
00:29:22,049 --> 00:29:25,530
this talk at cactus<font color="#CCCCCC"> con last week and so</font>

896
00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:26,790
they kind of scolded me so let's catch

897
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:27,899
up after this<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think that's a very</font>

898
00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:30,230
good question of Logging's one of the

899
00:29:27,900 --> 00:30:05,220
bigger things that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to do so</font>

900
00:29:30,230 --> 00:30:06,900
anything else so<font color="#E5E5E5"> because we actually</font>

901
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:08,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> everything we have everything</font>

902
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:10,140
located initially under local servers

903
00:30:08,549 --> 00:30:12,030
which come up and down we have every you

904
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:13,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">splunk so we use slunk as their stem all</font>

905
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:14,730
that data is actually still kept in

906
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:17,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">archive within splunk and we have that</font>

907
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:18,780
teardown civil type of tears so for

908
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:20,040
hippo we have seven years for example

909
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:21,690
for those types<font color="#E5E5E5"> of customers and we have</font>

910
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:23,159
that in s3 bucket so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we still are able</font>

911
00:30:21,690 --> 00:30:25,050
to maintain those<font color="#CCCCCC"> to actually address</font>

912
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:25,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">those compliance regimes and whatnot but</font>

913
00:30:25,050 --> 00:30:27,330
we do it in a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of a different</font>

914
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:28,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">fashion so when they come back and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look</font>

915
00:30:27,330 --> 00:30:29,879
at a server we act

916
00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:31,320
can't go to a specific server that was

917
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:32,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually looking at we can go back to</font>

918
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:33,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">the overall service and we can show them</font>

919
00:30:32,610 --> 00:30:35,520
every single server that was potentially

00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:37,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">within scope of that which always</font>

921
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:38,370
existed and we can show them the

00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:39,809
assurance controls we have ensuring that

923
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:40,739
all systems that you just<font color="#E5E5E5"> cause it</font>

doesn't exist<font color="#E5E5E5"> anymore that we have</font>

926
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:45,450
have changed control and all the logs

927
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:47,040
are within cloud sure we can go back<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">show them this is when the server was</font>

stood<font color="#E5E5E5"> up this is when the servos stopped</font>

930
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:52,470
they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go through and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> look through</font>

931
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:54,750
a few hundred servers have at<font color="#CCCCCC"> it I felt</font>

932
00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:56,790
working with we worked with<font color="#CCCCCC"> KPMG for a</font>

933
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:58,890
sock one and ISO 20000 one stuff when we

934
00:30:56,790 --> 00:31:00,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">worked with a few other organizations in</font>

935
00:30:58,890 --> 00:31:02,100
the healthcare space and<font color="#E5E5E5"> also in the</font>

936
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:03,600
financial sector as soon as you saw in

937
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:05,189
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> assurance controls and you got a</font>

938
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:06,178
really get them the warm fuzzies as far

939
00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:07,799
as what you're actually doing it

940
00:31:06,179 --> 00:31:09,090
actually works well they feel a lot

941
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:10,379
better at it and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can actually just</font>

942
00:31:09,090 --> 00:31:11,639
go to<font color="#CCCCCC"> splunk and you can show them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

943
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:12,809
is what<font color="#CCCCCC"> we've got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Oh what server do you</font>

944
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,980
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look into we can show you all</font>

945
00:31:12,809 --> 00:31:15,720
the servers that<font color="#E5E5E5"> were terminated within</font>

946
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:17,010
the past year past month what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

947
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:18,780
want to see all the servers that<font color="#E5E5E5"> were</font>

948
00:31:17,010 --> 00:31:19,950
started in the past<font color="#E5E5E5"> year past month we</font>

949
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:21,360
can show them<font color="#E5E5E5"> all that and we can show</font>

950
00:31:19,950 --> 00:31:23,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">them in a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> few moments not even minutes</font>

951
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:24,479
we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> show them like a few seconds it's</font>

952
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:25,918
an easy drop down so once they kind of

953
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:27,480
see we actually know what we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font>

954
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:29,070
and you actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a good handle of</font>

955
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:30,929
it it usually gives people the assurance

956
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:32,909
they need and all the data is there<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

957
00:31:30,929 --> 00:31:34,380
all within our<font color="#CCCCCC"> splunk ins and indexers</font>

958
00:31:32,910 --> 00:31:36,000
so it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually hiding it's not</font>

959
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:37,169
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting terminated the servers</font>

960
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,790
are because they were really<font color="#E5E5E5"> a femoral</font>

961
00:31:37,169 --> 00:31:44,780
that's just the processing piece but the

962
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:44,780
log data is still there anything else

963
00:31:46,309 --> 00:31:50,030
all right<font color="#E5E5E5"> thank you</font>
