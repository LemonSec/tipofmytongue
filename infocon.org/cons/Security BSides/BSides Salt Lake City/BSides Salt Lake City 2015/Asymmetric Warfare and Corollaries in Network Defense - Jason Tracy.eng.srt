1
00:00:01,739 --> 00:00:07,630
so I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to start</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out let's see it's</font>

2
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:09,430
a small crowd which is cool i'll try to

3
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:11,590
project i'm not going to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> a big deal</font>

4
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:14,620
about it but this should be good how

5
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:17,349
many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you are network folks what i</font>

6
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:18,698
mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> by that is you've configured or you</font>

7
00:00:17,349 --> 00:00:22,800
know how to run a router or routers

8
00:00:18,699 --> 00:00:26,319
switch or switches firewall firewalls

9
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:28,869
network services<font color="#E5E5E5"> dns those kinds of</font>

10
00:00:26,319 --> 00:00:30,999
things so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a network kind of</font>

11
00:00:28,869 --> 00:00:32,590
thing that's not disrespectful towards

12
00:00:30,999 --> 00:00:34,420
the coders or application security guys

13
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:36,310
because will actually talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about a</font>

14
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:37,950
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of that but it's just going</font>

15
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:41,980
to be touching on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the edge of it so</font>

16
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:45,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">based on that how many of you know what</font>

17
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:48,400
flow information is<font color="#E5E5E5"> network flow how</font>

18
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:52,840
many of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you collect and or use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> network</font>

19
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:54,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">flow data ok so I'm going to just tell</font>

20
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:57,250
you for just a minute what network flow

21
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:59,710
data is and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a simple way of</font>

22
00:00:57,250 --> 00:01:01,540
saying it when you have traffic that

23
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:05,019
you're sitting out<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the internet or</font>

24
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:08,560
transiting on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet network flow</font>

25
00:01:05,019 --> 00:01:10,719
data pretty much gives you a few really

26
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:13,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">critical things source destination</font>

28
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:18,189
timestamp you'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> get protocol</font>

29
00:01:16,389 --> 00:01:20,439
information you can get other types of

30
00:01:18,189 --> 00:01:21,999
information in it as well but<font color="#CCCCCC"> generally</font>

31
00:01:20,439 --> 00:01:25,059
speaking and I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> telling</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you to straight</font>

32
00:01:21,999 --> 00:01:27,818
up its is not payload data this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not</font>

33
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:30,280
he kept tight payload data network flow

34
00:01:27,819 --> 00:01:32,079
data is just kind of like a network

35
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:34,659
telemetry tech data that's not user

36
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:39,219
related but its transit service provider

37
00:01:34,659 --> 00:01:42,369
type related that being said I'm going

38
00:01:39,219 --> 00:01:44,529
to kind of talk from that mindset and

39
00:01:42,369 --> 00:01:46,270
I'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> mention a little bit damn</font>

40
00:01:44,529 --> 00:01:47,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">thanks for the intro and some of you</font>

41
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:51,490
folks know mean I've known some of you

42
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:53,499
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> years and years now but but work for</font>

43
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:56,439
the Utah<font color="#E5E5E5"> Education Network where our</font>

44
00:01:53,499 --> 00:01:59,439
service provider for about 1.5 almost

45
00:01:56,439 --> 00:02:02,369
six million IP addresses it's a s210 on

46
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:05,999
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet we run six to seven</font>

48
00:02:05,999 --> 00:02:12,160
it's a fairly decent-sized network in

00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:14,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">Utah it represents 41 district school</font>

all charter schools connections to it

52
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:21,079
doesn't hire it institutions and so it's

53
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:23,540
funny it's just<font color="#CCCCCC"> big enough to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

54
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:26,390
interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> right but it's not too big</font>

55
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:29,090
to not be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see so we are a</font>

56
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:32,809
service provider from an<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet</font>

57
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:34,760
service provider standpoint I attended<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

58
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:36,379
have the<font color="#E5E5E5"> opportunity</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to go to security</font>

59
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:39,769
conferences that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are service provider</font>

60
00:02:36,379 --> 00:02:41,899
relate security wise so some of the

61
00:02:39,769 --> 00:02:44,959
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I tend to really enjoy from</font>

62
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:47,239
our conferences here you know st. or

63
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:48,849
here def con or even some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the stuff</font>

64
00:02:47,239 --> 00:02:51,170
that's involved with the 801 group

65
00:02:48,849 --> 00:02:52,849
there's not a whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of relation with</font>

66
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:55,160
some of the ways I perceive security

67
00:02:52,849 --> 00:02:56,920
that's not to say it's special it's just

68
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:58,819
sometimes a little different that

69
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:01,220
background being said I was at a

70
00:02:58,819 --> 00:03:04,040
conference a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> months</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ago how many</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

71
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:05,750
you know what twitch TV is and who wants

72
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:10,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">to just tell us what it is it doesn't</font>

73
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:13,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">matter who</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so who has a guess on</font>

74
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:15,170
how popular it is huge like I'm telling

75
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:17,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">right now we went to kind of like a</font>

76
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:18,619
<font color="#CCCCCC">beard gear kind of social type thing a</font>

77
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:21,230
few months ago one of these<font color="#CCCCCC"> praise and</font>

78
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:22,790
tara conferences and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i was just shooting</font>

79
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:25,488
the bull sitting down<font color="#E5E5E5"> and joined Count</font>

80
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:27,530
of the crowd chillin a little bit and I

81
00:03:25,489 --> 00:03:31,069
found<font color="#E5E5E5"> myself sitting next to one of the</font>

82
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:34,220
twitch TV backbone engineers which was

83
00:03:31,069 --> 00:03:36,440
nuts I mean nuts and we're sitting<font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font>

84
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:38,120
talking and generally speaking and this

85
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:39,440
is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of open information I don't</font>

86
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:42,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">think there's anything crazy here but</font>

87
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:44,139
you en you know one point almost six

88
00:03:42,049 --> 00:03:48,500
million I PS 41 districts all that stuff

89
00:03:44,139 --> 00:03:50,930
we probably see a benchmark flow

90
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:55,880
somewhere in the high teens the high 20s

91
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:57,319
gig backbone wines but and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll see</font>

92
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:59,510
high watermarks that jump up into the

93
00:03:57,319 --> 00:04:01,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">40s but if we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go if we get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

94
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:03,888
30s and start leaning up there there

95
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:05,599
something wrong either<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's start a</font>

96
00:04:03,889 --> 00:04:07,040
school or there's a big update for apple

97
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:08,418
or something like that but generally

98
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:11,000
speaking when we move out of like high

99
00:04:08,419 --> 00:04:13,519
teens mid-twenties high 20s there's

100
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,260
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> not good going on so I'm</font>

101
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:18,680
sitting there talking with you knowing

102
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:20,750
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that now about somebody who's used</font>

103
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:22,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">to see in 20 30 40 gig of backbone</font>

104
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:24,710
traffic in a service provider

105
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:26,810
environment and over the course of a

106
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:27,739
couple hours the guy mentions to me how

107
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:31,370
they destroy

108
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:33,530
ute that service how they deliver twitch

109
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:36,620
to their customers which is crazy<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean</font>

110
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:38,750
it's crazy and it's interesting like we

111
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:40,310
would tend<font color="#E5E5E5"> to think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about core networks</font>

112
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:42,410
and backbone networks in a certain way

113
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:45,080
but when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you start talking it like major</font>

114
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:46,970
global networks that are top five

115
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:49,370
consumers<font color="#E5E5E5"> like commodity wise of</font>

116
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:50,900
Internet bandwidth it it<font color="#E5E5E5"> gets to be a</font>

117
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:54,020
bigger deal and their architecture start

118
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:55,909
to be crazy so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> telling you this</font>

119
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:57,948
information just kind of as a secondary

120
00:04:55,910 --> 00:04:59,599
thing but we were talking about some

121
00:04:57,949 --> 00:05:02,659
security things and how they actually

122
00:04:59,599 --> 00:05:04,759
scale to address security they don't

123
00:05:02,659 --> 00:05:07,789
scale vertically scale horizontal that's

124
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:13,099
an architectural thing and so they had

125
00:05:07,789 --> 00:05:18,110
an 800 gig<font color="#CCCCCC"> DDoS sometime in the last few</font>

126
00:05:13,099 --> 00:05:23,419
months 800 gig I've seen campuses tip

127
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:25,370
over 40 I mean just<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're done so I'm</font>

128
00:05:23,419 --> 00:05:27,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">like holy crap man how much bandwidth do</font>

129
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:31,909
you have the ability<font color="#CCCCCC"> to trance we're</font>

130
00:05:27,139 --> 00:05:34,039
about 1.2 tear that's nuts so I'm like

131
00:05:31,909 --> 00:05:36,440
how do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> mitigate it how do you you</font>

132
00:05:34,039 --> 00:05:40,990
know deal with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of an issue and</font>

133
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:44,599
so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> just eat it they just eat 800 gig</font>

134
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:47,479
so it gets me thinking about certain

135
00:05:44,599 --> 00:05:50,780
security implications and that's kind of

136
00:05:47,479 --> 00:05:51,800
the place where I'm coming from that's

137
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:53,179
why I asked a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit about your</font>

138
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:55,190
background and wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> you to know kind</font>

139
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:59,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">of where I'm coming from this is my</font>

140
00:05:55,190 --> 00:06:02,690
March Madness bracket<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and there's a</font>

141
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:06,620
point to that this is today's<font color="#CCCCCC"> scheduled</font>

142
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:11,360
for games and this is today's schedule

143
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:15,710
for b-sides right so we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to get</font>

144
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:18,680
this done uh this talk happened by

145
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:20,780
accident I'm telling you straight up it

146
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:23,419
wasn't a bad accident but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it wasn't a</font>

147
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:25,250
close colleague I'm on the committee

148
00:06:23,419 --> 00:06:26,659
with b-sides somebody invited me I don't

149
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:31,490
know if they'll invite me back it's been

150
00:06:26,659 --> 00:06:33,710
really cool but<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sean asks they send out</font>

151
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:37,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">CFP the call for presenters or we</font>

152
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:40,039
started to get ready to send it out and

153
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:41,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">nameís put together the code for it and</font>

154
00:06:40,039 --> 00:06:41,430
they're like we need somebody test and

155
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:43,169
like

156
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:45,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay I'll test it because i can type</font>

157
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:49,170
like the wind blows<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know so i just</font>

158
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:53,909
typed in a talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was a crazy idea</font>

159
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:56,900
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i found be cool and it goes like I</font>

160
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:59,550
didn't work try it again son like<font color="#E5E5E5"> timed</font>

161
00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:00,750
and it went through and he he's a go get

162
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:02,400
cool we're good to go and it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

163
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:05,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">one little blip and Seth knows this and</font>

164
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:06,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">whoever else on you know the way to the</font>

165
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:08,640
conference kind of things<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright cool</font>

166
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:11,159
see if<font color="#E5E5E5"> P is good to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go we'll roll it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

167
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:14,849
this that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sean's like hey thanks JT</font>

168
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:17,150
by the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for to your talk I'm</font>

169
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:19,650
serious<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> went down so I</font>

170
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:23,549
spent a few months nicotine I made that

171
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:27,989
up I just that is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's bull this is</font>

172
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:30,690
bull so so it's a bit of<font color="#E5E5E5"> an accident but</font>

173
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:32,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">I want to tell you something I don't</font>

174
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:36,930
necessarily<font color="#E5E5E5"> know well I can tell you</font>

175
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:38,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">right now I have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> no real idea personally</font>

176
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:40,620
like professionally about the

177
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:43,560
implications of trying to wrap my mind

178
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:46,740
around trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to feed a line of BS or to</font>

179
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:50,310
talk and where the truth may be<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

180
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:52,680
fallacy maybe and<font color="#E5E5E5"> all that so this thing</font>

181
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:56,820
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> asymmetry the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> abstract is kind of</font>

182
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:58,530
funny you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know asymmetric warfare and</font>

183
00:07:56,820 --> 00:08:02,090
correlation network defense it just

184
00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:04,289
sounds like<font color="#CCCCCC"> somebody made it up but um</font>

185
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:07,409
asymmetry literally means that you're

186
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:11,390
attacking<font color="#E5E5E5"> target you're intending to do</font>

187
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:15,150
harm or inflict damage on a victim in a

188
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:18,060
few different ways there's this kinetic

189
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:19,409
way kinetic is a force way you know

190
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:21,210
where you might be shooting them or

191
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:23,790
dropping bombs on them or whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

192
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:25,919
then there's the idea of cyber and we

193
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:28,680
could totally belabor that point all day

194
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:30,660
but this is an idea of asymmetry you

195
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:33,180
might have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> target you might say hey</font>

196
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:34,830
I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to attack one aspect of their</font>

197
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:37,439
critical infrastructure from a cyber

198
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:38,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">standpoint digitally if you will but I'm</font>

199
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,650
also going to attack them kinetically

200
00:08:38,909 --> 00:08:44,370
and that's what traditional asymmetry

201
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:47,220
means well even though it's an accident

202
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:51,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">I actually did think are there multiple</font>

203
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:54,150
modes of asymmetric threat from a cyber

204
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:55,080
standpoint that would actually be

205
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:57,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">something you could</font>

206
00:08:55,080 --> 00:09:00,540
try to identify and look for as a

207
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:05,490
network defender and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that there</font>

208
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:07,260
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> also want to mention the disclaimer</font>

209
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:09,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">if you think I'm up in the night I</font>

210
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:12,120
probably am but if you're interested<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

211
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:14,460
talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> things a little more just</font>

212
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:15,780
hit me up because I I think it's kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

213
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:17,130
cool<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I do think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there's something to</font>

214
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:19,110
affect I'm pretty sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's something</font>

215
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:21,120
to it and I'm sure I'm not the person<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

216
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:23,490
discover<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you to that right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now so</font>

217
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:25,890
the proverbial needle in a haystack and

218
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:30,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">I know it's been</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a little challenging</font>

219
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:32,730
avy with this room but there's the

220
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:34,770
needle in the haystack and<font color="#E5E5E5"> here is just</font>

221
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:40,770
literally an exercise for me to

222
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:45,180
demonstrate to you sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> for me to</font>

223
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:47,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">demonstrate to you what is that I'm</font>

224
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:50,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">trying to get on here so if you look</font>

225
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:56,010
this is output for my terminal and I did

226
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:58,920
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple things real simple just basic</font>

227
00:09:56,010 --> 00:10:01,439
and maps i targeted triple wa org right

228
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:04,110
that's where I work and I did<font color="#E5E5E5"> it from</font>

229
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:07,260
two locations one of the locations was

230
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:10,470
just right off the hot spot on my phone

231
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:12,660
and the other one location was off of<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

232
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:17,430
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a few VPS and this was like my san</font>

233
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:19,110
fran VPS so I just didn't end up that's

234
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:21,959
all I<font color="#E5E5E5"> did and it was really as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you can</font>

235
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:23,520
see what came back tcp AT&T to 443<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

236
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:25,950
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the font is small but I</font>

237
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:28,140
promise you that's what it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is and then I</font>

238
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:32,610
jumped into a flow collector network

239
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:34,650
flow collection box that we run and I

240
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:35,940
started looking at things now there's

241
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:39,209
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I learned a few months</font>

242
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:40,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">ago and the software guys and in the</font>

243
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:42,930
room I understand this a little bit

244
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:44,460
better but there's this concept of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

245
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:46,620
manifold since does anybody know who

246
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:48,690
what a manifold is from a software

247
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:50,010
standpoint how about from a security

248
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:52,650
standpoint anybody heard the term

249
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:55,110
manifold<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so well I'll just tell you</font>

250
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:56,790
what it what a manifold is<font color="#CCCCCC"> an manifold</font>

251
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:59,130
is exactly what that middle part says

252
00:10:56,790 --> 00:11:01,020
where it says destination / victim I've

253
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:02,910
got a command that say<font color="#E5E5E5"> an NF dump dash</font>

254
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:05,520
big<font color="#E5E5E5"> R and then it's got like some file</font>

255
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:06,750
locations and they're actually timestamp

256
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:08,220
starting at the beginning of the day in

257
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:09,160
the middle of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the day and then I've got</font>

258
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:10,600
some filter

259
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:12,519
that are saying hey I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> you to look</font>

260
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:13,930
at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> host which is actually IP address</font>

261
00:11:12,519 --> 00:11:17,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">that resolves a triple-double you a node</font>

262
00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:18,878
org<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so there's a ton of traffic that</font>

263
00:11:17,889 --> 00:11:20,800
comes back<font color="#E5E5E5"> from that I mean you'd</font>

264
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:22,649
imagine right I'm talking it just will

265
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:26,589
scroll and scroll and scroll and scroll

266
00:11:22,649 --> 00:11:28,779
but then I<font color="#E5E5E5"> started to build manifold the</font>

267
00:11:26,589 --> 00:11:30,879
manifold is moving<font color="#E5E5E5"> down to the second</font>

268
00:11:28,779 --> 00:11:34,209
line that I looked ya get it hosts you

269
00:11:30,879 --> 00:11:36,040
know 236<font color="#E5E5E5"> dot11 as it resolves but then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

270
00:11:34,209 --> 00:11:38,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">also added to the manifold this idea of</font>

271
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:41,439
and proto<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP I mean a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> traffic</font>

272
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:42,790
still in fact based on my end<font color="#E5E5E5"> map scans</font>

273
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:44,829
and what I actually know just on the

274
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:47,110
side these were probably roughly the

275
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:50,378
same you know besides whatever other

276
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:51,939
like ICMP type things or little things

277
00:11:50,379 --> 00:11:56,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">that people are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> looking for that get</font>

278
00:11:51,939 --> 00:12:00,189
blocked but the manifold keeps growing

279
00:11:56,110 --> 00:12:01,660
and I go to add proto tcp in port 443 so

280
00:12:00,189 --> 00:12:04,689
it's interesting one of the things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

281
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:05,829
I've learned along the way and I didn't

282
00:12:04,689 --> 00:12:08,319
necessarily<font color="#E5E5E5"> know that that's what it was</font>

283
00:12:05,829 --> 00:12:11,050
called<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as you're trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to isolate</font>

284
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:13,349
things from a security standpoint

forensic<font color="#E5E5E5"> Lee with network flow data</font>

286
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:18,370
you're actually building a manifold of

287
00:12:16,209 --> 00:12:21,399
everything that's normal and everything

288
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:23,800
that you expect to see and then it

289
00:12:21,399 --> 00:12:26,680
starts<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get interesting the things</font>

290
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:28,060
that you would<font color="#CCCCCC"> expect they go away</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

291
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:30,160
you build your manifold or build your

292
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:31,888
filters and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you didn't</font>

293
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:34,360
necessarily expect or start to be odd

294
00:12:31,889 --> 00:12:36,160
start to show<font color="#CCCCCC"> up as your manifold as</font>

295
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:41,170
your filter starts to close them out

296
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:42,719
yeah yeah it's a filter of normal yes

297
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:45,040
sir that's exactly<font color="#CCCCCC"> what it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is thank you</font>

298
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so then the next thing is and this</font>

299
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:48,219
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> where we start to say oh JT's behind</font>

300
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:49,329
the scenes like he actually knows what

301
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:50,980
he's doing because I did this on purpose

302
00:12:49,329 --> 00:12:53,800
to show y'all what I'm talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

303
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:55,329
what I think I'm talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about so moving</font>

304
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:56,829
down source attacker I've got another

305
00:12:55,329 --> 00:12:58,660
command it's exactly the same of the

306
00:12:56,829 --> 00:13:01,420
others but then i SAT<font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and said hey</font>

307
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:03,399
show me the<font color="#E5E5E5"> host which is X to the IP</font>

308
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:05,680
for that san fran VPS<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i told you</font>

309
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:08,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">about yeah I want to see proto TCP I</font>

310
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:10,959
want to see port 443 and next<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing you</font>

311
00:13:08,889 --> 00:13:13,120
know total float count summary total

312
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:14,529
flows for total bytes blah blah<font color="#CCCCCC"> all I</font>

313
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:17,139
saw were the four hits that were just

314
00:13:14,529 --> 00:13:19,269
part of my initial basic nmap scan and

315
00:13:17,139 --> 00:13:22,860
the timestamps correlate to if you look

316
00:13:19,269 --> 00:13:26,100
at it but anyways so

317
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:28,510
there's there's a difference between

318
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:31,000
what's going on at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the top with me</font>

319
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:33,340
coming off of my hot spotted connection

320
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,920
and what's going on at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the top with me</font>

321
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:40,240
coming off of my VPS in San Francisco

322
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:42,400
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's that you don't actually know</font>

323
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:45,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">that was me you wouldn't know that was</font>

324
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:48,069
me that has got an a nature of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

325
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:50,380
symmetry to it right it's coming off of

326
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:52,720
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> hot spot of the IP location it's</font>

327
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:54,850
called temporal locality it's coming off

328
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:56,950
of a temporal locality in one place and

329
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:59,230
a temporal locality in another but

330
00:13:56,950 --> 00:14:01,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">behind those two different temporal</font>

331
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:03,700
localities there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> one actor and that's</font>

332
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:05,830
me so that's kind of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> point of what</font>

333
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:07,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">asymmetry is talking about and not</font>

334
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:12,400
support where I'm saying if this sounds

335
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:14,589
nuts and it probably is so yeah I did<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

336
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:17,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">on purpose and it's only to illustrate</font>

337
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:19,800
the point that this is an easy way for

338
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:22,540
us to understand what the crap I think

339
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:25,089
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is what I think we're talking about</font>

340
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:28,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you might sit there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and say there is</font>

341
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:30,880
a Jekyll Hyde nature to it that we see

342
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:32,680
the guy that's acting you know totally

343
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:35,920
normally coming off of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the hotspot or</font>

344
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:37,989
coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of some area in this country</font>

345
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:40,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">you know and looking at things normally</font>

346
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:42,610
but what we don't see is that there's

347
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:44,980
the same actor with a second side to his

348
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:47,890
face that's coming out as maliciously

349
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:49,300
and trying to do damage one part of its

350
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:52,750
friendly and open the other part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> his</font>

351
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:55,719
obscure and closed we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> just about</font>

352
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:59,740
there who knows what the Internet of

353
00:14:55,720 --> 00:15:04,360
Things is who wants<font color="#CCCCCC"> to help us out with</font>

354
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:06,220
what it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is oh man but I didn't plan</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> us</font>

355
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:10,450
to cut to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the chase but that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> awesome</font>

356
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:13,180
so let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me give you what I think I think</font>

357
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:16,390
you're right so so the Internet of

358
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:18,729
Things cool cool gif I stole off the

359
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:21,840
tubes of you know a network-connected

360
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:25,510
fridge<font color="#E5E5E5"> network connected music whatever</font>

361
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:27,630
whatever that is down anyways I mean if

362
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:29,680
you just jump back five or<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten years</font>

363
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:31,450
most of<font color="#E5E5E5"> us would just sit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there and say</font>

364
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,800
yeah we've got more devices that are IP

365
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:34,660
connected in our homes

366
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,829
we ever had and we probably expect

367
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:38,529
they're going to have more devices that

368
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:40,660
are IP connect in our homes<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font>

369
00:15:38,529 --> 00:15:42,670
future<font color="#E5E5E5"> than we have now think about</font>

370
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:44,199
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> too for a second would you and</font>

371
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:47,079
we're still we're going to stay<font color="#E5E5E5"> on this</font>

372
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:49,870
slide but like you<font color="#CCCCCC"> got a linksys router</font>

373
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:51,550
almost in Wi-Fi you got a TV<font color="#CCCCCC"> at evo</font>

374
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:54,220
that's recording the TV shows as you

375
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:55,899
care about you might have a few other

376
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:57,070
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the nest controllers on the</font>

377
00:15:55,899 --> 00:15:58,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">wall</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they're taking care of your</font>

378
00:15:57,070 --> 00:16:02,140
temperature and things like that these

379
00:15:58,329 --> 00:16:05,519
things are IP connected so when was the

380
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:10,029
base image or firmware for that device

381
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:12,790
compiled for years ago five years ago

382
00:16:10,029 --> 00:16:15,610
last stable right was more than likely

383
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:17,560
not current because they're getting

384
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:20,110
ready to deploy to a production base of

385
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:22,569
tens if not hundreds of thousands maybe

386
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:25,269
even millions of consumers so they're

387
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:28,990
deploying a production base of software

388
00:16:25,269 --> 00:16:31,570
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is already behind and when was the</font>

389
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:33,430
last time that you or not to offend

390
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:36,910
anybody in the room but<font color="#CCCCCC"> when was the</font>

391
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:39,790
last time that your in-laws or your

392
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:42,939
non-technical uncle or aunt or whomever

393
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:45,779
patched the firmware on their home Wi-Fi

394
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:49,230
device the router they probably have it

395
00:16:45,779 --> 00:16:51,459
now how<font color="#E5E5E5"> many of you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in the room remember</font>

396
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:53,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">whether you've read</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about it or heard</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">about it or whatever I really don't care</font>

398
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:59,770
when there was talk about highways<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

399
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:02,079
you know like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you drive on with</font>

400
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:03,880
your car being built in such a way so

401
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:07,178
that they can<font color="#CCCCCC"> also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be used strategically</font>

402
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:12,099

00:17:07,179 --> 00:17:14,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">you remember I remember so think about</font>

404
00:17:12,099 --> 00:17:18,369
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> paradigm I'm going to tell</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you that</font>

405
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:20,559
I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> still here I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the highways that were being built</font>

407
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:27,040
in such a way architectural e to land

408
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:29,800
airplanes are you know still what's

409
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:31,240
being<font color="#CCCCCC"> used they may very well be but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

410
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:33,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">think that some of these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things are</font>

427
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:22,590
pretty happy about drama and I tend to

<font color="#E5E5E5">be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dramatic myself but I'm not big on</font>

431
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:30,840
you're seriously telling me that you

432
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:33,210
think the modern-day equivalent of us

433
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:34,830
landing airplanes on highways because

434
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:36,570
air strips have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been bombed out is now</font>

435
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:38,159
the internet of things being exploitable

436
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:41,100
because of old code bases that are

437
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:43,110
widely deployed and readily exploitable

438
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:45,149
in case of national Adrian it's kind of

439
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:48,899
what I'm telling<font color="#E5E5E5"> you but I don't want to</font>

440
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:52,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">get too nuts about it I'm not saying</font>

441
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:54,180
we're all gonna burn and die but it has

442
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:56,760
brought me<font color="#CCCCCC"> to this when Sean was like</font>

443
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:59,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">hey dude I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> need somebody said to the</font>

444
00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:02,250
group to check<font color="#E5E5E5"> cfp and see if it works</font>

445
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:04,439
and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just spewed my special brand of BS</font>

446
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:06,780
into that form and it didn't and i

447
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:09,360
spewed that special brand of BS again

448
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:10,920
with a little more lipstick on it and it

449
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:13,860
worked in the function check was good

450
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:16,820
and these<font color="#CCCCCC"> i go by the way i'm looking</font>

451
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:20,040
for your talk it set me to thinking and

452
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:22,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">i am not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure if that accident or a</font>

453
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:25,320
close call<font color="#CCCCCC"> that wasn't intended to be a</font>

454
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:30,210
talk has got me thinking it was either a

455
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:33,780
close call<font color="#E5E5E5"> ER it's too late so the talks</font>

456
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:35,910
not really about a symmetry because<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

457
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:38,040
don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that matters I don't think a</font>

458
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:39,720
symmetry matters I think if you've got a

459
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:42,180
threat that's coming in from two or more

460
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:43,440
directions that you should mitigate each

461
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:45,900
one of those threats as though they were

462
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:47,610
an atomic threat not an atomic thread

463
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:49,320
and like an atomic nuclear sense but an

464
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:51,240
atomic threat in the sense that it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

465
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:53,520
singular threat that you should take

466
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:56,370
care of regardless of what other threats

467
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:58,389
line up against it and may have a bad

468
00:19:56,370 --> 00:20:00,129
actor behind the scenes

469
00:19:58,390 --> 00:20:01,270
orchestrating it against you

470
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:03,370
asymmetrically because that doesn't

471
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:07,330
matter it doesn't matter I don't think

472
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:09,939
about hers um I'd recommend if you're

473
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:11,340
interested in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this kind of thing or if</font>

474
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:13,480
you you think that it's interesting

475
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:16,480
there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> gentleman by the name of Dave</font>

for cisco and then brocade poached him

478
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:25,540
and brought him over as their<font color="#CCCCCC"> CEO he</font>

479
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:27,970
talks about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this concept called robust</font>

things to become think about it there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

486

an inverse to that complexity you can't

00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:49,570
build in complexity and expected to

remain hauberk it won't great talk he's

489
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:53,139
probably given that talk more times and

490
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:54,670
he's wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> work but but you can find</font>

503
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:28,419
much akin to that line of thinking but

504
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:31,510
it has been updated and it is kind of

505
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:35,530
the Internet of Things thought with a

current mindset Paul hunting camp then

if you're interested<font color="#CCCCCC"> in flow related</font>

like an Internet traffic flow standpoint

things from an analyst standpoint

there's some awesome documentation a

long line with

523
00:22:11,799 --> 00:22:15,500
it talks about network security analysis

524
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:21,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">and things like that and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so I'd</font>

525
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:22,309
recommend that to ya this is kind of you

guys<font color="#CCCCCC"> know what core business processes</font>

527

right this is kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ideas I don't</font>

528
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:28,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">necessarily know that the true concern</font>

529
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:31,309
should be about knowing who the bad

530
00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:33,379
actor is this trying to attack us

531
00:22:31,309 --> 00:22:34,730
asymmetrically or who owns the botnet

532
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:38,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">too serious is the same thing it doesn't</font>

533
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:40,760
matter in my mind it doesn't matter I

534
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:44,510
don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> the court business process</font>

535
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:47,780
is the trivial many I think it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

536
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:50,510
critical view we tend<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get lost in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

537
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:52,490
weeds I'm forgetting about the critical

view and playing with the trivial<font color="#E5E5E5"> many</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">and it just doesn't matter anyways</font>

you know what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> wouldn't actually be</font>

545
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:35,480
able to detect it so imagine if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font>

546
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:37,909
trying to identify a botnet that had to

547
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:40,549
of thousands of hosts that were

00:23:37,909 --> 00:23:42,080
attacking unicorn quote and imagine you

549
00:23:40,549 --> 00:23:44,179
were<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually seeing both of them and</font>

550
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:45,470
somehow correlated them and I don't know

551
00:23:44,179 --> 00:23:48,500
how you<font color="#E5E5E5"> would necessarily go about doing</font>

552
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:52,520
that from a traffic<font color="#E5E5E5"> standpoint unless</font>

553
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:54,320
you employed other types of tools that

554
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:57,139
cert organization they<font color="#CCCCCC"> talked about</font>

555
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:59,330
actually capturing things at a non

<font color="#E5E5E5">sampled rate for flows which most people</font>

don't do or capturing full pcap data and

558
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:07,750
then look into those<font color="#CCCCCC"> things are trying</font>

559
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:10,640
to correlate them with high-level tools

560
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:12,710
but then imagine not you know second

561
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:14,450
bought of the two dropped off was

562
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:16,549
patched somebody mitigate the<font color="#E5E5E5"> drought or</font>

563
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:18,530
whatever and and next thing you know

564
00:24:16,549 --> 00:24:19,970
what's gone I don't really know and

565
00:24:18,530 --> 00:24:22,190
that's where i'm telling you SEF<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font>

566
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:24,530
kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of given up on it because i think</font>

567
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:25,149
asymmetries<font color="#CCCCCC"> exists but i don't think</font>

568
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:27,190
they're important

569
00:24:25,149 --> 00:24:29,859
or i should say i don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think there are</font>

570
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:31,679
as important as addressing atomic

571
00:24:29,859 --> 00:24:33,999
threats to the core business process

572
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:35,679
asymmetry a symmetry is a cool concept

573
00:24:33,999 --> 00:24:38,259
and it probably exists in fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm sure</font>

574
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:43,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">it exists but it's dumb it doesn't</font>

575
00:24:38,259 --> 00:24:45,399
really you know have anything to do with

576
00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:53,139
our day-to-day tactical in my opinion

577
00:24:45,399 --> 00:24:57,668
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> willing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be wrong I'm saying like</font>

578
00:24:53,139 --> 00:24:59,408
the the the threat surface is small<font color="#E5E5E5"> I I</font>

579
00:24:57,669 --> 00:25:01,239
wouldn't i would i would pay more

580
00:24:59,409 --> 00:25:02,979
attention to you know good firewall

581
00:25:01,239 --> 00:25:06,059
policies vendor agnostic<font color="#CCCCCC"> i really don't</font>

582
00:25:02,979 --> 00:25:08,889
care what better you<font color="#CCCCCC"> i said i don't</font>

583
00:25:06,059 --> 00:25:11,830
logging making sure you've got good

584
00:25:08,889 --> 00:25:14,049
patch schedules and some change controls

585
00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:15,580
i'm talking about the you know me and

586
00:25:14,049 --> 00:25:17,918
potato stuff that we all think is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

587
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:19,869
lame and not flashy i would totally

588
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:22,359
worry about that stuff that's meat and

589
00:25:19,869 --> 00:25:25,629
potatoes lame and not flashy before I

590
00:25:22,359 --> 00:25:27,189
even start to carry about asymmetry like

591
00:25:25,629 --> 00:25:28,748
I seriously just thought it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was killer a</font>

592
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:30,759
lot of this information I<font color="#CCCCCC"> was seeing and</font>

593
00:25:28,749 --> 00:25:34,210
picking up and wondering<font color="#E5E5E5"> and putting</font>

594
00:25:30,759 --> 00:25:36,879
together and I submitted the idea the

595
00:25:34,210 --> 00:25:39,190
thought is whimsically<font color="#E5E5E5"> onto the CFP as</font>

596
00:25:36,879 --> 00:25:40,509
we were testing it out and it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font>

597
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:41,799
thought exercise that's all it is

598
00:25:40,509 --> 00:25:44,229
seriously I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> not trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to waste</font>

599
00:25:41,799 --> 00:26:11,139
anybody's time it's just thought

600
00:25:44,229 --> 00:26:14,679
exercise but yeah yeah like a<font color="#CCCCCC"> uh yeah</font>

601
00:26:11,139 --> 00:26:17,080
like a smoke screen<font color="#CCCCCC"> I agree i think it's</font>

602
00:26:14,679 --> 00:26:18,909
important<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's the kind of</font>

603
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:22,978
thing that we would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be this is like TLA</font>

604
00:26:18,909 --> 00:26:22,979
type stuff that's what I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

605
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:34,880
or so<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I think the end result of your</font>

606
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:37,010
exercise here yeah bring those back when

607
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:40,880
the importance of protecting the end

608
00:27:37,010 --> 00:27:44,170
result<font color="#E5E5E5"> of your exercise here yeah</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bring</font>

609
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:44,170
