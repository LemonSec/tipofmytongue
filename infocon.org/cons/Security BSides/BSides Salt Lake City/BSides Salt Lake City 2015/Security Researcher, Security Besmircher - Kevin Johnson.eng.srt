11
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:42,510
well I'm me I didn't pick this name when

12
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:44,910
I turned 18<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I probably should have</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">picked something better you know Kevin</font>

14
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:48,599

18
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:02,489
awful I uh the reason i point that out

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,540
is when<font color="#E5E5E5"> i was flying out here it's the</font>

20
00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:07,619
first<font color="#E5E5E5"> time it's affected my flights</font>

21
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:09,360
normally it just affects things like if

22
00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:11,220
like I had a car stolen when the cops

23
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,929
picked me up to<font color="#CCCCCC"> show me you know come</font>

24
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:15,270
bring me downtown to talk about the car

25
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:17,670
being stolen they ran my name it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

26
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:23,130

106
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:54,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">amazing I'm biased right I learned when</font>

107
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:56,700
brenda was born my oldest that every

108
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:58,440
parent in the world believes that their

109
00:04:56,700 --> 00:05:02,250
child is the smartest most beautiful

110
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:04,500
most amazing kid ever the second thing I

111
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:09,300
learned was every other parent was wrong

112
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:10,800
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> and so they are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> main</font>

113
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:14,310
reasons I do what I do and they're

114
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:16,800
actually what drives this talk because I

115
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:20,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that this talk is something that's</font>

116
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:24,150
critical for us as an industry but I'm

117
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:26,100
biased right so<font color="#CCCCCC"> uh let me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know if you</font>

118
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:27,390
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> reach out to me ever now of</font>

119
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:32,730
course this doesn't work that's

120
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:36,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">wonderful that means i have to be up</font>

121
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:38,880
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> I hate being up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on stage I really</font>

122
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:41,310
do it's funny I'm a traveling consultant

123
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:44,010
that speaks all over the country I hate

124
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:46,710
public speaking I hate traveling and I

125
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:48,870
hate meeting new people so I picked this

126
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:51,599
job I don't know how that<font color="#CCCCCC"> happened right</font>

127
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:56,090
but the reality is that what we've got

128
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:59,220
today is a wild west of security right

129
00:05:56,090 --> 00:06:02,340
everybody and their brother knows about

130
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:04,080
security today<font color="#E5E5E5"> they may not know good</font>

131
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:06,419
things they may not know correct things

132
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:09,390
but it's something we talked about it's

133
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:11,430
a big topic hell the fact that what we

134
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:16,280
do has made it to the state of the union

135
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:19,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">address two years in a row freaks me out</font>

136
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:21,570
because look around you we are the

137
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:23,130
people the<font color="#CCCCCC"> President of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the United</font>

138

139
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:26,159
<font color="#CCCCCC">about your politics I don't care whether</font>

140
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:29,700
you hate the man or love the<font color="#CCCCCC"> man or</font>

141
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:32,640

231
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:44,670
the idea that our job is to beat up on

313
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:36,490
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have all these problems going on and</font>

314
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:38,470
then we have new technology<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming out</font>

315
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:42,160
right how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people here have an Apple</font>

320
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:53,200
admit<font color="#CCCCCC"> it they're ridiculously expensive</font>

321
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:54,880
but I don't want to tell everybody I'm

322
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:59,830
buying the addition one for fifteen

323
00:14:54,880 --> 00:15:01,780
thousand dollars that's ridiculous<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

324
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:03,490
that technology is coming right wearable

325
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:06,640
technology we now have the Internet of

326
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:10,000
Things wasn't the internet always of

327
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:13,000
things right like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I get what they're</font>

328
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,250
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say but we're making</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our jobs</font>

329
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:18,340
more difficult we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> making it more</font>

330
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:20,620
complex and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the reality</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is in my opinion</font>

331
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:22,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">our jobs aren't harder now than they</font>

332
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:25,180
were 20 years ago and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm an old fart</font>

333
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:31,090
enough to know what our<font color="#E5E5E5"> job is like 20</font>

334
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:33,810
years<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago it's not more complex we still</font>

335
00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:36,360
the same problem you accepted input

336
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:39,520
trusted the input and made use of it

337
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:41,680
right is that the nature of our problem

338
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:44,319
sequel injection what is it accepting

339
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:45,939
input trusting it using I'll for

340
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:49,030
overflow accepting input trusting it

341
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:52,750
using it social engineering accepting

342
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:56,800
input trusting it using it right that's

343
00:15:52,750 --> 00:16:00,550
it yet if you read twitter if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> read</font>

344
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:03,430
any news feed we now<font color="#CCCCCC"> have cross-site</font>

345
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:06,189
scripting report read<font color="#E5E5E5"> friends sequel</font>

346
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:07,150
injection command injection that's one

347
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:10,000
vulnerability

348
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:11,650
right we now have<font color="#CCCCCC"> run out of one in two</font>

349
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,680
word vulnerabilities and we now have

350
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:15,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">five and ten word vulnerabilities</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I was</font>

351
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:18,040
just talking to a guy and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm gonna mess</font>

352
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:21,100
up the name<font color="#CCCCCC"> of it but it was like path</font>

353
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:24,569
traversal cascading style sheet

354
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:27,460
injection I wish<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was making that up</font>

355
00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:30,520
right I was like what are you doing well

356
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:32,680
you inject a path that reference is a

357
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:35,230
different cascading style sheet and they

358
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:38,859
load that other one in<font color="#E5E5E5"> that cross site</font>

359
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:41,350
scripting right but somebody had to have

360
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:43,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">an ego come up with a new name because</font>

361
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:46,890
we have to be famous we in my opinion

362
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:51,819
have turned into<font color="#CCCCCC"> an industry of bullies</font>

363
00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:54,180
right we have we<font color="#E5E5E5"> name in shame we beat</font>

364
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:59,200
up on people we tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> them they suck</font>

365
00:16:54,180 --> 00:17:01,390
we're mean how do we even<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what the</font>

366
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:04,200
real threats are according<font color="#CCCCCC"> to mandiant</font>

367
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:06,550
it's the chinese or north koreans right

368
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:11,260
so mandiant says so it must be true

369
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:13,750
because they make lots of money right we

370
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:17,530
attributed Sony hack to North Korea why

371
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:29,110
because of a stupid movie anybody watch

372
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:32,830
that movie did<font color="#E5E5E5"> you enjoy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it really okay</font>

373
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:36,490
I'll go with that<font color="#E5E5E5"> right i've not watched</font>

374
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:38,290
it why does it<font color="#E5E5E5"> look dumb to me I hadn't</font>

375
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:42,460
even heard about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the movie until North</font>

376
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:43,240
Korea supposedly<font color="#CCCCCC"> attacked sony right we</font>

377
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:45,130
don't even<font color="#CCCCCC"> know what the real</font>

378
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:46,330
vulnerabilities are I talked to

379
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:48,520
developers all the time because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

380
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:50,169
believe part of my responsibility is to

381
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:52,990
sit down and actually educate people

382
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:55,090
right not<font color="#CCCCCC"> just coming and go wow you saw</font>

383
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:56,950
what to say here are the problems here's

384
00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:58,209
why they are problems and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk to</font>

385
00:17:56,950 --> 00:18:00,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">people and they don't even truly</font>

386
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:03,310
understand what<font color="#E5E5E5"> the issue is right I had</font>

387
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:05,050
a developer once logged into it one of

388
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:08,620
their websites through<font color="#E5E5E5"> Burke of course</font>

389
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:09,970
right herb and I look and they've dumped

390
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:12,520
down a whole bunch of visual basic

391
00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:14,230
script an individual basic script is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

392
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:16,810
connection string for the sa password

393
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:18,550
with the essay account with the sa

394
00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:20,559
password and it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a really long</font>

395
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:22,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">complex password</font>

396
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:25,809
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I say the developer who's sitting</font>

397
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:26,830
next to me I'm like hey dude<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay your</font>

398
00:18:25,809 --> 00:18:28,450

complex that password is yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> I get it</font>

402
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:41,289
it's complex but you're the key word

403
00:18:37,179 --> 00:18:43,299
there was look right then I had another

404
00:18:41,289 --> 00:18:44,529
guy in class once right I'm teaching a

405
00:18:43,299 --> 00:18:46,809
class we're talking about cracking

406
00:18:44,529 --> 00:18:49,710
passwords and I got this guy and he says

407
00:18:46,809 --> 00:18:53,139

somebody finding out who he was and

422
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:37,539
trying to determine his password I won't

423
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:39,480
call it a strong password but it's less

424
00:19:37,539 --> 00:19:42,279
likely that somebody would know that

425
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:44,980
that's a good<font color="#CCCCCC"> point</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the problem is</font>

426
00:19:42,279 --> 00:19:47,019
that's not the threat that's not what

427
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:48,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">he's trying to protect against what he's</font>

428
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:50,409
trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> protect against is somebody</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">with a script going after all the</font>

430
00:19:50,409 --> 00:19:54,519
possible accounts on that system in

431
00:19:52,059 --> 00:19:57,970
which case a<font color="#E5E5E5"> four-letter password I</font>

432
00:19:54,519 --> 00:20:01,629
don't even<font color="#E5E5E5"> consider a password it might</font>

433
00:19:57,970 --> 00:20:03,340
as well be blank right so I explain this

434
00:20:01,629 --> 00:20:04,509
to the guy and the guy gets freaked out

435
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:06,549
we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> even talking about the fact</font>

436
00:20:04,509 --> 00:20:11,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> he said he had one password right</font>

437
00:20:06,549 --> 00:20:13,899
but from Tallinn guy and he's freaking

438
00:20:11,049 --> 00:20:17,619

439
00:20:13,899 --> 00:20:20,100
comes here<font color="#E5E5E5"> and he told out the door and</font>

440
00:20:17,619 --> 00:20:23,230
he comes back in about 45 minutes<font color="#E5E5E5"> later</font>

441
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:25,090
it's like whoa<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay he's like yeah man</font>

447
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:38,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">told me so I fixed part of the problem</font>

448
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:41,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">but not the other but we're working on</font>

449
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:43,120

450
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:45,370
problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> are we even allowed to test what</font>

451
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:50,530
we want to test how many people here use

452
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:53,399
cloud-based stuffs right yeah you guys

453
00:20:50,530 --> 00:20:53,399
know why it's called the cloud

454
00:20:54,650 --> 00:21:01,650
nope<font color="#CCCCCC"> Vizio icon for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet is a</font>

455
00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:03,900
cloud right it's on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the internet so it's</font>

456
00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:05,520
cloud so here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> my deal here's what I</font>

457
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:08,240
want you guys to start<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing start</font>

458
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:13,080
referring to databases is the cylinder

459
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:16,830
right I found cylinder injection in<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

460
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:19,889
application every<font color="#CCCCCC"> awesome won't it yeah</font>

461
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:22,080
so please do that for me but like are we

462
00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:24,000
allowed to test our cloud apps are we

463
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:25,500
allowed to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> after those things so we</font>

464
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,610
go<font color="#CCCCCC"> after that third party can we</font>

465
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:31,260
determine what's going on we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know</font>

466
00:21:28,610 --> 00:21:33,270
and we have major flaws at least

467
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:38,760
according to Reuters in the news<font color="#E5E5E5"> and CNN</font>

468
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:41,490
hell they have their own logo I've been

474
00:21:56,430 --> 00:22:02,840
wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a hacker I had to be good</font>

475
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:05,310
at photoshop people were actually

476
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:06,810
disappointed last<font color="#CCCCCC"> Friday or is it this</font>

477
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:08,520
friends last<font color="#CCCCCC"> friday the ssl</font>

478
00:22:06,810 --> 00:22:11,639
vulnerabilities came out right<font color="#E5E5E5"> i was</font>

479
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:14,310
track of time there wasn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> a logo and</font>

480
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:16,080
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually said</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that the goose</font>

481
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:19,679
can't be that serious it doesn't have a

482
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:22,439
logo if you were one of those people who

483
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:26,070
said that please do me a favor beat the

484
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:30,240
 out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> yourself</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right i mean come</font>

485
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:33,600
on we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> building this a heart bleed ah</font>

486
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:37,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">shellshock</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> didn't even have one logo it</font>

487
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:42,300
had multiple logos right and put what

488
00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:44,280
the hell is poodle I mean poodles are

489
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:47,100
freaky looking dogs<font color="#E5E5E5"> but they don't</font>

490
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:49,620
really scare me but we named a

491
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:51,300
vulnerability we have logos and a lot of

492
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:52,919
<font color="#CCCCCC">people talking about this and I have had</font>

493
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:55,080
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> send me all the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Kevin that's good</font>

494
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:59,220
it's good we have logos because now

495
00:22:55,080 --> 00:23:02,010
we've got people talking you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

496
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:05,760
they're talking out their ass so it

497
00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:07,129
didn't help and then worse and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Friday</font>

498
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:09,530
proved it

499
00:23:07,130 --> 00:23:12,320
I have major companies that I've worked

500
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:14,600
with that did not apply the patches last

501
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:16,879
week because the severity of the bug

502
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:20,060
can't be<font color="#CCCCCC"> that high because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there wasn't</font>

503
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:22,970
a logo we've had companies that have

504
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:25,760
come to us and have said can you verify

505
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:30,410
we're not vulnerable to heartbleed you

506
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:31,910
know you're still running<font color="#CCCCCC"> Windows 311 no</font>

507
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:34,160
no we just want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make sure we're not</font>

508
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:38,420
vulnerable to heart plate that's a

509
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:40,730
problem that's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> negative we are</font>

510
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:46,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually being detrimental to our own</font>

511
00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:49,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">security by doing this crap but as an</font>

512
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:54,440
industry we're doing it and we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> making</font>

513
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:56,090
it worse right and my question is and

514
00:23:54,440 --> 00:24:00,590
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is what really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> drives me on this</font>

515
00:23:56,090 --> 00:24:03,110
talk right is how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we even</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know what</font>

516
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:05,120
we're allowed to do and we say all the

517
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:06,649
time right a charity was Jeremiah

518
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:10,959
Grossman came out with an<font color="#CCCCCC"> awesome blog</font>

519
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:13,850
post test yourself<font color="#E5E5E5"> hack yourself and</font>

520
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:15,590
Troy hunt out in Australia wrote a great

521
00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:18,080
blog<font color="#CCCCCC"> post about the same thing and i</font>

522
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:20,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">agree i think you should be testing you</font>

523
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:22,929
should be assessing your own stuff what

524
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:24,980
about the people testing the internet

525
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:26,540
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the people who just say hey</font>

526
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:28,010
there's a vulnerability let me see if

527
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:30,860
they're vulnerable to it I don't know

528
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:33,170
them but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to find out we</font>

529
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:35,510
allowed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do that and some people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tell</font>

531
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:41,300
right here's an example and I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

532
00:24:38,930 --> 00:24:45,590
very clear here I respect Robert Graham

533
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:47,570
greatly he is a smart person but<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

right<font color="#E5E5E5"> I almost</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> called it TCP dump like I</font>

really<font color="#CCCCCC"> did because i don't use wires</font>

541
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:08,570
your got use TCP dump but to do the

542
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:13,540
captures but that's just because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

543
00:25:08,570 --> 00:25:16,010
nerdy but Wireshark of him scanning

it

547
00:25:20,370 --> 00:25:23,659
and his answer when we called them out

548
00:25:21,930 --> 00:25:27,390
on it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> well I'm just running ping</font>

he knows he's just running ping I know

551
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:36,030
by looking at that that he's just

552
00:25:31,890 --> 00:25:38,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">running ping in the capture I see but</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">what else is he running and if you're</font>

to respond as if he's malicious isn't

561
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:05,970
there the potential for you to have to

562
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:07,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">do a breach notification if you can't</font>

563
00:26:05,970 --> 00:26:10,080
identify if you don't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> enough</font>

564
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:13,890
information<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say that he didn't go</font>

565
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:15,540
further my read of some of the breach

566
00:26:13,890 --> 00:26:17,070
notification laws is if you can't prove

567
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:21,240
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> weren't breached you have to notify</font>

568
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:23,280
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you were right that's a problem and</font>

569
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:24,840
when I've talked to Robert about this by

570
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:28,230
the super efficient way to have a

571
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:31,620
conversation of Twitter um he doesn't

572
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:32,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">think that's an issue i do right and his</font>

573
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:36,120
answer<font color="#E5E5E5"> is we're doing it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for the greater</font>

574
00:26:32,970 --> 00:26:37,710
good we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to help people so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

575
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:39,689
asked him great you're trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> help</font>

576
00:26:37,710 --> 00:26:40,770
people out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the IP addresses that</font>

577
00:26:39,690 --> 00:26:41,790
you identified that were vulnerable as

578
00:26:40,770 --> 00:26:44,309
shell shocked how many of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them did you</font>

579
00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:47,210
reach out to<font color="#CCCCCC"> and notified and the answer</font>

580
00:26:44,309 --> 00:26:50,940
was none they can<font color="#E5E5E5"> follow me on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> twitter</font>

581
00:26:47,210 --> 00:26:52,290
how egotistical is that if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

582
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:55,410
know if you're vulnerable follow me on

00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:57,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">Twitter right now I looked at his</font>

585
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:04,830

00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:07,740
business owner on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the planet yet they're</font>

587
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:10,500
supposed to know that Robert Graham is

588
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:11,790
nicely exploiting their system not a

589
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:14,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">full ability assessment here right he</font>

590
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:20,159
exploited it but it's for the greater

591
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:23,040
good greater good for his fame but we

592
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:24,420
have other network examples right the

593
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:28,190
apple developer network went down a

594
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:30,220
hundred thousand records were pulled

595
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:34,720
because I

596
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:36,880
hacktivist security researcher isn't a

597
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:39,100
lab coat but he's a researcher right

598
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:42,880
found a sequel injection flaw and I want

599
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:46,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be very clear I agree that Apple</font>

600
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:48,010
should<font color="#E5E5E5"> not be vulnerable to this totally</font>

601
00:27:46,049 --> 00:27:50,379
this guy pulled a hundred thousand

602
00:27:48,010 --> 00:27:53,260
records they took the developer<font color="#CCCCCC"> Network</font>

603
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:55,090
offline for more than a week which means

604
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:57,750
that every one of those startups that

people who were interested in learning

610
00:28:07,179 --> 00:28:13,929
IT and programming and security weren't

611
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:16,330
able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> and when you ask this guy hey</font>

612
00:28:13,929 --> 00:28:18,340
why did<font color="#CCCCCC"> you pull a hundred thousand</font>

613
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:21,039
records his answer was<font color="#E5E5E5"> well I just</font>

614
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:22,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">wanted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> prove it was a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> problem how</font>

many people<font color="#E5E5E5"> here have done the sequel</font>

616

617
00:28:24,130 --> 00:28:27,280
ask you did<font color="#E5E5E5"> it legally right how many</font>

your hand know about the count function

621
00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:37,449
we're instead of actually pulling the

622
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:39,549
records he could have said count how

623
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:40,510
many records I would have pulled he

624
00:28:39,549 --> 00:28:41,860
still would have gotten a hundred

625
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:45,580
thousand number he still would have

626
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:48,280
proven that he was able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do it but you</font>

627
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:51,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">know what it's not it's sexy he's not as</font>

628
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:53,980
headline-grabbing it's not as<font color="#CCCCCC"> bad to the</font>

629
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:55,210
other company right it's we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

630
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:55,870
doing this but don't worry about I don't

631
00:28:55,210 --> 00:28:58,320
worry<font color="#E5E5E5"> about I know you guys are</font>

632
00:28:55,870 --> 00:29:00,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">concerned it's okay he posted on Twitter</font>

633
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:04,210
Apple this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> definitely not a hack</font>

634
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:07,658
attack i am not a hacker<font color="#E5E5E5"> i do security</font>

635
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:09,159
researcher now i do want to point out he

636
00:29:07,659 --> 00:29:11,169
said sakura trees not research not

637
00:29:09,159 --> 00:29:15,309
researcher but i do want to point out he

638
00:29:11,169 --> 00:29:18,549
didn't copy<font color="#E5E5E5"> apples twitter account he</font>

639
00:29:15,309 --> 00:29:19,720
just said apple right so somehow apples

640
00:29:18,549 --> 00:29:21,610
supposed to know it I don't know who

641
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:23,770
Mike butcher is I should<font color="#CCCCCC"> have found out</font>

642
00:29:21,610 --> 00:29:28,120
before I put this in the slide but he

643
00:29:23,770 --> 00:29:31,299
now knows right again how egotistical is

644
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:35,379
it I'm a Turkish guy that is so<font color="#CCCCCC"> awesome</font>

645
00:29:31,299 --> 00:29:36,460
Apple must follow me right and that's

646
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:37,929
what he did but<font color="#E5E5E5"> he's a security</font>

647
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:41,220
researcher so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay because it</font>

648
00:29:37,929 --> 00:29:43,080
wasn't really hacking it was research

649
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:45,539
right

650
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:47,480
that makes it fun but you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font>

651
00:29:45,539 --> 00:29:49,860
worry<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it he targeted Google to</font>

652
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:53,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">write and this time he actually crashed</font>

653
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:54,840
the servers right twice<font color="#E5E5E5"> when that wasn't</font>

654
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:56,399
enough they brought<font color="#E5E5E5"> her back up he tried</font>

655
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:58,620
to Sumer and he could do it again<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

656
00:29:56,399 --> 00:30:00,209
could he was<font color="#E5E5E5"> just verifying that it</font>

657
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:03,689
wasn't a fluke right that it really was

658
00:30:00,210 --> 00:30:05,250
him that crashed it again I hear from

659
00:30:03,690 --> 00:30:06,960
security researchers all the time on the

660
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:09,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">internet that it's okay because there's</font>

661
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:11,880
no cost to what they're doing it<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't</font>

662
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:13,559
hurt anybody yeah I'll tell you right

663
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:15,929
now Google had to react<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that it was a</font>

664
00:30:13,559 --> 00:30:19,500
real hack because you know what it was a

665
00:30:15,929 --> 00:30:22,409
real hack matter what the guy calls it

666
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:25,289
it's real that's like<font color="#E5E5E5"> me walking in here</font>

667
00:30:22,409 --> 00:30:26,460
holding up a gun shooting somebody and

668
00:30:25,289 --> 00:30:28,490
saying wait look I was just researching

669
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:33,809
whether the bullet would actually go out

670
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:38,730
you never know some guns jam right it

671
00:30:33,809 --> 00:30:41,490
was research wasn't murder doesn't sound

<font color="#E5E5E5">what we've got going on and we as the</font>

675
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:53,760
industry seem to push this up and go

676
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:59,730
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is awesome look at that guy he's so</font>

677
00:30:53,760 --> 00:31:01,679

678
00:30:59,730 --> 00:31:05,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">talked to you out ethics and this is</font>

679
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:06,779
what I think we're lacking here and

680
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:09,600
here's the problem when you talk about

681
00:31:06,779 --> 00:31:12,029
ethics a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of people say ah we don't</font>

682
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:14,309
need laws matter<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fact</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Robert Graham</font>

683
00:31:12,029 --> 00:31:17,639
posted a whole blog post where he

684
00:31:14,309 --> 00:31:20,269
discussed the fact that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> should not be</font>

685
00:31:17,639 --> 00:31:24,000
under<font color="#CCCCCC"> the chilling effects of the law</font>

686
00:31:20,269 --> 00:31:27,269
because we're researchers that's a scary

687
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,500
phrase we should not be affected by the

688
00:31:27,269 --> 00:31:30,480
chilling effects of the law you know

689
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:35,039
laws like don't speed don't kill people

690
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:37,200
don't steal right those are laws and

691
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:39,840
while we may<font color="#E5E5E5"> not agree that the laws are</font>

692
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:44,159
good I will argue with the best of you

693
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:47,549
that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> CFAA needs improvement but the</font>

694
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:49,230
reality is there are laws we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to</font>

follow<font color="#E5E5E5"> them what I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about</font>

laws here talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> ethics there are</font>

697
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:56,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">things that are ethical yet illegal</font>

698
00:31:55,100 --> 00:32:01,129
and there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that are legal yet</font>

699
00:31:56,809 --> 00:32:05,210
not ethical right and i'll use<font color="#CCCCCC"> Godwin's</font>

700
00:32:01,130 --> 00:32:07,610
law right it was illegal for people to

00:32:05,210 --> 00:32:10,070
hide Jews in Nazi Germany during World

702

War two<font color="#CCCCCC"> but I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't think it was</font>

703
00:32:10,070 --> 00:32:15,830
unethical the high Jews in Nazi Germany

704
00:32:12,549 --> 00:32:18,440
right and I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> not comparing this to the</font>

705
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:23,409
Nazis this is not a security researchers

706
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:28,520
or Hitler right good<font color="#E5E5E5"> appreciate that</font>

707
00:32:23,410 --> 00:32:32,870
right but the reality is ethics are what

708
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:38,539
are allowed by your sense of right and

709
00:32:32,870 --> 00:32:40,010
wrong we need ethics to guide us and

710

<font color="#E5E5E5">you heard the italics and quotes around</font>

great there you know according their

741
00:33:58,370 --> 00:34:03,110
code of ethics you should not interact

742
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:04,790
with black hats so does that mean I'm

743
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:08,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">not allowed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to run tools the black hat</font>

744
00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:10,969
road or to my read yes I'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell you my</font>

745
00:34:08,929 --> 00:34:13,030
clients would be at a disadvantage if I

746
00:34:10,969 --> 00:34:15,889
didn't run tools that black hat wrote

747
00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:18,650
right so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I violate that code of ethics</font>

every day and I'm a cissp so if you want

753
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:32,120
mandatory for us as Danny said yesterday

00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:35,389
be learning and has to have an ethical

756
00:34:33,650 --> 00:34:37,490
guidelines that tells us we can't learn

757
00:34:35,389 --> 00:34:41,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">from the source of the attacks we're</font>

758
00:34:37,489 --> 00:34:43,159
trying to protect against is asinine not

759
00:34:41,870 --> 00:34:44,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">even getting into the fact that most of</font>

760

the ethical guidelines we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

people you hate

772
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:15,869
cuz I<font color="#E5E5E5"> look up there and I see Snowden</font>

773
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:17,010
and I could get into an argument but I

774
00:35:15,869 --> 00:35:18,270
believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> that man is a traitor and needs</font>

775
00:35:17,010 --> 00:35:20,369
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be shot in the head because that is</font>

776
00:35:18,270 --> 00:35:23,130
the penalty for traitor in the United

777
00:35:20,369 --> 00:35:25,200
States<font color="#CCCCCC"> and other people will look you in</font>

778
00:35:23,130 --> 00:35:29,400
the face and<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell you he's a hero he's a</font>

779
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:32,160
whistleblower he saved lives hey you

780
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:35,700
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> feeling both of us may be</font>

781
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:39,029
right right because again I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> smart</font>

782
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:40,319
enough<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know what the right way is but</font>

783
00:35:39,029 --> 00:35:41,970
i'll tell you<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I look at things that</font>

784
00:35:40,319 --> 00:35:44,130
Snowden did I look at things anonymous

785
00:35:41,970 --> 00:35:47,430
does and some of the stuff anonymous

786
00:35:44,130 --> 00:35:49,740
does i look at go yes do it<font color="#CCCCCC"> again and</font>

787
00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:56,069
there are days<font color="#CCCCCC"> i look at what anonymous</font>

788
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:59,879
does and say burn in hell right I look

789

at jester and I cheer every<font color="#E5E5E5"> time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> he says</font>

790
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:07,980
tango down right and I'll admit the

791
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:09,720
hypocrisy of that right I got no problem

792
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:14,460
standing up to telling you<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm a</font>

793
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:15,839
hypocrite but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am and I say it's</font>

794
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:18,900
because I'm not smart enough to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

795
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:24,750
what the right answer is but here's the

796
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:27,299
problem we are smart enough to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what</font>

797
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:30,690
the right answer is and if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we don't</font>

798
00:36:27,299 --> 00:36:35,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">stand up and say this is okay and this</font>

799
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:38,220
isn't we're plain and simple it's

800
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:41,220
we need to we need to stand up and say

801
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:43,230
this is okay and this is not and there's

802
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:45,058
ways to do this right one of the ways

803
00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:49,890
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I hear about all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the time is we</font>

804
00:36:45,059 --> 00:36:52,829
could pass<font color="#E5E5E5"> a law yeah was it rapid7 just</font>

805
00:36:49,890 --> 00:36:55,589
started a petition to like modify the

806
00:36:52,829 --> 00:36:56,940
CFAA those it rapid seven I don't mean

807
00:36:55,589 --> 00:36:59,640
to pick on a company if it wasn't them

808
00:36:56,940 --> 00:37:02,809
right they'll call us anyways try to

809
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:02,808
sell something but um

810
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:09,210
so right we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> change the CFAA and</font>

811
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:11,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">I don't know about you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> guys but I've</font>

812
00:37:09,210 --> 00:37:13,770
presented to the Senate I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in a</font>

813
00:37:11,790 --> 00:37:15,690
room with senators and House of

814
00:37:13,770 --> 00:37:19,620
Representatives and their staff and I've

815
00:37:15,690 --> 00:37:21,990
talked to them about security issues and

816
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:26,400
been embarrassed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> say they represented</font>

817
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:29,370
me because they don't know what we do we

818
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:31,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">have a congressman that's in charge of</font>

819
00:37:29,370 --> 00:37:33,870
the Technology Committee that proudly

820
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:35,610
admits he's never written an email and

821
00:37:33,870 --> 00:37:37,080
again I'm not arguing Republican

822
00:37:35,610 --> 00:37:40,980
Democrat any of that crap because I

823
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:42,299
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> care but I do know that if we're</font>

824
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:46,220
gonna have people who don't understand

825
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:49,500
what we do making the laws we're screwed

826
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:50,819
we need to provide<font color="#CCCCCC"> that guidance and</font>

827
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:52,620
I'll tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> you this is why right I'm</font>

828
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:53,910
sitting in a plane and I had a lady

829
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:55,410

831
00:37:55,410 --> 00:37:59,160
people but I'm talking to this lady and

832
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:02,370

836
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:12,390

always say I'm a penetration tester and

839
00:38:15,270 --> 00:38:21,450
I get the answer does that have

840
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:24,140
something to do with<font color="#E5E5E5"> oil no no it</font>

841
00:38:21,450 --> 00:38:27,899
doesn't well it depends on the target

842
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:29,339
all right<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know and I what is</font>

00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:32,670
Children's Hospital where she was

892

seizure disorder with no long-lasting

896
00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:46,259
effects right we're blessed that two

897
00:40:44,490 --> 00:40:47,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">months</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> after she went to Wilson's we</font>

898
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:49,830
were notified by<font color="#E5E5E5"> Wilson's that they were</font>

899
00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:52,200
breached and all of Brenna's data was

900
00:40:49,830 --> 00:40:54,270
stolen they got her social her date of

901
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:56,430
birth where she was born her address

902
00:40:54,270 --> 00:40:58,410
everything about her everything they

903
00:40:56,430 --> 00:40:59,940
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to steal her identity but don't</font>

904
00:40:58,410 --> 00:41:02,730
worry<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it Wilson's takes this very</font>

905
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:06,570
seriously and they gave her a year of

906
00:41:02,730 --> 00:41:09,000
credit monitor right after people who

907
00:41:06,570 --> 00:41:11,340
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know at nine years old you're not</font>

908
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,960
allowed to sign up pretty here of credit

909
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:15,480
monitoring so<font color="#CCCCCC"> wolfson's paid for</font>

910
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:17,630
something nobody can use and the problem

911
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:21,750
here is this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not a year-long problem</font>

912
00:41:17,630 --> 00:41:23,940
Brenna's identity has been stolen for

913
00:41:21,750 --> 00:41:25,470
the rest of her life she may not have

914
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:27,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">long-lasting effects from the seizure</font>

915
00:41:25,470 --> 00:41:28,169
disorder but she'll have one lesson

916
00:41:27,390 --> 00:41:30,118
affection

917
00:41:28,170 --> 00:41:32,430
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> wolfson's didn't protect her data</font>

918
00:41:30,119 --> 00:41:36,540
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the level they should have protected</font>

919
00:41:32,430 --> 00:41:37,859
it too and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> believe very firmly that</font>

920
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:42,720
they didn't protect the data to the

921
00:41:37,859 --> 00:41:47,848
level they did<font color="#E5E5E5"> because we fail we as an</font>

922
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:50,879
industry hey we are so busy building up

923
00:41:47,849 --> 00:41:54,930

star ninja famous that we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not helping</font>

925
00:41:54,930 --> 00:41:59,779
the people that need our help we're

926
00:41:57,180 --> 00:42:03,230
supposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be the superheroes no caves</font>

927
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:05,910
but we're supposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be and we're not</font>

928
00:42:03,230 --> 00:42:07,470
and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we wait for laws to come out and</font>

929
00:42:05,910 --> 00:42:09,930
guidelines who in the world can pick

930
00:42:07,470 --> 00:42:11,848
those right we got certifications doing

931
00:42:09,930 --> 00:42:15,210

cissp yeah do you want them picking our

936
00:42:26,579 --> 00:42:30,599
ethics if you want them and nothing

937
00:42:29,190 --> 00:42:32,099
wrong with certification I'm not sitting

938
00:42:30,599 --> 00:42:34,290
here telling you certification is evil

939
00:42:32,099 --> 00:42:36,210

wrong I'm just saying or<font color="#CCCCCC"> there is that</font>

943
00:42:42,030 --> 00:42:46,470
where we want our guidelines built is

944
00:42:43,829 --> 00:42:48,569
that where we want our ethics to be

945
00:42:46,470 --> 00:42:51,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">determined and I don't know about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

946
00:42:48,569 --> 00:42:53,490
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> my answer is no well I have amazing</font>

947
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:55,770
respect for Allen power well I think

948
00:42:53,490 --> 00:42:59,430
Alan Paller is an amazing man<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't</font>

949
00:42:55,770 --> 00:43:01,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">believe he</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is the only person who should</font>

950
00:42:59,430 --> 00:43:03,118
be determining what are I fix on and I

951
00:43:01,859 --> 00:43:05,098
know I know they have an ethics board

952
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:08,460
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> all that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> kind stuff I'm simplifying</font>

953
00:43:05,099 --> 00:43:11,430
this significantly right but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's an</font>

954
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:13,740
option right<font color="#E5E5E5"> we also have bug bounties</font>

955
00:43:11,430 --> 00:43:15,180
this is a great idea let's just open up

956
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:17,368
<font color="#E5E5E5">our systems up and say to everybody hey</font>

957
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:20,430
hack me please tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about it though</font>

958
00:43:17,369 --> 00:43:23,670
right exactly though most of the bug

959
00:43:20,430 --> 00:43:25,859
bounty programs i see they're finding

960
00:43:23,670 --> 00:43:28,380
low-hanging fruit which in my opinion is

961
00:43:25,859 --> 00:43:30,180
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> failure of a bug bounty program if you</font>

962
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:31,650
still have low hanging fruit like

963
00:43:30,180 --> 00:43:34,799
cross-site scripting in a search button

964
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:37,109
search box<font color="#E5E5E5"> you shouldn't be opening up a</font>

965
00:43:34,799 --> 00:43:39,839
bug bounty because you're not ready<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

966
00:43:37,109 --> 00:43:41,319
it yet that's like<font color="#E5E5E5"> giving a</font>

967
00:43:39,839 --> 00:43:43,078
four-year-old the keys

968
00:43:41,319 --> 00:43:46,799
over art

969
00:43:43,079 --> 00:43:48,660
right you can't do<font color="#E5E5E5"> it what that's one</font>

970
00:43:46,799 --> 00:43:50,099
thing and then there's questions right

971
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:51,089
how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do it how do you know you're</font>

972
00:43:50,099 --> 00:43:52,440
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> it right how do you know you've</font>

973
00:43:51,089 --> 00:43:55,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">got the right people looking at your</font>

974
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:57,119
system how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know that threat that</font>

975
00:43:55,049 --> 00:43:58,440
you always hear right Adobe did a bug

976
00:43:57,119 --> 00:44:00,450
bounty program and people bitched

977
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:04,430
they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> just going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> give us a t-shirt</font>

978
00:44:00,450 --> 00:44:08,218
no money I'll just sell what I find

979
00:44:04,430 --> 00:44:11,848
right that's what people said is that

980
00:44:08,219 --> 00:44:15,529
throughout we want to go again I go back

981
00:44:11,849 --> 00:44:20,219
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're supposed to be fixing things</font>

982
00:44:15,529 --> 00:44:23,099
we're supposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be the good in what we</font>

983
00:44:20,219 --> 00:44:25,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">do and I feel</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very firmly about that I</font>

984
00:44:23,099 --> 00:44:30,180
feel very strongly about this I believe

985
00:44:25,619 --> 00:44:33,180
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the route to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go and this is</font>

986
00:44:30,180 --> 00:44:36,029
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a popular one you say licensing</font>

987
00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:37,259
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> gah i don't want license I don't</font>

988
00:44:36,029 --> 00:44:39,509
the government to determine whether I

989
00:44:37,259 --> 00:44:40,319
could be a hacker nobody determines

990
00:44:39,509 --> 00:44:44,249
whether you can be a hacker it's a

991
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:47,369
mindset and I also want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> point out I</font>

992
00:44:44,249 --> 00:44:49,738
didn't say government<font color="#E5E5E5"> license it but I</font>

993
00:44:47,369 --> 00:44:52,049
do believe that we as an industry need

994
00:44:49,739 --> 00:44:56,369
to start looking at something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that says</font>

995
00:44:52,049 --> 00:44:59,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">I am able to do what I do that I follow</font>

996
00:44:56,369 --> 00:45:01,920
a certain standard that I have a certain

997
00:44:59,279 --> 00:45:04,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">set of ethics and that when I give you</font>

998
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:09,239
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> results of what I give you you can</font>

999
00:45:04,890 --> 00:45:12,089
believe it was sufficient that it met

1000
00:45:09,239 --> 00:45:14,579
some standard that I'm not some jackass

1001
00:45:12,089 --> 00:45:18,749
who paid 1600 dollars for an SS license

1002
00:45:14,579 --> 00:45:20,430
and called it a pen test right do you

1003
00:45:18,749 --> 00:45:22,019
know how many reports I see where all

1004
00:45:20,430 --> 00:45:26,219
they did was take the logo off and put

1005
00:45:22,019 --> 00:45:28,379
their logo on I mean he'll I was looking

1006
00:45:26,219 --> 00:45:30,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">at a report just recently where the</font>

1007
00:45:28,380 --> 00:45:32,279
links went still out to the tenable

1008
00:45:30,329 --> 00:45:35,309
website for information about what the

1009
00:45:32,279 --> 00:45:39,209
findings<font color="#E5E5E5"> were if you're not even smart</font>

1010
00:45:35,309 --> 00:45:41,449
enough to change the links get the hell

1011
00:45:39,209 --> 00:45:41,448
out

1012
00:45:41,580 --> 00:45:45,600
but licensing would fix that but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will</font>

1013
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:49,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">agree that I don't want the government</font>

1014
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:51,779
to Isis I don't I'm a big believer in

1015
00:45:49,590 --> 00:45:53,850
small government and I'm not saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

1016
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:56,820
a Republican I'm just<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying I believe</font>

1017
00:45:53,850 --> 00:45:58,020
in small government right and i think

1018
00:45:56,820 --> 00:45:59,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">that the minute you say that the</font>

1019
00:45:58,020 --> 00:46:00,540
government's going to license something

1020
00:45:59,130 --> 00:46:03,270
we have a problem so what I think we

1021
00:46:00,540 --> 00:46:06,000
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do and again want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be very</font>

1022
00:46:03,270 --> 00:46:10,980
clear I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> that smart in just some</font>

1023
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:12,420
jackass who started a business right if

1024
00:46:10,980 --> 00:46:17,550
we started something up like the infosec

1025
00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:19,500
bar right lawyers have it now I want to

1026
00:46:17,550 --> 00:46:22,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very clear the legal bar is a</font>

1027
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:24,990
government<font color="#CCCCCC"> entity I don't want to model</font>

1028
00:46:22,170 --> 00:46:26,700
that part but if we were to stand up and

1029
00:46:24,990 --> 00:46:28,020
we said hey look this is what we're

1030
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:29,129
going to do we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to create a set</font>

1031
00:46:28,020 --> 00:46:32,100
of ethics we're going to create a set of

1032
00:46:29,130 --> 00:46:33,540
standards on how you test how you do

1033
00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:35,730
deliverables and what a report should

1034
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:37,230
include how you determine that something

1035
00:46:35,730 --> 00:46:38,820
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> high risk how you determine something</font>

1036
00:46:37,230 --> 00:46:41,790
is medium risk how you determine right

1037
00:46:38,820 --> 00:46:43,230
we set<font color="#E5E5E5"> up that standard we could then</font>

1038
00:46:41,790 --> 00:46:45,390
start working<font color="#CCCCCC"> with it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and you're not</font>

1039
00:46:43,230 --> 00:46:47,850
required to do it you're not required to

1040
00:46:45,390 --> 00:46:48,960
be a bar member right many of the states

1041
00:46:47,850 --> 00:46:52,529
the united states allow you to practice

1042
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:53,760
law be calling yourself away but if

1043
00:46:52,530 --> 00:46:57,680
somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> wants to hire your service</font>

1044
00:46:53,760 --> 00:47:00,000
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to say I'm bar certified</font>

1045
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:02,279
right

1046
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:05,550
and we could hold<font color="#E5E5E5"> you to a set of</font>

1047
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:08,010
standards we can hold you to when you

1048
00:47:05,550 --> 00:47:09,930
screw up things when you screw your

1049
00:47:08,010 --> 00:47:12,930
customer when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you do things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that violate</font>

1050
00:47:09,930 --> 00:47:15,060
our ethics you lose that bar affiliation

1051
00:47:12,930 --> 00:47:17,040
and the reason I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this will</font>

1052
00:47:15,060 --> 00:47:19,700
work<font color="#E5E5E5"> is because the movie industry and</font>

1053
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:22,140
no it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not because i watch CSI cyber</font>

1054
00:47:19,700 --> 00:47:24,930
the movie industry was forced with the

1055
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:27,210
same idea movie industry started

1056
00:47:24,930 --> 00:47:29,069
releasing movies and people started

1057
00:47:27,210 --> 00:47:32,120
complaining that the movies were obscene

1058
00:47:29,070 --> 00:47:34,980
and the government started talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

1059
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:38,670
legislation their favorite thing right

1060
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:40,620
next is taxation but they would

1061
00:47:38,670 --> 00:47:42,900
legislate it passed laws to what the

1062
00:47:40,620 --> 00:47:45,210
movies could have right they would pass

1063
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:48,620
laws to determine<font color="#E5E5E5"> if a movie was ok and</font>

1064
00:47:45,210 --> 00:47:51,840
the movie energy though we got it dude

1065
00:47:48,620 --> 00:47:53,970
and they created the rating system right

1066
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:57,090
and they built a rating system they

1067
00:47:53,970 --> 00:48:01,230
started raiding stuff they in self

1068
00:47:57,090 --> 00:48:03,950
inflicted<font color="#E5E5E5"> a standard and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the government</font>

1069
00:48:01,230 --> 00:48:06,150
went oh cool you got it awesome right

1070
00:48:03,950 --> 00:48:07,049
and then back in the 80s I don't know

1071
00:48:06,150 --> 00:48:08,670
how many<font color="#CCCCCC"> people are old enough to</font>

1072
00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:12,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">remember the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> eighties but I do this</font>

1073
00:48:08,670 --> 00:48:16,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">horror horrible disgusting obscene movie</font>

1074
00:48:12,210 --> 00:48:20,040
came out gremlins and um he people<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

1075
00:48:16,470 --> 00:48:23,490
like haha they blew<font color="#CCCCCC"> up an alien in my</font>

1076
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:25,020
grave kids shouldn't see that and people

1077
00:48:23,490 --> 00:48:26,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">started talking about censorship people</font>

1078
00:48:25,020 --> 00:48:28,470
started talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about legislation</font>

1079
00:48:26,270 --> 00:48:30,120
obviously Hollywood has gotten too big

1080
00:48:28,470 --> 00:48:32,689
for their britches so we should

1081
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:35,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">legislate them and Hollywood</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> said well</font>

1082
00:48:32,690 --> 00:48:39,000
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> got this one and they change the</font>

1083
00:48:35,970 --> 00:48:41,399
rating system<font color="#CCCCCC"> to include pg-13 right and</font>

1084
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:43,890
the new rating came up and the

1085
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:46,170
government let they went dude you did it

1086
00:48:43,890 --> 00:48:48,870
awesome good<font color="#CCCCCC"> going have a nice day and</font>

1087
00:48:46,170 --> 00:48:51,180
they solve the problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I'm not a</font>

1088
00:48:48,870 --> 00:48:53,370
doom and gloom guy right I'm not gonna

1089
00:48:51,180 --> 00:48:56,580
sit up here and say the world is<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font>

1090
00:48:53,370 --> 00:48:59,009
to end but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I do believe very firmly that</font>

1091
00:48:56,580 --> 00:49:03,450
if we don't stand up as an industry and

1092
00:48:59,010 --> 00:49:06,099
say dude we got it and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually get</font>

1093
00:49:03,450 --> 00:49:08,710
it if we don't actually

1094
00:49:06,099 --> 00:49:11,680
stand up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and say this is the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> standard</font>

1095
00:49:08,710 --> 00:49:14,950
we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> follow then that doom and</font>

1096
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:17,529
gloom of the government passing laws of

1097
00:49:14,950 --> 00:49:19,899
the government saying security research

1098
00:49:17,529 --> 00:49:24,009
is bad by the way there's some security

1099
00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:28,210
research that I think is valid right we

1100
00:49:24,009 --> 00:49:31,299
like Germany distribution know it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and do</font>

1101
00:49:28,210 --> 00:49:34,329
not see comments now distribution of

1102
00:49:31,299 --> 00:49:37,180
hacker tools was illegal right now they

1103
00:49:34,329 --> 00:49:38,769
change that but if you were distributing

1104
00:49:37,180 --> 00:49:40,690
hacker tools it was against the law in

1105
00:49:38,769 --> 00:49:42,249
Germany right which I found funny

1106
00:49:40,690 --> 00:49:44,289
because I<font color="#E5E5E5"> couldn't give</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you a copy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1107
00:49:42,249 --> 00:49:45,459
samurai WTF or weaponized flash or

1108
00:49:44,289 --> 00:49:47,319
anything else like that but I could give

1109
00:49:45,460 --> 00:49:53,220
you a<font color="#E5E5E5"> copy of adobe flash and internet</font>

1110
00:49:47,319 --> 00:49:56,650
explorer but that's the route they went

1111
00:49:53,220 --> 00:50:01,299
in Italy IP address IP addresses<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

1112
00:49:56,650 --> 00:50:03,640
private information laws passed by

1113
00:50:01,299 --> 00:50:07,029
governments about technology suck they

1114
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:08,319
can't keep up right and that's why<font color="#E5E5E5"> I say</font>

1115
00:50:07,029 --> 00:50:12,609
what we have to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> is we have to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stand</font>

1116
00:50:08,319 --> 00:50:15,150
up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and do better right and I do think</font>

1117
00:50:12,609 --> 00:50:16,869
<font color="#CCCCCC">that it's something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we have to do soon I</font>

1118
00:50:15,150 --> 00:50:21,069
think it's something<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have to do now</font>

1119
00:50:16,869 --> 00:50:23,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">and I'm not the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> only person who can do</font>

1120
00:50:21,069 --> 00:50:26,619
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> matter of fact I'm not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the person to</font>

1121
00:50:23,319 --> 00:50:29,019
do it because<font color="#E5E5E5"> again if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we have one</font>

1122
00:50:26,619 --> 00:50:31,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">person stand up and say I'll create the</font>

1123
00:50:29,019 --> 00:50:34,269
standard so be based on that person's

1124
00:50:31,329 --> 00:50:36,400
opinions and what I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think is okay isn't</font>

1125
00:50:34,269 --> 00:50:39,700
