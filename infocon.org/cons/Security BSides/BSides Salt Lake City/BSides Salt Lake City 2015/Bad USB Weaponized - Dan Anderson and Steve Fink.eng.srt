Thanks alright here's our disclaimer

these these views don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> represent any</font>

00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:17,009
employer or customer or only anyone and

4
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:19,439
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> really don't take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> responsibility and</font>

5
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:22,020
but we do ask you to take<font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font>

6
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:28,050
responsibility in your<font color="#E5E5E5"> drinking we may</font>

7
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:33,960
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> even do that so it's great all right</font>

8
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:36,750
so what's a bad USB well<font color="#CCCCCC"> us bees are</font>

9
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:38,850
pretty cool nice<font color="#E5E5E5"> little storage devices</font>

10
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:41,969
but they're a lot more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than that so it's</font>

11
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:45,719
really a mini computer and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can use</font>

12
00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:52,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">it to gain physical access of course you</font>

13
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:55,530
don't need credentials so like I was

14
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:58,920
saying it's a tiny computer and it has

15
00:00:55,530 --> 00:01:01,039
firmware<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and because of that you</font>

16
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:03,120
can figure out how to do things with it

17
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:06,360
the important thing to note though is

18
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:09,439
that the architecture it doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

19
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:12,289
validate any of the any of the you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

20
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:15,750
communication<font color="#CCCCCC"> between the two devices</font>

21
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:17,970
only to the extent that it validates it

22
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:23,430
if it works and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you can</font>

23
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:26,310
transmit because of that you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

24
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:28,170
easy to inject anything and that's kind

25
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:30,420
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the point of the rubber ducky Steve's</font>

26
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:32,820
going to go more into that in a little

27
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:43,140
while and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then we'll get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more into how</font>

28
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:45,298
do you build these things<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so wow I</font>

29
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:47,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">think really really loud hopefully my</font>

30
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:51,329
remote works and we can I can wander

31
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:53,729
around so really<font color="#E5E5E5"> the the difference</font>

32
00:01:51,329 --> 00:01:55,798
<font color="#CCCCCC">between the bad USB and the rubber</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ducky</font>

33
00:01:53,729 --> 00:01:59,429
does everybody here know what<font color="#CCCCCC"> the rubber</font>

34
00:01:55,799 --> 00:02:00,780
ducky is so I see a few people not

35
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:04,380
raising their hands so I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

36
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:06,960
explain it briefly so rubber ducky was

37
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:09,720
designed for this purpose it actually

38
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,978
has components on it to slide and<font color="#CCCCCC"> micro</font>

39
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:13,769
<font color="#CCCCCC">SD card in</font>

40
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:16,080
now utilizing it for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this purpose of</font>

41
00:02:13,769 --> 00:02:20,069
injecting malware injecting things into

42
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:22,799
a host<font color="#E5E5E5"> PC how that differs from bad USB</font>

43
00:02:20,069 --> 00:02:25,530
as bad USB as taking<font color="#E5E5E5"> an off-the-shelf</font>

44
00:02:22,799 --> 00:02:28,200
product manipulating its original

45
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:30,769
intended purpose to achieve the same

46
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:34,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">result so you're injecting that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> malware</font>

47
00:02:30,769 --> 00:02:35,730
directly into it it looks innocuous it

48
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:37,530
doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> look</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like there's anything wrong</font>

49
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:40,738
with it it could look like the one that

50
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:46,410
you took home last night if we choose<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

51
00:02:40,739 --> 00:02:49,379
make it look that way so it's it totally

52
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:51,090
looks like<font color="#E5E5E5"> an off-the-shelf product you</font>

53
00:02:49,379 --> 00:02:52,739
it doesn't look<font color="#E5E5E5"> like it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to have</font>

54
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:54,329
anything wrong with it<font color="#CCCCCC"> it you know it</font>

55
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:58,019
doesn't have the reproductive sticker or

56
00:02:54,329 --> 00:03:02,569
anything so a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people think it's</font>

57
00:02:58,019 --> 00:03:06,810
windows own it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually not it's a USB</font>

58
00:03:02,569 --> 00:03:12,480
universe it happens in Windows Mac or

59
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:17,130
Linux they're all vulnerable so why do

00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:20,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">we care who can go through the day</font>

63
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:29,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">contacted a couple of manufacturers this</font>

64
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:32,910
was a legitimate<font color="#E5E5E5"> response i cut and</font>

65
00:03:29,549 --> 00:03:35,760
pasted it right from what they responded

66
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:38,760
to me they say that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's theoretical</font>

67
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:42,179
exploit that it cannot be practiced as

68
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:46,500
we all know it can<font color="#CCCCCC"> happen any day</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> any</font>

69
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:48,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">time we it's beyond theoretical so the</font>

70
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:50,760
more<font color="#CCCCCC"> we talk about it the more we get it</font>

71
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:54,000
out there everything the more they have

72
00:03:50,760 --> 00:04:04,760
to address<font color="#CCCCCC"> it somebody needs to make</font>

73
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:07,379
changes that can make us be secure so

74
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:09,810
for this particular demonstration what

75
00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:17,810
do we need we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> a USB thumb</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> drive</font>

76
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:21,358
with the pies on PS 2251 dash 03 man the

77
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:24,210
07 is out the 07 is actually more

78
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:27,690
prevalent right now because

79
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:29,340
of the attention<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we've been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> giving</font>

80
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:31,259
this and<font color="#CCCCCC"> everything they phase out the</font>

81
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:34,169
old<font color="#E5E5E5"> three and have been putting in the</font>

82
00:04:31,259 --> 00:04:36,870
07 but of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course we're already working</font>

83
00:04:34,169 --> 00:04:39,659
on reverse engineering the<font color="#E5E5E5"> code seven so</font>

84
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:47,849
that we can do the same thing so here<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

85
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:50,220
a patriot xt supersonic USB 3 point this

86
00:04:47,849 --> 00:04:52,590
one comes apart really<font color="#E5E5E5"> well because it</font>

87
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:55,560
has a<font color="#CCCCCC"> plastic case inside the rubber</font>

88
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:57,799
shell you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can peel it back in just a few</font>

89
00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:00,419
seconds and it goes back<font color="#E5E5E5"> together</font>

90
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:03,360
extremely quick and it looks perfect

91
00:05:00,419 --> 00:05:07,380
when you put it back together so here it

92
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:10,190
is out of its shell and this is what

93
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:15,509
you're dealing with here the pies on<font color="#CCCCCC"> Chu</font>

94
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:18,599
this is the exact<font color="#E5E5E5"> model of the pies on</font>

95
00:05:15,509 --> 00:05:21,270
chip now if you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> it to Shiva they</font>

96
00:05:18,599 --> 00:05:23,729
will actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> say toshiba acidifies on</font>

97
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:27,799
but it's exactly<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same chip there's</font>

98
00:05:23,729 --> 00:05:35,070
absolutely<font color="#CCCCCC"> no difference in the 20</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> PS</font>

100
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:40,800
singled out because paisan gave away

101
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:43,948
their entire schematics for everything

102
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:47,070
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> a public internet it was out there</font>

103
00:05:43,949 --> 00:05:49,050
available of course<font color="#CCCCCC"> we read it that's</font>

104
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:55,320
where we start any penetration starts

105
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:57,659
and just reading their website so the

<font color="#CCCCCC">five</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on Berner images you'll notice this</font>

page is in Russia a Russian<font color="#CCCCCC"> Tsar way for</font>

108
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:07,469
ahead<font color="#E5E5E5"> of us as far as hacking the FISA</font>

109
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:09,389
most of the information is in Russia you

110
00:06:07,469 --> 00:06:15,960
have to go then translate it and bring

111
00:06:09,389 --> 00:06:19,800
it over so Adam and Brandon took this a

112
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:23,130
step further they presented this talk at

113
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:25,800
Derby Kong this last year and they took

114
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:28,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">it a step further by creating tools so</font>

115
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:31,740
they've made the tool drive comp Drive

116

<font color="#E5E5E5">calm communicates with the drive with</font>

the<font color="#CCCCCC"> nanda</font>

118
00:06:32,569 --> 00:06:39,740
it will pull<font color="#CCCCCC"> the old firmware you can</font>

119
00:06:35,659 --> 00:06:42,919
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> go through your batch of USB</font>

120
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:45,499
drives now you know i buy 50 here 50

121
00:06:42,919 --> 00:06:46,909
there 50 here and then I instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

122
00:06:45,499 --> 00:06:49,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">happen to disassemble them to see what</font>

123
00:06:46,909 --> 00:06:52,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">lies on chip is in there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now I can just</font>

124
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:54,649
shove it in run dr cohn dr<font color="#CCCCCC"> cohn tells me</font>

125
00:06:52,459 --> 00:06:57,409
yep that's good goes in this pile nope

126
00:06:54,649 --> 00:06:59,599
that's not golden lamp up I can go

127
00:06:57,409 --> 00:07:01,219
through<font color="#E5E5E5"> a hundred in a matter of just a</font>

128
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:03,378
few minutes instead of instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of having</font>

129
00:07:01,219 --> 00:07:06,110
to distance dissect each and every one

130
00:07:03,379 --> 00:07:09,559
of them to find what chip it has in it

131
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:12,709
now narrowed it down dr calm also can

132
00:07:09,559 --> 00:07:15,619
pull the original firmware off put the

133
00:07:12,709 --> 00:07:19,339
customized firmware back on all within

134
00:07:15,619 --> 00:07:21,139
the one application so they also

135
00:07:19,339 --> 00:07:23,629
provided a tool to build a custom

136
00:07:21,139 --> 00:07:26,949
firmware it's a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> more than</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a batch</font>

137
00:07:23,629 --> 00:07:31,189
script but our excuse me<font color="#CCCCCC"> yea batch file</font>

138
00:07:26,949 --> 00:07:33,469
and it does it pulls us things and build

139
00:07:31,189 --> 00:07:36,110
the custom firmware which you can then

140
00:07:33,469 --> 00:07:39,949
embed the payload which is another tool

141
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:41,839
they provide so embed the payload where

142
00:07:39,949 --> 00:07:43,759
do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get the payload it's just simply</font>

143
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:46,219
a ducky screw we're just recycling

144
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:49,009
something we already have and starting

145
00:07:46,219 --> 00:07:51,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">to use in a different manner so we take</font>

146
00:07:49,009 --> 00:07:53,599
our ducky script and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I had intended</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

147
00:07:51,769 --> 00:07:56,869
have a couple of devices that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we could</font>

148
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:58,789
do some demonstration but I brick from

149
00:07:56,869 --> 00:08:01,939
last night went us a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> too far</font>

150
00:07:58,789 --> 00:08:05,659
trying to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> the 32 and a 64 bit in</font>

151
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:08,629
there at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> time so ducky script</font>

152
00:08:05,659 --> 00:08:12,909
use the duck encoder gives you your

153
00:08:08,629 --> 00:08:15,979
inject bein take the inject bin put it

154
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:19,308
embed it using the<font color="#E5E5E5"> embed payload right</font>

155
00:08:15,979 --> 00:08:21,589
into your custom firmware and you're

00:08:19,309 --> 00:08:23,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">there if you want to build these tools</font>

157
00:08:21,589 --> 00:08:24,979

158
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:28,490
visual studio and you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to need</font>

160
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:31,849
don't have to because it's already

161
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:39,979
compiled you can download it from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

one more time payloads so we can do

anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> with our payload the one I was</font>

174
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:18,430
right then and there<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm in like 30</font>

175
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:21,280
seconds to list so we can also make<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

176
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:26,160
where it emails oh shoots us off to us

opens up persistent listener phones home

178
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:31,589
whatever we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do the payload can</font>

179
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:37,540
be anything because there's absolutely

180
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:43,180
no checking within the USB design it was

181
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:46,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">designed it really came</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out in 1996 I</font>

182
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:49,660
was testing USB and we didn't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> any</font>

183
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:51,160
devices we it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> there supposed to test</font>

184
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:54,219
something with it we had to install it

185
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:56,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">in windows 95 osr too but I didn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

186
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:59,140
anything so we ended<font color="#E5E5E5"> up rigging up a set</font>

187
00:09:56,770 --> 00:10:01,300
at USB speakers well that's worthless

188
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:04,060
because we<font color="#CCCCCC"> got a audio port on the back</font>

189
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:09,670
why do we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> that so it was a</font>

190
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:11,530
progression and in in 1996 security

191
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:14,020
mentality didn't exist like<font color="#CCCCCC"> it does</font>

192
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:18,250
today so we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> still operating on old</font>

193
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:20,740
old tech gnome so the the simpler the

194
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:24,070
payload the better you know I got a

195
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:26,230
little complicated between my 32 64 bit

196
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:29,310
everything i bricked them but breaking

197
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:33,310
homes not the end of the road if you

198
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:35,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">brick it that's okay because you can you</font>

199
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:41,079
can short the pins get back into boot

200
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:44,410
mode you're okay so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way it works dr</font>

201
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:46,270
calm sets the device into boot mode once

202
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:49,540
it's in boot mode you can retrieve the

203
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:51,059
flash send a flash anything to it so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

204
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:54,659
flash the firmware

205
00:10:51,059 --> 00:10:57,358
then to test cycle the power boots up

206
00:10:54,659 --> 00:11:00,179
going to do what you've designed it to

207
00:10:57,359 --> 00:11:02,669
do hopefully otherwise you have to go to

208
00:11:00,179 --> 00:11:04,468
the next method short the pins which

209
00:11:02,669 --> 00:11:08,848
automatically puts the hardware into

210
00:11:04,469 --> 00:11:11,519
boot mode flash the firmware test print

211
00:11:08,849 --> 00:11:13,259
slathering and its many times as you

212
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:16,019
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it and as much</font>

213
00:11:13,259 --> 00:11:29,339
patience as you have you can do<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything</font>

214
00:11:16,019 --> 00:11:33,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">you want with these USD</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so so how do</font>

215
00:11:29,339 --> 00:11:35,759
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> protect ourselves well one way is you</font>

216
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:38,459
come to events like this and you find

217
00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:41,069
out what's going<font color="#CCCCCC"> on so that's that's the</font>

218
00:11:38,459 --> 00:11:44,189
first thing well you could you could

219
00:11:41,069 --> 00:11:45,868
choose to disable the USB a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> years</font>

220
00:11:44,189 --> 00:11:48,089
back it's been<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> few years now the</font>

221
00:11:45,869 --> 00:11:50,519
VA tried this they<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought it would be</font>

222
00:11:48,089 --> 00:11:52,409
brilliant<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to disable the USB</font>

223
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:55,649
and they actually even went to the

224
00:11:52,409 --> 00:12:00,599
extent on some of these of gluing a

225
00:11:55,649 --> 00:12:03,089
little piece of plastic into the USB so

226
00:12:00,599 --> 00:12:08,269
you couldn't use<font color="#CCCCCC"> it well what happens</font>

227
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:11,219
when you do that it drives people<font color="#E5E5E5"> crazy</font>

228
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:13,889
makes them pretty mad they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

229
00:12:11,219 --> 00:12:17,099
find<font color="#E5E5E5"> a workaround so those kinds of</font>

230
00:12:13,889 --> 00:12:20,489
activities tend to send people to using

231
00:12:17,099 --> 00:12:23,989
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> drop box or they still have a need</font>

232
00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:28,079
<font color="#CCCCCC">to transfer some big files right</font>

233
00:12:23,989 --> 00:12:30,239
antivirus well antivirus isn't going to

234
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:36,439
help very much at<font color="#E5E5E5"> least today nobody's</font>

235
00:12:30,239 --> 00:12:36,439
really got anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> that detects bad USB</font>

236
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:45,659
you can have endpoint protection right

237
00:12:40,729 --> 00:12:47,339
you can well you can do the simple

238
00:12:45,659 --> 00:12:50,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">things that we probably all do a lot of</font>

239
00:12:47,339 --> 00:12:52,109
removing PowerShell you can do some

240
00:12:50,549 --> 00:12:55,619
hardware encryption that kind of stuff

241
00:12:52,109 --> 00:12:59,339
helps but physical security is the most

242
00:12:55,619 --> 00:13:01,769
important thing you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know Jason talked a</font>

243
00:12:59,339 --> 00:13:04,409
lot about what he does in physical

244
00:13:01,769 --> 00:13:04,889
security but that is that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the most</font>

245
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:07,410
important

246
00:13:04,889 --> 00:13:10,639
thing if I if I have a laptop if I have

247
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:13,170
a desktop and I'm taking good care of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

248
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:16,290
from a physical standpoint somebody's

249
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:19,679
not going to just easily slip a USB in

250
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:21,629
them that I'm not aware of into it but I

251
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:24,149
can't be<font color="#E5E5E5"> there all the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time if it's a</font>

252
00:13:21,629 --> 00:13:28,230
desktop it's a laptop maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can have</font>

253
00:13:24,149 --> 00:13:31,339
it with me all the time or maybe

254
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:35,399
somebody could potentially trick me into

255
00:13:31,339 --> 00:13:36,929
putting in a USB and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's why it's</font>

256
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:39,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">so important</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to have that security</font>

257
00:13:36,929 --> 00:13:42,779
awareness and training and what's what

258
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:46,759
is it about<font color="#E5E5E5"> all these does anybody think</font>

259
00:13:42,779 --> 00:13:55,079
of any other ways that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we could protect</font>

260
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:57,480
yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay user education so I love that</font>

261
00:13:55,079 --> 00:14:00,628
<font color="#CCCCCC">answer let me expand on that a little</font>

262
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:03,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">bit so when we first concocted this idea</font>

263
00:14:00,629 --> 00:14:05,399
of hey let's kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of take the work</font>

264
00:14:03,149 --> 00:14:06,660
that's been done already and see what we

265
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:09,929
can build with that and what we can

266
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:11,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">divine we didn't know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it was going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

267
00:14:09,929 --> 00:14:13,639
so hard to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get an environment stood up</font>

268
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:17,279
and everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it was going to take</font>

269
00:14:13,639 --> 00:14:19,379
so we fully intend to actually go right

270
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:22,290
there this is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> become a platform</font>

271
00:14:19,379 --> 00:14:25,410
eventually of security awareness and

272
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:28,139
training where we build<font color="#E5E5E5"> these and place</font>

273
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:31,410
them strategically in places<font color="#E5E5E5"> and have</font>

274
00:14:28,139 --> 00:14:35,910
people plug them in and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> the goal</font>

275
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:37,709
would be to have you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> able to</font>

276
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:40,019
show people well you you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> you found</font>

277
00:14:37,709 --> 00:14:41,998
this you did this and send them<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a</font>

278
00:14:40,019 --> 00:14:44,489
little website<font color="#E5E5E5"> where they fill out a</font>

279
00:14:41,999 --> 00:14:47,970
form social engineer them a little bit

280
00:14:44,489 --> 00:14:49,739
more and see how much how much data and

281
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:51,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">we'll kind of walk them down the tree</font>

282
00:14:49,739 --> 00:14:55,559
how much can we get from them<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay first</font>

283
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:57,269
they plugged it in<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay maybe they</font>

284
00:14:55,559 --> 00:14:58,980
didn't receive one<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a manila envelope</font>

285
00:14:57,269 --> 00:15:00,419
on their desk with their name on it but

286
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:03,119
maybe they found in the parking lot or

287
00:15:00,419 --> 00:15:07,439
whatever and we just<font color="#E5E5E5"> help walk through</font>

288
00:15:03,119 --> 00:15:10,619
<font color="#CCCCCC">that with the eventual goal of giving</font>

289
00:15:07,439 --> 00:15:12,569
them back their data that we that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

290
00:15:10,619 --> 00:15:15,029
them to input into some forms and things

291
00:15:12,569 --> 00:15:16,170
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the platform and that's where</font>

292
00:15:15,029 --> 00:15:21,000
we're headed<font color="#CCCCCC"> with that</font>

293
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:21,000
any other thoughts of on ways to protect

294
00:15:24,810 --> 00:15:32,439
alternative storage<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so the little</font>

295
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:34,300
like flash drives and the little chips

296
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:38,050
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can put in computer or you know</font>

297
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:39,579
your watch or your phone or those kinds

298
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:42,400
of things<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay those are going to be</font>

299
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:43,840
probably picked apart and they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

300
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:48,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">to have some of the same challenges</font>

301
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:49,840
right it's a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea though one of the</font>

302
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:53,070
things that that we noticed is we're

303
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:55,210
going through this is is the chip

304
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:59,290
manufacturers are changing fast enough

305
00:15:55,210 --> 00:16:03,700
so the 03 that we have a pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> good</font>

306
00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:06,130
platform already worked out is you know

307
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:09,160
that's that was older technology the<font color="#E5E5E5"> o</font>

308
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:10,689
sevens are more prevalent now and takes

309
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:12,640
a little bit of<font color="#E5E5E5"> time to figure it out so</font>

310
00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:16,060
they try and<font color="#E5E5E5"> stay ahead of the curve and</font>

311
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:19,120
the engineering why by continuing to

312
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:21,910
spit out new chips right so that helps a

313
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:24,460
little bit we probably would suggest<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

314
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:27,610
them eventually that they maybe not put

315
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:30,490
all their tech specs up maybe now there

316
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:35,490
we go all of them any other thoughts on

317
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:35,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">protection yep</font>

318
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:55,230
guess you can use drive calm to

319
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:59,310
determine the chipset and the firmware

320
00:16:55,230 --> 00:17:02,490
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it has and they have serial numbers</font>

321
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:05,099
in the firmware but there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so many</font>

322
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:07,020
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> USB manufacturers</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font>

323
00:17:05,099 --> 00:17:08,429
can't check them all you know you would

324
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:11,970
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to create this big monstrous</font>

325
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:14,130
database of that and then somehow get it

326
00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:16,589
you know at the end point where

327
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:21,080
somebody's plugging it in so it's really

328
00:17:16,589 --> 00:17:24,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">not possible what we need to see our</font>

329
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:26,609
signatures on the firmware check some

330
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:28,260
signatures you know where we're in d

331
00:17:26,609 --> 00:17:30,709
fiving something we're doing something

332
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:42,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">to verify that that is a valid</font>

legitimate firmware on that device no

334
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:49,380
you can because I can take this device

335
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:51,750
and make your machine believe you just

336
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:54,600
plugged in a keyboard and that this text

337

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's now getting fed it count is</font>

340
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:04,650
emulate a keyboard I can emulate a mouse

341
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:21,150
I can emulate a hard drive I can emulate

342
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:23,760
any USB device US v<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't have that</font>

343
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:26,700
differentiation in the USB handshake

344
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:29,010
when you plug that device in the system

345
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:32,340
says you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just plug in a device what are</font>

you the<font color="#E5E5E5"> device is I'm a keyboard and the</font>

347
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:38,010
system says great here's some keyboard

348
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:41,100
drivers rock on there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> absolutely no</font>

349
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:42,840
way to check it no way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to determine what</font>

350
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:46,260
device you actually plugged in is

351
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:50,280
legitimate you can literally plug it in

352
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:52,470
and it can say I'm a USB speaker and

353
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:57,158
start<font color="#E5E5E5"> feeding it what it believes our</font>

354
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:59,769
audio and you can execute PowerShell

355
00:18:57,159 --> 00:19:02,200
rock on because you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> just ambulating</font>

356
00:18:59,769 --> 00:19:19,479
that device and you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> sending the same</font>

357
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:22,509
information with that device it's not

358
00:19:19,479 --> 00:19:25,149
even egressing there<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean you do have</font>

359
00:19:22,509 --> 00:19:28,440
egress points along the firewall and

360
00:19:25,149 --> 00:19:31,779
intrusion detection stuff like that but

361
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:38,190
the I'm sorry the question was can you

362
00:19:31,779 --> 00:19:42,039
do some sort of endpoint control to that

363
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:44,889
yes you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can stop the egress of</font>

364
00:19:42,039 --> 00:19:48,220
data you can stop you know and notify

365
00:19:44,889 --> 00:19:51,758
those type things but inherently in USB

366
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:54,220
you can't stop that firmware from

367
00:19:51,759 --> 00:19:56,649
infecting that machine so yes you can be

368
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:58,929
notified<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that machine attempted to</font>

369
00:19:56,649 --> 00:20:02,139
send this out but realistically what is

370
00:19:58,929 --> 00:20:04,509
the response time<font color="#E5E5E5"> on them you know logs</font>

371
00:20:02,139 --> 00:20:06,519
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be gone through somebody has to</font>

372
00:20:04,509 --> 00:20:09,789
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> notified somebody has</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to go down</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

373
00:20:06,519 --> 00:20:11,559
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> machine you know it is a huge</font>

374
00:20:09,789 --> 00:20:15,369
vulnerability because no matter<font color="#CCCCCC"> what you</font>

375
00:20:11,559 --> 00:20:18,940
plug in it there's no<font color="#CCCCCC"> way to stop that</font>

376
00:20:15,369 --> 00:20:43,629
firmware<font color="#E5E5E5"> from infecting that host yes</font>

377
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:45,429
sir it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> already over well but I can I</font>

378
00:20:43,629 --> 00:20:47,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">can I can make it where it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doesn't pop</font>

379
00:20:45,429 --> 00:20:49,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">up anything the user</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> will think oh well</font>

380
00:20:47,619 --> 00:20:51,609
that one's just did and they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

381
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:54,070
sit there<font color="#CCCCCC"> and say oh well didn't work</font>

382
00:20:51,609 --> 00:20:55,960
here in my<font color="#E5E5E5"> computer slow they give it a</font>

383
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:58,239
couple more seconds they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> just in</font>

384
00:20:55,960 --> 00:21:00,070
there waiting<font color="#E5E5E5"> waiting then they pull it</font>

385
00:20:58,239 --> 00:21:03,269
out they throw it<font color="#E5E5E5"> away it doesn't matter</font>

386
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:03,269
you're already infected at that

387
00:21:54,150 --> 00:22:02,200
guys in your old USB devices you can sit

388
00:21:57,610 --> 00:22:03,610
down fire up<font color="#CCCCCC"> dr calm plug it in and in</font>

389
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:08,260
two seconds<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know whether that one's</font>

390
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:11,530
eyes on or the 03<font color="#CCCCCC"> or a No seven or what</font>

391
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:13,510
and and then I just throw them into

392
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:15,730
different piles this one's on 03 this

393
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:17,590
one's on 07 I now have boxes for my have

394
00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:18,760
them labeled because I know<font color="#CCCCCC"> though seven</font>

395
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:20,709
is coming we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be able to use</font>

396
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:27,480
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> one I got a few thousand oh seven</font>

397
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:30,370
and you know few hundred<font color="#CCCCCC"> Oh threes so so</font>

398
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:32,590
so another vector is how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people in</font>

399
00:22:30,370 --> 00:22:39,070
here have one of those nice little USB

400
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:41,020
wireless mice few nice<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so you take</font>

401
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:44,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">the little dongle right and you plug it</font>

402
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:47,320
in and it's a USB also another delivery

403
00:22:44,049 --> 00:22:49,330
mechanism and that one's nice because

404
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:52,149
you're really<font color="#E5E5E5"> not expecting to do much</font>

405
00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:54,610
with it other than be able to use your

406
00:22:52,150 --> 00:22:57,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">mouse so i plug it in and my mouse works</font>

407
00:22:54,610 --> 00:22:58,360
and now it's even a lot better used to

408
00:22:57,220 --> 00:23:00,370
be you have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> go through</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

409
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:03,100
generations for it to discover it and

410
00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:04,750
download software<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh one of the old ones</font>

411
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:08,500
of downloading software includes

412
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:10,150
downloading malware right but so you

413
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:12,250
plug in<font color="#E5E5E5"> that little thing now it's your</font>

414
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:15,010
not the person that's done that is not

415
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:15,590
expecting to interact with<font color="#CCCCCC"> it other than</font>

416
00:23:15,010 --> 00:23:18,289
the

417
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:20,389
the mouse<font color="#CCCCCC"> Wow the mouse</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> works does all</font>

418
00:23:18,289 --> 00:23:22,908
the things I'm expecting and it's just

419
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:27,830
sitting<font color="#E5E5E5"> there doing whatever else we</font>

420
00:23:22,909 --> 00:23:47,470
might want to make it do<font color="#E5E5E5"> right any other</font>

421
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:52,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">questions or comments okay okay going</font>

422
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:55,159
alright<font color="#CCCCCC"> so hardware encryption here's</font>

423
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:59,240
something we came across recently that

424
00:23:55,159 --> 00:24:00,890
might be somewhat helpful Jason's

425
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:02,870
calculating all the social engineering

426
00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:07,610
ways past this already i conceived them

427
00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:11,479
yesterday but this this kind of a

428
00:24:07,610 --> 00:24:16,449
physical physical security would help

429
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:16,450
right so if you put<font color="#E5E5E5"> a key code on it and</font>

430
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:20,450
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course you could put a lot of these</font>

431
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:23,899
around<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the parking lot that have no</font>

432
00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:26,179
pins so great fun as well or deliver min

433
00:24:23,899 --> 00:24:29,989
the manila envelope lenses love that one

434
00:24:26,179 --> 00:24:33,260
why I love it so much yeah this device

435
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:38,230
is not impervious to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> USB</font>

436
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:40,700
vulnerability but if<font color="#CCCCCC"> I were to carry a</font>

437
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:44,480
device in my pocket this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what I would</font>

438
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:46,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">carry because you have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to enter the pin</font>

439
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:48,320
number to activate it so I know that<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font>

440
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:50,928
<font color="#E5E5E5">someone got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ahold of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my device they're</font>

441
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:52,610
not going to infect my device without my

442
00:24:50,929 --> 00:24:55,039
knowledge without me being present

443
00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:56,870
something like that and they're also not

444
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:59,629
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get my day down this has</font>

445
00:24:56,870 --> 00:25:02,799
hardware encryption it has a battery in

446
00:24:59,630 --> 00:25:06,559
it it maintains you know everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

447
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:10,460
then you lock it and you have to have

448
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:12,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">the pin to unlock it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if you were to like</font>

449
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:14,299
danza put a bunch of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these out in the</font>

450
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:15,860
parking lot you know somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> would sit</font>

451
00:25:14,299 --> 00:25:18,230
there and punch the buttons a million

452
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:20,209
times trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to figure out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the code even</font>

453
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:22,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">though it has no code you could utilize</font>

454
00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:27,440
this as an attack vector but it would

455
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:29,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">protect your data yeah if you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> worry</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

456
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,480
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to put the parking lot and the</font>

457
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:34,010
code

458
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:35,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">one two three</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> four right that's the</font>

459
00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:46,280
first one it's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first one we're going</font>

460
00:25:35,809 --> 00:26:04,928
<font color="#E5E5E5">to try it that's right okay so any other</font>

461
00:25:46,280 --> 00:26:09,020
questions or comments so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that would be</font>

462
00:26:04,929 --> 00:26:11,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do ok but like I said that</font>

463
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:13,549
simplest payload is the best because

464
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:15,439
once you start getting overly

465
00:26:13,549 --> 00:26:18,470
complicated you have more variables for

466
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:20,809
failure and so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want it to work</font>

467
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:23,679
one hundred percent of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the time every</font>

468
00:26:20,809 --> 00:26:27,168
time you need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to know your target</font>

469
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:30,830
whether it's Windows Mac Linux you know

470
00:26:27,169 --> 00:26:33,710
you need to know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that target 32 64 bit</font>

471
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:36,470
of those type things or<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to</font>

472
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:40,250
stick to a<font color="#CCCCCC"> very simple payload of we</font>

473
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:42,410
open it up we launched this persistent

474
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:44,179
listener and we connect back and the

475
00:26:42,410 --> 00:26:45,919
instant that you can connect back you

476
00:26:44,179 --> 00:26:47,360
can take over<font color="#E5E5E5"> that host and owned it and</font>

477
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:50,410
then start working<font color="#E5E5E5"> out from that host</font>

478
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:55,668
well you know so on and so forth and

479
00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:57,919
honestly I believe that if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> took a</font>

480
00:26:55,669 --> 00:27:01,570
handful of these and put them say in the

481
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:04,840
bowl like Jason suggested out there and

482
00:27:01,570 --> 00:27:07,250
it you<font color="#E5E5E5"> couldn't keep up fast enough</font>

483
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:10,820
answering back those hosts to own them

484
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:12,850
with how fast<font color="#CCCCCC"> people would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> put it in and</font>

485
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:16,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a super simple payload of</font>

486
00:27:12,850 --> 00:27:20,389
you know open it up open this listener

487
00:27:16,549 --> 00:27:21,980
and connect back I tried<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get a overly</font>

488
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:24,679
complicated because I wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do some</font>

489
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:27,230
demonstrations where you know we would

490
00:27:24,679 --> 00:27:29,570
ask for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a volunteer and say hey we plug</font>

491
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:32,059
this in you know we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to steal</font>

492
00:27:29,570 --> 00:27:35,540
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> your passwords and we would have</font>

493
00:27:32,059 --> 00:27:37,750
found somebody a volunteer for sure back

494
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:37,750
here

495
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:54,610
in general it's still us be that the

496
00:27:51,759 --> 00:27:56,860
inherent flaw is USB period I mean it

497
00:27:54,610 --> 00:27:59,889
doesn't matter the manufacturer anything

498
00:27:56,860 --> 00:28:02,289
it has firmware on it that firmware has

499
00:27:59,889 --> 00:28:04,120
to talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the host and they have to</font>

500
00:28:02,289 --> 00:28:06,549
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a USB handshake and there is</font>

501
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:10,360
nothing inherently built in the USB

502
00:28:06,549 --> 00:28:12,850
standard at all to<font color="#CCCCCC"> validate anything so</font>

503
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:15,870
it doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> matter what device it is as</font>

504
00:28:12,850 --> 00:28:18,939
long as somebody wants<font color="#CCCCCC"> to and is</font>

505
00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:20,649
persistent enough to break that down in

506
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:22,899
reverse engineer their<font color="#E5E5E5"> firmware and</font>

507
00:28:20,649 --> 00:28:26,080
determine where it sits on the nan and

508
00:28:22,899 --> 00:28:27,939
how<font color="#CCCCCC"> its put in there and what what bites</font>

509
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:32,168
they can take away and what bike they

510
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:34,269
can use from<font color="#E5E5E5"> that original firmware it's</font>

511
00:28:32,169 --> 00:29:20,860
vulnerable just I<font color="#CCCCCC"> mean it's just</font>

512
00:28:34,269 --> 00:29:23,320
inherent you just got owned and<font color="#E5E5E5"> strip</font>

513
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:26,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">their passwords off on the way and then</font>

514
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:28,750
send it via gmail to some obscure

515
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:38,469
account sure absolutely everybody should

516
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:42,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">do it anyone else so that well we'd like</font>

517
00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:47,100
to thank our our friends<font color="#E5E5E5"> and colleagues</font>
