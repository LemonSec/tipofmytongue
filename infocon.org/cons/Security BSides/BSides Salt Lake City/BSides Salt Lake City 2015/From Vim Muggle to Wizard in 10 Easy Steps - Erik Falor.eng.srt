those<font color="#E5E5E5"> tools that we too often don't</font>

think about just use all the time so why

59
00:02:59,329 --> 00:03:02,720
is it's more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just a text editor</font>

60
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:04,010
it's become a way of life for power

uncover an unseen world inhabited by

the user and their goal what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean by</font>

90
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:14,880
that is features that don't help you get

of features it's not lacking in that

I'm studying up masters computer science

112
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:03,150
at Utah State University my name is

with epic failure so don't feel bad

115
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:08,880
about hurting my<font color="#E5E5E5"> feelings saying it that</font>

116
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:12,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">way I have been using them virtually</font>

117
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:13,320
every day since 2003 and it dawned on me

118
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:15,929
when I putting<font color="#E5E5E5"> this together that that</font>

119
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:17,610
was as long ago as 12 years<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago that's</font>

120
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:18,720
as long as I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> in public school and it</font>

121
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:20,760
doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really seem like it was that</font>

122
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,020
long ago doesn't feel like 12 years in

123
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:24,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">fact I couldn't really think of anything</font>

124
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:26,549
that's distinctively 2003 about 2003 so

125
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:32,400
I had to go to Google to see what

126
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:34,140
happened then this wasn't a good<font color="#CCCCCC"> year so</font>

127
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:36,150
with the title like them muggle to

128
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:37,950
wizard I'm kind of implying there's a

129
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:39,900
dichotomy there's two kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of users</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

130
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:42,210

132
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:47,580
i'll call the muggles and programmer

133
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:49,350
culture<font color="#CCCCCC"> people these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are wizards so what</font>

134
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:51,109
what do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys think is the</font>

135
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:53,610
distinction<font color="#E5E5E5"> between these two cultures</font>

136
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:57,300
what makes a user a user what makes a

140
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:32,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">efficiency yes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so that's</font>

141
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:33,840
exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> it okay I dispute the</font>

142
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:36,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">user-friendliness thing because I feel</font>

143
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:38,039
<font color="#CCCCCC">like editors that don't give you a</font>

144
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:39,539
chance<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get better at the editor</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

145
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:41,010
really use it well or they're actually

00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:42,540
on tagged mystic towards easy user but

147
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:44,550
at the early stage when you're first

148
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:47,669
coming into it certainly friendliness

149
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:48,720
issue yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right so that's that's</font>

150
00:06:47,669 --> 00:06:50,039
what I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

151
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,510
what I'm hopefully going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> convince you</font>

152
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:53,400
about is that the learning curve isn't a

153
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:55,320
bad thing it's a good thing so<font color="#CCCCCC"> muggles</font>

154
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,789
in general the<font color="#CCCCCC"> way they approach their</font>

155
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:58,770
computer it's a specific<font color="#CCCCCC"> tool for</font>

156
00:06:56,790 --> 00:07:02,100
specific tasks<font color="#E5E5E5"> they have apps and this</font>

157
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:02,880
app does this that app does that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

158
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:04,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of keep them in those containers</font>

159
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,510
they don't care how the app works just

160
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:08,460
as long as<font color="#CCCCCC"> they can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get on tumblr or use</font>

161
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:11,430
hashtags or whatever to do in these days

162
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:13,500
and they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> it to look pretty I don't</font>

163
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:15,210
understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> iPads I don't understand the</font>

appeal<font color="#E5E5E5"> there other than they just look</font>

165
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:18,299
neat they look like something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font>

166
00:07:16,919 --> 00:07:20,150
grew up watching on Saturday morning

167
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:22,590
cartoons but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to use the thing</font>

168
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:24,270
it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> defends about every</font>

169
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:26,039
sensibility i have about<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know user</font>

170
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:27,000
interface now wizards on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other hand</font>

171
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:29,460
were the kind of people that we

172
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,290
recognize<font color="#CCCCCC"> that a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> computer is a computer</font>

173
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:33,180
it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> machine that can do literally</font>

anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's limited only by our</font>

175
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:38,190
imagination and it does stuff on its own

176
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:39,330
is automated so we can set it to work

177
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:41,010
tell what to do then<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's going to get</font>

00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:42,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">this stuff done I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have to babysit</font>

179
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:44,400
and keep mashing buttons to make it keep

180
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:46,140
going it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like I'm trying to push a</font>

181
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,900
ball up hill it will do it on its own

182
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:50,430
the way we use our computers is kind of

183
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:52,620
part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our identity and our lifestyle</font>

184
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:54,600
and to get invested in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a tool isn't like</font>

185
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:56,820
a big thing for<font color="#E5E5E5"> us because we can</font>

186
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:58,680
understand that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's going to pay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> off</font>

187
00:07:56,820 --> 00:08:00,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">in the long run i've been using vim for</font>

over a decade and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i feel like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm able</font>

00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:07,440
lot of my peers but most importantly

191
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:09,599
wizards we like our computers to do our

192
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:11,789
bidding and to work for<font color="#CCCCCC"> us and we just</font>

193
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:13,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">really get offended and insulted when</font>

194
00:08:11,789 --> 00:08:14,909
the computer<font color="#E5E5E5"> expects us to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff that</font>

195
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:15,280
the computer should be good<font color="#E5E5E5"> at doing</font>

196
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:18,460
like

197
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:20,679
counting and doing a tedious task in the

198
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:21,849
loop over and over again this is what

199
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:24,220
computers are for so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> make our</font>

200
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:26,410
computer do that so my goal is<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> help</font>

201
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:29,080
you recognize workflows and patterns in

202
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:31,450
your<font color="#CCCCCC"> day-to-day</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that are kind of muggle</font>

203
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:33,159
ish in the sense that you're doing dumb

204
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:35,348
stuff that the computer could easily do

205
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:37,809
what quick just<font color="#E5E5E5"> as dumbly but more</font>

206
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:39,909
quickly think about how to make your

207
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:41,468
<font color="#E5E5E5">workflows more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> wizard-like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and to get us</font>

208
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:43,419
started<font color="#E5E5E5"> on that you know them is a</font>

209
00:08:41,469 --> 00:08:45,100
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> great tool to that end but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I want</font>

210
00:08:43,419 --> 00:08:46,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">to give you the 10 best features they'll</font>

211
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:48,610
give you<font color="#CCCCCC"> the most bang for your buck</font>

212
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:50,589
there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of features is really hard</font>

213
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:51,760
to decide which 10 ones to go with for

214
00:08:50,589 --> 00:08:55,800
this I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> these ones will get you off</font>

215
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:57,790
and running so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mentioned there's a</font>

216
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:59,050
interactive component to this I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

217
00:08:57,790 --> 00:09:01,500
to kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of follow along with me if you</font>

218
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:05,020
have a laptop so go to this website

219
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:06,820
unabated net I got a tarball there with

220
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:08,110
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> couple of text files in it look at</font>

221
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:12,060
this I'm getting people to the security

222
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:16,120
conference to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a URL I'm leet I</font>

223
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:17,979
should have all their be PDFs of the

224
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:23,080
slides you can download that trust me

225
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:24,339
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just the slides guys</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so</font>

226
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:26,260
while you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> downloading</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that and</font>

227
00:09:24,339 --> 00:09:28,600
unzipping it and get<font color="#CCCCCC"> the files out wait</font>

228
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:33,390
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> des is there anybody on a Windows</font>

229
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:33,390
platform here you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys on linux or mac</font>

230
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:39,160
ok well there's a good way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get like a</font>

231
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:41,260
bleeding edge version of them on<font color="#CCCCCC"> windows</font>

232
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:42,040
but we'll talk about that instead in the

233
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:44,589
meantime I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about the</font>

234
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:45,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">history of VI why is vim the way it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

235
00:09:44,589 --> 00:09:47,020
today<font color="#E5E5E5"> and how did we get there and all</font>

236
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:48,520
that good stuff and because we're in

237
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:51,880
Utah feel a bit obligated to have a

238
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:54,100
genealogy chart to describe this them

239
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:58,780
has a long heritage it descends from a

240
00:09:54,100 --> 00:10:00,700
line of<font color="#E5E5E5"> line editors QED was one of the</font>

241
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:02,860
first ones back in the day and apart

242
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:04,600
from having a<font color="#E5E5E5"> really cool name it was</font>

243
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:07,420
ported to unix by guys like dennis

244
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:09,520
ritchie and ken thompson like Thompson

245
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:11,140
hack ken Thompson so you know this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

246
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:13,689
basically alien technology when he

247
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:15,400
writes it what QED did was when he type

248
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:18,100
in a regular<font color="#CCCCCC"> expression it would compile</font>

249
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:19,959
machine code representations of the non

250
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:22,839
deterministic finite automaton and then

251
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:24,880
run that as the regular expression so

252
00:10:22,839 --> 00:10:27,790
that was that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty legit I'm the</font>

253
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:29,139
ported to Linux sorry to unix in the 70s

254
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:31,118
a dennis ritchie had a hand in

255
00:10:29,139 --> 00:10:34,089
that and then it went through a line of

256
00:10:31,119 --> 00:10:35,709
revisions and kind of refinement even

257
00:10:34,089 --> 00:10:37,269
though ed is the standard UNIX editor

258
00:10:35,709 --> 00:10:39,368
wasn't regarded as being particularly

259
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:40,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">user-friendly so some guys try to make</font>

260
00:10:39,369 --> 00:10:44,619
<font color="#CCCCCC">it a little bit better over the years</font>

261
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:46,868
and bill joy was the guy<font color="#CCCCCC"> that did a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font>

262
00:10:44,619 --> 00:10:48,790
of that work he actually a Steve Jobs a

263
00:10:46,869 --> 00:10:51,249
feature from this editor called Bravo

264
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:52,839
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> vims redo operator when you type</font>

265
00:10:51,249 --> 00:10:57,069
a period and it redoes the last thing

266
00:10:52,839 --> 00:10:59,649
you just did so glad that off but lion

267
00:10:57,069 --> 00:11:02,529
editors<font color="#CCCCCC"> your UI was a piece of paper</font>

268
00:10:59,649 --> 00:11:05,079
they were teletype terminal program for

269
00:11:02,529 --> 00:11:07,029
editing text on a typewriter effectively

270
00:11:05,079 --> 00:11:09,040
but instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> of having a screen had paper</font>

271
00:11:07,029 --> 00:11:10,359
so had some design considerations that

272
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:13,029
were optimized<font color="#CCCCCC"> to that environment</font>

273
00:11:10,359 --> 00:11:14,619
namely you don't just type text by

274
00:11:13,029 --> 00:11:16,839
default you start off<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a command mode</font>

275
00:11:14,619 --> 00:11:18,040
you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> lots of marks and buffers and</font>

276
00:11:16,839 --> 00:11:19,239
registers and things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that help you keep</font>

277
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:21,549
track of your<font color="#E5E5E5"> work because you're really</font>

278
00:11:19,239 --> 00:11:23,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">looking at one line at a time by the</font>

279
00:11:21,549 --> 00:11:26,949
time bill joy got involved he had this

280
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:29,619
terminal the Lear<font color="#CCCCCC"> sigler ad m3a he had a</font>

281
00:11:26,949 --> 00:11:31,319
screen so he could have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a cursor that</font>

282
00:11:29,619 --> 00:11:33,519
needed to be moved<font color="#E5E5E5"> around the screen</font>

283
00:11:31,319 --> 00:11:34,569
that's a pretty cool feature except

284
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:37,869
you'll notice<font color="#E5E5E5"> on this keyboard there's</font>

285
00:11:34,569 --> 00:11:40,329
not arrow cluster anywhere this is why

286
00:11:37,869 --> 00:11:42,429
VI uses<font color="#CCCCCC"> 8sj K&L to move the cursor</font>

287
00:11:40,329 --> 00:11:44,319
around because that's just what his

288
00:11:42,429 --> 00:11:45,730
terminal had wasn't him trying to be

289
00:11:44,319 --> 00:11:48,610
uber efficient or anything that's just

290
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:50,199
the limitations he had and as a side

291
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:52,600
note<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can know a lot of people myself</font>

292
00:11:50,199 --> 00:11:53,859
included got into VI because the<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea of</font>

293
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:56,100
not using the arrow keys to move the

294
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:57,970
cursor seemed really lead and wizardly

295
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:59,199
if you think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is kind of a dumb</font>

296
00:11:57,970 --> 00:12:00,009
argument to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make the new users because</font>

297
00:11:59,199 --> 00:12:01,540
you're telling them<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's really</font>

298
00:12:00,009 --> 00:12:03,489
inefficient<font color="#E5E5E5"> to move your right hand from</font>

299
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:04,480
here to here<font color="#E5E5E5"> to move the arrow keys but</font>

300
00:12:03,489 --> 00:12:06,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">then we expect people to move to the</font>

301
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:09,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">left hand from here to here to mash</font>

302
00:12:06,009 --> 00:12:11,649
escape all the time you'll notice<font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font>

303
00:12:09,819 --> 00:12:14,229
this little tab looking key right here

304
00:12:11,649 --> 00:12:16,539
is actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Escape key so for him</font>

305
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:18,549
hitting escape wasn't a big deal and a

306
00:12:16,539 --> 00:12:20,410
lot of vim users in the community will

307
00:12:18,549 --> 00:12:22,720
remap their caps lock key<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be the</font>

308
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:27,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">Escape key to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so it's they can you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

309
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:29,379
keep the claim of being ergonomic a lot

310
00:12:27,189 --> 00:12:31,509
of the problems<font color="#E5E5E5"> that VI and indeed the</font>

311
00:12:29,379 --> 00:12:35,019
line editors were trying to solve or far

312
00:12:31,509 --> 00:12:37,149
far gone<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're so obsolete now but</font>

313
00:12:35,019 --> 00:12:39,189
we're still talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about VI</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bills only</font>

314
00:12:37,149 --> 00:12:41,049
had a 300 baud modem from<font color="#E5E5E5"> his terminal</font>

315
00:12:39,189 --> 00:12:42,829
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the mainframe so his whole thing was</font>

316
00:12:41,049 --> 00:12:44,750
trying to limit the bandwidth

317
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:45,920
in the latency it couldn't keep up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

318
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:47,660
this thought so he wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> something he</font>

319
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:49,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">could give very few commands but get it</font>

320
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:51,439
to do a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of work so you didn't have</font>

321
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:52,700
to wait for<font color="#E5E5E5"> it or you know do dumb stuff</font>

322
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:55,040
over and over again because it's really

323
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:56,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">slow for him but the reason VI has</font>

324
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,760
staying power and why we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> still using</font>

325
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:01,220
VI based editors 40 years later because

326
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:03,950
he accidentally got the best you I not

327
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:07,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">even trying to so let's talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about a</font>

328
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:08,720
good UI real quick a good UI is well

329
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:11,689
it's not aerobics like what Tom Cruise

330
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:13,610
is doing here in fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

331
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:16,580
would consider VI to be the epitome of a

332
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:18,860
bad UI and they do everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> wrong so</font>

333
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:19,940
there's no guey no mouse support and a

334
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:21,620
lot of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel like you need that in</font>

335
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:23,000
a text editor got<font color="#E5E5E5"> all these weird</font>

336
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:25,370
cryptic commands they're hard to

337
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,230
remember like unlike control see that's

338
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:29,660
copy because you know copy starts with<font color="#E5E5E5"> C</font>

339
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:31,850
control x of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course is cut because cut</font>

340
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:33,170
starts I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> X looks like scissors and</font>

341
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:36,170
cut with scissors and then naturally

342
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:37,339
paste its control V because the view

343
00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:41,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">looks like a down arrow and you're</font>

344
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:44,390
pasting stuff down control Z's undo<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok</font>

345
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:47,240
so we all got we all got<font color="#CCCCCC"> our own weird</font>

346
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:48,920
cryptic commands VI is just don't happen

347
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:51,140
to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ones that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> everybody else uses</font>

348
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:53,510
partly because it predates that standard

349
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:55,310
by a good decade oh that's a dumb

350
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:57,080
argument but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not discoverable</font>

351
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:58,880
there's not like tooltips and little

352
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:00,950
menus to hold your hand<font color="#E5E5E5"> and help you</font>

353
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:02,510
along and that's one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those features i</font>

354
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:03,590
feel get in between you and your goal

355
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:05,420
because once you know what you're doing

356
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:07,550
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't need tool tips to remind you</font>

357
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:11,270
how to do it<font color="#CCCCCC"> right and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> finally it's a</font>

358
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:14,270
modal program ooh this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is bad bad stuff</font>

359
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:15,530
you guys<font color="#CCCCCC"> should</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have modes because there</font>

360
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:18,520
are significant source of errors

361
00:14:15,530 --> 00:14:20,930
confusion restrictions and complexity

362
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:23,060
now if anybody other than Jef raskins

363
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:24,650
said that I would just I wouldn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> even</font>

364
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:25,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">put it in my slides but this this guy's</font>

365
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:27,319
a genius he knows what he's talking

366
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:29,270
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> he really hated the</font>

367
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:31,730
original v I didn't tell you what mode

368
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:33,920
you were in it does now and<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the</font>

369
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:36,370
other clones do so if you still<font color="#E5E5E5"> alive</font>

370
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:38,839
I'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask him what he thought of that but</font>

371
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:41,150
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> despite all of these things of you I</font>

372
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:42,650
did wrong lots of people probably more

373
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:45,530
people today than at any point in

374
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:48,620
history are using a VI based editor you

375
00:14:45,530 --> 00:14:52,160
know why is that and so let's talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

376
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:54,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> learning curve the you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is that you I</font>

377
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:56,750
experts are designing they're geared

378
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:58,640
towards new computer users a lot

379
00:14:56,750 --> 00:15:00,470
stuff was thought of in the 80s when

380
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:01,640
computers weren't commonplace so to get

381
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:03,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">people to use a computer in the first</font>

382
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:05,090
place was a big feet you<font color="#CCCCCC"> had to convince</font>

383
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:06,680
him it was like a real world object

384
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:09,230
they're familiar with<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a desktop and</font>

385
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:11,479
you got emails that come to an inbox and

386
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:13,820
how to use all these stupid abstractions

387
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:15,980
and metaphors for things that is Wizards

388
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:18,170
we know we're on a computer we know it's

389
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:19,760
got registers and you know operations

390
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:20,930
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> opcodes I mean that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doesn't scare us</font>

391
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:23,420
her intimidate us it just gets in the

392
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:26,089
way and<font color="#E5E5E5"> furthermore looking at this</font>

393
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:28,969
chart what's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> difference between a</font>

394
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:30,380
notepad user over here and a notepad

395
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:31,880
user over here that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> been using it for</font>

396
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:34,220
two years versus the guy that<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

397
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:37,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">started</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> using it two weeks ago not an</font>

398
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:39,740
awful lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay you don't just get really</font>

399
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:41,209
good at notepad you get a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit</font>

400
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:43,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">good at notepad and that's as far as you</font>

401
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:45,140
can go VI on the other hand yes sir

402
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:47,120
there's a ramp up time but once you get

403
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:48,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">to a certain point you can start adding</font>

404
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:51,230
on new features and these features work

405
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:52,910
together and they they combine and they

406
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:56,450
compose and makes it<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the more</font>

407
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:58,160
powerful all the time you I experts that

408
00:15:56,450 --> 00:15:59,690
are designing for this guy's got this

409
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:02,300
many brain cells he knows what he's

410
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:04,430
doing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> well and someone with this</font>

411
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:06,560
many hands I don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> you get to call</font>

412
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:08,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">it a humane interface when it's designed</font>

413
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,829
for someone that you know

414
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:12,560
physiologically can't be a human being

415
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:13,970
right because you're an insert mode all

416
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,589
the time because presumably in the text

417
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:17,900
editor all you're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> is typing new</font>

418
00:16:15,589 --> 00:16:20,480
text does anybody just<font color="#E5E5E5"> open up a blank</font>

419
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:22,100
file and type a new line of text and

420
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:25,100
then close it and then the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font>

421
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:26,660
types of<font color="#E5E5E5"> me know you're like refactoring</font>

422
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:27,980
and rearranging stuff and move and crap

423
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:29,120
around that's why you're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> in insert</font>

424
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:32,480
mode<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the time because it's not your</font>

425
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:34,490
most common use case and as far as<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

426
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,390
iPads and touch screens go like again I

427
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:37,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't think these are designed with</font>

428
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:38,540
human physiology in mind<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I can't</font>

429
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:40,010
see<font color="#CCCCCC"> through my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hand to tell what I'm</font>

430
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:41,810
supposed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be touching and I can't feel</font>

431
00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:43,580
what I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> touching so my theory is that</font>

432
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:45,109
Steve Jobs was on one of his legendary

433
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:46,370
acid trips and he's watching beetlejuice

434
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:49,250
when he<font color="#E5E5E5"> got the idea for the touch</font>

435
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:50,510
screen because he<font color="#CCCCCC"> invented that same way</font>

436
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:53,089
Al Gore<font color="#E5E5E5"> invented the internet right</font>

437
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:56,210
pretty sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the marketing leads me</font>

438
00:16:53,089 --> 00:16:58,760
to believe so VI on the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> hand see</font>

439
00:16:56,210 --> 00:17:01,070
what I did there it enlaces your inner

440
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:02,510
cyborg you're going to be having all

441
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:03,860
these commands right your fingertips<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

442
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:06,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">move text around it's going to be</font>

443
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:07,839
awesome so let's talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> why these</font>

444
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:09,970
old-school moves

445
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:11,589
are the best first one of these is

446
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:14,439
regular expression so at this point if

447
00:17:11,589 --> 00:17:15,819
you got the<font color="#E5E5E5"> text file pop open demo text</font>

448
00:17:14,439 --> 00:17:17,919
in them then go find the regular

449
00:17:15,819 --> 00:17:19,359
expression section with regular

450
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:22,270
expressions you don't have to experience

451
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:23,889
the file linearly I tried sublime for a

452
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:25,329
little while I saw my co-workers using

453
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:27,520
it's got that mini map on the right that

454
00:17:25,329 --> 00:17:29,379
looks really really cool my problem was

455
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:31,210
editing little tiny files like<font color="#CCCCCC"> etsy</font>

456
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:33,400
fstab that they all fit on the screen

457
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:35,409
anyways and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I didn't need a map or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font>

458
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:38,140
editing<font color="#E5E5E5"> these several megabytes long</font>

459
00:17:35,409 --> 00:17:39,640
tomcat logs that map I mean it all looks

460
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:41,380
the same on the map and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the map only</font>

461
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:43,149
shows me a few screen<font color="#CCCCCC"> fools so that</font>

462
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:45,700
didn't buy me a lot but at that time I

463
00:17:43,149 --> 00:17:47,529
realized I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't think of the file is</font>

464
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:48,850
like a linear sequence i use regular

465
00:17:47,529 --> 00:17:51,159
expressions to jump around where<font color="#E5E5E5"> I need</font>

466
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:52,750
to go I mean we use computers to find

467
00:17:51,159 --> 00:17:56,260
stuff for us all the time that's what

468
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:57,730
Google does and your editor should be

469
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:59,740
finding stuff for you so you don't have

470
00:17:57,730 --> 00:18:01,270
to scroll through search for it you can

471
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:02,799
count how many times stuffs in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> file</font>

472
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:05,260
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can make lots of these little boring</font>

473
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:06,549
tedious error-prone changes you just

474
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:09,610
tell the computer what to do then let it

475
00:18:06,549 --> 00:18:12,129
do it so for instance let's talk about

476
00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:14,678
<font color="#E5E5E5">in here I got the word</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> jabber walk in</font>

477
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:16,419
here a few times and I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find out</font>

478
00:18:14,679 --> 00:18:17,980
how many times I'm saying jabber walk in

479
00:18:16,419 --> 00:18:20,380
this file so i could just highlight it

480
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:22,000
is regular expression do a search so it

481
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:25,390
highlights it and visualizes it for me

482
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,980
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> can hit n the vim command to you</font>

483
00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:28,480
know go through all of them and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I could</font>

484
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:31,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">just wait till I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bottomed out and then I</font>

485
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:32,529
could be counting wait a<font color="#E5E5E5"> minute i'm on a</font>

486
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:33,789
computer these are really good at

487
00:18:32,529 --> 00:18:35,500
counting also have the computer<font color="#E5E5E5"> do the</font>

488
00:18:33,789 --> 00:18:36,908
counting right so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm just going to run</font>

489
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:39,159
this little command here it's a

490
00:18:36,909 --> 00:18:41,890
substitute command but the end lat the

491
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:43,240
end doesn't actually change it I'm

492
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:44,350
student<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the side effect because at</font>

493
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:45,909
the bottom<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the screen if you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can see</font>

494
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:47,889
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it tells me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there are eight matches</font>

495
00:18:45,909 --> 00:18:49,510
on eight different lines I got the

496
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:51,220
computer<font color="#E5E5E5"> to count this for me stupid</font>

497
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:53,408
fast because you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know again computers</font>

498
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:55,840
are really good at that stuff well let's

499
00:18:53,409 --> 00:18:57,789
say okay so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I got a bit of a confession</font>

500
00:18:55,840 --> 00:19:00,730
to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> i am i'm into Lewis Carroll</font>

501
00:18:57,789 --> 00:19:03,070
George Lucas cross over fanfic I like

502
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:04,720
lose Carol poems but I don't like all

503
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:06,490
the nonsense words that he puts in there

504
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:08,169
that just don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean anything I want</font>

505
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:10,299
them<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be grounded in some kind of</font>

506
00:19:08,169 --> 00:19:12,789
reality<font color="#E5E5E5"> perhaps in a galaxy far far away</font>

507
00:19:10,299 --> 00:19:14,440
or their nonsense words<font color="#CCCCCC"> are actual real</font>

508
00:19:12,789 --> 00:19:16,149
things I've seen on a screen before and

509
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:19,299
there's cannon behind it means something

510
00:19:16,149 --> 00:19:21,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">and passionate about that so let's give</font>

511
00:19:19,299 --> 00:19:23,799
Jabberwocky the George Lucas

512
00:19:21,549 --> 00:19:25,389
han shot first treatment<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to</font>

513
00:19:23,799 --> 00:19:27,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">change all these borrow gouves does</font>

514
00:19:25,389 --> 00:19:29,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">anybody know what those are no well</font>

515
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:31,689
let's change midi-chlorians does anybody

516
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:33,970
know those are but doesn't matter but

517
00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:36,489
they sound cooler it's plausible right

518
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:38,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">ok so I made for substitutions of four</font>

519
00:19:36,489 --> 00:19:40,200
lines now jabberwockies getting

520
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:43,389
somewhere it's about midi-chlorians

521
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:44,860
that's that's that's good guys<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right</font>

522
00:19:43,389 --> 00:19:47,619
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm at the end of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all these sections in</font>

523
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:49,479
<font color="#CCCCCC">the file I gotta help command Vince got</font>

524
00:19:47,619 --> 00:19:51,100
really really good documentation and you

525
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:52,840
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to go out to the web to get</font>

526
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:55,178
it this is important point because if

527
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:57,070
you're using them to<font color="#E5E5E5"> fix your your arse</font>

528
00:19:55,179 --> 00:19:59,499
you'll see<font color="#E5E5E5"> your inet d file or your</font>

529
00:19:57,070 --> 00:20:01,539
hosts file or your<font color="#CCCCCC"> dns lookup file your</font>

530
00:19:59,499 --> 00:20:03,309
resolve comfest the one you're fixing

531
00:20:01,539 --> 00:20:05,350
that and you can't go to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the web to get</font>

532
00:20:03,309 --> 00:20:07,029
help files<font color="#CCCCCC"> your kind of hoes right so</font>

533
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:10,748
it's got all that stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> just installed</font>

534
00:20:07,029 --> 00:20:12,279
by default so use it<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so regular</font>

535
00:20:10,749 --> 00:20:13,690
expressions take away they do the stuff

536
00:20:12,279 --> 00:20:16,960
that computers a good<font color="#CCCCCC"> at so you don't</font>

537
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:18,940
have to let's talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about marks but not</font>

538
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,049
those marks marks are like bookmarks

539
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:21,639
these are things that keep track of

540
00:20:20,049 --> 00:20:23,320
where you are in the file it doesn't

541
00:20:21,639 --> 00:20:24,789
<font color="#CCCCCC">change a text file sound like you put a</font>

542
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:26,350
comment in the file like I usually do

543
00:20:24,789 --> 00:20:29,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">this as book market something that's</font>

544
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:31,299
internal to them and if if VI and vim

545
00:20:29,799 --> 00:20:32,470
can keep track of where you are in the

546
00:20:31,299 --> 00:20:34,239
file then you can use that<font color="#E5E5E5"> to your</font>

547
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:36,070
advantage and then tell it to do stuff

548
00:20:34,239 --> 00:20:38,109
based on that what I mean right here

549
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:39,759
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually traditional VI this is</font>

550
00:20:38,109 --> 00:20:41,710
the same source code that bill joy

551
00:20:39,759 --> 00:20:43,539
originally wrote it since been open

552
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:46,539
source and it's been ported to build on

553
00:20:43,539 --> 00:20:48,369
Linux so for historical purposes it's

554
00:20:46,539 --> 00:20:49,869
kind of fun just kind of fun<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go back</font>

555
00:20:48,369 --> 00:20:52,090
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> see how much of this new vin stuff</font>

556
00:20:49,869 --> 00:20:54,340
still works even back in the day<font color="#E5E5E5"> well</font>

557
00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:56,619
set a mark<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'll set a mark here marks</font>

558
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:58,269
have names one character names you've

559
00:20:56,619 --> 00:20:59,799
got 26 letters on the keyboard so

560
00:20:58,269 --> 00:21:02,049
there's 26 marks you can use my default

561
00:20:59,799 --> 00:21:04,899
type<font color="#E5E5E5"> em and then the name of the mark so</font>

562
00:21:02,049 --> 00:21:08,499
<font color="#CCCCCC">i'll set mark a right there and over</font>

563
00:21:04,899 --> 00:21:11,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">here i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to put mark be to jump to</font>

564
00:21:08,499 --> 00:21:12,970
a mark use a single quote command single

565
00:21:11,379 --> 00:21:15,009
quote a takes me back to the line where

566
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:17,830
my a mark is single quote be puts me

567
00:21:15,009 --> 00:21:19,809
down here on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the be line if i want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go</font>

568
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:21,759
back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the exact character cell that i</font>

569
00:21:19,809 --> 00:21:24,340
set the mark in that's the other single

570
00:21:21,759 --> 00:21:26,649
quote your back tick backtick be puts me

571
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:28,480
back on that s which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is where</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i set the</font>

572
00:21:26,649 --> 00:21:29,889
mark<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright well</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's kind of useful</font>

573
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,480
you just got to<font color="#E5E5E5"> remember what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mark</font>

574
00:21:29,889 --> 00:21:33,969
you're using but the real powerful thing

575
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:34,960
is that you can tell them to do stuff

576
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:37,840
based on those mar

577
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:39,490
works and vim has actually been setting

578
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:42,789
marks for you you probably didn't even

579
00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:44,799
know it useful marks the square bracket

580
00:21:42,789 --> 00:21:46,600
marks the opening square bracket marks

581
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:49,029
the point where you first made a change

582
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:50,770
or yanked text for that matter than the

583
00:21:49,029 --> 00:21:52,539
other square bracket marks the end of

584
00:21:50,770 --> 00:21:53,799
that region so if you paste in a big

585
00:21:52,539 --> 00:21:55,570
block attacks and you need to do

586
00:21:53,799 --> 00:21:57,190
something to that block a taxi pasted in

587
00:21:55,570 --> 00:21:59,260
you can tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> them what you're talking</font>

588
00:21:57,190 --> 00:22:01,929
about you start a command<font color="#E5E5E5"> you say single</font>

589
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:03,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">quote that brace single quote this other</font>

590
00:22:01,929 --> 00:22:05,950
brace and they tell what<font color="#E5E5E5"> command you</font>

591
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:10,990
want and it'll do it well I set the a

592
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:15,580
mark<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the B mark they don't have that</font>

593
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:18,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">in this I was embarrassing I'll invent</font>

594
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:19,928
the stuff that I marked previously I

595
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:21,490
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to be looking at it could be</font>

596
00:22:19,929 --> 00:22:22,899
scrolled way off the screen it could

597
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:24,279
have been something I did<font color="#CCCCCC"> 20 minutes ago</font>

598
00:22:22,899 --> 00:22:26,770
as long as those marks are still valid

599
00:22:24,279 --> 00:22:30,610
VI can find them and it can operate on

600
00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:31,929
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> text so you guys when setting those</font>

it's typing heaven forbid i'm in a text

609
00:22:45,789 --> 00:22:49,000
right the great thing about these

of the above-mentioned methods<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay you</font>

615
00:22:57,309 --> 00:23:02,980
can give a command a range of lines to

616
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:04,870
operate on and you can you tell it line

617

numbers you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can use the marks that</font>

618

you've been setting you can use<font color="#CCCCCC"> regular</font>

expressions you don't even have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have</font>

622
00:23:11,049 --> 00:23:15,490
tell the editor to operate on it say

623
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:21,010
from here until the next time you see

624
00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:23,289
this word do something so last week so

625
00:23:21,010 --> 00:23:25,210
so I had a directory of all my Lewis

626
00:23:23,289 --> 00:23:27,730
Carroll George Lucas cross over fanfic

627
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:30,840
and I got a guest account on one of my

628
00:23:27,730 --> 00:23:33,340
computers and one of my guests logged in

629
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:35,020
elevated the privileges and they deleted

630
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:36,549
all my fanfic and it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> totally</font>

631
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:38,950
devastated I don't know why someone

632
00:23:36,549 --> 00:23:40,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">would do that first of all but this</font>

633
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:42,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">person</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was a bit of a noob they didn't</font>

634
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:44,320
cover the tracks very well I got<font color="#CCCCCC"> their</font>

635
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:45,520
bash history file so I've got a time

636
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:48,850
stamp I know when they committed the

637
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:50,620
crime<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok it was around this time they</font>

638
00:23:48,850 --> 00:23:52,270
it I don't know which one of my users it

639
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:53,889
was because if they all log<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the</font>

640
00:23:52,270 --> 00:23:56,680
same guest account but if I got the last

641
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:58,690
log I can see what I<font color="#E5E5E5"> Pia just logged in</font>

642
00:23:56,680 --> 00:24:01,140
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time I'll know if I need to slam</font>

643
00:23:58,690 --> 00:24:04,060
the ban hammer down on problem is these

644
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:06,670
timestamps aren't exactly readable<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

645
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:07,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">right so what we're going to do here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

646
00:24:06,670 --> 00:24:10,330
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to run this command it's going to</font>

647
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:12,760
go from the current line plus<font color="#CCCCCC"> two so the</font>

648
00:24:10,330 --> 00:24:15,010
first time stamp line down to from the

649
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:16,870
current line plus 76 which is the end of

650
00:24:15,010 --> 00:24:19,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">this region</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to run this a</font>

651
00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:23,050
gnarly looking substitute command on it

652
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:24,700
but what this does that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably worse</font>

653
00:24:23,050 --> 00:24:26,680
you can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> see at the bottom what this is</font>

654
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:29,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to do is going to find a digit</font>

655
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:31,420
followed by a hash sign and substitute

656
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:33,550
it with the output of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> SCR f time</font>

657
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:35,500
built in vim function so it's going to

658
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:38,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">take the UNIX epoch time turn it into</font>

659
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:41,190
something that I can read then I'm going

660
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:44,979
<font color="#CCCCCC">to band somebody ok so now these are all</font>

661
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:47,170
readable so go back to shell code and I

662
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:49,810
can see the crime happened around 12

663
00:24:47,170 --> 00:24:51,820
10pm on the fifteenth of<font color="#E5E5E5"> March so now</font>

664
00:24:49,810 --> 00:24:55,720
all i gotta do is see who is logged in

665
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:58,450
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> i would prosecute</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> them oh yeah dare</font>

666
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:59,830
they all right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want one of the</font>

667
00:24:58,450 --> 00:25:00,850
tricks i just did back there<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'll show</font>

668
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:02,320
you this real quick because editing

669
00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:04,240
these command lines is fun but you're

670
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:05,649
into them you expect to do some<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff</font>

671
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:08,290
but on the command line at the bottom

672
00:25:05,650 --> 00:25:10,540
it's kind of more<font color="#CCCCCC"> emacs e's control w to</font>

673
00:25:08,290 --> 00:25:11,710
delete a word and that's okay that's

674
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:13,360
that's good in a pinch if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

675
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:15,460
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> something awesome when you're</font>

676
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:16,840
in command line mode hit ctrl f and it's

677
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:19,360
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pop up your complete command</font>

678
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:21,429
history the last 50 or 100 lines<font color="#CCCCCC"> order</font>

679
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:23,050
the default is this is a vim buff or all

680
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:24,550
the vim tricks you know and<font color="#E5E5E5"> love you can</font>

681
00:25:23,050 --> 00:25:26,620
use in here and then when you're done

682
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:28,690
you hit enter and then it's going to

683
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:29,830
execute that command for you so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'll</font>

684
00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:33,780
save you<font color="#CCCCCC"> a ton of time it's a really</font>

685
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:36,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">good that's a really good one registers</font>

686
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:38,139
just like marks vim has been putting

687
00:25:36,370 --> 00:25:40,780
stuff into registers for you you guys

688
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:43,840
know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> registers are these are that</font>

689
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:46,450
in other desktop environments it's the

690
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:51,040
cut<font color="#E5E5E5"> and paste clipboard because there's</font>

691
00:25:46,450 --> 00:25:52,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">only one of them in VI we've got lots of</font>

692
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:54,550
them and a dozens of them but the other

693
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:56,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">awesome thing about them is that you can</font>

694
00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:59,860
tell VI to use the text<font color="#E5E5E5"> in that register</font>

695
00:25:56,950 --> 00:26:02,230
as though it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a VI command so it's a</font>

696
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:02,469
macro<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so this is the really</font>

697
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:05,200
great

698
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:06,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">Park registers are good anytime you</font>

699
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:09,070
delete stuff it goes into<font color="#E5E5E5"> a stack of</font>

700
00:26:06,789 --> 00:26:10,840
registers there's a default register

701
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:12,280
which is you know the one<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you would</font>

702
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:14,080
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> hit the peak</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Amanda pace from</font>

703
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:15,460
that's the double quote anything

704
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:17,230
anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> you'd change like with the</font>

705
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:18,580
delete command or if you yank it's going

706
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:20,500
to go into the default register whose

707
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:22,510
name is double quote but then if you

708
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:24,370
yank stuff there's the zero register

709
00:26:22,510 --> 00:26:26,350
which is the default yank register so

710
00:26:24,370 --> 00:26:28,120
now your text is in two places when you

711
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:29,320
delete stuff it goes into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the double</font>

712
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:31,449
quote register and also goes into

713
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:34,149
register number one and it shifts

714
00:26:31,450 --> 00:26:35,980
register one and register 2 and so on so

715
00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:39,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">write your fingertips you're keeping the</font>

716
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:40,090
last ten things you've deleted<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font>

717
00:26:39,010 --> 00:26:41,408
<font color="#CCCCCC">that comes in really handy if you</font>

718
00:26:40,090 --> 00:26:43,750
accidentally delete too much you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

719
00:26:41,409 --> 00:26:46,630
get it back well you sure can so like

720
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:48,340
marks you use a quote mark to introduce

721
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:49,630
that you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> referring to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a register so</font>

722
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:52,209
it's the double quote when you're

723
00:26:49,630 --> 00:26:54,190
talking about registers but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the cool</font>

724
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:55,419
thing is of these are macros so let's

725
00:26:54,190 --> 00:26:57,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">say I want to do something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's a</font>

726
00:26:55,419 --> 00:27:00,190
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit tricky to do as a regular</font>

727
00:26:57,610 --> 00:27:02,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">expression what I typed out right here</font>

728
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:05,260
are the<font color="#E5E5E5"> VI commands that I would do to</font>

729
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:06,820
do this particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> operation that's not</font>

730
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:09,460
important though because if you hit the

731
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:10,899
cue command and you type the name<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a</font>

732
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:12,100
register you'll say recording in the

733
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:13,390
corner how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you guys have done</font>

734
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:15,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">that accidentally and didn't know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

735
00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:18,909
you're doing type Q again to turn that

736
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:20,379
off so cue the name of a register like

737
00:27:18,909 --> 00:27:22,809
say register a and then you do some

738
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:25,539
stuff like go down three lines and hit Q

739
00:27:22,809 --> 00:27:27,850
if i type at sign a it's going to

740
00:27:25,539 --> 00:27:29,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">execute it's going to take the text</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

741
00:27:27,850 --> 00:27:31,780
register<font color="#CCCCCC"> a and then do it as a VI</font>

742
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:33,939
command so you can show<font color="#CCCCCC"> them what you</font>

743
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:36,220
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do and then tell it to do it</font>

744
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:39,250
again and<font color="#E5E5E5"> again so in this case I got</font>

745
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:40,840
this text here this corresponds to a

746
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:42,429
command to want to do I've got an<font color="#E5E5E5"> escape</font>

747
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:44,559
character right here so it gets out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

748
00:27:42,429 --> 00:27:46,090
insert mode and I type of<font color="#E5E5E5"> J so it goes</font>

749
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:48,428
down<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the next line so I don't even</font>

750
00:27:46,090 --> 00:27:51,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do that again</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> manually so let's</font>

751
00:27:48,429 --> 00:27:54,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">just load this up into register a what I</font>

752
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:55,929
want to do is writing a mail merge or

753
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:57,549
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of my friends and I had you know</font>

754
00:27:55,929 --> 00:27:59,650
personalized greetings at the beginning

755
00:27:57,549 --> 00:28:01,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">of my mail messages but they're a little</font>

756
00:27:59,650 --> 00:28:03,250
bit too honest and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought maybe some</font>

757
00:28:01,929 --> 00:28:04,450
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be offended</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> by that so I</font>

758
00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:05,860
thought I should just change it to

759
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:08,409
something generic and bland and

760
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:10,299
unoffensive probably could have<font color="#CCCCCC"> done</font>

761
00:28:08,409 --> 00:28:12,010
this with a regular<font color="#CCCCCC"> expression but and</font>

762
00:28:10,299 --> 00:28:15,549
us a little bit tricky so i'll just do

763
00:28:12,010 --> 00:28:17,110
the macro thing so if i say at sign a

764
00:28:15,549 --> 00:28:19,929
it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to change the offending word</font>

765
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:23,289
into my good so now<font color="#CCCCCC"> it says hello there</font>

766
00:28:19,929 --> 00:28:26,619
my good fellow well<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> type at sign</font>

767
00:28:23,289 --> 00:28:29,408
a three times all right do I look like a

768
00:28:26,619 --> 00:28:31,449
noob be nice if vim could just remember

769
00:28:29,409 --> 00:28:34,119
the last macro executed so I didn't have

770
00:28:31,450 --> 00:28:37,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">to tell it every time right and it can</font>

771
00:28:34,119 --> 00:28:40,230
so that's at sign at sign a type at sign

772
00:28:37,149 --> 00:28:43,119
a sign remembers the last macro I did

773
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:44,879
but now i'm typing you know two key

774
00:28:43,119 --> 00:28:47,590
strokes<font color="#CCCCCC"> or every one thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i want to do</font>

775
00:28:44,879 --> 00:28:50,109
when I go to the grocery store and I buy

776
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:51,879
stuff at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the checkout register the lady</font>

777
00:28:50,109 --> 00:28:52,960
you know takes my hungry<font color="#E5E5E5"> man meals and</font>

778
00:28:51,879 --> 00:28:55,449
she doesn't scan them all individually

779
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:57,070
she scans the first one types in how

780
00:28:55,450 --> 00:29:00,309
many<font color="#CCCCCC"> there are and then puts them in the</font>

781
00:28:57,070 --> 00:29:02,950
bag what can't my editor do that too

782
00:29:00,309 --> 00:29:04,869
well it sure can<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll just tell it I got</font>

783
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:07,960
six more lines here I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go six at</font>

784
00:29:04,869 --> 00:29:09,639
at and it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do it because</font>

785
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:12,070
remember the last command the last part

786
00:29:09,639 --> 00:29:13,508
<font color="#CCCCCC">of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that macro was the jakey to go down</font>

787
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:14,739
<font color="#CCCCCC">to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> next line so it just</font>

788
00:29:13,509 --> 00:29:16,119
automatically puts the cursor right

789
00:29:14,739 --> 00:29:18,399
where it needs to be and then it does it

790
00:29:16,119 --> 00:29:20,019
that many times<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay start</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking like</font>

791
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:21,580
that you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> job done a</font>

792
00:29:20,019 --> 00:29:24,759
lot easier now<font color="#CCCCCC"> what if you don't know</font>

793
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:26,739
there's six more lines right well you

794
00:29:24,759 --> 00:29:27,820
can just<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell it some crazy big number</font>

795
00:29:26,739 --> 00:29:29,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">and then when it gets to the end of the</font>

796
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:31,149
file or if your command errors out

797
00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:32,440
because you know the command can't work

798
00:29:31,149 --> 00:29:34,418
like you got a regular<font color="#E5E5E5"> expression</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

799
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:35,559
there it'll just bail out they<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

800
00:29:34,419 --> 00:29:36,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">even have to know how many you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> got in</font>

801
00:29:35,559 --> 00:29:39,480
there he<font color="#E5E5E5"> just tell to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it a bunch of</font>

802
00:29:36,909 --> 00:29:42,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">times</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and when it gets done it gets done</font>

803
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:45,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so the point here is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that data is</font>

804
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:47,169
code so let's talk about language

805
00:29:45,009 --> 00:29:48,399
language is important because I mean

806
00:29:47,169 --> 00:29:49,629
everything we do the<font color="#E5E5E5"> computer you can</font>

807
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:50,918
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> of in terms of the language and</font>

808
00:29:49,629 --> 00:29:52,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">how we get our point across to the</font>

809
00:29:50,919 --> 00:29:54,399
computer what we want to do there's a

810
00:29:52,869 --> 00:29:56,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">lot of these new editors coming out you</font>

811
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:58,600
got sublime you got a dumb and they look

812
00:29:56,710 --> 00:30:00,039
really really cool but<font color="#E5E5E5"> they really just</font>

813
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:02,619
miss the point and they're never going

814
00:30:00,039 --> 00:30:03,999
to replace VI because your interaction

815
00:30:02,619 --> 00:30:07,299
with the computer is the important part

816
00:30:03,999 --> 00:30:08,739
not how it looks and they're all still

817
00:30:07,299 --> 00:30:10,720
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> using the mouse and you got a</font>

818
00:30:08,739 --> 00:30:12,039
point and highlight and click and let me

819
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:14,289
let's<font color="#CCCCCC"> be honest how good does that</font>

820
00:30:12,039 --> 00:30:16,299
really work there's UI guidelines for

821
00:30:14,289 --> 00:30:17,408
how big UI elements like buttons are

822
00:30:16,299 --> 00:30:18,789
supposed to be because if they're too

823
00:30:17,409 --> 00:30:20,559
small people have a hard time clicking

824
00:30:18,789 --> 00:30:23,590
them now you want people<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put their</font>

825
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:25,450
cursor onto a character in their text

826
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:26,499
file and if there any you know their

827
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:27,909
eyesight sending good at all they're

828
00:30:26,499 --> 00:30:28,630
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be using a tiny font so they</font>

829
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:32,080
can see a lot

830
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:34,030
come on<font color="#CCCCCC"> guys the reason that VI is never</font>

831
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:36,899
going away the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason it's been around</font>

832
00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:39,700
for 40 years is because it's a language

833
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:41,170
it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple language and if you</font>

834
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:43,390
understand these basic concepts all

835
00:30:41,170 --> 00:30:45,400
these weird cryptic commands all of a

836
00:30:43,390 --> 00:30:47,320
sudden<font color="#CCCCCC"> makes sense you got three things</font>

837
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:49,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">in this language you've got to count you</font>

838
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:51,399
got<font color="#E5E5E5"> an operator you got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> emotion that's</font>

839
00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:52,720
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> really all there is to it the</font>

840
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:54,010
count parts optional a lot of people

841

842
00:30:54,010 --> 00:30:56,710
one thing at a time but if you're ever

843

<font color="#E5E5E5">doing more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> than one thing at a time</font>

00:30:56,710 --> 00:31:01,720
don't do that thing multiple times tell

845
00:30:59,710 --> 00:31:04,630
VI how many times to do it and let VI do

846

it operator these are some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

commands<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very familiar with</font>

849
00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:12,130
command but you need to type some other

850
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:14,890
key<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make it finish those are</font>

851
00:31:12,130 --> 00:31:17,590
operators and not just commands like the

852
00:31:14,890 --> 00:31:20,560
D command D D takes two characters to

853

from here down a line see where I'm

857
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:30,640
going with this the really<font color="#E5E5E5"> clever bit is</font>

858
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:32,680
the motion you've got lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of ways in VI</font>

859
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:34,720
to position the cursor where you want to

860
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:36,760
be because it's aware that text has

861
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:39,400
things like words and lines and

862
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:41,410
sentences and paragraphs if we've got

863
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:42,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">names and concepts and words for these</font>

864
00:31:41,410 --> 00:31:44,890
things shouldn't the editor have a

865
00:31:42,970 --> 00:31:46,750
notion what these things are and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

866
00:31:44,890 --> 00:31:48,400
the part of VI that really makes a

867
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:50,500
brilliant because you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can have these</font>

868
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:52,360
basic things you need to do to text you

869
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:54,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">have basic ways to describe how much</font>

870
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:55,840
text you want to refer<font color="#CCCCCC"> to and then you</font>

confuse anybody there<font color="#E5E5E5"> accepts just so</font>

874
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:04,570
hard anything that you're using to move

875
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:07,230
the cursor pretty much counts as a

876
00:32:04,570 --> 00:32:10,659
motion so marks that we talked about

877
00:32:07,230 --> 00:32:13,030
that's emotion regular expressions act

878
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:15,610
as a motion<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this context our beloved</font>

hjkl keys this is the part that makes

880
00:32:15,610 --> 00:32:20,080
them awesome because they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not just</font>

moving<font color="#E5E5E5"> the cursor it tells VI where you</font>

quote from a man jef raskin computer

885
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:29,290
shall not waste your time or require you

to do more work than is strictly

887
00:32:29,290 --> 00:32:34,000
necessary is your editor wasting your

888
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:37,450
time is it<font color="#CCCCCC"> making you do more work than</font>

necessary for not using<font color="#CCCCCC"> VI probably is</font>

saying so remember CEO em count operator

them and he'll put<font color="#CCCCCC"> it in and then when</font>

906
00:33:14,890 --> 00:33:18,429
the bug reports start rolling in they're

907

long gone they're not maintaining it so

he's got all this other stuff that<font color="#E5E5E5"> he</font>

gets to maintain on top of already being

910
00:33:22,179 --> 00:33:26,050
a big project so he's kind of gotten a

911
00:33:24,730 --> 00:33:27,460
little bit reluctant to make big

912
00:33:26,050 --> 00:33:29,260
sweeping changes over the years and

913
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:30,850
that's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of gotten some people</font>

914
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:34,240
in the community fed up and tired so

915
00:33:30,850 --> 00:33:36,129
last year a guy named<font color="#CCCCCC"> tiago</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> d ahuda made</font>

916
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:38,200
a bounty source project he wanted to

917
00:33:36,130 --> 00:33:40,420
fork them and do some really radical and

918
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:41,650
drastic things to it when he started out

919
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:43,600
I really didn't think it was going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go</font>

920
00:33:41,650 --> 00:33:44,860
anywhere but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm willing to eat my hat</font>

921
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:46,330
because in the last month or<font color="#E5E5E5"> two they</font>

922
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:48,490
really come a long ways and have gotten

<font color="#E5E5E5">it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going pretty</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good so it's called neo</font>

00:33:48,490 --> 00:33:52,150
vim they've<font color="#E5E5E5"> done a lot of neat things</font>

925
00:33:50,250 --> 00:33:54,220
you're cleaning up the code they're

926
00:33:52,150 --> 00:33:56,470
using some<font color="#CCCCCC"> more modern libraries to</font>

927
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:59,140
abstract certain things out make it<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

928
00:33:56,470 --> 00:34:01,210
know more cross-platform downside is

929
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:02,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">their cross-platform libraries aren't on</font>

930
00:34:01,210 --> 00:34:04,780
all the platforms so some of the

931
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:06,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">platforms</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> them on new ovens not</font>

932
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:08,320
ever going to be supported on some bit

933
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:10,480
miffed about that but they're just rakul

934
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:13,090
things like in the tty layer you can

935
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:14,918
distinguish control I from tab so you

936
00:34:13,090 --> 00:34:17,649
can use<font color="#CCCCCC"> control I in a mapping in the</font>

937
00:34:14,918 --> 00:34:19,299
console<font color="#E5E5E5"> that'll</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> work in G VIN but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if you</font>

938
00:34:17,649 --> 00:34:21,219
do in the console the console just sees

939
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:22,659
it as a tab character so they're doing

940
00:34:21,219 --> 00:34:23,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">some cool stuff definitely</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> worth</font>

941
00:34:22,659 --> 00:34:26,020
checking out if you're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> afraid of</font>

942
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:28,179
building your<font color="#CCCCCC"> own software on this bit</font>

943
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:30,129
alpha e right now just<font color="#E5E5E5"> be aware of that</font>

944
00:34:28,179 --> 00:34:32,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">but it's pretty neat it's going</font>

945
00:34:30,129 --> 00:34:34,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">somewhere alright so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> let's talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

946
00:34:32,889 --> 00:34:36,669
some external tools some external

947
00:34:34,750 --> 00:34:39,810
programs how many of you know a<font color="#CCCCCC"> UNIX</font>

948
00:34:36,668 --> 00:34:44,949
system you're comfortable<font color="#CCCCCC"> there alright</font>

949
00:34:39,810 --> 00:34:46,690
so vir sorry them it's a compound among

950
00:34:44,949 --> 00:34:48,189
other components it's designed to work

951
00:34:46,690 --> 00:34:50,590
well with stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's already on your</font>

952
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:53,230
computer instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of being a kitchen sink</font>

953
00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:54,730
ide and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'll be all kind of a big blow</font>

954
00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:56,179
deprogram got all these great<font color="#E5E5E5"> programs</font>

955
00:34:54,730 --> 00:34:58,190
are in computer so then

956
00:34:56,179 --> 00:35:00,500
should work with them that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> VI way</font>

957
00:34:58,190 --> 00:35:03,020
work in harmony we can pull in text from

958
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:04,730
another file with the read command but

959
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:06,559
as you know on unix we consider just

960
00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:09,619
about anything a file it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy</font>

961
00:35:06,559 --> 00:35:12,140
to pull in the contents of a command so

962
00:35:09,619 --> 00:35:14,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">i can read in for example</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this LS</font>

963
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:16,790
command I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see how many types of</font>

964
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:20,599
syntax them can highlight out of the box

965
00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:21,920
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll just run this command 582 more</font>

966
00:35:20,599 --> 00:35:23,510
lines in<font color="#CCCCCC"> my file so there's at least</font>

967
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:25,640
five hundred and eighty two types of

968
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:28,309
syntax of them just out of the box

969
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:29,720
vanilla will highlight what I think is

970
00:35:28,309 --> 00:35:31,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">always really cute when I go to the</font>

971
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:34,759
editor and go to their syntax menu and

972
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:36,500
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a couple dozen entries for</font>

973
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:39,609
some reason I'm writing a script and for

974
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:43,220
some reason if I needed b-sides dot orgs

975
00:35:39,609 --> 00:35:45,380
IP address in my script I could just not

976
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:47,149
go to another X term and run nslookup

977
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:48,619
and cut<font color="#E5E5E5"> and paste it back in I'll just</font>

978
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:50,540
do it in here cuz i'm already in vim and

979
00:35:48,619 --> 00:35:53,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">starting on unix we're really blurring</font>

the line between text<font color="#E5E5E5"> and files on a</font>

983
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:01,490
other way but if I got some text in my

984
00:35:59,319 --> 00:36:03,259
text file or whatever i'm editing right

985
00:36:01,490 --> 00:36:05,149
now I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to push it out to another</font>

986
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:06,920
program process it and then bring it

987
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:13,250
back in well that's what the bank

988
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:15,049
command does I can do stuff like run

989

00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:37,640
highlight the snippet and then paste it

997
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:39,260
in the chat window then I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

998
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:45,109
what a muggle would do I'm better<font color="#E5E5E5"> than</font>

999
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:47,720

1002
00:36:50,119 --> 00:36:54,859
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> anybody want to go to that website</font>

1003
00:36:51,530 --> 00:37:04,160
and tell me if that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really what what's</font>

1004
00:36:54,859 --> 00:37:07,049
there I'll screw it i'll just do it oh I

1005
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:10,230
was embarrassing<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

1006
00:37:07,050 --> 00:37:16,680
oh you don't believe me you guy just hit

1007
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:21,510
undo right yeah so look<font color="#E5E5E5"> what i just did</font>

1008
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:23,040
there I made a mapping because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I like to</font>

1009
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:24,960
type out a command like I'm going to

1010
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:26,730
type it on the shell I do that very

1011
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:29,760
often so I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> made this mapping that</font>

1012
00:37:26,730 --> 00:37:31,410
alum take the<font color="#E5E5E5"> text put my shell in front</font>

1013
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:32,670
of it and then the tech so basically

1014
00:37:31,410 --> 00:37:34,620
it's like passing this command to my

1015
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:36,810
Sheldon runs that and puts the output

1016
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:40,170
back into my editor so I saw<font color="#CCCCCC"> this guy</font>

1017
00:37:36,810 --> 00:37:43,080
right down here no remap capital Q bang

1018
00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:44,910
bang<font color="#CCCCCC"> SH and bang bang says take the</font>

1019
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:46,980
current line as a normal mode command

1020
00:37:44,910 --> 00:37:48,960
basically take the current line and run

1021
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:50,310
it through this command it's my shell so

1022
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:52,230
whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> I type on there like a command</font>

1023
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:53,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">it'll do put that in your vm r see that</font>

1024
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:57,750
will be awesome who knows what the

1025
00:37:53,430 --> 00:37:59,310
capital<font color="#E5E5E5"> Q commanded them does that's</font>

1026
00:37:57,750 --> 00:38:01,500
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thought trust me you won't miss</font>

1027
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:04,350
it I need a list of all the users on my

1028
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:06,660
system BAM capital Q I know how much

1029
00:38:04,350 --> 00:38:08,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">battery life do I have what's the prime</font>

1030
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:11,430
factorization two of<font color="#E5E5E5"> my favoritest</font>

1031
00:38:08,370 --> 00:38:12,600

1032
00:38:11,430 --> 00:38:15,899
hacked again I need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> set</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up a new</font>

1033
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:18,600
password done<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay now if I need to do</font>

1034
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:21,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like a hexadecimal times table</font>

1035
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:23,009
right I know how to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that with unix</font>

1036
00:38:21,390 --> 00:38:24,629
commands<font color="#CCCCCC"> I could</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> write like a one-off</font>

1037
00:38:23,010 --> 00:38:26,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">Python or Perl script to do that but I'm</font>

1038
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:28,110
not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see you seek to print out</font>

1039
00:38:26,610 --> 00:38:31,860
the sequence of<font color="#E5E5E5"> numbers and print after</font>

1040
00:38:28,110 --> 00:38:33,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">for mattamas you know hexadecimal but</font>

1041
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:36,450
you know I really wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a table so</font>

1042
00:38:33,870 --> 00:38:38,430
I pass it<font color="#CCCCCC"> through format and I just</font>

1043
00:38:36,450 --> 00:38:40,859
think there's going to be 16 things on

1044
00:38:38,430 --> 00:38:42,779
the line two characters<font color="#E5E5E5"> four-digit plus</font>

1045
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:44,580
a space that's three characters so we

1046
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:47,070
got 48 characters there's new line at

1047
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:49,890
the end simple math BAM got my times

1048
00:38:47,070 --> 00:38:52,110
table just like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay we're turning</font>

1049
00:38:49,890 --> 00:38:54,180
our text buffer into a text stream and

1050
00:38:52,110 --> 00:38:55,800
we have any other program our computer

1051
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:57,629
that can take<font color="#E5E5E5"> text can manipulate it</font>

1052
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:58,680
plug it back<font color="#E5E5E5"> into what we're doing don't</font>

1053
00:38:57,630 --> 00:39:00,720
need other terminals you don't need to

1054
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:07,129
cut and paste anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right it's</font>

1055
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:07,129
the way<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> guys wow what did I do</font>

1056
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:23,229
let's guess

1057
00:39:11,079 --> 00:39:25,089
comes on slide 40<font color="#CCCCCC"> pretty good guess all</font>

1058
00:39:23,229 --> 00:39:27,640
right this<font color="#E5E5E5"> way I wanted me do the splits</font>

1059
00:39:25,089 --> 00:39:30,519
it's not uncomfortable it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not awkward</font>

1060
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:32,049
guys promise splitting windows this is

1061
00:39:30,519 --> 00:39:33,819
when the greatest features of<font color="#CCCCCC"> them is</font>

1062
00:39:32,049 --> 00:39:35,529
very flexible a lot of other editors on

1063
00:39:33,819 --> 00:39:37,150
visual studio they let you split it like

1064
00:39:35,529 --> 00:39:39,369
down the middle or maybe down the<font color="#CCCCCC"> middle</font>

1065
00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:42,700
this way or some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them like do a grid</font>

1066
00:39:39,369 --> 00:39:44,469
and it's very very confining there's

1067
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:46,269
like a tiling window manager you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

1068
00:39:44,469 --> 00:39:48,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">open the same file in five different</font>

1069
00:39:46,269 --> 00:39:50,379
places at once or you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can open five</font>

1070
00:39:48,190 --> 00:39:52,209
different files in five little views at

1071
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:54,910
once Tim doesn't care it puts it up

1072
00:39:52,209 --> 00:39:56,558
there the way you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do that is the control</font>

1073
00:39:54,910 --> 00:39:58,598
w command puts it kind of in the sub

1074
00:39:56,559 --> 00:40:00,999
mode where the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> character refers to</font>

1075
00:39:58,599 --> 00:40:02,349
some window operation now a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

1076
00:40:00,999 --> 00:40:04,390
commands<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you're already familiar</font>

1077
00:40:02,349 --> 00:40:06,400
with like moving the cursor up down left

1078
00:40:04,390 --> 00:40:07,868
and right well naturally if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

1079
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:11,319
go to the window above<font color="#CCCCCC"> you'd use control</font>

1080
00:40:07,869 --> 00:40:13,269
WK to go up and it's like a tiling

1081
00:40:11,319 --> 00:40:16,089
window manager<font color="#E5E5E5"> this point super useful</font>

1082
00:40:13,269 --> 00:40:19,058
so I got two windows here I can do<font color="#CCCCCC"> ctrl</font>

1083
00:40:16,089 --> 00:40:21,819
w<font color="#CCCCCC"> down to go here control WV to make a</font>

1084
00:40:19,059 --> 00:40:24,789
new vertical split control<font color="#CCCCCC"> WS to split</font>

1085
00:40:21,819 --> 00:40:28,509
yet again i can say split I don't know

1086
00:40:24,789 --> 00:40:32,019
proc partitions and take a look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1087
00:40:28,509 --> 00:40:34,959
file control WC will close whatever

1088
00:40:32,019 --> 00:40:36,598
window my cursors in control wo will

1089
00:40:34,959 --> 00:40:39,819
make my current window the only window

1090
00:40:36,599 --> 00:40:41,019
it's really really great especially if

1091
00:40:39,819 --> 00:40:42,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">you've got a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> nice big monitor and you</font>

1092
00:40:41,019 --> 00:40:43,930
got a nice small font you can see

1093
00:40:42,670 --> 00:40:46,029
everything you need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see all at once</font>

1094
00:40:43,930 --> 00:40:47,529
so naturally<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to ask hey if</font>

1095
00:40:46,029 --> 00:40:49,989
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> can see two files at the same time can</font>

1096
00:40:47,529 --> 00:40:52,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">I compare them better question can my</font>

1097
00:40:49,989 --> 00:40:55,630
editor compare them for me the answer is

1098
00:40:52,479 --> 00:40:59,819
of course silly so here's the final

1099
00:40:55,630 --> 00:41:02,019
draft<font color="#CCCCCC"> of my improvement to Jabberwocky</font>

1100
00:40:59,819 --> 00:41:04,989
it's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be re-released in stunning</font>

1101
00:41:02,019 --> 00:41:06,848
3d courtesy George Lucas and I've gone

1102
00:41:04,989 --> 00:41:09,579
through and changed all the silly Lewis

1103
00:41:06,849 --> 00:41:11,829
Carroll knocks words for silly George

1104

<font color="#E5E5E5">Lucas knots words and then the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">Jabberwock you see here I replace a jar</font>

1106
00:41:14,109 --> 00:41:17,288
jar binks because if there's anybody

1107
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:20,709
that needs to be decapitated it's that

1108
00:41:17,289 --> 00:41:23,799
guy all the lines that I've changed<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:27,670
color schemes are on a 256-color

terminal you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get better color</font>

1113
00:41:27,670 --> 00:41:31,330
schemes in this this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is just vanilla out</font>

1114
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:33,070
of the box but<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I needed to</font>

1115
00:41:31,330 --> 00:41:34,480
put changes from this buffer to the

1116
00:41:33,070 --> 00:41:36,880
other one you got commands to do that I

1117
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:38,800
can do DP to push the difference over to

1118
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:40,750
the other side or if I<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do the</font>

1119
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:43,990
other sense i can say do to pull the

1122
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:48,940
will tell you a few more of those

1123
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:53,590
commands it's really good way to manage

1124
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:55,270
emerges visualization visual mode it's

1125
00:41:53,590 --> 00:41:57,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting because VI itself was a</font>

1127
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:02,230
then we've got yet another visual mode

1128
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:03,640
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is how we highlight text it's a</font>

1129
00:42:02,230 --> 00:42:06,130
really convenient and flexible way to

1130
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:09,160
select blocks of text that<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't quite</font>

1131
00:42:06,130 --> 00:42:11,710
fit into the normal um like operator

1132
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:13,060
motion like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of emotion it's</font>

1133
00:42:11,710 --> 00:42:15,250
and it's also kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> nice sometimes</font>

1134
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:17,620
just to see what you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing it's also</font>

1135
00:42:15,250 --> 00:42:19,960
the only way to select a block attacks

1136
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:22,270
like a rectangle of text a lot of these

1137
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:23,800
are new trendy editors have multiple

1138
00:42:22,270 --> 00:42:26,320
cursors now that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> new must-have</font>

1139
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:28,000
feature and they're a little bit muggy

1140
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:30,790
and their implementation so I don't

1141
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:32,770
favor it a whole lot but also all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1142
00:42:30,790 --> 00:42:34,960
stuff that they do with multiple cursors

1143
00:42:32,770 --> 00:42:37,360
we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been able to do in them at least</font>

1144
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:39,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">since vim version 3 with visual block</font>

1145
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:40,630
mode or the plain old substitute command

1146
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:42,760
so let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me show</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you some of the stuff</font>

1147
00:42:40,630 --> 00:42:45,040
that they like to do come over<font color="#E5E5E5"> here and</font>

keystrokes or another thing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font>

1152
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:56,980
do with multiple cursors is I want to

1153
00:42:54,850 --> 00:42:59,230
add<font color="#CCCCCC"> another different expression into</font>

1154
00:42:56,980 --> 00:43:02,920
this array dereference operation well

1157
00:43:06,370 --> 00:43:09,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">cases and I'll show you on the cool</font>

1158
00:43:07,870 --> 00:43:11,799
videos I mean I gotta admit multiple

1159
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:13,629
cursors is kind of fun it does<font color="#CCCCCC"> feel cool</font>

1160
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:16,030
to see I type one character but like a

1161
00:43:13,630 --> 00:43:17,020
dozen enter into the text that looks

1162
00:43:16,030 --> 00:43:18,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">really cool it makes you feel pretty</font>

1163
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:20,650
awesome but when you use<font color="#CCCCCC"> it for a little</font>

1164
00:43:18,430 --> 00:43:22,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">while you kind of realize in making it</font>

1165
00:43:20,650 --> 00:43:24,160
look pretty it's just really not it's

1166
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:25,629
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> not actually that useful you know</font>

than a regular expression<font color="#CCCCCC"> search because</font>

1169
00:43:27,310 --> 00:43:32,259
you got to hit ctrl D a whole bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1170
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:33,640
times or like old f3 or something it's

1171
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:35,770
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> really slow to the implementation</font>

1172
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:37,910
if you get a big log file like the ones

1173
00:43:35,770 --> 00:43:41,030
i hack on it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just painful but</font>

any dang ways vzyal block mode you guys

you're invisible block mode you select

1178
00:43:47,630 --> 00:43:51,410
some text you got a beginning point and

1179
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:53,089
an ending point if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> use capital I to</font>

1180
00:43:51,410 --> 00:43:54,109
move the cursor usually it's going to

00:43:53,089 --> 00:43:55,849
take you<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> beginning</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the line</font>

visual block mode it takes it to the

1183
00:43:55,849 --> 00:44:00,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">beginning of the block so you can</font>

1184
00:43:57,319 --> 00:44:02,599
prepend a text to your selection then

1185
00:44:00,170 --> 00:44:04,520
analogously capital a takes it to the

00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:10,250
end of the line I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just point that out</font>

because little<font color="#E5E5E5"> I and little a don't</font>

right there good you can read you got

laziness hubris and impatience as a

1199

<font color="#E5E5E5">have because they lead you to think</font>

1201
00:44:38,329 --> 00:44:41,299
about having<font color="#CCCCCC"> the computer do all that</font>

00:46:39,050 --> 00:46:42,710
going to be hitting escape too much and

1260
00:46:40,490 --> 00:46:44,868
typing w kool n WQ and all your files

1261
00:46:42,710 --> 00:46:46,910
for the point here<font color="#E5E5E5"> is you're making it</font>

1262
00:46:44,869 --> 00:46:48,650
in the muscle memory once you've learned

1263
00:46:46,910 --> 00:46:50,149
it you don't need to relearn it's just

1264
00:46:48,650 --> 00:46:51,859
like riding a bike<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't have to</font>

1265
00:46:50,150 --> 00:46:53,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">think about it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> anymore and that's the</font>

00:46:51,859 --> 00:46:54,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">part of the learning curve that well</font>

1267
00:46:53,329 --> 00:46:55,970
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a learning curve i like to call</font>

1268
00:46:54,650 --> 00:46:57,319
it the experience curve because once

1269
00:46:55,970 --> 00:46:59,750
you've got that experience you're not

1270
00:46:57,319 --> 00:47:01,869
thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it anymore then it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

1271
00:46:59,750 --> 00:47:03,890
a problem is automatic it's a reflex

1272
00:47:01,869 --> 00:47:05,720
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> i noticed with a lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

1273
00:47:03,890 --> 00:47:07,750
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are good at them</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'll get to this</font>

1274
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:09,680
point on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the chart and they'll stop</font>

1275
00:47:07,750 --> 00:47:12,109
usually the point<font color="#E5E5E5"> where they learned the</font>

1276
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:13,640
redo operator they can hit dot and tell

1277
00:47:12,109 --> 00:47:15,859
them to redo the same thing they<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

1278
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:17,299
did but you know somewhere else and they

1279
00:47:15,859 --> 00:47:18,859
think oh my goodness I'm so much better

1280
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:20,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">than I'll ever be with notepad and they</font>

1281
00:47:18,859 --> 00:47:22,790
quit learning don't do that there's a

1282
00:47:20,810 --> 00:47:24,828
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of features in them you've got to</font>

1283
00:47:22,790 --> 00:47:26,089
keep trying them out and you'll you'll

1284
00:47:24,829 --> 00:47:27,800
learn lots of new things you'll always

1285
00:47:26,089 --> 00:47:29,240
progress but it builds on the stuff you

1286
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:30,790
already know so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not even a</font>

1287
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:33,560
difficult thing it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> even hard</font>

1288
00:47:30,790 --> 00:47:35,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright so the last feature the one</font>

1289
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:36,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing I want you to remember from this</font>

1290
00:47:35,119 --> 00:47:38,300
if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't remember anything else</font>

1291
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:40,220
remember this thing and you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

1292
00:47:38,300 --> 00:47:41,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to be so awesome and you'll be</font>

1293
00:47:40,220 --> 00:47:44,149
doing stuff so<font color="#E5E5E5"> much faster let's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

1294
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:47,329
talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it text objects who's heard</font>

1295
00:47:44,150 --> 00:47:49,579
of text objects<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay perfect i'm gonna</font>

1296
00:47:47,329 --> 00:47:51,770
show you something<font color="#E5E5E5"> new in the in the c</font>

1297
00:47:49,579 --> 00:47:53,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">om scheme of things these kind of fit</font>

1298
00:47:51,770 --> 00:47:55,369
into the motion category but they're not

1299
00:47:53,060 --> 00:47:56,750
motions they don't move the cursor but

1300
00:47:55,369 --> 00:47:58,700
it goes back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the idea that we've got</font>

1301
00:47:56,750 --> 00:48:00,470
names for certain structures and our

1302
00:47:58,700 --> 00:48:02,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">text we've got quoted strings we've got</font>

1303
00:48:00,470 --> 00:48:04,040
brackets we've got blocks of code and

1304
00:48:02,089 --> 00:48:05,759
got tags if we've got names for these

1305
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:08,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">things and we can kind of give a</font>

1306
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:10,620
an idea we<font color="#CCCCCC"> should have our editor</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1307
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:12,390
comprehend text the same way that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

1308
00:48:10,620 --> 00:48:15,240
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we can be speaking the same</font>

1309
00:48:12,390 --> 00:48:16,950
language that's what text objects do so

1310
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:19,379
right here I got a bit of JavaScript and

1311
00:48:16,950 --> 00:48:21,290
pulled off the b-sides<font color="#E5E5E5"> web page I've got</font>

1312
00:48:19,380 --> 00:48:24,120

<font color="#CCCCCC">parentheses I've got some literal</font>

1314
00:48:24,120 --> 00:48:28,410
strings I've got some blocks of text I

1315
00:48:25,950 --> 00:48:31,439
got tags wouldn't it be<font color="#E5E5E5"> nice if I could</font>

1316
00:48:28,410 --> 00:48:34,220
tell them to like delete everything or

1317
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:37,170
highlight everything inside this pocket

1318
00:48:34,220 --> 00:48:38,580
or you know I got this function call<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

1319
00:48:37,170 --> 00:48:40,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to change what's happening in here</font>

1321
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:44,070

them do something<font color="#E5E5E5"> with these / ends and</font>

1326
00:48:50,370 --> 00:48:55,290
I can with the text<font color="#CCCCCC"> object so the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> way it</font>

1327
00:48:52,740 --> 00:48:57,990
works you<font color="#CCCCCC"> give it a operator that's</font>

1334
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:20,400
if it's a parenthesis well type of

00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:26,970
this like index dereference here VA

the square brace in three characters

1341
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:35,580
I've told it to highlight well three

1342
00:49:33,750 --> 00:49:38,820
characters<font color="#E5E5E5"> has a bad example how about</font>

00:49:35,580 --> 00:49:40,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">this block of code VA curly brace now I</font>

1344
00:49:38,820 --> 00:49:45,090
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> just refactor this whole function or</font>

1345
00:49:40,620 --> 00:49:47,040
I don't like XML I<font color="#E5E5E5"> am over like a JSON</font>

1346
00:49:45,090 --> 00:49:53,550
guy or whatever so for me I would just

1347
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:55,950
assume delete it all so d<font color="#E5E5E5"> at4 tag delete</font>

1348
00:49:53,550 --> 00:49:58,740
the tag my life just<font color="#CCCCCC"> got simpler no more</font>

1349
00:49:55,950 --> 00:50:01,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">XML if you guys don't remember anything</font>

1350
00:49:58,740 --> 00:50:04,620
else remember delete all the XML and

1351
00:50:01,590 --> 00:50:06,600
then you<font color="#E5E5E5"> will be a text editing cyborg</font>

1352
00:50:04,620 --> 00:50:07,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">and when you get the hang of text object</font>

1353
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:09,270
I mean it<font color="#E5E5E5"> really feels like you're a</font>

00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:11,010
ghost in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the shell and yours hacking</font>

1355
00:50:09,270 --> 00:50:12,360
away because oh man it's a great feeling

1356
00:50:11,010 --> 00:50:15,120
you didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> even touch the mouse to do</font>

1357
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:16,470
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> that so here at the end of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

I

1360
00:50:17,420 --> 00:50:23,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">realized that VI isn't hard just seems</font>

1361
00:50:20,420 --> 00:50:26,030
hard but it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty simple with</font>

1362
00:50:23,540 --> 00:50:28,279
these 10 features you've got enough idea

1363
00:50:26,030 --> 00:50:30,500
of how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to edit your text you can do it</font>

1364
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:31,730
super efficient super fast the great

1365
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:32,869
thing about a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these features they</font>

1366
00:50:31,730 --> 00:50:34,940
kind of build on each other they

1367
00:50:32,869 --> 00:50:37,910
complement each other it creates<font color="#CCCCCC"> a whole</font>

1368

entire<font color="#E5E5E5"> system that it's not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just a text</font>

1370
00:50:40,460 --> 00:50:43,910
know like you gotten Python or Ruby or

1371
00:50:42,619 --> 00:50:46,040
list where you're just interactively

1372
00:50:43,910 --> 00:50:49,970
editing stuff I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's what VI is</font>

1373
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:51,558
for text pick up new features make it a

1374
00:50:49,970 --> 00:50:53,808
point every week to just find some new

1375
00:50:51,559 --> 00:50:55,430
feature you read a blog or read the help

1376
00:50:53,809 --> 00:50:57,440
file and just<font color="#CCCCCC"> put</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your workflow</font>

1377
00:50:55,430 --> 00:50:59,779
go out of your way to do it if you do it

1378
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:01,910
the mug leeway hit undo and go back and

1379
00:50:59,780 --> 00:51:03,230
do the new<font color="#E5E5E5"> Wizarding way after a week</font>

00:51:04,790 --> 00:51:08,750
in which case you're saving time or it

1383
00:51:07,250 --> 00:51:10,220
doesn't fit your flow and then just move

1384
00:51:08,750 --> 00:51:12,170
on to something else I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> heaven knows</font>

1385
00:51:10,220 --> 00:51:14,779
there's plenty<font color="#CCCCCC"> of features in VI you're</font>

not going to run out<font color="#CCCCCC"> anytime soon but</font>

00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:18,680
before we part now that you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> gotten</font>

your wizard hat and I guess a crystal
