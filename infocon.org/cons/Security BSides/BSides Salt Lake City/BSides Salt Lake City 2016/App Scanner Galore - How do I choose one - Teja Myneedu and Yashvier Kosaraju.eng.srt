00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:23,670
more reliable that go<font color="#E5E5E5"> my name is Stacia</font>

penetration testing background

originally and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I moved in house to</font>

be a security<font color="#CCCCCC"> engineer doing both pen</font>

00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:41,398
running application scanners running the

10
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:44,370
security program for my company hi my

11
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:46,559
name is Josh I was a consultant as well

12
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:49,949
now i work for<font color="#CCCCCC"> bobs where I do</font>

13
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:51,809
application security stuff which ranges

14
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:53,430
from a wide<font color="#CCCCCC"> range of things from</font>

15
00:00:51,809 --> 00:00:54,480
scanning penetration testing and

16
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:59,670
everything that<font color="#E5E5E5"> has to do with our</font>

17
00:00:54,480 --> 00:01:01,800
application so before<font color="#CCCCCC"> I actually get</font>

18
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:04,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">into the talk I'm just curious how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> many</font>

19
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:07,140
of you guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know run a scanner</font>

20
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:09,210
internally within your company or for

21
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:12,659
clients just<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing some sort of pen</font>

22
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:14,908
testing engagements<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay quite a few</font>

23
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:18,439
though so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I assumed like a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of people</font>

24
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:20,610
here would would be interested in

25
00:01:18,439 --> 00:01:23,699
deploying a scanner in some manner

26
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:26,930
either be from a client perspective or

27
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:29,280
internally we personally have had

28
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:31,350
experiences you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know trying to evaluate</font>

29
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:34,650
scanners and deploy them internally and

30
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:37,679
scale these deployments and we learned a

31
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:41,640
lot of lessons the<font color="#E5E5E5"> primary thing though</font>

32
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:45,659
is we thought what are the questions

33
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:47,850
that one needs to<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask before choosing a</font>

34
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:49,950
scanner so the whole point of this talk

35
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:53,309
is to help you ask the right questions

36
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:56,280
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> provide some examples of situations</font>

37
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:59,159
you might face before deploying when you

38
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:01,619
deploy scanner and a few useful tweaks

39
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:03,899
that you you can make to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make your lives</font>

40
00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:05,759
easier because you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know scanners are not</font>

41
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:08,610
really reliable sometimes they crash you

42
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:10,229
use kick off a scanner and<font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> away for</font>

43
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:12,060
two days<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you come</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> back to seeds it</font>

44
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:14,580
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuck like an hour later</font>

45
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:18,660
so just things to watch out for some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

46
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:21,480
some tweaks you know and what this<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font>

47
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:23,730
is not about is not an evaluation of all

48
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:26,579
the scanners out there we did not do any

49
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:28,649
objective evaluation of you know every

50
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:31,319
single scanner the scan coverage or the

51
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:33,300
scan performance or false positives it's

52
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:35,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">definitely not you know a recommendation</font>

53
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:37,620
of this<font color="#CCCCCC"> at the scanner you want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

54
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:41,700
we want you to<font color="#CCCCCC"> ask</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the right questions</font>

55
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:43,019
for yourself and we hope<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we we</font>

56
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:45,869
cover about eighty<font color="#CCCCCC"> percent of the</font>

57
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:47,790
questions everybody needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to ask and and</font>

58
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:50,010
choose the right scanner for you and

59
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:52,560
also it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cost-benefit analysis I</font>

60
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:54,750
know there's some<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good free</font>

61
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,239
open-source scanners but also some which

62
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:59,220
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> like forty thousand dollars a year</font>

63
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:02,489
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> definitely not any endorsement to</font>

64
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:06,690
any particular scanner so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

65
00:03:02,489 --> 00:03:09,720
right into it before even getting to

66
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:11,880
what scanner you want to use I would

67
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:14,010
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to know what your</font>

68
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:17,370
application footprint is like and your

69
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:20,519
company<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is what are the objectives</font>

70
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:22,890
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to achieve when using an</font>

71
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:24,540
application scam security scanner do you

72
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:27,929
want to just find vulnerabilities and

73
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:29,190
fix them I would think<font color="#CCCCCC"> so but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

74
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:31,620
there's different<font color="#E5E5E5"> motivations in</font>

75
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:33,359
different cases some cases the scanners

76
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:35,910
are purely compliance with when somebody

77
00:03:33,359 --> 00:03:38,519
wants<font color="#CCCCCC"> a report and they use scanners</font>

78
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:40,650
which is understandable I ideally as a

79
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:42,329
security<font color="#CCCCCC"> guy I want everybody</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to you</font>

80
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:43,799
know fix all vulnerable ities but you

81
00:03:42,329 --> 00:03:46,889
know risk management is also a thing

82
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:49,560
right and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> sometimes your customers</font>

83
00:03:46,889 --> 00:03:51,540
want you to you know produce some sort

84
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:54,540
of scan report or vulnerability report

85
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:56,429
and then the other<font color="#CCCCCC"> question to ask is</font>

86
00:03:54,540 --> 00:04:00,450
how many applications do you have in

87
00:03:56,430 --> 00:04:02,639
your org and how many of like or do you

88
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:04,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">have only internal apps or do you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have a</font>

89
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:08,069
main product but which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually a web</font>

90
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:09,420
app and how are you<font color="#E5E5E5"> planning</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to use the</font>

91
00:04:08,069 --> 00:04:11,548
scanner do you have dedicated security

92
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:14,250
engineers running these scanners doing

93
00:04:11,549 --> 00:04:16,798
triaging of eliminating false positives

94
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:20,010
and handing over these two engineers or

95
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:22,019
do you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> an engineer actually running</font>

96
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:24,890
the scanner for you and who owns the

97
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:24,890
whole execution process

98
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:31,910
so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first thing you need to ask is</font>

99
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:34,220
what's your deployment model is your

100
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:36,050
application locally hosted is it on the

101
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:39,440
cloud do you have multiple environments

102
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:41,720
like staging a dev of production where

103
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:43,820
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to scan stuff can these</font>

104
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:45,950
environments talk to each other can they

105
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:47,900
talk to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet if they can talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

106
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:51,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">the Internet then you might as well</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font>

107
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:53,388
for a club a scanner<font color="#E5E5E5"> and but the</font>

108
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:56,810
different things you need to consider

109
00:04:53,389 --> 00:04:58,970
when comparing<font color="#E5E5E5"> cloud base to locally</font>

110
00:04:56,810 --> 00:05:01,040
hosted scanners cloud-based scanners or

111
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:03,020
more like point and shoot give it a

112
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:04,760
starting URL give it a set of

113
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:07,609
credentials to authenticate with and

114
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:10,159
then say should it go scans gives you

115
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:11,870
back a result but<font color="#E5E5E5"> with locally hosted</font>

116
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:15,260
scanners you have many<font color="#E5E5E5"> things you can</font>

117
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:17,630
customize you can potentially integrate

118
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:24,889
it within your SSD LC program in a much

119
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:27,080
better way once you decide where to

120
00:05:24,889 --> 00:05:28,820
where to host the scanner or between<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

121
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:30,409
cloud-based and a locally hosted scanner

122
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:32,690
you need to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at art</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

123
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:35,180
authentication how the scanner would be

124
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:36,740
authenticating to your application you

125
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:39,560
would have multiple applications right

126
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:41,060
over<font color="#E5E5E5"> bap a set of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> API is a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mobile</font>

127
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:42,880
application or even multiple mobile

128
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:46,250
applications and they all use different

129
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:48,830
models of authentication some may use

130
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:51,680
tokens cookies HTTP basic auth and

131
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:54,020
whatnot so<font color="#CCCCCC"> before choosing a scanner you</font>

132
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:56,000
need to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> scanner can</font>

133
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:58,549
support all the forms of authentication

134
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,289
your multiple different apps have I mean

135
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:02,450
if it cannot authenticate<font color="#E5E5E5"> to one of your</font>

136
00:06:00,289 --> 00:06:08,750
abs what good is<font color="#CCCCCC"> an unauthenticated</font>

137
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:11,090
scanning and a<font color="#E5E5E5"> deer right so once you</font>

138
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:13,220
make sure that the scanner can

139
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:14,560
authenticate into your application you

140
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:17,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">need to make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it stays</font>

141
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:19,700
authenticated there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> many cases when</font>

142
00:06:17,539 --> 00:06:22,039
scanner is<font color="#E5E5E5"> log in and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then they do</font>

143
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:23,690
something which logs them out within

144
00:06:22,039 --> 00:06:25,610
like five ten minutes<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then the rest</font>

145
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:28,240
of the 24<font color="#E5E5E5"> hour scan it does is</font>

146
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:31,039
unauthenticated that's not as much value

147
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:33,650
many scanners have regex based or

148
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:36,610
pattern matching you need to figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

149
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:38,229
if the pattern matching the

150
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:40,300
scanner has actually applies to your

151
00:06:38,229 --> 00:06:42,938
application and it actually stays logged

152
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:45,129
in if the scanner detects a logout it

153
00:06:42,939 --> 00:06:47,590
needs to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to log back into your</font>

154
00:06:45,129 --> 00:06:50,710
scan into<font color="#E5E5E5"> your application and continue</font>

155
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:53,128
<font color="#E5E5E5">the scan another thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you might want to</font>

156
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:55,750
see is how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many times does it log back n</font>

157
00:06:53,129 --> 00:06:58,300
I've seen some scanners that do not have

158
00:06:55,750 --> 00:07:01,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">a good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> session detection mechanism and</font>

159
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:03,340
to avoid problems because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that you</font>

160
00:07:01,719 --> 00:07:07,599
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep sending log and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> requests like</font>

161
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:09,580
once every five seconds this actually

162
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:11,889
<font color="#CCCCCC">happened to me when I was doing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an evil</font>

163
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:16,389
of different scanners for one of them i

164
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:18,400
had like 35,000 or 40,000 concurrent

165
00:07:16,389 --> 00:07:21,580
sessions live on the test environment

166
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:22,779
and guess what the DB crashed so you

167
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:30,340
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that does not happen</font>

168
00:07:22,779 --> 00:07:32,529
on production also<font color="#E5E5E5"> after I evaluated a</font>

169
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:35,049
few scanners I realized that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the scanner</font>

170
00:07:32,529 --> 00:07:37,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">I was running did not support web</font>

171
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:40,719
sockets which was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a functionality that</font>

172
00:07:37,779 --> 00:07:42,719
our application used so it's it might be

173
00:07:40,719 --> 00:07:45,629
a good<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea for you to check what</font>

174
00:07:42,719 --> 00:07:48,039
protocols your application uses

175
00:07:45,629 --> 00:07:51,460
application layer protocols like speedy

176
00:07:48,039 --> 00:07:56,349
which is one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google's or WebRTC which</font>

177
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:59,138
is usually used for a video or audio and

178
00:07:56,349 --> 00:08:02,490
similarly input formats there are so

179
00:07:59,139 --> 00:08:04,839
many different<font color="#E5E5E5"> input formats JSON XML</font>

180
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:08,199
GWT you might want to just check what

181
00:08:04,839 --> 00:08:11,949
your app uses not all scanners are good

182
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:14,169
at fuzzing you know all protocols or all

183
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:17,319
input formats I've seen some scanners

184
00:08:14,169 --> 00:08:19,448
which are pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> bad at JSON or GWT is</font>

185
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:21,849
that not even supported by many scanners

186
00:08:19,449 --> 00:08:25,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">but it's still one of the input formats</font>

187
00:08:21,849 --> 00:08:28,569
used out there similarly custom test

188
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:31,599
cases so I've seen several scanners

189
00:08:28,569 --> 00:08:34,959
struggle with sso or Sam always flows

190
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:37,569
because there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> whenever there are flows</font>

191
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:39,539
which involve dynamically changing

192
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:43,390
parameters that are not just<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

193
00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:45,880
HTTP request headers or body or sorry

194
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:47,529
HTTP<font color="#CCCCCC"> request URL or body and there's</font>

195
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:50,390
additional parameters that change in the

196
00:08:47,529 --> 00:08:53,000
headers a lot of scanners don't

197
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:56,030
detect these changes and follow the flow

198
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:58,820
so if you can customize your scanner to

199
00:08:56,030 --> 00:09:01,579
follow a specific flow if you can have

200
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:05,660
have it act as<font color="#E5E5E5"> a proxy and then specify</font>

201
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:07,970
which parameters to track that's that

202
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:10,569
will help you continue the automated

203
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:14,240
scan in a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> different</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cases</font>

204
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:16,070
similarly web services I'm I'm not

205
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">really a huge map any scanner really</font>

206
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:21,170
that does a really good job of just

207
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:24,590
taking the web web services visible

208
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:27,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">pilon and does a great job of scanning</font>

209
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:29,240
but there there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are a few different ones</font>

210
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:32,570
which at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> can take a Wizzle file</font>

211
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:39,470
and you know start scan automatically so

212
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:41,330
some some things to watch out for one

213
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:46,730
important thing you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at when</font>

214
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:48,290
evaluating scanners is crawling if the

215
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:50,090
scanner is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to crawl your whole</font>

216
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:51,290
website how is it going to scan how is

217
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:52,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">it going to find one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that abilities</font>

218
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:56,300
right because it does not<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the whole</font>

219
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:58,010
surface area itself when you're looking

220
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:59,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">at the crawl engine of a particular</font>

221
00:09:58,010 --> 00:10:03,350
scanner for multiple things you need to

222
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:05,240
look at these things<font color="#CCCCCC"> will help you a lot</font>

223
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:09,170
and some of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things you might want</font>

224
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:11,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">to look at our does it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> love a user</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

225
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:13,370
specify the starting URL I mean you

226
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:14,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">might not want to start the scan at the</font>

227
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:16,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">homepage but you might want to start it</font>

228
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:19,070
at the login<font color="#E5E5E5"> page where the scanner</font>

229
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:22,810
would authenticate and then we want does

230
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:25,400
it let you do that does the scanner

231
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:27,770
support addition or removal of other

232
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:29,540
domains or sub domains or some specific

233
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:34,490
links you might or might not want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

234
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:36,860
crawl or scan one important feature you

235
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:39,620
might want to see for is manual crawl

236
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:42,350
and by manual crawl I mean the user

237
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:45,110
doing a crawl using a browser and then

238
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:47,210
the scanner listening as a proxy and

239
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:49,880
then recording the whole crawl once

240
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:52,460
you're done with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the manual crawl that</font>

241
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:55,400
would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> the whole map application map</font>

242
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:59,660
that the scanner takes and just scanning

243
00:10:55,400 --> 00:11:02,300
part of it so one thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> highly</font>

244
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:04,850
suggest is when you do like comparison

245
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:07,219
<font color="#CCCCCC">and scanners do not just look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at the end</font>

246
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:09,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">results of how many vulnerabilities that</font>

247
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:12,200
scanner a fine and I'll need<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's kind</font>

248
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:15,140
of be fine you would<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to look at the</font>

249
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:17,210
crawl results and make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that the</font>

250
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:20,510
scanners are finding the same number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

251
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:22,400
unique URLs there are cases when I when

252
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:24,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">a scanner would find the same URL again</font>

253
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:26,930
in a different format and it would<font color="#E5E5E5"> mark</font>

254
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:28,849
it as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> different URL so you might want</font>

255
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:35,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">to watch out for duplication of URLs as</font>

256
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:38,000
well next is the scan engine scan engine

257
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:40,100
is well it's the bread and butter of the

258
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:44,140
whole scanner system right I mean that's

259
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:46,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">what you buy it for for scanning stuff</font>

260
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:48,500
there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of research that has</font>

261
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:50,540
happened on the various can engines

262
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:53,120
being used so we're not<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to go in</font>

263
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:54,949
depth of how different scan engines work

264
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:57,410
and which one<font color="#CCCCCC"> is better which one is not</font>

265
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:59,810
we provide resources at the end you

266
00:11:57,410 --> 00:12:01,880
could look<font color="#E5E5E5"> up the research but there are</font>

267
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:05,869
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> things which you might want to look</font>

268
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:09,200
at for<font color="#CCCCCC"> example say your application is</font>

269
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:12,890
returning a JSON blob and that contains

270
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:15,110
a cross-site scripting payload but the

271
00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:17,300
response current correctly specifies

272
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:19,490
that the content type is<font color="#E5E5E5"> application /</font>

273
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:22,670
JSON does the scanner look at the

274
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:24,920
content type before specifying or before

275
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:28,310
it actually flags that response as a

276
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:29,959
vulnerability specifying that that

277
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:33,979
particular response is vulnerable to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

278
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:35,690
cross-site scripting attack these things

279
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:37,970
would actually save a lot of time

280
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:39,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">because these are a whole bunch of false</font>

281
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:43,970
positives you would not<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to look and</font>

282
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:47,810
evaluate each of them manually another

283
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:52,960
good example I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> which which actually</font>

284
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:56,449
a free well very<font color="#E5E5E5"> local scanner justice</font>

285
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:58,310
so for remote code execution testing

286
00:12:56,450 --> 00:13:01,550
what the scanner does is it has a

287
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:04,520
external server and the RCE payloads

288
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:07,520
that it sends to your application if

289
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:10,610
correctly executed send a ping to this

290
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:12,860
external server and then the scanner

291
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:13,329
talks to the server<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then confirms</font>

292
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:16,779
that the

293
00:13:13,329 --> 00:13:20,618
has been received and then it actually

294
00:13:16,779 --> 00:13:22,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">Flags the vulnerability this way it's</font>

295
00:13:20,619 --> 00:13:29,319
quite certain that it's an actual bug

296
00:13:22,569 --> 00:13:32,410
and not a false positive so we have

297
00:13:29,319 --> 00:13:34,269
covered scanning scanners how they log

298
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:38,469
in how they stay logged in the crawl

299
00:13:34,269 --> 00:13:40,749
engine the actual<font color="#E5E5E5"> scan engine as well so</font>

300
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:42,730
state management is next so by state

301
00:13:40,749 --> 00:13:45,970
management what I mean is how the

302
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:49,989
scanner actually stores the state of the

303
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:52,720
manually tryouts vulnerabilities so by

304
00:13:49,989 --> 00:13:55,689
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I mean is when an engineer or</font>

305
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:58,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">you in your company opens the scanner up</font>

306
00:13:55,689 --> 00:14:01,329
opens up a scan and then mark some of

307
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:04,389
them as false positive or fixed or like

308
00:14:01,329 --> 00:14:08,109
risk apps accepted is this state

309
00:14:04,389 --> 00:14:10,119
reflected among different scams is this

310
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:12,670
reflected among different profiles of

311
00:14:10,119 --> 00:14:14,470
scams as then you might have a light

312
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:17,378
scan you might have a profile for

313
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:19,269
complete invasive<font color="#E5E5E5"> scan something marked</font>

314
00:14:17,379 --> 00:14:21,189
as false positive within an invasive

315
00:14:19,269 --> 00:14:26,860
scan should also reflect among the other

316
00:14:21,189 --> 00:14:28,269
scan profile see you have again another

317
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:32,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing you might want to look for is</font>

318
00:14:28,269 --> 00:14:34,660
dusty scanner let you mark a set<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

319
00:14:32,379 --> 00:14:37,419
vulnerabilities as not applicable to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

320
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:40,799
scan profile for example say you're

321
00:14:37,419 --> 00:14:44,470
scanning your<font color="#CCCCCC"> AP is and the api's use</font>

322
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:46,179
token-based authentication so these api

323
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:48,819
calls would not be vulnerable to see

324
00:14:46,179 --> 00:14:52,360
surf attacks right because they do not

325
00:14:48,819 --> 00:14:57,099
use cookies so in that scan profile can

326
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:59,799
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> mark csrf as non non applicable to</font>

327
00:14:57,100 --> 00:15:01,600
the whole scan<font color="#CCCCCC"> but that feature would</font>

328
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:03,489
actually save you a lot of time because

329
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:06,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">once you mark these things as not</font>

331
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:09,868
would not have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> look at false</font>

332
00:15:07,269 --> 00:15:09,869
positives

333
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:17,560
there are additional features like a

334
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:19,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">light dish mention everything about</font>

335
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:22,268
authentication or session management

336
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:24,430
those are I would<font color="#CCCCCC"> say</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> must have features</font>

337
00:15:22,269 --> 00:15:25,870
but there can be additional features

338
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:28,599
that you are<font color="#E5E5E5"> interested in and</font>

339
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:31,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">compliance checks I would regard them as</font>

340
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:34,440
one of those<font color="#E5E5E5"> bonus features compliance</font>

341
00:15:31,709 --> 00:15:36,638
standards usually are<font color="#E5E5E5"> not very</font>

342
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:39,040
prescriptive right there they just say

343
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:41,470
you have to follow the basic security

344
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:44,800
principles like<font color="#CCCCCC"> Elise privilege but you</font>

345
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:46,810
yourself in your policies the that you

346
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:50,410
define to comply with those standards

347
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:52,930
say hey we want a<font color="#CCCCCC"> 15 minute lockout or</font>

348
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:55,089
account lock door session timeout or a

349
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:57,339
specific password complexity requirement

350
00:15:55,089 --> 00:16:00,160
so we've come across scanners where we

351
00:15:57,339 --> 00:16:02,920
could configure those checks and they

352
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:05,290
can the scanner can also help us stay

353
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:07,630
compliant but if you know you're you're

354
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:10,120
trying to scale your scanner in a large

355
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:11,860
organization with 50 applications it

356
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:14,589
would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> nice to have a scanner</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

357
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:16,480
check these things<font color="#CCCCCC"> in and tell you when</font>

358
00:16:14,589 --> 00:16:21,180
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of compliance instead of you</font>

359
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:24,880
know wait for an auditory to show up

360
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:26,529
similarly other features<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we have</font>

361
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:29,910
seen in scanners<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we thought were</font>

362
00:16:26,529 --> 00:16:33,069
really useful our scan throttle to put a

363
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:34,750
lot of you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know scanners support this</font>

364
00:16:33,069 --> 00:16:36,760
but we've also you know had our

365
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:38,709
applications our QA environment crash

366
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:40,870
because some of the scanners didn't

367
00:16:38,709 --> 00:16:45,969
support throttling or<font color="#E5E5E5"> request timeouts</font>

368
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:48,699
and a report format support<font color="#E5E5E5"> also I guess</font>

369
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:51,100
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is more important</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for consultants</font>

370
00:16:48,699 --> 00:16:53,649
if you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually customize things but</font>

371
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:56,230
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> in house we have used scanners</font>

372
00:16:53,649 --> 00:16:59,889
where we could actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> put in snippets</font>

373
00:16:56,230 --> 00:17:03,900
for remediation guidance for example you

374
00:16:59,889 --> 00:17:06,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">know if you internally have a library to</font>

375
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:10,000
fix cross-site scripting and you just

376
00:17:06,549 --> 00:17:13,150
need to make this method call then<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

377
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:16,270
add that particular snippet that says

378
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:17,260
use this library in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> report and every</font>

379
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:19,418
<font color="#E5E5E5">single</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time you have cross-site</font>

380
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:21,240
scripting you have that so how how much

381
00:17:19,419 --> 00:17:24,410
can you<font color="#CCCCCC"> really customize your report</font>

382
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:25,880
upstream proxy support is a huge one

383
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:28,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">I have personally used this so many</font>

384
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:30,820
times because I use one scanner and I'm

385
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:33,440
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to scan and it's continuously</font>

386
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:35,929
logging out or it's just stopping and

387
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:39,590
it's a session not detected what do i do

388
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:41,930
i chain another proxy<font color="#E5E5E5"> I see what the</font>

389
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:43,790
scanner is sending out so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I used like</font>

390
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:46,820
some some pre proxy<font color="#CCCCCC"> Charles burp</font>

391
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:48,290
whatever you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> and look at what</font>

392
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:50,899
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of ascending and where it</font>

393
00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:54,020
struggling to stay alive in and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

394
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:57,860
do match and replace at a place just<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

395
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:59,930
make<font color="#CCCCCC"> it work so just a tiny hack but it</font>

396
00:17:57,860 --> 00:18:02,409
has saved me a lot of times you know

397
00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:04,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">which is just a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> time and and</font>

398
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:07,220
custom checks like selenium scripts<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

399
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:09,790
any sort of scripting ability within

400
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:12,950
your scanner has been<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> huge help</font>

401
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:15,470
similarly if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can define environments</font>

402
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:16,640
but for example if you can tell your

403
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:17,690
scanner that this is your dev

404
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,580
environment<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is your staging</font>

405
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:23,270
environment and then configure it

406
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:31,610
accordingly you<font color="#CCCCCC"> that will also save you</font>

407
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:40,580
a lot of time so automation who here

408
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:42,290
does<font color="#CCCCCC"> not love outta me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in security</font>

409
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:44,360
everything needs to be automated as much

410
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:48,290
as possible right we want to reduce as

411
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:51,139
much manual work as we can so when you

412
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:56,360
come to automation with scanners it's

413
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:59,270
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a financial com manpower related</font>

414
00:18:56,360 --> 00:19:00,500
decision all the features listed here

415
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:03,200
you would get them in an<font color="#E5E5E5"> enterprise</font>

416
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:05,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">level license but that would cost way</font>

417
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:10,000
more than a basic license with the

418
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:13,760
scheme same scan and crawl engines so

419
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:16,070
it's again a very different question for

420
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:17,690
each enterprise if you have a big enough

421
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:19,899
budget you could go<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> enterprise</font>

422
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:24,460
version but if your budget is limited

423
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:24,460
you would want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go for a basic version</font>

424
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:31,350
and most of these can actually be

425
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:34,240
scripted out based on the command line

426
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:36,189
capabilities of the scanner so if you're

427
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:38,049
low on budget you might want to look for

428
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:40,659
a scanner which has very<font color="#E5E5E5"> good command</font>

429
00:19:38,049 --> 00:19:42,129
line interface capabilities and good API

430
00:19:40,659 --> 00:19:43,779
supports so that you could spend like a

431
00:19:42,129 --> 00:19:47,590
week or<font color="#CCCCCC"> two and automate most of these</font>

432
00:19:43,779 --> 00:19:48,820
things but in<font color="#E5E5E5"> general even if you</font>

433
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:51,789
automate or you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to buy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> these things</font>

434
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:53,470
some things<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to look for with</font>

435
00:19:51,789 --> 00:19:56,499
the scanners or does it have JIRA

436
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:58,539
integration that means can it file

437
00:19:56,499 --> 00:20:00,070
tickets automatically<font color="#E5E5E5"> and once the</font>

438
00:19:58,539 --> 00:20:02,919
ticket is closed can it automatically

441
00:20:05,559 --> 00:20:09,820
with your single sign-on so that you do

not have to worry about authentication

email notifications you might want a

mail notifications when a scan starts

456
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:48,580

before<font color="#E5E5E5"> you choose which sort of</font>

automation features you want these are

<font color="#E5E5E5">some useful tweaks which we have noticed</font>

460
00:20:56,559 --> 00:21:04,658
during our whole play session with

461
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:07,210
scanners that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we had in our respective</font>

462
00:21:04,659 --> 00:21:09,610
organizations so one thing we<font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font>

463
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:11,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">suggest is to just blacklist all log out</font>

464
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:13,539
pages when you're evaluating them

465
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:16,960
because you do not<font color="#CCCCCC"> know how good their</font>

466
00:21:13,539 --> 00:21:18,549
session management engine is and then

467
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:22,179
it's more<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a precautionary measure</font>

468
00:21:18,549 --> 00:21:25,869
right you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to knowingly make</font>

469
00:21:22,179 --> 00:21:28,029
the scanner log out during the scan then

470
00:21:25,869 --> 00:21:30,820
the session management mechanism itself

471
00:21:28,029 --> 00:21:33,090
i would say spend some time on it build

472
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:34,750
a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> regex which covers all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

473
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:37,689
different

474
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:40,630
scenarios so usually<font color="#CCCCCC"> scanners have like</font>

475
00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:42,610
logged in or logged out regex as in a

476
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:44,740
regex matching a pattern which would

477
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:46,179
show only in logged in pages or

478
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:49,000
something which would show only on

479
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:51,070
logged out pages so make sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

480
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:54,250
regex you have covers all the edge cases

481
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:56,710
you might have in your application use a

482
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:59,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">single thread once in a while using a</font>

483
00:21:56,710 --> 00:22:02,950
single thread yes I agree it's painfully

484
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:06,840
long but it would cover more surface

485
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:09,730
area than multi-threaded crawling and

486
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:11,919
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming to custom flows there are</font>

487
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:14,620
some flows which might use different

488
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:16,720
protocols it might be<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a mash-up of</font>

489
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:18,939
things which the crawler might not be

490
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:20,800
intelligent enough to crawl through so

491
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:23,740
you might<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to do a custom flow-based</font>

492
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:26,080
can disregard multiple sessions are

493
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:28,230
multiple flows for different<font color="#CCCCCC"> things and</font>

494
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:32,080
then just integrate it with the scanner

495
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:34,960
defining custom 404 pages that's

496
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:37,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually really important because for</font>

497
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:40,870
scanners only a status code which says

498
00:22:37,570 --> 00:22:42,340
for 400 something<font color="#CCCCCC"> is an error page but</font>

499
00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:45,159
your application might be sending our

500
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:49,240
200 pages with an error message in the

501
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:52,270
body so if you do not define custom

502
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:54,460
pages some things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> can happen is say</font>

503
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:57,520
for example the scanner try<font color="#CCCCCC"> stacy's of</font>

504
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:59,770
attack<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it get it gets back a 200</font>

505
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:02,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay with the body saying there was an</font>

506
00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:03,760
error with the token but that would not

507
00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:06,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">make sense to the scanner</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

508
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:08,590
see the 200 message and then think the

509
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:12,280
attack executed and it would list it as

510
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:14,860
a vulnerability so if you have custom

511
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:18,430
404 pages that would mitigate a lot of

512
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:21,729
false positives then you would want to

513
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:23,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">have logs in your system right this</font>

514
00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:26,020
these are attacks against<font color="#E5E5E5"> product</font>

515
00:23:23,650 --> 00:23:29,560
production or development and things

516
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:32,320
might break once in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a while what I've</font>

517
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:35,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">noticed is having a custom user agent is</font>

518
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:38,679
very easy to enable or a custom header

519
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:40,510
and those are very easy to parse through

520
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:44,920
and locks and make sure what the point

521
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:46,419
of failure was and again using a proxy a

522
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:49,749
stage<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mentioned is a</font>

523
00:23:46,419 --> 00:23:51,359
very good debugging but methodology

524
00:23:49,749 --> 00:23:54,519
which we have followed time and again

525
00:23:51,359 --> 00:23:57,070
but again<font color="#CCCCCC"> with crack of proxies behind</font>

526
00:23:54,519 --> 00:24:01,350
heavy scanners there is a chance they

527
00:23:57,070 --> 00:24:01,350
might crash so just watch out<font color="#CCCCCC"> for that</font>

528
00:24:01,799 --> 00:24:09,129
these are some<font color="#CCCCCC"> things we have noticed go</font>

529
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:11,320
wrong terribly multiple concurrent

530
00:24:09,129 --> 00:24:13,748
sessions so if the session detection

531
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:15,340
mechanism is not good enough<font color="#CCCCCC"> as I</font>

mentioned<font color="#CCCCCC"> before you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> might have multiple</font>

534
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:23,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">because that would put a lot of load on</font>

535
00:24:21,369 --> 00:24:25,988
your database again your application

536
00:24:23,529 --> 00:24:27,460
might behave differently to say a

537
00:24:25,989 --> 00:24:30,039
hundred or two hundred concurrent

538
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:32,559
sessions at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same time then rate</font>

limiters by IP by<font color="#E5E5E5"> username and things</font>

545
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:54,100
how they can go wrong is say for example

546
00:24:49,299 --> 00:24:56,379
you kick off a scan before going home

547
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:59,259
and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> next morning</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you come open</font>

00:24:56,379 --> 00:25:01,539

00:24:59,259 --> 00:25:03,129
limited by IP and guess what your whole

<font color="#E5E5E5">company's rate limited at this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> point</font>

need to capture the scanner cannot do

559
00:25:24,639 --> 00:25:29,709
that some scanners have noticed do have

00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:32,379
an<font color="#CCCCCC"> option where you can set the number</font>

application logs to user out and then

563
00:25:34,899 --> 00:25:40,178
the scanner would not do more than the X

number of bad<font color="#E5E5E5"> attempts before it</font>

actually gives in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the correct password</font>

you guys have played a lot but with

568
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:58,360
scanners but burp suite for example has

569
00:25:55,179 --> 00:26:00,520
a you know a command-line argument where

570
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:03,129
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> change the amount of memory uses</font>

571
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:04,539
similarly there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of other</font>

572
00:26:03,130 --> 00:26:07,659
commercial and opens their scanners to

00:26:04,539 --> 00:26:10,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">that sometimes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually options</font>

575
00:26:10,450 --> 00:26:15,370
to use some command line options but

576
00:26:12,429 --> 00:26:18,039
definitely be aware of memory issues if

577
00:26:15,370 --> 00:26:20,350
you act if you especially are running

578
00:26:18,039 --> 00:26:23,140
scans that run for days you might want

579
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:24,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">to just check that you have allocated</font>

580
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:27,760
sufficient memory to your scanner

581
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:29,110
similarly turn off all notifications in

582
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:31,299
your app this can be<font color="#E5E5E5"> really dangerous</font>

583
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:32,850
because you can flood everybody in your

00:26:31,299 --> 00:26:35,470
organization with a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of emails</font>

585
00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:38,529
depending on what sort of notifications

586
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:41,049
you have configured data destruction is

587
00:26:38,529 --> 00:26:42,909
one classic thing sequel injections can

588
00:26:41,049 --> 00:26:45,700
drop a database even though if you're

589
00:26:42,909 --> 00:26:47,679
testing in your you know QA environment

590
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:50,409
dev environment there there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> still</font>

591
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:52,809
people doing manual testing there so you

592
00:26:50,409 --> 00:26:56,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't want to completely destroy</font>

593
00:26:52,809 --> 00:27:00,100
environments another thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is disk space</font>

594
00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:02,379
constraints be careful of how much disk

595
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:04,029
base your scan is occupying I've seen

596
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:06,460
scans crash just because you haven't

597
00:27:04,029 --> 00:27:08,049
like I<font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't checked before that I</font>

598
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:11,590
have enough disk space for the scanner

599
00:27:08,049 --> 00:27:14,408
to run so basically this like<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're</font>

600
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:16,889
<font color="#CCCCCC">the I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> guess last three slides or things</font>

601
00:27:14,409 --> 00:27:20,559
that we have run<font color="#CCCCCC"> into while running</font>

602
00:27:16,890 --> 00:27:23,440
scanners and we have had hours of

603
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:25,690
productivity loss because this<font color="#E5E5E5"> canner</font>

604
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:27,340
stopped in the middle of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the night for</font>

605
00:27:25,690 --> 00:27:29,640
some reason logged out couldn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> login</font>

606
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:32,678
<font color="#E5E5E5">because they account about locked out or</font>

607
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:36,940
it didn't have enough memory allocated

608
00:27:32,679 --> 00:27:38,590
or I had some drop state or just kind of

609
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:41,409
ransom drop statement which basically

610
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:45,340
dropped the whole database so that's

611
00:27:41,409 --> 00:27:47,159
basically it we this<font color="#E5E5E5"> setup useful</font>

612
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:50,049
resources so there's a couple of

613
00:27:47,159 --> 00:27:53,700
websites<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are papers or that we have</font>

614
00:27:50,049 --> 00:27:56,080
referred<font color="#E5E5E5"> to before to look at scanner</font>

615
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:58,270
comparison there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> one called</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sec tools</font>

616
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,530
sec tools market which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the first you</font>

617
00:27:58,270 --> 00:28:00,420
are

618
00:27:58,530 --> 00:28:03,450
there which actually compares different

619
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:05,340
scanners and and another paper which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

620
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:09,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">believe was presented a couple of years</font>

621
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:11,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">ago</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is actually in a comparison</font>

622
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:13,650
between different types of scanners some

623
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:17,280
of the information is there there is

624
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:22,610
outdated but most of it is is pretty

625
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:22,610
decent that is actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> all we have</font>

626
00:28:41,639 --> 00:28:47,968
yeah but we have uploaded our talk at

627
00:28:44,849 --> 00:28:51,678
that URL and Clive box com2 so do you

628
00:28:47,969 --> 00:28:51,679
want to take a look<font color="#E5E5E5"> or a welcome to</font>
