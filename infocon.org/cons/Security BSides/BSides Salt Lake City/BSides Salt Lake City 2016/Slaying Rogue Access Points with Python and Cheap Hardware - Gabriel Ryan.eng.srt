1
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:18,869
communication resources and faster and

2
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:22,500
more reliable this is first female hear

3
00:00:18,869 --> 00:00:24,060
me yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so I've got a confession to</font>

4
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:26,580
make<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm a real knew when it comes to</font>

5
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:28,019
doing like PowerPoint stuff so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i haven't</font>

6
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:30,778
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually gotten this to display without</font>

7
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:31,830
the little doodads on the top but I mean

8
00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:33,149
the information is up there we have a

9
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:36,120
pretty big screen so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> just going to</font>

10
00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:37,559
kind of go with it you're going to see

11
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:40,669
me doing this a lot though because like

12
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:43,910
I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a copy oh I have an update</font>

13
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:43,910
what's up<font color="#E5E5E5"> man</font>

14
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:56,610
I got it fact if I just kind of like go

15
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:59,329
down here i'll just take peaks one

16
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:59,329
necessary but

17
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:04,309
so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is like a talk kind of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

18
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:06,440
pineapples not pineapples I can't really

19
00:01:04,309 --> 00:01:09,110
say that but the kinds of like<font color="#CCCCCC"> Wireless</font>

20
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:10,640
attacks that involve spinning up like a

21
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:12,920
like a rogue access point that's like

22
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,570
either like a like a spoof of a

23
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:17,210
legitimate access point or just tricking

24
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:19,550
one way or the other some kind of 802

25
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:21,919
dot11 enabled device to connect to a

26
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:25,310
malicious<font color="#E5E5E5"> AP and then pone the hell out</font>

27
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:27,050
of it so there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are two kinds</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of rogue</font>

28
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:28,730
access point attacks that you really see

29
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:30,050
a lot the first one is an evil twin

30
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:32,570
attack and the evil twin attack

31
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:35,509
basically involves you know making like

32
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:38,300
a like a copy of<font color="#CCCCCC"> a legitimate access</font>

33
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:40,430
point and karma attack is one that you

34
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:43,070
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically what you do is you well</font>

35
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:48,250
we'll go over that<font color="#E5E5E5"> later let's go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> over</font>

36
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:50,089
evil twin attacks so free Wi-Fi so

37
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:52,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">imagine we're in this situation right</font>

38
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:53,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">where you know we're kind of broke we</font>

39
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:55,100
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> really want to use the internet</font>

40
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:57,170
tho tho really cheap and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we don't</font>

41
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:59,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually you know want to invest like</font>

42
00:01:57,170 --> 00:02:02,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">the five dollars it is at starbucks to</font>

43
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:04,039
get Wi-Fi access so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know we're</font>

44
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:06,530
sitting there<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we're surrounded by</font>

45
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:08,330
people and they all you know seem to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

46
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:10,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">connected and they're doing their thing</font>

47
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:11,780
and we're like<font color="#E5E5E5"> gee wouldn't be nice if</font>

48
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:13,370
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> had you know some creds for like a</font>

49
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:18,530
login portal that they had so we could

50
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:22,930
go about<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing our thing well I root</font>

51
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:27,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">whew I'm doing the thing again with the</font>

52
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:27,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay I'm actually going to stand on here</font>

53
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:33,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay imagine</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> scenario where you know</font>

54
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:35,988
where starbucks and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> noticed that the</font>

55
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:37,280
the network at starbucks has an SSID

56
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:38,959
starbucks Wi-Fi and it's running<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

57
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,430
channel 6 and they're all these people

58
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:41,780
connected to it and they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

59
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:46,500
connected to this this this open access

60
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:50,000
point on channel 6 and you know

61
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:53,760
what would<font color="#CCCCCC"> happen</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if we were to spin up</font>

62
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,010
our own access point with the same SSID

63
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,989
and the same channel as the legitimate

64
00:02:56,010 --> 00:03:00,239
one well what would happen so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

65
00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:02,700
provided that our signal strength was as

66
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:04,620
strong or stronger than the legitimate

67
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:06,810
one all those connections<font color="#E5E5E5"> would drop and</font>

68
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:19,830
connect to ours and without allow us to

69
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:21,630
do is is create that allows do is create

70
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:22,680
a man and metal situation right so all

71
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:24,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">these guys have dropped</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> off of their</font>

72
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:26,340
legitimate connection but now connected

73
00:03:24,209 --> 00:03:27,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">to us we can start routing their packets</font>

74
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:28,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know using our P tables or something</font>

75
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,940
like that to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet and meanwhile</font>

76
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:32,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">start you know sniffing creds and and</font>

77
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:34,739
and we can get those like basically

78
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:36,739
gmail credentials anything we wanted I'm

79
00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:42,200
not supposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> say in front</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of speaker</font>

80
00:03:36,739 --> 00:03:42,200
but yeah so we do that and

81
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:50,070
dude that would be awesome thank you so

82
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:51,210
much i was thinking like is there a way

83
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:52,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">i can clone myself and it's kind of put</font>

84
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:56,400
myself here and at the same time but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

85
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:58,200
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> this gotta solve it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay he is my</font>

86
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:06,900
below I guess I could stand here no

87
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:08,700
feedback what's up the I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

88
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:13,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">the key to the CPI for the fencing</font>

89
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:14,560
competition stand here

90
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:15,970
so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> looks like there's like really</font>

91
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,290
really specific spot where at the stand

92
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:18,670
where I'm not in front of speaker and

93
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:21,250
I'm not by a projector so I'm just going

94
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:25,660
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> fly myself here can we go back one</font>

95
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:27,160
slide<font color="#E5E5E5"> Thanks yep perfect</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay we're</font>

96
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:31,870
gonna start<font color="#E5E5E5"> this over because that was</font>

97
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:33,520
crap so let's imagine<font color="#CCCCCC"> scenario sunday</font>

98
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:35,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">morning in you know we really want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

99
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">access the internet and we're chillin in</font>

100
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:37,690
dunkin donuts we're actually doing

101
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:39,609
anything at dunkin donuts<font color="#E5E5E5"> which is kind</font>

102
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:41,080
of you know loitering there and we

103
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:42,430
really want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use their Wi-Fi we can't</font>

104
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,870
use their Wi-Fi because there's a

105
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:45,610
captive portal there where you have to

106
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:47,740
enter in like you know like a username

107
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:50,919
and password kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of thing that you only</font>

108
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:54,490
get if you you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know spend a five dollars</font>

109
00:04:50,919 --> 00:04:55,990
for a cup of coffee so what could you do

110
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:57,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">I mean you could do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> something where you</font>

111
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:59,020
like art poison the router something I

112
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:00,099
thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> you could connect to it and then</font>

113
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:01,180
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of them in the middle</font>

114
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:04,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">would like our poison attack or</font>

115
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:07,030
something like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and doing that start</font>

116
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:08,530
intercepting traffic and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> steal</font>

117
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:10,900
the creds to to the captive portal that

118
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:12,609
way<font color="#E5E5E5"> unfortunately I mean that is like a</font>

119
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:13,479
tried-and-tested method but you know it

120
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:15,040
really it really messes up your

121
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:16,120
throughput it's really really noticeable

122
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:18,070
I mean if someone's doing something like

123
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:19,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">that it's it's kind of loud it's just</font>

124
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:21,760
something like<font color="#E5E5E5"> our requests all over the</font>

125
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:25,630
place but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the point is there are better</font>

126
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:26,710
ways to do it if you notice here I know

127
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:29,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">that said Starbucks</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pretended lumpy</font>

128
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:30,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">doughnuts but so like let's say that</font>

129
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:35,550
dunkin donuts is running starbucks Wi-Fi

130
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:37,510
on channel 6 so it's I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know</font>

131
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:40,450
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> running starbucks Wi-Fi on</font>

132
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:41,950
channel 6 and you know what would what

133
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:43,330
would happen if you were to spin up your

134
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:44,560
own access point you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> using like an</font>

135
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:46,539
external like wireless card or something

136
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,640
like that with your<font color="#CCCCCC"> laptop</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> also with</font>

137
00:05:46,539 --> 00:05:50,770
SSID<font color="#E5E5E5"> set to starbucks Wi-Fi on channel 6</font>

138
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:51,909
how would those connected clients be

139
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:54,789
able to tell the difference between your

140
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:57,370
access point<font color="#E5E5E5"> and there's well they can't</font>

141
00:05:54,789 --> 00:05:59,169
so provided that<font color="#E5E5E5"> your your signal</font>

142
00:05:57,370 --> 00:06:01,930
strength is is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know like</font>

143
00:05:59,169 --> 00:06:03,789
stronger strong enough<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's more</font>

144
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:05,289
efficient for those clients to connect

145
00:06:03,789 --> 00:06:06,610
to you as opposed to the legitimate

146
00:06:05,289 --> 00:06:08,680
access point they<font color="#E5E5E5"> will and that's</font>

147
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:11,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually not that hard to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do next side</font>

148
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:13,120
please so as<font color="#E5E5E5"> you see what will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> happen is</font>

149
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you know if you were to spin up</font>

150
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:17,320
that that that spoof access point that

151
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:18,820
clone all these<font color="#E5E5E5"> clients would drop their</font>

152
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:20,260
connections and suddenly connect to your

153
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:22,210
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can then assign them IP</font>

154
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:23,980
addresses start writing their traffic

155
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:26,200
through like ssl strip

156
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:27,730
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever and at that point</font>

157
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:29,680
you'd have your your nice little credit

158
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:33,240
out having to you know purchase like a

159
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:37,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">five dollar beverage so let's go to the</font>

160
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:38,590
next one so what do you<font color="#CCCCCC"> ban jizz to this</font>

161
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">kind of attack well it's actually</font>

162
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:41,320
relatively easy to<font color="#CCCCCC"> perform you just need</font>

163
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:43,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">something that's capable of making like</font>

164
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:46,240
a hot spot more or less you can just

165
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:47,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">download hostapd and with relative ease</font>

166
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,940
you can you can like write a script or

167
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:52,060
something like that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> does this kind</font>

168
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:53,620
of thing it's also really targeted so

169
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:55,300
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of my deals in like a red</font>

170
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:57,490
team situation<font color="#CCCCCC"> where you don't want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

171
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:59,130
attack you know clients that are

172
00:06:57,490 --> 00:07:01,420
connected<font color="#E5E5E5"> to some other dudes network</font>

173
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:03,580
you know in this situation you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can you</font>

174
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:05,080
can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> pinpoint I want to</font>

175
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:08,289
specifically attack this open network

176
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:11,310
and you won't have issues with like you

177
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:13,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">know people from like I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know the</font>

connecting here for your thing is next

180
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:22,450
slide cool what are some disadvantages

181
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:24,670
well out of the box it does not work

182
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:27,070
against protected WPA networks because

183
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:28,740
you know you can't without having that

184
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:31,990
pre-shared key you can't really like

185
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:33,280
spin up an exact copy of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing and</font>

186
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:35,650
these things<font color="#E5E5E5"> will be associate to this</font>

187
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:37,479
<font color="#CCCCCC">WP</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> network or even WEP network and you</font>

188
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:38,890
won't really be able to impersonate it

189
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:41,410
and get them to connect to you what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

190
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:44,740
can do though what you can do is you can

191
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:48,490
you can snip for well basically every

192
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:50,350
single 8211 device has like a list of

193
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:52,810
preferred networks right so let's say

194
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:55,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you've connected once to 18 feet</font>

195
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:57,790
Wi-Fi Barnes & Noble you know your phone

196
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:59,260
now has that saved and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's let's the</font>

197
00:07:57,790 --> 00:08:01,000
preferred networks and then let's say

198
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:02,430
you go home<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then you collect to you</font>

199
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,320
know you connect to<font color="#E5E5E5"> your Wi-Fi network</font>

200
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:06,460
Jimmy's Wi-Fi or whatever that that's

201
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:09,250
also going to be in your inner preferred

202
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:10,390
network so let's refer network so your

203
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:12,700
device is constantly going to be sending

204
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:14,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">out like probe request for these</font>

205
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:18,659
preferred networks which you can listen

206
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:20,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">for and use this to compile a list of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

207
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:22,000
you know commonly preferred networks for

208
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,840
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> every device around you</font>

209
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,520
because let's say you're surrounded by

210
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:25,659
wireless devices and they're all sitting

211
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">out these pro bequests you can kind of</font>

212
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:28,930
find one that they all have<font color="#CCCCCC"> in common</font>

213
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:30,760
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what you do here so if all</font>

214
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:33,159
these devices are<font color="#E5E5E5"> connected to this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> wpa</font>

215
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:35,049
network and and you can just are

216
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:36,819
sniffing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and trying to find sniffing for</font>

217
00:08:35,049 --> 00:08:37,649
their preferred networks and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> find</font>

218
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:40,259
one that they haven't

219
00:08:37,649 --> 00:08:41,909
and you can add<font color="#CCCCCC"> eos the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wpa or that</font>

220
00:08:40,259 --> 00:08:45,180
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> targeting and then when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they all</font>

221
00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:47,970
drop the ones you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> you spin up a an</font>

222
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:49,739
evil twin of this this common preferred

223
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:53,490
network all the devices would connect<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

224
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:58,079
you and then you<font color="#CCCCCC"> pwned them basically so</font>

225
00:08:53,490 --> 00:09:00,959
<font color="#CCCCCC">I guess next</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> slide so how do we detect</font>

226
00:08:58,079 --> 00:09:02,609
this stuff well in most cases you know

227
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:06,508
that there's really two cases I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think we</font>

228
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:08,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">should go the next</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one too yeah so I</font>

229
00:09:06,509 --> 00:09:10,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">mean there are two</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ways to like the text</font>

230
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:11,309
let mean it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> Narrows right the first</font>

231
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:14,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">scenario involves someone spends up and</font>

232
00:09:11,309 --> 00:09:17,429
able to win you know and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know this</font>

233
00:09:14,939 --> 00:09:19,259
they've set their SSID to match a

234
00:09:17,429 --> 00:09:21,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">legitimate access point on your network</font>

235
00:09:19,259 --> 00:09:23,879
and they set up their their channel to

236
00:09:21,779 --> 00:09:25,470
match the legitimate access point on

237
00:09:23,879 --> 00:09:28,410
your network so they smoothly janessa

238
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:29,819
sighting in channel so you know if this

239
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:32,059
happens they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be they're</font>

240
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:34,110
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be sending out pro responses to</font>

241
00:09:32,059 --> 00:09:36,990
devices that are currently associated or

242
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:38,249
that are you know have that have your

243
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:40,589
network in their preferred network so

244
00:09:38,249 --> 00:09:42,839
just how devices send a probe requests

245
00:09:40,589 --> 00:09:44,249
for networks the access<font color="#E5E5E5"> point send out</font>

246
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:45,839
pro responses and you can listen to

247
00:09:44,249 --> 00:09:48,959
those<font color="#CCCCCC"> Pro responses and they'll have the</font>

248
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:50,550
the channel the the AP is running on

249
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:52,550
they'll have the SSID as well as the

250
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:54,599
bssid which is kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the it's</font>

251
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:59,069
like the hardware address kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of thing</font>

252
00:09:54,600 --> 00:10:01,139
I mean sort of so um so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

253
00:09:59,069 --> 00:10:04,920
assuming that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the attacker does not</font>

254
00:10:01,139 --> 00:10:09,420
spoof his or her mac address or and also

255
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:10,920
the SSID you know and basically an evil

256
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:13,410
twin shows up and you start seeing

257
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:16,319
packets that are that are pro responses

258
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:20,790
to one of your access points and it has

259
00:10:16,319 --> 00:10:23,610
the necessary in channel that is you

260
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:25,230
know matching yours but the bssid is not

261
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:27,990
matching one in like a white list

262
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:29,220
basically of access points that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

263
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:30,420
are within your<font color="#E5E5E5"> network then you know</font>

264
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:32,579
something fishy's up and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we go in the</font>

265
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:34,439
next<font color="#E5E5E5"> slide there's a diagram here of how</font>

266
00:10:32,579 --> 00:10:37,589
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would work so you'd have like a</font>

267
00:10:34,439 --> 00:10:38,939
pack of sniffing<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sniffing for your</font>

268
00:10:37,589 --> 00:10:40,709
sniffing for probe responses from

269
00:10:38,939 --> 00:10:42,509
different access points and at some

270
00:10:40,709 --> 00:10:44,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">point you start seeing one that you know</font>

271
00:10:42,509 --> 00:10:47,279
you basically say is this bssid allowed

272
00:10:44,579 --> 00:10:48,449
and if it's not allowed then you kind of

273
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,740
at that<font color="#E5E5E5"> point to start sending like</font>

274
00:10:48,449 --> 00:10:52,410
alerts the system mins

275
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:55,080
and maybe like also you can start d

276
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:57,300
opping that that access point by<font color="#E5E5E5"> its you</font>

277
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:59,100
know bssid and that would cause anything

278
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:01,260
that did connect<font color="#E5E5E5"> you it to drop and kind</font>

279
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:06,500
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> potentially save your your clients</font>

280
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:09,180
from abuse in that way next slide please

281
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:11,400
so why doesn't this always work well

282
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:14,010
there really isn't anything stopping an

283
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:15,209
attacker from spoofing their bssid<font color="#E5E5E5"> to so</font>

284
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:18,600
if the attacker actually spends the time

285
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:21,270
to you know cover their<font color="#E5E5E5"> third bssid and</font>

286
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:24,180
match they actually listen for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a scope</font>

287
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:25,650
out your network and figure out figure

288
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:27,449
out how to like spend of an april twin

289
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:30,590
that matches one of your access points

290
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:32,370
by SSID<font color="#CCCCCC"> essid and channel at that point</font>

291
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:33,330
whitelisting will not work because

292
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:36,060
there's like really no way to

293
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:38,040
differentiate using<font color="#E5E5E5"> whitelisting between</font>

294
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:41,520
resume an access point and also one that

295
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:44,880
is kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like able to win there is a</font>

296
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:46,770
way around this though and yes so how do

297
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:49,500
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> get around this paying attention</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

298
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:50,430
signal strength suppose<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I'm have an</font>

299
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,050
access point right here at the front<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

300
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:56,400
the room and it's just<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of chilling</font>

301
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:57,930
here and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know it's serving up some</font>

302
00:11:56,400 --> 00:12:00,439
arbitrary network name free Wi-Fi will

303
00:11:57,930 --> 00:12:03,689
call it that it's running<font color="#CCCCCC"> on Channel</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> two</font>

304
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:05,250
so you know let's say some sketchy dude

305
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:06,510
in like a like a<font color="#E5E5E5"> DEFCON t-shirt or</font>

306
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:08,940
something like that kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> rolls into</font>

307
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:10,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">the parking lot outside the you know</font>

308
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:11,940
outside the convention center has like

309
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:14,069
gets<font color="#CCCCCC"> out that's really huge like high</font>

310
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:17,340
gain antenna you know makes this starts

311
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:19,470
making this this you know evil twin<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

312
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:22,980
my access point right and he actually

313
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:25,740
takes the care<font color="#E5E5E5"> to stupid by bssid SSID</font>

314
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:27,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">in channel well you know if I was like</font>

315
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:28,530
listening for packets right we had a

316
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:32,699
Pakistan in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the corner of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> room there</font>

317
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:33,870
and we established like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the signal</font>

318
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:36,570
strength coming from my access point

319
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:37,590
should be radically<font color="#CCCCCC"> different from the</font>

320
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:39,030
signal strength coming from the

321
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:41,880
attackers access point so in other words

322
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:43,319
the signal strength coming from if you

323
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:45,990
know access points<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't move around</font>

324
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:47,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">very much I mean sometimes I guess like</font>

325
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:50,970
hypothetically someone could grab one

326
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:53,069
and try to like walk off at it but yeah

327
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:55,530
access points<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't move much so if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

328
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:57,810
if we listen if we have a fixed axis

329
00:12:55,530 --> 00:12:59,470
point and a fixed<font color="#E5E5E5"> Pakistan for like</font>

330
00:12:57,810 --> 00:13:02,219
that's kind of being used as IDs

331
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:04,720
and we we can we can establish a

332
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:07,630
baseline signal strength from the

333
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:09,640
sniffer to that access point over time

334
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:11,620
and then when someone<font color="#CCCCCC"> picked you know</font>

335
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:13,689
basically spends up a an evil twin of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

336
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:15,460
you'll start<font color="#CCCCCC"> seeing packets that you</font>

337
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:18,150
know deviate from that from that

338
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:19,720
threshold by like a certain amount and

339
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:21,640
that's how you know that's something

340
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:23,200
fishy is up at that<font color="#E5E5E5"> point I guess you</font>

341
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:24,670
can't really you can't really like start

342
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,740
you know launching the off<font color="#E5E5E5"> pack and</font>

343
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:28,180
stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> could do is</font>

344
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:29,860
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> could at this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> point know that</font>

345
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:31,060
something something strange<font color="#E5E5E5"> is going on</font>

346
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:36,220
and you could<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually take action</font>

347
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:38,790
accordingly<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I guess the next I guess</font>

348
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:42,670
it kind of blew past those didn't I

349
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:47,500
guess next slide to<font color="#E5E5E5"> ya a little more a</font>

350
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:52,199
little more demo time<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so let's try</font>

351
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:52,200
this out yeah

352
00:13:53,850 --> 00:14:05,350
he's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go oh ok so this is gonna</font>

353
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:06,399
be interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok yeah you do that so so</font>

354
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:07,929
for this what we're going to be doing is

355
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:11,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're going to be using a kind of like a</font>

356
00:14:07,929 --> 00:14:14,699
gutted version of this it's it's a

357
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:19,209
pretty notorious suite of tools for

358
00:14:14,699 --> 00:14:21,160
running rogue access point to act it's

359
00:14:19,209 --> 00:14:25,449
called the<font color="#CCCCCC"> mana framework and we've kind</font>

360
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:28,209
of removed these stuff that would make

361
00:14:25,449 --> 00:14:30,008
this actually own stuff it'll it'll spin

362
00:14:28,209 --> 00:14:33,429
up an access point and will behave like

363
00:14:30,009 --> 00:14:36,369
kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of like a like a very very almost</font>

364
00:14:33,429 --> 00:14:38,108
rope access point I thing but it's it's

365
00:14:36,369 --> 00:14:41,829
not actually going to do that so we're

366
00:14:38,109 --> 00:14:42,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">going and we're also going to run a tool</font>

367
00:14:41,829 --> 00:14:46,569
that actually kind of follows this

368
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:51,459
algorithm that we just described and I'm

369
00:14:46,569 --> 00:14:54,089
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do something where I move this</font>

370
00:14:51,459 --> 00:14:54,089
over here

371
00:14:58,170 --> 00:15:02,630
bear with<font color="#CCCCCC"> me okay</font>

372
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:12,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">yeah lost my mouth feel oh there's one</font>

373
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:18,570
house cool blood<font color="#E5E5E5"> clot sighs you see that</font>

374
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:26,520
can anybody not see that easily a little

375
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:29,120
small<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay hola realistically I just</font>

376
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:29,120
need a longer neck

377
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:38,570
I'm actually like pretty wired in

378
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:40,040
heavily here you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what I'm gonna do</font>

379
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:42,800
I'm actually gets about teeny terminals

380
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:45,430
and i'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start this overly fast</font>

381
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,430
I'm so sorry

382
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:55,580
yeah just I can't see it<font color="#E5E5E5"> let me do that</font>

383
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:55,580
thing

384
00:15:58,430 --> 00:16:01,029
so

385
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:05,030
if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> run this thing</font>

386
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:14,690
so to hackers walk into a bar<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

387
00:16:19,529 --> 00:16:23,480
and one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them has a rogue access point</font>

388
00:16:21,089 --> 00:16:23,480
yes

389
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:39,690
cool so what we're now doing is we have

390
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:46,740
a we're running this the sniffer here

391
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:51,360
and it's it's searching for I lost my

392
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:53,190
mouse<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so hypothetically this is</font>

393
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:58,640
this is technical demo<font color="#E5E5E5"> worst-case</font>

394
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:58,640
scenario what would be happening is that

395
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:02,010
suppose that there wasn't able to win up

396
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:04,560
here what would be happening is you

397
00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:09,569
start seeing<font color="#E5E5E5"> something some output on</font>

398
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:13,260
there that would say you know it would

399
00:17:09,569 --> 00:17:20,310
say blah blah able to endure<font color="#CCCCCC"> tech did</font>

400
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:23,459
and oh my god so say evil twin detected

401
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:26,639
and it would start like the offing it

402
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:28,020
basically so having a<font color="#E5E5E5"> V issues at the</font>

403
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,820
moment so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's probably this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is not</font>

404
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:36,270
gonna really go back to it will just go

405
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:39,330
back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Power Plus wise so let's</font>

406
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:43,050
talk about<font color="#CCCCCC"> Karma tax on try it again</font>

407
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:47,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so let's talk about Karma</font>

408
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:48,210
tax so karma tax are kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the it's a</font>

409
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:49,770
slightly<font color="#E5E5E5"> more sophisticated kind of</font>

410
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:52,680
rogue access point attack armed attack

411
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:55,530
works is that you know we talked<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

412
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:56,730
how if you have a wireless device is

413
00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:58,530
constantly sending out requests for his

414
00:17:56,730 --> 00:17:59,790
preferred networks<font color="#E5E5E5"> pro requests you know</font>

415
00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:02,430
saying basically saying are<font color="#CCCCCC"> you there</font>

416
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:03,899
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> i connect to you so what what a</font>

417
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:06,570
rogue AP will do if it's launching a

418
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:08,850
Carm attack so it will<font color="#E5E5E5"> respond to all</font>

419
00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:10,230
these requests promiscuous<font color="#CCCCCC"> lee it will</font>

420
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:12,570
you know it let's say that you know I'm

421
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:16,110
a rogue AP and i'm doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> a harm attack</font>

00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:37,890
the result of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that any any</font>

430
00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:39,810
device nearby it's kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like like a</font>

431
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:41,220
frag grenade i guess like it's like

432
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:42,418
wireless things you just turn this thing

433
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:44,429
on

434
00:18:42,419 --> 00:18:47,820
and any device<font color="#CCCCCC"> in your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> by that's sending</font>

435
00:18:44,429 --> 00:18:48,929
out these pro requests and in theory

436
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:51,178
what happens is that these things

437
00:18:48,929 --> 00:18:52,169
connect to you because you're responding

438
00:18:51,179 --> 00:18:56,279
to all their probe request these way

439
00:18:52,169 --> 00:18:58,009
this way so right<font color="#CCCCCC"> so here we have the</font>

440
00:18:56,279 --> 00:19:00,480
diagram basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're you have this</font>

441
00:18:58,009 --> 00:19:02,730
this client one it you know sends out

442
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:04,799
this request<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm looking for linksys the</font>

443
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:07,139
rogue AP is like yes I'm linksys go

444
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:09,989
ahead and connect to me and then client

445
00:19:07,139 --> 00:19:11,488
tues like I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking for ATT Wi-Fi so</font>

446
00:19:09,989 --> 00:19:13,739
the rogue AP at that points like yeah

447
00:19:11,489 --> 00:19:16,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's me I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a VP Wi-Fi connect me bro</font>

448
00:19:13,739 --> 00:19:17,730
so then the my few connects client one

449
00:19:16,739 --> 00:19:18,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">at the bottom actually should stay</font>

450
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:20,399
client<font color="#E5E5E5"> three I don't know what it says</font>

451
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:22,409
client one but let's pretend to climb

452
00:19:20,399 --> 00:19:23,758
three so client one or climb three

453
00:19:22,409 --> 00:19:27,149
because I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking for NSA surveillance</font>

454
00:19:23,759 --> 00:19:28,289
man so you know yeah the<font color="#E5E5E5"> rogue AP says</font>

455
00:19:27,149 --> 00:19:30,479
yeah that's me<font color="#E5E5E5"> where's white castle</font>

456
00:19:28,289 --> 00:19:32,700
let's go so the connection happens and

457
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:34,889
in this case<font color="#CCCCCC"> scenario all three of these</font>

458
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:37,980
clients are get<font color="#E5E5E5"> pwned because they did</font>

459
00:19:34,889 --> 00:19:40,258
connect to it so let's go next slide and

460
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:42,480
so the advantages of these kinds of

461
00:19:40,259 --> 00:19:44,940
attacks over over evil twin attacks are

462
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:46,320
that you know for one thing you know

463
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:47,519
they're really easy to run you<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

464
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:49,710
start<font color="#E5E5E5"> out the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> script I need a script</font>

465
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:51,720
that does this kind of thing it brings

466
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:53,429
it up and you have this<font color="#E5E5E5"> this thing</font>

467
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:54,749
<font color="#E5E5E5">running</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at carm attack and it's just at</font>

468
00:19:53,429 --> 00:19:56,009
that point you can just fire forget<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

469
00:19:54,749 --> 00:19:57,809
you just kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of like run this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing and</font>

470
00:19:56,009 --> 00:19:59,909
you can just kind of be driving down<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

471
00:19:57,809 --> 00:20:02,700
road or<font color="#CCCCCC"> something like that with your</font>

472
00:19:59,909 --> 00:20:05,190
device a cough cough pineapple and

473
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:06,269
things will sneer by will start being

474
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:10,379
forced into connecting to your device

475
00:20:06,269 --> 00:20:12,419
and you know magic happens the

476
00:20:10,379 --> 00:20:14,459
disadvantage is is that it's messy<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

477
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:15,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">know it's really difficult to target a</font>

478
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:22,440
specific network with this kind of thing

479
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:23,389
if you go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the next slide it's you</font>

480
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:26,730
can't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> do that that way</font>

481
00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:28,289
unfortunately that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that is a downside</font>

482
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:29,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can't if you have a WPA</font>

483
00:20:28,289 --> 00:20:32,158
protected<font color="#CCCCCC"> Network and this is one</font>

484
00:20:29,399 --> 00:20:33,988
argument for having you know using wpa

485
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:36,299
or something like that is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

486
00:20:33,989 --> 00:20:37,950
really as susceptible to that you aren't

487
00:20:36,299 --> 00:20:40,529
really able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do this kind of thing</font>

488
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:43,109
what you can do though is you can force

489
00:20:40,529 --> 00:20:46,320
connected clients disassociate with the

490
00:20:43,109 --> 00:20:48,210
wpa key and at that<font color="#E5E5E5"> point you can have</font>

491
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,529
something spending if you had<font color="#CCCCCC"> known what</font>

492
00:20:48,210 --> 00:20:51,749
their preferred networks are you can

493
00:20:49,529 --> 00:20:53,279
spin up a spoof of that or even in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

494
00:20:51,749 --> 00:20:54,869
case when you're when you're doing a

495
00:20:53,279 --> 00:20:55,200
Carm attack if they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> disassociated</font>

496
00:20:54,869 --> 00:20:57,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">from what</font>

497
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,860
they were connecting to think all the

498
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:01,980
times you've been dropped from the Wi-Fi

499
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:03,899
at some security conference basically

500
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:06,149
what will happen at<font color="#CCCCCC"> that point is that</font>

501
00:21:03,899 --> 00:21:08,789
it will just kind of like connect<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

502
00:21:06,149 --> 00:21:11,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">whatever is available in this case your</font>

503
00:21:08,789 --> 00:21:14,549
pineapple or rogue AP script or whatever

504
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:17,549
but the disadvantages to this is that

505
00:21:14,549 --> 00:21:20,309
well it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy to detect you know for</font>

506
00:21:17,549 --> 00:21:22,590
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing a you know an access point</font>

507
00:21:20,309 --> 00:21:24,928
should not respond to requests for

508
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:28,019
multiple you know ESS IDs<font color="#E5E5E5"> but that just</font>

509
00:21:24,929 --> 00:21:31,260
shouldn't happen so if you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> for that</font>

510
00:21:28,019 --> 00:21:34,500
it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy to fit to see big on</font>

511
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:37,710
the next slide actually brings us to how

512
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:41,220
to detect these things so basically

513
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:43,620
let's say<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you want to look for for</font>

514
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:44,850
for devices that are doing karma tax I'm

515
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:47,158
<font color="#E5E5E5">really good scenarios to think about is</font>

516
00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:49,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">like I mean so if you were walk into a</font>

517
00:21:47,159 --> 00:21:52,409
room yeah just imagine you walk into a

518
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:53,880
bar because we like bars so you walk

519
00:21:52,409 --> 00:21:56,730
into a bar and you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for this</font>

520
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:58,260
guy named Jason and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> walk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in just</font>

521
00:21:56,730 --> 00:21:59,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of shut up hey is anybody here</font>

522
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:00,960
named Jason and this sketchy dude in a

523
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:04,469
DEFCON t-shirt in the back just kind of

524
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:05,700
like yeah I'm Jason<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you might be</font>

525
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:07,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">inclined to believe him because like why</font>

526
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:08,549
would he lie about that but let's say

527
00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:10,230
that you're not actually going in there

528
00:22:08,549 --> 00:22:11,610
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a guy named Jason you're a</font>

529
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:13,380
professional detector this is

530
00:22:11,610 --> 00:22:15,418
what you do so let's say you know back

531
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:17,039
out you walk<font color="#E5E5E5"> back to the bar again and</font>

532
00:22:15,419 --> 00:22:21,029
you're like hey<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's anybody here named</font>

533
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:23,039
Jason guy says yes I'm Jason so you're

534
00:22:21,029 --> 00:22:25,049
like kind of write it down this<font color="#E5E5E5"> guy says</font>

535
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:28,169
he's<font color="#CCCCCC"> chasing then you do it again is</font>

536
00:22:25,049 --> 00:22:29,789
anybody here named Bob yeah i'm bob says

537
00:22:28,169 --> 00:22:31,169
the same guy well now you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

538
00:22:29,789 --> 00:22:33,029
something's up because this guy has

539
00:22:31,169 --> 00:22:35,580
responded the same question<font color="#E5E5E5"> what is your</font>

540
00:22:33,029 --> 00:22:38,370
name<font color="#E5E5E5"> or is there anybody here named name</font>

541
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:39,750
this person the same answer<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's</font>

542
00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:41,279
contradictory and the same is true with

543
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:43,080
rogue access point attacks or rogue

544
00:22:41,279 --> 00:22:45,899
access points if you have a rogue access

545
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:49,789
point that's running a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Carm attack it</font>

546
00:22:45,899 --> 00:22:53,158
will respond to arbitrary you know

547
00:22:49,789 --> 00:22:55,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">request for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> probe request for four</font>

548
00:22:53,159 --> 00:22:58,110
networks for various<font color="#CCCCCC"> SSIDs know what</font>

549
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:59,428
this means if we go the next slide<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

550
00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:00,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">know let's say</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we can have like an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> IDs</font>

551
00:22:59,429 --> 00:23:03,000
like a little device or something like

552
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:05,520
that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> sends out</font>

553
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,990
a probe request for some<font color="#E5E5E5"> random essid</font>

554
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:08,879
just a string<font color="#E5E5E5"> or something like that and</font>

555
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:11,580
the rogue access point at that point

556
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:13,380
would would respond yes that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> me even</font>

557
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:15,780
though it's like this nonsensical<font color="#CCCCCC"> esis</font>

558
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:17,520
idea which probably would never see at

559
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:21,660
that point your device can send<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

560
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:23,670
another arbitrarily crafted pro request

561
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:25,050
for another one I mean while keeping

562
00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:27,180
know that this this<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing has responded</font>

563
00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:29,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">to the previous one the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> rogue AP at this</font>

564
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:31,470
point would respond in exactly the same

565
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:32,610
way at this won't you have overlap where

566
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:35,670
there shouldn't be you have a device

567
00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:37,409
that has responded<font color="#CCCCCC"> to requests for two</font>

568
00:23:35,670 --> 00:23:39,630
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> ssids at this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> point you just</font>

569
00:23:37,410 --> 00:23:43,080
take down the name of the bssid<font color="#CCCCCC"> end and</font>

570
00:23:39,630 --> 00:23:47,070
and n-channel and you can just<font color="#CCCCCC"> be off</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

571
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:49,290
until it no longer works so time<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

572
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:52,409
another demo so we saw how will the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last</font>

573
00:23:49,290 --> 00:23:54,300
one went so we could do a live demo does

574
00:23:52,410 --> 00:23:58,590
anybody want to be a karmic now when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

575
00:23:54,300 --> 00:24:00,720
can do it so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess go next slide see</font>

576
00:23:58,590 --> 00:24:05,730
what's up with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that so existing</font>

577
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:07,500
solutions so if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> go to so like air</font>

578
00:24:05,730 --> 00:24:09,740
aruba networks makes this thing called

579
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:12,030
an air wave it the list price<font color="#E5E5E5"> for it is</font>

580
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:14,070
what's a software license for<font color="#E5E5E5"> 20 you can</font>

581
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:17,399
put on 25 devices and it will kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of do</font>

582
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:18,629
this kind of thing really cheaply did I

583
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:20,310
say cheaply I'm sorry they need to say

584
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:22,680
cheaply it'll do this thing really well

585
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:24,810
but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> as you can see it's probably</font>

586
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:27,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">like out of the price range of someone</font>

587
00:24:24,810 --> 00:24:28,679
who just made<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think about it how</font>

588
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:29,970
many enterprise networks do you know I

589
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:31,250
mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> was lets them go into a security</font>

590
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:33,960
conference and they actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> had like</font>

591
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:36,090
actual rogue AP production they don't

592
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:38,220
because you know it's it's priced at<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

593
00:24:36,090 --> 00:24:39,720
a point where it's almost a luxury item

594
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:43,290
you know there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> so much stuff to ask</font>

595
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:44,880
first if we look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> ciscos they have the</font>

596
00:24:43,290 --> 00:24:46,020
error net 600 series they're actually

597
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,820
like wireless access points that will

598
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:50,310
kind of like also be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to detect this</font>

599
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:52,169
kind of thing once again it's it's

600
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:53,129
doable if you're like a large enterprise

601
00:24:52,170 --> 00:24:55,350
and you can afford this kind of thing

602
00:24:53,130 --> 00:24:57,990
but it's out of the hands of like your

603
00:24:55,350 --> 00:25:00,050
average you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know just kind of like small</font>

604
00:24:57,990 --> 00:25:02,550
system a<font color="#E5E5E5"> torn out never met or whatever</font>

605
00:25:00,050 --> 00:25:05,310
and fluke networks they make the single

606
00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:06,840
an<font color="#E5E5E5"> error magnet Wi-Fi analyzer pro if</font>

607
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:07,919
you're perceived see somebody like kind

608
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:09,840
of like nervously walking around the

609
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:11,220
spectrum analyzer and on their tablet or

610
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,178
something trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find access points</font>

611
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:14,760
that's probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> what they're using</font>

612
00:25:12,179 --> 00:25:15,070
that's like four thousand<font color="#CCCCCC"> dollars first</font>

613
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:18,309
off

614
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:21,460
licensed so it's honestly pretty

615
00:25:18,309 --> 00:25:22,690
unaccessible to a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people but you</font>

616
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:23,769
know what if the bare minimum resources

617
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:28,929
needed for effective rogue access point

618
00:25:23,769 --> 00:25:30,580
mitigation well basically you can use

619
00:25:28,929 --> 00:25:34,480
the scripts that we were totally able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

620
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:37,120
run today you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're revealed</font>

621
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:38,110
online you can try them out but you can

622
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:42,158
use the scripts that we were totally

623
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:43,389
able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> run today and run like on a</font>

624
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:45,519
raspberry pi or something like that and

625
00:25:43,389 --> 00:25:47,469
you know at that point you basically

626
00:25:45,519 --> 00:25:51,610
taken your cost of rogue AP protection

627
00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:52,659
down to like sixty dollars a unit<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

628
00:25:51,610 --> 00:25:55,360
cost of actually putting one of these

629
00:25:52,659 --> 00:25:57,840
together and and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a really good</font>

630
00:25:55,360 --> 00:26:00,459
thing because it means that if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have</font>

631
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:05,019
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of it if you kind of take this</font>

632
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:09,009
do-it-yourself approach you can open up

633
00:26:05,019 --> 00:26:13,000
rogue AP protection too well nonprofit

634
00:26:09,009 --> 00:26:14,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">conferences stuff like that so are</font>

635
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:18,490
totally awesome proof of it in the next

636
00:26:14,529 --> 00:26:21,639
slide it's the yeah so that's the next

637
00:26:18,490 --> 00:26:24,190
one right so if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to try out this</font>

638
00:26:21,639 --> 00:26:27,959
stuff because we also how like awesome

639
00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:30,190
it works and stuff it's on github

640
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:31,899
currently is having some some some

641
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:33,009
issues compiling on certain distros and

642
00:26:31,899 --> 00:26:36,729
stuff like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> but i'm working on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

643
00:26:33,009 --> 00:26:40,360
but yeah it's you can you can do this

644
00:26:36,730 --> 00:26:42,600
kind of stuff with no for hundreds of

645
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:46,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">Python that's all it takes really and</font>

646
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:47,809
that's that's basically it yeah any

647
00:26:46,570 --> 00:26:50,960
questions

648
00:26:47,809 --> 00:26:50,960
what's up

649
00:26:51,890 --> 00:27:07,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">again I actually couldn't hear you sorry</font>

650
00:26:56,160 --> 00:27:07,980
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> antenna strength for the for what it</font>

651
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:09,350
seems to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sufficient actually</font>

652
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:11,520
especially when you consider that the

653
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:15,540
you can basically use the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same hardware</font>

654
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:17,160
to to launch a rogue AP attack you know

655
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:20,550
you actually there's just con

656
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:21,990
misconception that so you might want a

657
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:24,389
more high power antenna some in some

658
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:25,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay situations so for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> example like to</font>

659
00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:28,320
strap a yagi antenna or something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

660
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:30,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually less directional and kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of go</font>

661
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:37,580
from there but yeah it should be

662
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:37,580
anything else it is

663
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:53,020
so it depends on<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> looking for</font>

664
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:55,750
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're looking for karma text it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> will</font>

665
00:27:53,020 --> 00:28:00,639
actually use that<font color="#E5E5E5"> algorithm that we</font>

666
00:27:55,750 --> 00:28:02,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">described</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it will it will craft</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a pro</font>

667
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:04,660
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of like nonsensical probe</font>

668
00:28:02,650 --> 00:28:06,190
request and send them out if it starts

669
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:08,860
seeing responses to that it'll take

670
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:12,640
actually they'll notify you do the

671
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:15,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">aughts stuff like that for evil twins it</font>

672
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:17,070
will actually you know do the thing with

673
00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:19,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">a signal strength</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they will it will also</font>

674
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:20,860
you know you can you can make a white

675
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:23,889
list so you just<font color="#E5E5E5"> likely just load up a</font>

676
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:25,870
bunch of like you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> theses IDs into a</font>

677
00:28:23,890 --> 00:28:31,200
text file and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it reads that and then you</font>

678
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:31,199
just run it and that's it so what's up

679
00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:38,500
so for that what it does is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it</font>

680
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:40,240
establishes so you run it for about like

681
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:43,930
couple minutes and establishes a

682
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:45,610
baseline single strength coming from the

683
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:47,740
device<font color="#E5E5E5"> and on which you're running it to</font>

684
00:28:45,610 --> 00:28:50,350
the particular AP that you're running or

685
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:52,090
that you've listed in there and then if

686
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:53,169
suddenly it starts receiving packets

687
00:28:52,090 --> 00:28:55,899
that are supposedly coming from your

688
00:28:53,170 --> 00:28:58,330
access point but the signal strength<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

689
00:28:55,900 --> 00:29:00,100
deviating by a certain threshold by and

690
00:28:58,330 --> 00:29:01,330
you can sub threshold but it shouldn't

691
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:02,919
move around so<font color="#CCCCCC"> much from that from that</font>

692
00:29:01,330 --> 00:29:04,030
from that baseline then you know

693
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:09,030
something pushes up and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's how it</font>

694
00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:09,030
affects that what's up

695
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:19,780
yes big shoutouts escapee escapee is<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

696
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:22,070
amazing python library it for networking

697
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:25,580
wireless all of it it basically allows

698
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:27,080
you to craft arbitrary packets and

699
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:29,929
that's that's amazing I mean you can

700
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:33,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">literally encapsulate like an art packet</font>

701
00:29:29,930 --> 00:29:35,510
inside of like a TV like for encapsulate

702
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:37,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">things backwards basically I mean it</font>

703
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:39,890
doesn't doesn't have to make sense you

704
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:41,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">can do it also using a multi-processing</font>

705
00:29:39,890 --> 00:29:46,160
you know it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually a lottery complet</font>

706
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:48,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">mustang but that's it basically not not</font>

707
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:53,590
too many external stuff but two major

708
00:29:48,170 --> 00:29:53,590
major external libraries anything else

709
00:29:54,670 --> 00:29:57,670
nothing

710
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:02,440
yes

711
00:30:08,610 --> 00:30:14,168
bad weather bad weather so you know it's

712
00:30:12,850 --> 00:30:16,959
kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a proof in the proof</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of concept</font>

713
00:30:14,169 --> 00:30:18,460
stage right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I think that one</font>

714
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:20,769
thing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be really good to add</font>

715
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:22,929
and it's open source if anyone wants to

716
00:30:20,769 --> 00:30:25,149
contribute<font color="#E5E5E5"> to this actually knows</font>

717
00:30:22,929 --> 00:30:29,830
anything about kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of calculating for</font>

718
00:30:25,149 --> 00:30:32,168
this kind of thing there there should be

719
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:37,720
some way to compensate for environmental

720
00:30:32,169 --> 00:30:39,759
factors that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you could add but yeah yeah</font>

721
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:49,139
definitely works pretty well inside

722
00:30:39,759 --> 00:30:49,139
though which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool sure</font>

723
00:30:59,530 --> 00:31:02,100
huh

724
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:15,540
that's super<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool I wonder if it's</font>

725
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:15,540
copyrighted but uh yeah so what's up

726
00:31:44,130 --> 00:31:50,050
because well for one thing that's a good

727
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:51,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">question and what you'll notice</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that if</font>

728
00:31:50,050 --> 00:31:53,320
you if you actually open<font color="#CCCCCC"> up like a</font>

729
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:54,429
packet analyzer or just eat them<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

730
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:58,870
like run like arrow dumper stuff like

731
00:31:54,430 --> 00:31:59,980
that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> TX values or you know basically</font>

732
00:31:58,870 --> 00:32:02,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">your signal strength is going to</font>

733
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:05,280
fluctuate between each request so the

734
00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:07,510
question that point becomes how much

735
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:09,430
leeway do you want to give these packets

736
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:12,580
in terms of like a variation in signal

737
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:13,840
strength you know how do you how do you

738
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:15,970
know what the signal<font color="#CCCCCC"> strength should be</font>

739
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:18,449
and then how much leeway do you want to

740
00:32:15,970 --> 00:32:23,710
give<font color="#E5E5E5"> it you know because if it's if</font>

741
00:32:18,450 --> 00:32:25,270
you're running<font color="#CCCCCC"> an axis point and the the</font>

742
00:32:23,710 --> 00:32:28,900
signal<font color="#CCCCCC"> strength is fluctuating by like</font>

743
00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:30,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know maybe like 10 DB I or something</font>

744
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:32,110
like that how do you know it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

745
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:34,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">be that it could</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be something different</font>

746
00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:37,330
depending on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the scenario so the problem</font>

747
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:39,160
is like there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> always variation and you</font>

748
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:41,379
never really<font color="#E5E5E5"> know it's really hard</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

749
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:44,880
know up front how much<font color="#E5E5E5"> variation is</font>

750
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:44,880
going to occur what's up

751
00:32:46,970 --> 00:32:51,289
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> super exciting awesome</font>

752
00:33:08,450 --> 00:33:12,620
yeah you sir sound like an engineer and

753
00:33:11,570 --> 00:33:17,060
this excites<font color="#CCCCCC"> me because you wanna</font>

754
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:22,419
contribute to<font color="#E5E5E5"> this so I'm just gonna say</font>

755
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:22,419
<font color="#CCCCCC">yes to that what's up</font>

756
00:33:44,010 --> 00:33:51,629
I i would have to cut a good point i

757
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:53,460
would actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to talk to somebody</font>

758
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:56,670
who knows more about VPNs and stuff

759
00:33:53,460 --> 00:34:01,860
because I really but i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to guess</font>

760
00:33:56,670 --> 00:34:03,420
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do so case in point or um moral here</font>

761
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:11,960
use a VPN if you're connected to open

762
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:15,380
networks always anything else that's it

763
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:15,380
no problem
