1
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:19,590
communication resources and faster and

2
00:00:10,889 --> 00:00:21,990
more reliable<font color="#CCCCCC"> I personal favorite so</font>

3
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:24,990
yeah I'm nibble this is a tabletop

4
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:29,880
cryptography besides salt lake it's

5
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:32,488
great<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be back and amazing job I love</font>

6
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:33,660
the venue on you know the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google</font>

7
00:00:32,488 --> 00:00:36,059
volunteers that have put this together

8
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:39,148
you guys have<font color="#CCCCCC"> done an amazing amazing</font>

9
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:40,620
job of course nobody's in here right<font color="#E5E5E5"> now</font>

10
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:43,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">because they're all out doing other</font>

11
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:45,209
things so very important things keeping

12
00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:48,390
the con running so I certainly

13
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:51,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">appreciate all their work um so um</font>

14
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:54,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">really briefly I am NOT these guys</font>

15
00:00:51,980 --> 00:01:00,030
everybody knows who those two guys are

16
00:00:54,059 --> 00:01:02,849
right yep dipping in a snare so I'm not

17
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:06,600
a mathematician I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a cryptographer</font>

18
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:08,250
I am an enthusiast so so some of the

19
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">things I'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to say in this talk</font>

20
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:13,770
while<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think are technically accurate</font>

21
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:16,460
and from my research I found to be

22
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:19,429
<font color="#CCCCCC">accurate you know I could be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wrong so so</font>

23
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:24,289
you know please keep that in mind on

24
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:27,240
this is who I am Jason Rivera aka nibble

25
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:29,970
security engineer for<font color="#CCCCCC"> compu net on you</font>

26
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:31,679
know really amazing place to work great

27
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:35,850
group of people and they see<font color="#E5E5E5"> the value</font>

28
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:39,960
in shenanigans like this sponsoring

29
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:41,880
b-sides sponsoring hacker camp you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

30
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:45,929
being involved in the community you can

31
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:49,020
find me on twitter at nibble oh did it

32
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:52,860
awesome see there<font color="#CCCCCC"> you go yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> also email</font>

34
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:56,270
want to give a shout out to that a lot

35
00:01:54,420 --> 00:02:00,030
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> our members</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here in the in the</font>

session today so you know it's all about

37
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:05,189
community right that's what this this

38
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:09,750
events about that's what DC 801 is about

39
00:02:05,189 --> 00:02:12,750
801 labs providing a space to to have

40
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:14,020
that community meet grow so amazing

41
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:19,280
stuff

42
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:21,860
so why<font color="#E5E5E5"> tabletop so um cryptography um</font>

43
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:24,590
you know my day-to-day job I'm dealing

44
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:28,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">with things like ipsec ipsec if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I can</font>

45
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:32,209
say it right ssl/tls privacy has always

46
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:36,010
been an interest of mine um you know and

47
00:02:32,209 --> 00:02:40,519
and the the history of crypto analysis

48
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:45,859
the Enigma machine Alan Turing and how

49
00:02:40,519 --> 00:02:47,720
the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Enigma and I'll talk on this a</font>

50
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:49,640
little bit later but but cracking<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:52,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">Enigma and the technologies that were</font>

developed around that kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of led</font>

53
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:57,500
directly into what we know as modern

54
00:02:54,080 --> 00:03:00,560
computing today um I have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> definitely</font>

55
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:04,880
give a shout out to<font color="#CCCCCC"> so--but stand</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

56
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:06,230
trans / uh so-so three years<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago on the</font>

57
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:07,730
two of<font color="#E5E5E5"> us were sitting down there may</font>

58
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:11,810
have been some adult beverages involved

59
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:14,980
and you know he<font color="#CCCCCC"> had</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this great idea that</font>

60
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:19,190
he wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do a hacker camp</font>

61
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:21,440
essentially a CTF off the grid<font color="#E5E5E5"> tents</font>

62
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:22,910
campers out in the middle of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> woods</font>

63
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:25,280
somewhere and I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> like you know what</font>

64
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:27,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's a crazy idea and I love it let's</font>

65
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,900
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> it what can I do to help so this guy</font>

66
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:32,060
came<font color="#CCCCCC"> up with with this amazing CTF we</font>

67
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:34,400
did it up at first years at jordanelle

68
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:36,769
reservoir last year was up near

69
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,840
strawberry reservoir on BLM land and

70
00:03:36,769 --> 00:03:41,060
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> amazing it's you know we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out in</font>

71
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:47,870
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> woods there's generators to power a</font>

72
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:50,359
full CTF walk sport geocaching just a

73
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:51,769
lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> really fun time just for people</font>

74
00:03:50,359 --> 00:03:53,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">that like to get out in the woods a</font>

75
00:03:51,769 --> 00:03:56,690
little bit but still have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get their</font>

76
00:03:53,989 --> 00:03:58,910
geek on so one of the things that that

77
00:03:56,690 --> 00:04:01,730
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did is I said okay so i've got</font>

78
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:03,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">this passion for cryptography crypt</font>

79
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:05,119
analysis<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm not an expert in it but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font>

80
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:08,480
interested in<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so i learned some more</font>

81
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:10,190
and one of the big keys there was it had

82
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,988
to be off<font color="#CCCCCC"> the grid i wanted</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

83
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:14,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we could do without our computers</font>

84
00:04:11,989 --> 00:04:16,399
that we could do after hours sitting

85
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:19,970
around the campfire or by generator

86
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:22,880
light or<font color="#CCCCCC"> whatever it was right so that's</font>

87
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:25,849
kind of how on the cryptography track

88
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:27,139
came about at at hacker camp and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

89
00:04:25,849 --> 00:04:29,748
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was</font>

90
00:04:27,139 --> 00:04:31,490
helpful with so this year we're doing

91
00:04:29,749 --> 00:04:35,479
hacker camp again it'll be the third

92
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:37,490
year<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's jun 24 through the 25th on and</font>

93
00:04:35,479 --> 00:04:41,599
it'll be up at that strawberry reservoir

94
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:43,340
site it's BLM land free to camp you know

95
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:45,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">come out check</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it out it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really you</font>

96
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:48,378
know we had about 30 people up last year

97
00:04:45,319 --> 00:04:50,479
people bring<font color="#E5E5E5"> their families the plan</font>

98
00:04:48,379 --> 00:04:51,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">right now is to have a kids track so if</font>

99
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:53,180
you have little ones you want to get

100
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:54,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">them out in the woods get them to</font>

101
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:56,749
appreciate nature but also get<font color="#E5E5E5"> them to</font>

102
00:04:54,710 --> 00:05:01,549
appreciate hacker culture that's what

103
00:04:56,749 --> 00:05:04,490
it's about so really quick couple of

104
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:06,259
terms just<font color="#E5E5E5"> these are how I interpret</font>

105
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:08,689
these terms just working on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same</font>

106
00:05:06,259 --> 00:05:11,270
page I don't want you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh well you</font>

107
00:05:08,689 --> 00:05:13,069
know cryptography is this well this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

108
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:15,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">what I when I say cryptography in this</font>

109
00:05:13,069 --> 00:05:17,930
talk this is what I mean cryptography is

110
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:19,460
basically you know the art of writing

111
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:23,539
and solving codes it comes from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

112
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:26,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">Greek cryptos meeting hidden and graphy</font>

113
00:05:23,539 --> 00:05:31,039
meaning writing right so on<font color="#CCCCCC"> ciphertext</font>

114
00:05:26,839 --> 00:05:35,240
this is you know the the the code<font color="#E5E5E5"> after</font>

115
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:38,029
it's been encrypted right so so you know

116
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:41,050
a system words letters figure symbols

117
00:05:38,029 --> 00:05:45,430
whatever substituted for a normal

118
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:49,669
message for the purpose of secrecy

119
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:51,620
cipher is the actual making of the

120
00:05:49,669 --> 00:05:55,818
letter letter substitution so the

121
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:57,469
<font color="#CCCCCC">process encryption again another word</font>

122
00:05:55,819 --> 00:06:01,189
<font color="#CCCCCC">that I'll use for a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> process of turning</font>

123
00:05:57,469 --> 00:06:05,629
text or data into a code or you know

124
00:06:01,189 --> 00:06:10,099
ciphertext cryptology is the study of

125
00:06:05,629 --> 00:06:14,360
codes and ciphers and crypto analysis is

126
00:06:10,099 --> 00:06:17,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">the science and of decrypting codes and</font>

127
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:19,580
ciphers so so really<font color="#CCCCCC"> I wanted to set the</font>

128
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:22,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">stage kind of with a little bit of</font>

129
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:27,229
history and then dive into the specific

130
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:29,899
a you know encryption methods that I

131
00:06:27,229 --> 00:06:34,310
used at hacker camp and I've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font>

132
00:06:29,899 --> 00:06:36,169
examples of those those here<font color="#E5E5E5"> mmm so you</font>

133
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:39,620
know we're starting out in ancient times

134
00:06:36,169 --> 00:06:41,299
right on photography has been around<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

135
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:43,110
a long time

136
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:46,039
probably as long as people have been

137
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:49,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">writing people have had the need to</font>

138
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:51,960
maintain some secret or to differentiate

139
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:55,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">their writing in some way so the</font>

140
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:57,090
Egyptians used hieroglyphs as everybody

141
00:06:55,169 --> 00:06:58,469
knows I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the rosetta stone</font>

142
00:06:57,090 --> 00:07:03,719
right and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll talk about that a minute</font>

143
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:06,659
but the hieroglyphs on in about<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1900 BCE</font>

144
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:12,870
on they started using hieroglyphic

145
00:07:06,659 --> 00:07:15,419
substitution as a way to show<font color="#E5E5E5"> a an</font>

146
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:16,860
enlightened Pharaoh right and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font>

147
00:07:15,419 --> 00:07:18,930
remember the Pharaohs name I'm really

148
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:21,990
bad at at pronunciation of egyptian

149
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:23,610
names anyway so but what's interesting

150
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:26,669
kind of about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the rosetta stone is</font>

151
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:28,319
before rosetta stone was discovered we

152
00:07:26,669 --> 00:07:31,440
didn't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> how to interpret these</font>

153
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:32,729
hieroglyphic symbols we kind of had an

154
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,949
idea that that was some kind of language

155
00:07:32,729 --> 00:07:37,440
right but but what the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Rosetta Stone</font>

156
00:07:34,949 --> 00:07:39,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">allowed was it had three languages on</font>

157
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:44,190
there all with the same text right

158
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:46,590
hieroglyphic text a demonic demonic text

159
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:48,419
and ancient<font color="#E5E5E5"> Greek well we knew what you</font>

160
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:50,729
know how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to interpret ancient Greek so</font>

161
00:07:48,419 --> 00:07:53,250
we could extrapolate from that the text

162
00:07:50,729 --> 00:07:57,568
in hieroglyphs so it's kind of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> big</font>

163
00:07:53,250 --> 00:08:02,759
deal um the in ancient China they were

164
00:07:57,569 --> 00:08:06,419
using wax to cover up and hide their

165
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:08,130
their secrets so they would have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a piece</font>

166
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:11,310
of paper and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they would pour wax over it</font>

167
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:13,740
and the wax would cover the the text and

168
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:16,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">then the recipient would break the wax</font>

169
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:22,380
and get in there on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ancient</font>

170
00:08:16,349 --> 00:08:24,659
Assyrians between 1500 to 500 BCE they

171
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:27,169
would use secret tattoos with secret

172
00:08:24,659 --> 00:08:32,218
messages it was a really common thing

173
00:08:27,169 --> 00:08:34,319
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Hebrew scribes around 600 BCE they</font>

174
00:08:32,219 --> 00:08:38,430
used a substitution cipher called at

175
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:42,180
bash i'm not i'm not you know a very

176
00:08:38,429 --> 00:08:44,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">familiar in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tomek a scholarship but from</font>

177
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:48,930
my understanding a pash is almost a

178
00:08:44,579 --> 00:08:52,770
literal translation of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> word the</font>

179
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:54,479
letters in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Hebrew alphabet the alif</font>

180
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:57,089
is like a

181
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:59,100
and the last character<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the Hebrew</font>

182
00:08:57,089 --> 00:09:01,740
alphabet so what what this substitution

183
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:04,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">type were due any time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you had in a you</font>

184
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:08,329
would put a Z and any time you had a B

185
00:09:04,139 --> 00:09:12,899
you would put a why etc right<font color="#E5E5E5"> and and uh</font>

186
00:09:08,329 --> 00:09:14,040
well I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting there hold on so so um</font>

187
00:09:12,899 --> 00:09:17,420
what's kind of interesting about that

188
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:20,459
was I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> the name of the cipher was</font>

189
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:23,519
was the the way that it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was encrypted</font>

190
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:25,439
right so so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> almost kind of</font>

191
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:29,040
conjectured now that it wasn't for

192
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:32,430
secrecy it was to show that there was

193
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:35,849
some special text here it was commonly

194
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:37,888
used in the biblical book of jeremiah so

195
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:39,480
the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> really interesting one is the</font>

196
00:09:37,889 --> 00:09:42,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">Kama Sutra right so everybody has an</font>

197
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:45,029
idea of what the Kama Sutra is right but

198
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:48,180
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a book that had many</font>

199
00:09:45,029 --> 00:09:51,329
techniques that were supposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be what</font>

200
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:53,040
a woman a mature woman would know<font color="#CCCCCC"> right</font>

201
00:09:51,329 --> 00:09:55,829
and and one of the really interesting

202
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:58,439
things in there is it had one of the art

203
00:09:55,829 --> 00:10:00,388
forms I didn't just have sex stuff right

204
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:03,649
it had I had other things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like book</font>

205
00:10:00,389 --> 00:10:05,760
binding and perfume making and and

206
00:10:03,649 --> 00:10:08,130
carpentry and one of the things that

207
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:10,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">have had in there was the art of secret</font>

208
00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:13,860
writing on so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a way that a woman</font>

209
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:16,260
could keep her<font color="#E5E5E5"> affairs secret and it was</font>

210
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:20,970
a basic substitution cipher called the

211
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:23,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">min of slaughter this but but sigh</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Jana</font>

212
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:26,310
cipher so a letter for letter

213
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:30,540
substitution cipher so pretty

214
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:34,079
interesting so how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you guys know</font>

215
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:37,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ass khattala is ok so we got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a few</font>

216
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:38,790
so I have asked<font color="#CCCCCC"> attali my wife and my</font>

217
00:10:37,019 --> 00:10:41,459
kids made this for me I'm so it's

218
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:44,399
khatauli was um kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> considered one</font>

219
00:10:41,459 --> 00:10:48,779
of the first military cipher devices

220
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:50,819
used by the Spartan Greeks around for 75

221
00:10:48,779 --> 00:10:54,060
BCE it's a good example of a

222
00:10:50,819 --> 00:10:56,250
substitution or a transposition cipher

223
00:10:54,060 --> 00:11:01,500
thank you so on who wants<font color="#CCCCCC"> to volunteer</font>

224
00:10:56,250 --> 00:11:05,010
to solve this khattala yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right so</font>

225
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:07,920
so what this guitar was on it and it

226
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:09,779
relied a lot on people

227
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:12,599
knowing how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to read that was kind of</font>

228
00:11:09,779 --> 00:11:15,870
important which at the time was not a

229
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:17,579
problem but so you would<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a</font>

230
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:22,260
messenger who would have a very<font color="#CCCCCC"> secret</font>

231
00:11:17,579 --> 00:11:24,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">message that he or she would carry to</font>

232
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:28,339
correspond some kind of military orders

233
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:32,760
or or information and the recipient

234
00:11:28,339 --> 00:11:34,920
would have a very<font color="#CCCCCC"> specific a pole or a</font>

235
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:36,300
piece of wood that they would wrap the

236
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:38,579
message around and as they wrap the

237
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:40,859
message around the message would become

238
00:11:38,579 --> 00:11:43,589
clear so if you were to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at this now</font>

239
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:47,670
it's just a jumble of letters right but

240
00:11:43,589 --> 00:11:49,170
as you wrap it around the the pole<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

241
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:51,120
the Greeks you know they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

242
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:53,099
specific<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the size of the the pole</font>

243
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:55,110
right so if you have the wrong size pole

244
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:58,920
it wouldn't wouldn't work right so<font color="#CCCCCC"> so I</font>

245
00:11:55,110 --> 00:12:01,110
have a message here and our volunteer

246
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:03,660
what's your<font color="#E5E5E5"> name Chris all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right I</font>

247
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:05,430
provided which is some some tape there

248
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:06,839
Chris because<font color="#CCCCCC"> you might need it to tape</font>

249
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:09,510
down the side but go ahead<font color="#E5E5E5"> and start</font>

250
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:12,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">working on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that and and there's a prize</font>

251
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:14,970
in it for you if it if and<font color="#E5E5E5"> when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you fix</font>

252
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:18,360
you figure out<font color="#E5E5E5"> what the message is so so</font>

253
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:20,040
we'll come back to you but that's

254
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:22,170
essentially that the graphic isn't the

255
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:24,209
best and I apologize about that but on

256
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:26,599
that is essentially what what Chris is

257
00:12:24,209 --> 00:12:31,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">working on there for us and we'll see if</font>

258
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:34,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">timing wise she's able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to get there its</font>

259
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:36,990
pretty long so and and and then back

260
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:39,060
right into the Caesar<font color="#E5E5E5"> cipher</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so we'll</font>

261
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:41,040
check back<font color="#E5E5E5"> with you so how many you guys</font>

262
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:42,089
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what the Caesar cipher is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> alright</font>

263
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:46,230
so so we're going to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> through this</font>

264
00:12:42,089 --> 00:12:47,640
pretty quick so um you know is this was

265
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:51,959
used<font color="#E5E5E5"> in ancient Rome</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there's there's</font>

266
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:55,079
documented information on<font color="#E5E5E5"> Caesar sending</font>

267
00:12:51,959 --> 00:12:57,630
messages to i<font color="#E5E5E5"> think was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> potomac sore</font>

268
00:12:55,079 --> 00:13:00,989
somebody in in germany you know

269
00:12:57,630 --> 00:13:04,620
conveying military orders using this

270
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:07,620
kind of encryption method it's also

271
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:10,199
called a rot<font color="#E5E5E5"> cyber so a rotation cipher</font>

272
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:14,639
it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> classic example of a substitution</font>

273
00:13:10,199 --> 00:13:17,939
cipher um so and I apologize in advance

274
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:20,600
the the letters this is kind of a new if

275
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:22,500
anybody's seen a

276
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,910
presentation I've done in the past this

277
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:27,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">is kind of a new thing for me having</font>

278
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:30,209
text and and and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know this style to</font>

279
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:31,980
it so the text doesn't exactly line up

280
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:35,130
the way I wanted but but this is an

281
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:37,260
example so you have a you know an

282
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:40,320
example of some some<font color="#CCCCCC"> ciphertext here you</font>

283
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:44,240
know it's a substitution<font color="#E5E5E5"> Caesar cipher</font>

284
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:46,740
you also know that it is a classic

285
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:49,380
substitution cipher that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is commonly</font>

286
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:52,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">called a rot13 right so so we have a</font>

287
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:56,430
rot13 table at the top there you know

288
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:59,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">ayee equals n B equals you know oh C</font>

289
00:13:56,430 --> 00:14:03,540
equals<font color="#CCCCCC"> P etc etc</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so how you go through</font>

290
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:07,340
you take<font color="#E5E5E5"> your cipher text and you find</font>

291
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:15,469
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> P and you know that that equals C</font>

292
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:26,700
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you find a the N equals a and</font>

293
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:32,880
so on so Z and Q d/l why anybody have

294
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:34,410
any questions about<font color="#CCCCCC"> that that's a good</font>

295
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">question right so I'm going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to speed it</font>

296
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:37,500
up a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> but if there's no</font>

297
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:40,260
question so so everybody's seen you know

298
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:42,960
rot13 was commonly used in the gold BBS

299
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:44,819
days to hide you know what what we were

300
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:47,400
saying but it was a it was an easy way

301
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:48,870
to to cook that message<font color="#CCCCCC"> Redmond's um I</font>

302
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:50,910
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know if it's still used today it's</font>

303
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:55,320
kind of rot 26 who's a big fan of that

304
00:14:50,910 --> 00:15:01,740
one yes all right every<font color="#E5E5E5"> time every time</font>

305
00:14:55,320 --> 00:15:09,230
so so we speed it up and then we have

306
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:15,210
our super secret message<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so um</font>

307
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:19,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">so that was you know a Caesar let's talk</font>

308
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:20,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">about crypt analysis on that so you know</font>

309
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:23,910
while we were all mucking about in the

310
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:26,660
mud in in Western Europe you know

311
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:30,010
arguing over the inherent rights of

312
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:33,219
tarts wielding swords too

313
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:40,150
you know and and and knights who say nee

314
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:42,050
back back in in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> arabic of</font>

315
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:45,189
civilization they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually working</font>

316
00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:49,400
on things like math and and and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

317
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:52,100
language and and so so there was a there

318
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:56,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">was a gentleman called al Kindi who</font>

319
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:59,210
wrote on a or a manifesto essentially

320
00:15:56,690 --> 00:16:03,610
that was called decrypting and cryptic

321
00:15:59,210 --> 00:16:07,430
correspondence this was around 850<font color="#E5E5E5"> siiii</font>

322
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:09,830
and in it and that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first page of</font>

323
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:13,160
it there an<font color="#E5E5E5"> example of it but it</font>

324
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:16,580
basically went through how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

325
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:19,850
frequency analysis which if you if you

326
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:22,580
know what that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that the Caesar cipher</font>

327
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:24,800
is very<font color="#E5E5E5"> susceptible to frequency</font>

328
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:27,890
analysis<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll jump back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

329
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:30,020
quick so you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> see and this this</font>

330
00:16:27,890 --> 00:16:31,939
message may not be the best one but you

331
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:35,420
can see certain letters reoccurring over

332
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:38,120
and over again and if the<font color="#CCCCCC"> keys are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

333
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:39,500
the language<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's in potentially</font>

334
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:41,960
know who sent knew who sent the message

335
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:44,390
knew who was the recipient of the

336
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:47,540
message then you could somehow derive

337
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:49,490
you know the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> message from that lays</font>

338
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:51,680
occur commonly is the most commonly

339
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:55,339
occurring letter in the English language

340
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:57,920
so so if you you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a rot13</font>

341
00:16:55,339 --> 00:17:00,490
message chances are<font color="#CCCCCC"> if there's a lot of</font>

342
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:10,938
letters in there that are the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

343
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:14,089
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> um also in the 1400s there was a 14</font>

344
00:17:10,939 --> 00:17:15,650
volume encyclopedia written by<font color="#E5E5E5"> another</font>

346
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:23,929
slaughter they're called the ship all

347
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:26,948
<font color="#CCCCCC">Asha and it had a whole volume dedicated</font>

348
00:17:23,929 --> 00:17:31,370
to crypto analysis the only real

349
00:17:26,949 --> 00:17:35,450
documented case of crypto analysis in

350
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:40,520
the you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know the Middle Ages in Europe</font>

351
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:42,140
were monks cloistered up they were you

352
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:43,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">know kind of focused</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on intellectual</font>

353
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:44,570
idea

354
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:46,820
but they<font color="#E5E5E5"> were looking in the Bible for</font>

355
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:48,740
things on that that they could

356
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:51,020
extrapolate<font color="#CCCCCC"> and codes and things like</font>

357
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:55,940
that so so we weren't completely lost

358
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:59,840
just mostly um it's worth noting there

359
00:17:55,940 --> 00:18:01,940
to that around<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time Mary Queen of</font>

360
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:04,939
Scots happened so just a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little bit of</font>

361
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:07,340
trivia there if anybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> knows who she</font>

362
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:09,260
was and what happened to<font color="#E5E5E5"> her basically a</font>

363
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:13,070
big crypto fail that ended in her head

364
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:15,760
getting lopped off so um<font color="#E5E5E5"> so secrets are</font>

365
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:18,770
important right so<font color="#E5E5E5"> so moving on to the</font>

366
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:21,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">Vanier</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cipher and I'm not French so if</font>

367
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:23,930
I'm mispronouncing that apologies but

368
00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:27,740
it's essentially and this is a this is a

369
00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:31,910
simplified version of a tabular ekta or

370
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:34,220
a van a square it's called<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> couple</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

371
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:37,370
different things but it's a series of

372
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:39,980
different Caesar ciphers essentially

373
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:44,120
what's really unique about this is it

374
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:46,370
introduced the use of a code word the

375
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:50,530
code word is interesting because we see

376
00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:53,899
it's the concept of a shared secret

377
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:57,560
reoccurring even in today's cryptography

378
00:18:53,900 --> 00:19:02,900
right it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> great example of a</font>

379
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:05,240
polyalphabetic substitution cipher so

380
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:08,660
before<font color="#CCCCCC"> I get into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that house this guitar</font>

381
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:15,320
going awesome awesome cool I think

382
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:20,420
you're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make it um so we have</font>

383
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:23,389
this bit of<font color="#E5E5E5"> ciphertext and since we're</font>

384
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:25,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">the right the the recipient of the</font>

385
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:28,100
message we did not intercept this we

386
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:30,980
know on you know who it's from<font color="#E5E5E5"> what the</font>

387
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:33,320
method of encryption is we also know the

388
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:41,000
shared secret the key word right the

389
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:43,610
code word it's chocolate right so this

390
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:46,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">is your safe word</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> too awesome</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good to</font>

391
00:19:43,610 --> 00:19:48,770
know so how we would decrypt this

392
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:50,540
message we take our<font color="#E5E5E5"> ciphertext and we</font>

393
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:53,120
repeat the code word over and over again

394
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:54,590
and match it up and again apologies that

395
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:56,629
the letters don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> match up perfectly</font>

396
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:59,090
there

397
00:19:56,630 --> 00:20:03,590
but we take we take our tabular ekta are

398
00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:07,370
our<font color="#E5E5E5"> Vinny a square and we select the</font>

399
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:09,949
first letter of our code word C and we

400
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:14,030
go<font color="#CCCCCC"> over to the first letter of our</font>

401
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:18,020
cipher text which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is why and then we go</font>

402
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:27,560
up and that is our message letter or

403
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:32,300
clear text w do the same with h2o up to

404
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:48,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">H again so see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how that happens there</font>

405
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:51,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay 00 2 s is e c 2 t r 0 to s be any</font>

406
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:58,459
questions concerns on how that<font color="#E5E5E5"> happens</font>

407
00:20:51,020 --> 00:21:00,200
yes sir yes sir yep<font color="#E5E5E5"> yep</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so it just</font>

408
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:04,190
repeats for every letter yep absolutely

409
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:07,310
yeah so I don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> if it's if it's a</font>

410
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:08,690
parent there but yeah so and there are a

411
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:11,540
couple different ways<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do this I've</font>

412
00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:14,480
seen I you know for for ease of a

413
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:16,520
presentation<font color="#CCCCCC"> I kept the the letters in</font>

414
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:19,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">the same place as the words of the of</font>

415
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:21,410
the encrypted message sometimes we will

416
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:24,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">break it up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know groups of five five</font>

417
00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:26,690
five and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have to kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

418
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:29,239
all together once you have the decrypted

419
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:31,900
message but so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll jump through this</font>

420
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:31,900
really quick here

421
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:42,260
this is a really<font color="#CCCCCC"> easy one to encrypt and</font>

422
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:44,189
decrypt and and is<font color="#E5E5E5"> really pretty pretty</font>

423
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:46,710
secret if you don't know the<font color="#E5E5E5"> keyword</font>

424
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:53,190
because the alphabet keeps changing so

425
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:57,660
so where is fancy breath so so yeah it's

426
00:21:53,190 --> 00:22:00,810
it's a it was a tough<font color="#CCCCCC"> one and it and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

427
00:21:57,660 --> 00:22:04,410
kept people thinking for a long time on

428
00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:07,560
how to break it and and how to use<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

429
00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:10,110
and use it well<font color="#E5E5E5"> easily especially in the</font>

430
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:14,159
field sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> called field</font>

431
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:18,179
cryptography right some people<font color="#CCCCCC"> that were</font>

432
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:21,330
really really taken with this this this

433
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:24,530
method and crypto analyzing this method

434
00:22:21,330 --> 00:22:29,280
everybody know who that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> left</font>

435
00:22:24,530 --> 00:22:31,260
there's Charles Babbage a bon vivant if

436
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:33,420
you will so<font color="#E5E5E5"> so he's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just a guy that</font>

437
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:35,490
liked to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> really cool things right and</font>

438
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:38,460
at one point<font color="#E5E5E5"> he was challenged to</font>

439
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:41,430
decrypt<font color="#E5E5E5"> Vinny a a lot of people thought</font>

440
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:45,240
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was indecipherable and he actually</font>

441
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:48,330
figured out how to do it his findings he

442
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:50,010
did that back in 1854 but his it never

443
00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:51,840
actually published his findings his

444
00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:54,060
findings weren't published until the

445
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:56,040
1970s there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are a couple other people</font>

446
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:58,350
that that successfully were able to show

447
00:22:56,040 --> 00:23:00,510
crypto analysis of the yay after that

448
00:22:58,350 --> 00:23:02,570
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the time he</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was one of the first</font>

449
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:05,640
people interesting fact about Babbage

450
00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:09,870
everybody know what the difference

451
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:11,340
engine is so he's so potentially the

452
00:23:09,870 --> 00:23:13,739
first computer if he could have built it

453
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:16,709
he designed that they also hung out with

454
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:19,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">IDA Lovelace really cool lady so so</font>

455
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:22,080
considered one of the first programmers

456
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:28,530
on the guy in the middle anybody know

457
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:33,090
who that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> up close his pen name Lewis</font>

458
00:23:28,530 --> 00:23:36,600
Carroll Charles Ludwig<font color="#E5E5E5"> Dodgson so Lewis</font>

459
00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:38,550
Carroll he actually said<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the Vanier</font>

460
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:40,800
cipher was unbreakable in eighteen sixty

461
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:42,300
eight so even though it had already been

462
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:44,220
broken but he was a really big

463
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:47,520
mathematician you can find a lot of

464
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:48,460
secrets and codes in his work on last

465
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:50,560
guy

466
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:55,380
everybody else who that is right po

467
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:57,790
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> on so on he he did not directly</font>

468
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:59,560
talk about<font color="#CCCCCC"> Vinnie a but what's really</font>

469
00:23:57,790 --> 00:24:05,860
cool about<font color="#E5E5E5"> him and in popular culture</font>

470
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:08,320
was in the 1843 he wrote the gold-bug

471
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:10,240
which is one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those stories</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> reading</font>

472
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:12,070
and I've read<font color="#E5E5E5"> in middle school was like</font>

473
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,840
oh<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's kind of cool</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> um but actually</font>

474
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:16,629
goes through<font color="#CCCCCC"> step by step how to</font>

475
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:18,220
decipher an encrypted message and it

476
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:20,680
just kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> piqued my interest as a kid</font>

477
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:22,690
I really really liked<font color="#E5E5E5"> Poe yeah</font>

478
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:26,050
interestingly also put out<font color="#CCCCCC"> a challenge</font>

479
00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:28,030
in a periodical called the

480
00:24:26,050 --> 00:24:30,669
Philadelphia's<font color="#E5E5E5"> Alexander weekly</font>

481
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:33,879
messenger claiming that he could decrypt

482
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:37,030
any monoalphabetic substitution cipher

483
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:38,620
and he successfully deciphered all of

484
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:43,710
the hundreds of submissions that were

485
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:45,699
sent it so so big into codes and and

486
00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:47,110
definitely if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have not read the</font>

487
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:51,730
gold-bug since middle school or high

488
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:56,490
school<font color="#CCCCCC"> i recommend it so fun stuff how</font>

489
00:24:51,730 --> 00:24:56,490
we doing you got it what<font color="#E5E5E5"> do you got</font>

490
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:14,630
very good sir<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right so your prize I</font>

491
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:16,850
know you already have applied

492
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:19,580
cryptography we talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that but</font>

493
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:22,969
you can select a book I have a copy of

494
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:24,740
neal stephenson's cryptonomicon awesome

495
00:25:22,970 --> 00:25:28,100
all right there<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go thank you</font>

496
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:29,990
appreciate it if<font color="#CCCCCC"> anybody else wants</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

497
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:32,240
check out this<font color="#CCCCCC"> khattala it'll be up here</font>

498
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:36,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">and i'll probably be at the the compy</font>

499
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:38,690
net tenable table after so so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have a</font>

500
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:40,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">couple more books</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and I'm crypto</font>

501
00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:42,890
challenges so whoever solves those other

502
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:44,090
crypto challenges first you get your

503
00:25:42,890 --> 00:25:51,080
choice of a couple of books i'll talk

504
00:25:44,090 --> 00:25:53,870
about that<font color="#E5E5E5"> later yeah so some early</font>

505
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:58,189
cipher machines most of these machines

506
00:25:53,870 --> 00:26:00,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">on the left there on the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> albertini</font>

507
00:25:58,190 --> 00:26:03,650
cipher machine on a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> these were</font>

508
00:26:00,890 --> 00:26:06,970
really just ways to try and streamline

509
00:26:03,650 --> 00:26:10,460
using<font color="#CCCCCC"> VIN yay or caesar for that matter</font>

510
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:14,120
variants on the Caesar cipher in in the

511
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:17,360
field right for military use things like

512
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:19,969
<font color="#CCCCCC">that most of these were substitution</font>

513
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:22,580
ciphers the<font color="#CCCCCC"> wheatstone the second one</font>

514
00:26:19,970 --> 00:26:26,330
they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> used instead of letters</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

515
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:28,939
use symbols on the Jeffersonian sim

516
00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:34,669
cylinder this is commonly attributed to

517
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:36,380
a Jefferson but it's never been proved

518
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:38,930
that he actually used one I have a toy

519
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:40,160
version of it here if anybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> wants to</font>

520
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:41,900
try<font color="#CCCCCC"> and take a look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at it I have a</font>

521
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:45,350
secret message but<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically you would</font>

522
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:48,350
line up it's a series of wheels and in

523
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:50,540
an official grade one you can move the

524
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:52,370
wheels around so you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

525
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:54,620
sneaky with your message but you

526
00:26:52,370 --> 00:26:57,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">essentially have your your your message</font>

527
00:26:54,620 --> 00:27:00,050
your clear text and you line it up and

528
00:26:57,020 --> 00:27:02,420
then you<font color="#E5E5E5"> pick another another line and</font>

529
00:27:00,050 --> 00:27:09,590
you know it's completely corrupted ZX +

530
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:11,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">H see you I see ze let us see ya CN</font>

531
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:13,399
right and then you'd look through here

532
00:27:11,690 --> 00:27:16,370
and see that there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a secret message</font>

533
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:22,340
so anybody wants to check this<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

534
00:27:16,370 --> 00:27:25,429
up and look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> it or after the last one</font>

535
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:29,090
that's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> picture from the the crypto</font>

536
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:34,460
museum at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the NSA that is a Confederate</font>

537
00:27:29,090 --> 00:27:36,620
cipher<font color="#E5E5E5"> disk on from the Civil War so so</font>

538
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:39,650
one interesting tidbit about that is<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

539
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:42,830
know again they<font color="#CCCCCC"> had a as a variation on</font>

540
00:27:39,650 --> 00:27:45,650
beignet they had code words and they

541
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:48,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">used primarily</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the same three code words</font>

542
00:27:45,650 --> 00:27:50,059
or phrases throughout the whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> war so</font>

543
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:53,330
once once the Allies<font color="#E5E5E5"> had figure those</font>

544
00:27:50,059 --> 00:27:55,450
out and had access to their device or

545
00:27:53,330 --> 00:28:00,830
not the Allies excuse me the-the-the-the

546
00:27:55,450 --> 00:28:03,200
northerns folks the Yanks they they were

547
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:07,449
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to decrypt</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Yanks what version</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

548
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:12,380
that had letters and numbers on it a

549
00:28:07,450 --> 00:28:15,800
series of zeros<font color="#CCCCCC"> and eight so another fun</font>

550
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:17,390
one is the mexican army cipher<font color="#CCCCCC"> disk this</font>

551
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:19,428
was a this is considered

552
00:28:17,390 --> 00:28:21,500
state-of-the-art<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here is a</font>

553
00:28:19,429 --> 00:28:23,860
toy version of it essentially but it was

554
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:29,150
used during the border war with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> US</font>

555
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:33,219
early 1900s it's a monoalphabetic cipher

556
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:35,780
but essentially how you use it is the

557
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:37,900
the sender of the message the receiver

558
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:41,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the message would have an agreed-upon</font>

559
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:43,220
setting where you would have you know

560
00:28:41,090 --> 00:28:46,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">the letter A equals it's a series of</font>

561
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:48,530
numbers around each each wheel right so

562
00:28:46,370 --> 00:28:54,889
the letter A<font color="#E5E5E5"> you would have a shared</font>

563
00:28:48,530 --> 00:28:57,678
secret of you know a 529 60 0 and then

564
00:28:54,890 --> 00:29:00,800
you would send<font color="#E5E5E5"> a series of encoded</font>

565
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:03,890
messages and using that you could

566
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:06,260
decrypt it um if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> continue</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to use the</font>

567
00:29:03,890 --> 00:29:08,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">same setting over and over again people</font>

568
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:11,120
get you know wind of it they understand

569
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:13,240
it they get the device very easy to

570
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:16,309
intercept and decrypt the messages

571
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:18,950
what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting is I've seen this guy</font>

572
00:29:16,309 --> 00:29:20,629
did a video where he uses a on youtube

573
00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:24,470
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I saw it on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the internet so you know</font>

574
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:27,610
it works but<font color="#E5E5E5"> he actually makes it so</font>

575
00:29:24,470 --> 00:29:29,170
that this is still a fairly decent

576
00:29:27,610 --> 00:29:33,270
encryption device

577
00:29:29,170 --> 00:29:36,610
which is interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> by changing the the</font>

578
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:39,570
rotation of the wheels with each letter

579
00:29:36,610 --> 00:29:43,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're decrypting it really makes it</font>

580
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:46,000
pretty and pretty tough to crack so so

581
00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:49,810
another one that's that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> really common</font>

582
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:53,920
on that kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of came out of the cracking</font>

583
00:29:49,810 --> 00:29:56,190
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Vin yay was a one-time pad which is</font>

584
00:29:53,920 --> 00:30:03,730
basically considered an uncrackable

585
00:29:56,190 --> 00:30:08,680
piece of encryption so very good any

586
00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:11,410
questions about that awesome so the big

587
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:15,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">one enigma right everybody knows enigma</font>

588
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:17,110
or it everybody knows enigma yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

589
00:30:15,850 --> 00:30:20,290
good you haven't seen a low no it's good

590
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:21,610
good good<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right so um you know all</font>

591
00:30:20,290 --> 00:30:25,060
these things we've done in hacker camp

592
00:30:21,610 --> 00:30:28,300
right codes you know 100 200 s this was

593
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:30,730
the 500 right this was the big dog um so

594
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:33,850
encryption<font color="#CCCCCC"> was a rotor based</font>

595
00:30:30,730 --> 00:30:36,970
cryptographic device so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you had</font>

596
00:30:33,850 --> 00:30:40,090
different rotors that would move and the

597
00:30:36,970 --> 00:30:43,690
text would change as you you know in

598
00:30:40,090 --> 00:30:45,669
cipher and decipher message right some

599
00:30:43,690 --> 00:30:49,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the first rotor machines started</font>

600
00:30:45,670 --> 00:30:53,830
showing up around 1915 a couple of dutch

601
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:55,870
naval officers developed it they<font color="#CCCCCC"> believe</font>

602
00:30:53,830 --> 00:31:00,340
there were only two rotors and that one

603
00:30:55,870 --> 00:31:02,979
the it was a then modified with a

604
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:06,909
keyboard and the light system to input

605
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:09,670
the text and you know spit out the the

606
00:31:06,910 --> 00:31:13,480
decrypted message the actual enigma that

607
00:31:09,670 --> 00:31:15,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">was used by the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> nazis and world war two</font>

608
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:20,020
was developed around nineteen eighteen

609
00:31:15,850 --> 00:31:22,570
by<font color="#CCCCCC"> arthur sri bius that actually had</font>

610
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:24,820
three interchangeable rotors see not

611
00:31:22,570 --> 00:31:26,770
only with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the rotors move but you had</font>

612
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:28,899
different rotors with letters and

613
00:31:26,770 --> 00:31:33,879
different locations on them so so pretty

614
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:38,560
pretty amazing they had a plug board to

615
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:40,270
to change how the the the text was

616
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:41,580
reflected and that'll make<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit</font>

617
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:42,930
more sense and

618
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:44,669
a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> minutes if you're not familiar</font>

619
00:31:42,930 --> 00:31:48,830
with the inner workings of the day

620
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:48,830
enigma but some interesting statistics

621
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:56,670
the the increased as you increase the

622
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:59,150
rotors it increases<font color="#E5E5E5"> the the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ability to</font>

623
00:31:56,670 --> 00:32:06,450
decrypt the message exponentially right

624
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:09,090
so big numbers so as as<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have you</font>

625
00:32:06,450 --> 00:32:12,420
know with with three wheels six pairs<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

626
00:32:09,090 --> 00:32:16,199
letters that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are swapped that increases</font>

627
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:20,280
the possible settings of keys to 159

628
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:21,870
million million million right and you

629
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:24,330
know if you had a thousand

630
00:32:21,870 --> 00:32:27,419
cryptographers each with captured enigma

631
00:32:24,330 --> 00:32:29,310
machines and they'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> have tested for keys</font>

632
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:32,160
per minute all day every day it would

633
00:32:29,310 --> 00:32:34,830
take<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1.8 billion years to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> try every</font>

634
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:39,510
combination that kind of gives you an

635
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:41,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">idea right so when I was researching</font>

636
00:32:39,510 --> 00:32:44,550
hacker camp I found<font color="#E5E5E5"> this really cool</font>

637
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:47,629
thing called the paper enigma so so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

638
00:32:44,550 --> 00:32:50,430
is really a very simple offline

639
00:32:47,630 --> 00:32:52,110
representation of what enigma does was

640
00:32:50,430 --> 00:32:55,290
developed by a guy<font color="#E5E5E5"> Michael cause he</font>

641
00:32:52,110 --> 00:32:58,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">works for Google now and there's a link</font>

642
00:32:55,290 --> 00:33:01,110
there to a google code page that he has

643
00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:02,850
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> a I think it's JavaScript or a</font>

644
00:33:01,110 --> 00:33:06,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">working version of the pay cut paper</font>

645
00:33:02,850 --> 00:33:10,350
enigma on his website but essentially

646
00:33:06,570 --> 00:33:13,020
you have there on the the right side of

647
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:16,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">the page</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your your cylinders thinks I</font>

648
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:16,610
could<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> holdup I've got them here too</font>

649
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:22,530
but you take your handy-dandy scissors

650
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:27,360
and you cut along the dotted line just

651
00:33:22,530 --> 00:33:30,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">like in a kindergarten right on and you</font>

652
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:35,389
have rotor one two and three and the

653
00:33:30,450 --> 00:33:39,060
rotors are then placed into over the the

654
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:44,430
input output and reflector and you

655
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:47,610
notice the the arrows on the right side

656
00:33:44,430 --> 00:33:51,270
of the the rotor placement<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

657
00:33:47,610 --> 00:33:54,520
indicates that the rotor moves as you

658
00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:58,090
were to type in the letter right so so

659
00:33:54,520 --> 00:34:01,770
rotor three moves every time you input a

660
00:33:58,090 --> 00:34:06,040
letter and it basically goes across

661
00:34:01,770 --> 00:34:09,520
reflects back and then gives you your

662
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:15,040
plaintext letter and and i have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

663
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:17,020
obtained secret footage of how to use

664
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:23,590
this device and we'll see if<font color="#E5E5E5"> this works</font>

665
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:25,060
so so let's let's escape works<font color="#E5E5E5"> alright</font>

666
00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:28,300
so first thing you want to do clean<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font>

667
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:31,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">your workspace you'll want anything else</font>

668
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:32,710
distracting you this is sped<font color="#CCCCCC"> up a little</font>

669
00:34:31,210 --> 00:34:36,250
bit this decryption took about<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10</font>

670
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:38,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">minutes so you see the rotor move I</font>

671
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:41,530
can't actually see it going so that's

672
00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:44,740
kind of tough would you see I<font color="#CCCCCC"> move the</font>

673
00:34:41,530 --> 00:34:48,580
rotor and or not<font color="#E5E5E5"> me some secret person</font>

674
00:34:44,739 --> 00:34:52,080
somewhere um and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our first</font>

675
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:55,418
letter so worth noting on the the

676
00:34:52,080 --> 00:35:01,110
placement of the rotors is that shared

677
00:34:55,418 --> 00:35:04,140
secret key word at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bottom eff and so</font>

678
00:35:01,110 --> 00:35:08,410
each letter is run through the process

679
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:12,910
the the crypto message and then given

680
00:35:08,410 --> 00:35:14,410
the plaintext letter so again the

681
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:16,690
machine would have done this for you but

682
00:35:14,410 --> 00:35:18,990
by doing the paper enigma the the goal

683
00:35:16,690 --> 00:35:21,280
of the hope the idea is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you'll</font>

684
00:35:18,990 --> 00:35:23,379
understand a little bit more intimately

685
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:25,510
how the device itself worked it's not

686
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:28,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">just a black box anymore it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not an</font>

687
00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:32,590
enigma anymore it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's obtainable it's</font>

688
00:35:28,870 --> 00:35:36,400
understandable and so it speeds up here

689
00:35:32,590 --> 00:35:39,760
in a second and what what you want to

690
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:41,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">look</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for is when rotor two moves so</font>

691
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:44,860
right now rotor one is the only<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

692
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:47,950
moving we've got the first kind of start

693
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:55,390
of the of the the the the message there

694
00:35:47,950 --> 00:35:58,240
and it's about<font color="#CCCCCC"> 12 letters in something</font>

695
00:35:55,390 --> 00:36:00,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that when rotor</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> two moves but that</font>

696
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:02,979
as a message would become longer and

697
00:36:00,550 --> 00:36:05,650
more complex you would see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> rotor to</font>

698
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:06,270
would move every so often and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

699
00:36:05,650 --> 00:36:08,410
ultimate

700
00:36:06,270 --> 00:36:11,410
the one all the way on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Left would</font>

701
00:36:08,410 --> 00:36:22,149
move so so really increasing the the

702
00:36:11,410 --> 00:36:24,670
difficulty of decrypting the message um

703
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:26,890
so there's these<font color="#E5E5E5"> uh there's kind of hard</font>

704
00:36:24,670 --> 00:36:29,440
to see there but there's arrows to the

705
00:36:26,890 --> 00:36:31,569
right of the rotor so as as rotor one

706
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:34,690
moves up there's a there's a little

707
00:36:31,570 --> 00:36:36,910
arrow at the top so that it signifies

708
00:36:34,690 --> 00:36:42,520
every time that rotor moves<font color="#E5E5E5"> but then</font>

709
00:36:36,910 --> 00:36:44,230
there's a black arrow on<font color="#E5E5E5"> there on yeah</font>

710
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:50,740
yeah you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> come up and grab a sheet of</font>

711
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:52,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">North but yeah so it see here the arrow</font>

712
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:54,160
yeah absolutely<font color="#E5E5E5"> and there's instructions</font>

713
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:56,529
on the bottom I have a ton of these

714
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:58,180
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is you know part of the the</font>

715
00:36:56,530 --> 00:37:02,950
challenge right is going through in a

716
00:36:58,180 --> 00:37:04,419
paper enigma so so feel free<font color="#E5E5E5"> to come up</font>

717
00:37:02,950 --> 00:37:09,009
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> grab these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> L so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I have the Vinny I</font>

718
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:14,280
squares here as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> so any questions</font>

719
00:37:09,010 --> 00:37:14,280
around that so it's a fun um yes sir

720
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:27,729
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about crypto</font>

721
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:27,730
analyzing it in a second but but I mean

722
00:37:28,270 --> 00:37:33,350
absolutely<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that that's what i just</font>

723
00:37:30,830 --> 00:37:35,480
showed was a decrypt of an encrypted

724
00:37:33,350 --> 00:37:39,470
message there and and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> through</font>

725
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:41,510
it uh you know yes yeah yeah same

726
00:37:39,470 --> 00:37:45,669
setting and everything yes so so that

727
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:50,570
shared secret is is is key there right

728
00:37:45,670 --> 00:37:52,700
so so cracking enigma right so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

729
00:37:50,570 --> 00:37:57,230
this is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very popular eyes story it's</font>

730
00:37:52,700 --> 00:38:01,040
it's a key part of cryptonomicon the

731
00:37:57,230 --> 00:38:03,610
book but also you know what<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

732
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:06,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">difference what's the name</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the movie</font>

733
00:38:03,610 --> 00:38:08,869
difference engine yeah or didn't know

734
00:38:06,470 --> 00:38:10,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">the imitation game right so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> uh</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

735
00:38:08,869 --> 00:38:13,760
kind of you know talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> Alan</font>

736
00:38:10,970 --> 00:38:18,230
Turing and and his time at Bletchley

737
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:20,660
Park but so so how did they crack this

738
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:25,100
in World War two right how did<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

739
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:27,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">happen umm so so it started in Poland</font>

740
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:32,480
they intercepted one of the devices in

741
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:35,630
about nineteen<font color="#E5E5E5"> twenty eight so the the</font>

742
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:37,690
and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> polls math the out of it</font>

743
00:38:35,630 --> 00:38:40,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">right they started</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing the work</font>

744
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:43,880
breaking the three rotor enigma from

745
00:38:40,130 --> 00:38:46,460
1932 to 1939 so intercepting messages

746
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:51,080
and being able to actively break those

747
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:54,830
messages through math that changed as

748
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:58,220
the Nazis added more rotors to to the

749
00:38:54,830 --> 00:39:00,259
Enigma it kind of became overwhelmed so

750
00:38:58,220 --> 00:39:02,839
they had that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know as the war went</font>

751
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:05,390
on actually kind of started right on

752
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:07,190
1939 they handed over all their findings

753
00:39:05,390 --> 00:39:11,089
to the French and ultimately the English

754
00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:15,109
and that's where Bletchley Park happened

755
00:39:11,090 --> 00:39:20,510
where you know they<font color="#E5E5E5"> had I believe is a</font>

756
00:39:15,109 --> 00:39:21,470
hundred<font color="#E5E5E5"> and forty of the bombs is what</font>

757
00:39:20,510 --> 00:39:24,380
they were called so these are

758
00:39:21,470 --> 00:39:26,959
essentially enigmas built on enigmas

759
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:29,780
built on enigmas and an automated way of

760
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:32,780
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to crack the code within a time</font>

761
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:35,800
frame before the Nazis moved to a new

762
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:35,800
shared secret

763
00:39:36,109 --> 00:39:42,900
when about 1942<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Germans added</font>

764
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:45,599
another rotor to the u-boats enigmas

765
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:48,990
because I was a really really secretive

766
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:51,270
part of the day operation and and the

767
00:39:48,990 --> 00:39:53,819
<font color="#CCCCCC">was a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little less commonly known as the</font>

768
00:39:51,270 --> 00:39:57,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">u.s. got involved and decrypting these</font>

769
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:59,520
messages as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well the US Navy worked with</font>

770
00:39:57,240 --> 00:40:03,209
the National Cash Register company they

771
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:07,040
built<font color="#E5E5E5"> 121 us made bombs that were used</font>

772
00:40:03,210 --> 00:40:11,400
from September 1943 to march of 1945

773
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:13,609
actively decrypting a u-boat messages

774
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:17,160
and also messages for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Luftwaffe and</font>

775
00:40:13,609 --> 00:40:20,340
the land forces so pretty pretty

776
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:22,440
interesting stuff again what what I

777
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:25,800
guess really excites me about this is

778
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:28,830
these these were early computers and and

779
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:36,330
the use of these led directly to you

780
00:40:28,830 --> 00:40:38,970
know this in my mind right so um these

781
00:40:36,330 --> 00:40:40,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">are just some resources and credits that</font>

782
00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:43,009
I have to give<font color="#E5E5E5"> out you know obviously I</font>

783
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:46,950
said I'm not not not the<font color="#E5E5E5"> smartest guy</font>

784
00:40:43,010 --> 00:40:49,710
but you know what<font color="#CCCCCC"> inspired me for this</font>

785
00:40:46,950 --> 00:40:51,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">Neal Stephenson's cryptonomicon a really</font>

786
00:40:49,710 --> 00:40:54,750
cool piece of<font color="#E5E5E5"> fiction if you haven't</font>

787
00:40:51,930 --> 00:40:58,710
read it highly recommend it you know it

788
00:40:54,750 --> 00:41:00,810
has real people like Alan Turing and he

789
00:40:58,710 --> 00:41:03,869
inserts fictional characters that

790
00:41:00,810 --> 00:41:06,240
interact<font color="#E5E5E5"> with them to help at Bletchley</font>

791
00:41:03,869 --> 00:41:07,619
Park and then also a a more modern day

792
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:09,868
setting that still really holds true

793
00:41:07,619 --> 00:41:12,570
even though the books what probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10</font>

794
00:41:09,869 --> 00:41:16,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">15 years old now so so great great novel</font>

795
00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:19,710
highly recommend it the code book by

796
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:23,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">Simon's sting I think is how you say his</font>

797
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:25,200
name um but that's right here amazing

798
00:41:23,430 --> 00:41:28,379
book if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> interested in the history</font>

799
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:30,720
of cryptography solve the puzzle you may

800
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:32,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the chance to pick this the other</font>

801
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:34,200
one just because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that this</font>

802
00:41:32,790 --> 00:41:37,290
applies directly to us be very

803
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:41,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">sought-after second edition of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Bruce</font>

806
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:48,750
enigma I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to tell</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you which</font>

00:41:48,150 --> 00:41:50,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">is which</font>

808
00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:52,110
but if you've been paying attention at

809
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:54,089
all it<font color="#E5E5E5"> should be apparent I have paper</font>

enigmas here I have been the I squares

811
00:41:54,090 --> 00:41:58,650
here if you can solve the text you're

812
00:41:56,670 --> 00:42:00,390
one of the first two people now to solve

813
00:41:58,650 --> 00:42:04,680
the text you get to choose one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

825
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:42,750
you're interested<font color="#E5E5E5"> in crypto analysis and</font>

826
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:45,540
crypto analysis exercises is the black

00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:54,480
giveaways that's his website really

830
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:59,540
really cool exercises in paper

831

cryptography so any questions concerns

832
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:07,009
tomatoes great thank you
