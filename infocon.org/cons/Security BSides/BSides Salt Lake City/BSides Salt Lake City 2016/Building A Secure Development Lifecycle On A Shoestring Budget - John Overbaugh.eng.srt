more reliable that go<font color="#CCCCCC"> higher performing</font>

00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:20,340
all right and I'm kind of a walker so as

the name and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk i'm giving today</font>

12
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:43,500
is about building a secure development

00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:52,739
with and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know there seems to be this</font>

17
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:55,129
prevailing concept that one building

18
00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:57,209
secure code is difficult and to

19
00:00:55,129 --> 00:00:59,070
developing coming up with a secure

20
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:00,989
development<font color="#CCCCCC"> lifecycle is a very</font>

21
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:04,080
expensive<font color="#E5E5E5"> process that requires bringing</font>

22
00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:06,658
in large companies with big bills like

23
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:08,610
digital and I can<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell you from my own</font>

24
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:11,850
experience that that's not the case<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

25
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:13,590
fact you really can do this on your own

26
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:14,939
without any outside help so that's kind

27
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:17,189
of we're going to talk about today<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

28
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:19,559
not going to tell you what your secure

00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:22,619
development lifecycle should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

30
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:24,180
that's sort of your<font color="#E5E5E5"> decision not mine it</font>

00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:25,259
depends<font color="#E5E5E5"> on your culture depends on what</font>

00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:27,180
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> trying to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> build it depends on</font>

33
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:28,290
your regulation and so forth what I am

34
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:30,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to talk about are some of the</font>

35
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:31,350
strategies that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> used in the past to</font>

36
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:33,479
build a secure development lifecycle

37
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:35,640
talk about some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the resources that</font>

38
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:37,079
are available<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you and answer any</font>

39
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,119
questions that you might have as we go

40
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:40,199
along please don't be afraid to

41
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:42,360
interrupt in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the middle of the</font>

42
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:44,909
presentation I do have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> question how</font>

43
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:48,810
many people here are actually developers

44
00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:53,909
write code and then how many<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

45
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:58,409
managers and how many are<font color="#CCCCCC"> infosec</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

46
00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:59,520
all right good great so the first

47
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:00,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">question you have to ask yourself</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

48
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,060
what is a secure development life cycle

49
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:05,759
and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> way</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I like to talk about it is</font>

50
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:07,380
simplified it's the tools the skills and

51
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:11,730
the process<font color="#CCCCCC"> is it that we need to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> build</font>

52
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:13,440
increasingly secure code I never say to

53
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:13,649
build secure code because how do you

54
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,379
measure

55
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:18,540
that what is secure code what's secure

56
00:02:16,379 --> 00:02:20,780
today will not be secured tomorrow the

57
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:24,298
idea is that it's an iterative process

58
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:25,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">having an STL is really all about moving</font>

59
00:02:24,299 --> 00:02:28,159
from being reactive to being proactive

60
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:33,149
that's that's all that's all it is

61
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:35,069
reactive well proactive in terms of what

62
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:38,519
hackers are doing today proactive in

63
00:02:35,069 --> 00:02:40,409
terms of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the current attacks but</font>

64
00:02:38,519 --> 00:02:45,420
also proactive in terms of regulation

65
00:02:40,409 --> 00:02:48,090
and other requirements<font color="#E5E5E5"> so it doesn't</font>

66
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:49,679
cost significantly more to build secure

67
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:52,590
code than it does to build<font color="#E5E5E5"> insecure code</font>

68
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:54,239
because in the end<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're typing</font>

69
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:55,590
characters on a keyboard right<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

70
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:57,510
end you're writing a line of code and

71
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:58,950
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can either write a secure line of</font>

72
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:00,239
code or an insecure line of code takes

73
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:02,909
about the same amount of<font color="#E5E5E5"> time what it</font>

74
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:04,650
does take is some knowledge and some

75
00:03:02,909 --> 00:03:06,298
understanding<font color="#E5E5E5"> of what secure code is and</font>

76
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:07,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">what it looks like the things we'll</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talk</font>

77
00:03:06,299 --> 00:03:11,099
about today we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to use a lot of</font>

78
00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:13,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">water folly terms only</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> because waterfall</font>

79
00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:16,138
was first I'm very agile in the way I

80
00:03:13,709 --> 00:03:17,489
like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> work in the way the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> teams I like</font>

81
00:03:16,139 --> 00:03:19,260
to work<font color="#E5E5E5"> with and so forth and everything</font>

82
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:21,329
will talk about will fit well<font color="#E5E5E5"> into agile</font>

83
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:23,578
and it does apply<font color="#E5E5E5"> it both the one time</font>

84
00:03:21,329 --> 00:03:26,609
projects if you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> building code for in</font>

85
00:03:23,579 --> 00:03:28,260
an IT organization but<font color="#CCCCCC"> also for product</font>

86
00:03:26,609 --> 00:03:31,349
software that's going to be iterated on

87
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:33,000
over and over<font color="#E5E5E5"> again so in to start out I</font>

88
00:03:31,349 --> 00:03:35,129
want to throw this<font color="#E5E5E5"> image up on the</font>

89
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,430
screen this is the Microsoft<font color="#CCCCCC"> sdl and</font>

90
00:03:35,129 --> 00:03:40,319
really honestly<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is about how simple</font>

91
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:43,349
it is to build a secure development

92
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:45,000
lifecycle sit<font color="#CCCCCC"> down</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and think about the</font>

93
00:03:43,349 --> 00:03:46,709
processes and like I said these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are very</font>

94
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">very waterfall processes right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

95
00:03:46,709 --> 00:03:50,190
training requirements design

96
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:52,500
implementation verification but if

97
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:54,540
you're agile and I have some<font color="#E5E5E5"> slides and</font>

98
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:56,579
appendix if we get to it we<font color="#E5E5E5"> will if</font>

99
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:58,709
you're agile you may be<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing activities</font>

100
00:03:56,579 --> 00:04:00,540
in each of these columns all at the same

101
00:03:58,709 --> 00:04:02,549
time<font color="#E5E5E5"> you may have a piece of code that's</font>

102
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:04,739
in verification right now while you're

103
00:04:02,549 --> 00:04:06,419
implementing something but oh you got to

104
00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:08,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">work in at 9am you have to go do a</font>

105
00:04:06,419 --> 00:04:11,250
meeting to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about requirements</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

106
00:04:08,669 --> 00:04:13,669
some of your users<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so that's how it</font>

107
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:15,569
kind of fits in in agile as well

108
00:04:13,669 --> 00:04:17,370
throughout each of these phases

109
00:04:15,569 --> 00:04:18,630
microsoft has some recommendations of

110
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:20,789
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> activities you might want to</font>

111
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:22,560
do this is a secure development

secure development lifecycle a secure

114
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:29,860
development lifecycle is basic

115
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:32,080
kind of a document that the sky

116
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:34,629
describes a process that includes some

117
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:38,248
or all of these that may have some gates

118
00:04:34,629 --> 00:04:40,360
for when you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to exit a given phase</font>

119
00:04:38,249 --> 00:04:43,060
whatever works for your organization

120
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:44,319
this is kind of a model<font color="#E5E5E5"> for it what</font>

121
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:45,909
we're going to do today is<font color="#E5E5E5"> break this</font>

you're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look to have we'll start</font>

127
00:04:54,279 --> 00:04:57,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">with training like I said it's just as</font>

128
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:59,199
easy to write secure code as<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is dry</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">insecure code you just need to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know what</font>

00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:03,159
you're doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> and that's what training is</font>

00:05:30,729 --> 00:05:35,139
karate belt approach to training where

144
00:05:32,949 --> 00:05:37,599
everyone got fundamentals so it's kind

145
00:05:35,139 --> 00:05:38,979
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> like your white belt and then people</font>

146
00:05:37,599 --> 00:05:40,810
that went ahead and did some oh awesome

147
00:05:38,979 --> 00:05:42,818
top 10 by technology got a yellow belt

148
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:45,310
and so on<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so forth where you know</font>

people who maybe go get their GSS p from

150

sands become kind of the experts once

they've<font color="#CCCCCC"> done some applied training do</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">that down the road a little bit a lot of</font>

00:05:56,740 --> 00:06:01,139
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff you can learn on your own</font>

156
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:02,830
i have i've done a number of

157

certifications you know I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> G</font>

certifications but have actually not

160
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:12,460
done the GSP yet I'm self-trained to

161
00:06:10,719 --> 00:06:15,279
read a lot of books I look<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:17,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">internet I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talk to a lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people when</font>

163
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:18,819
when I find a vulnerability in a

164
00:06:17,409 --> 00:06:20,560
client's code we talk about that

165
00:06:18,819 --> 00:06:23,379
vulnerability I learned through osmosis

166
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:25,419
and that works very<font color="#E5E5E5"> well for me and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

167
00:06:23,379 --> 00:06:26,979
works<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a lot of other people the key</font>

168
00:06:25,419 --> 00:06:29,198
here is to have the commitment to learn

169
00:06:26,979 --> 00:06:30,930
I've worked with so many developers that

170
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:33,520
are just like I want to hear<font color="#E5E5E5"> about it</font>

171
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:35,139
you know either a it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a security</font>

172
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:38,109
bug right I'm the smartest guy in the

173
00:06:35,139 --> 00:06:39,819
room you're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not a bug or be</font>

174
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:41,409
okay fine<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a bug tell me how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to fix</font>

175
00:06:39,819 --> 00:06:44,319
it I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to go ahead and write this</font>

176
00:06:41,409 --> 00:06:45,639
same bug tomorrow and you're going to

177
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:47,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">tell</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me tomorrow how to fix</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it because</font>

178
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:49,869
that's how much I care<font color="#E5E5E5"> about my career</font>

179
00:06:47,129 --> 00:06:52,649
right it all depends<font color="#E5E5E5"> on you and your</font>

180
00:06:49,869 --> 00:06:54,879
<font color="#CCCCCC">attitude and your team's attitude okay</font>

181
00:06:52,649 --> 00:06:56,830
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you move to the requirements phase</font>

182
00:06:54,879 --> 00:06:58,689
really the goal of requirements is just

183
00:06:56,830 --> 00:07:00,969
to determine how much security<font color="#E5E5E5"> is enough</font>

184
00:06:58,689 --> 00:07:02,919
security how much do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to pay to</font>

185
00:07:00,969 --> 00:07:04,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">figure that out not very much you have</font>

186
00:07:02,919 --> 00:07:08,139
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> take some time to understand your</font>

187
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:10,509
clients your internal expectations and

188
00:07:08,139 --> 00:07:12,459
your regulation I have a really

189
00:07:10,509 --> 00:07:13,929
interesting conversation with business

190
00:07:12,459 --> 00:07:16,179
leaders quite often where I'll sit down

191
00:07:13,929 --> 00:07:19,328
<font color="#E5E5E5">and say okay how security we want to be</font>

192
00:07:16,179 --> 00:07:21,429
and they say we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be secure secure</font>

193
00:07:19,329 --> 00:07:24,219
everything we want all the security in

194
00:07:21,429 --> 00:07:25,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">our code great</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so i think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the bill</font>

195
00:07:24,219 --> 00:07:27,009
for that will be about<font color="#E5E5E5"> seven hundred</font>

196
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:28,869
fifty thousand dollars because here's

197
00:07:27,009 --> 00:07:30,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">what we're going to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all of a sudden</font>

198
00:07:28,869 --> 00:07:34,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">all of the security things are no</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> longer</font>

199
00:07:30,819 --> 00:07:36,550
as important and as you talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> costs you</font>

200
00:07:34,389 --> 00:07:37,929
begin<font color="#CCCCCC"> to figure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out what your company</font>

201
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:40,029
really wants to do and what you'll

202
00:07:37,929 --> 00:07:42,188
notice is there's usually a gap right

203
00:07:40,029 --> 00:07:44,229
you want this much security and your

204
00:07:42,189 --> 00:07:47,649
company wants<font color="#CCCCCC"> to pay for that much</font>

205
00:07:44,229 --> 00:07:50,019
security<font color="#E5E5E5"> alright but really building a</font>

206
00:07:47,649 --> 00:07:51,759
secure development<font color="#E5E5E5"> lifecycle is part of</font>

207
00:07:50,019 --> 00:07:53,589
the requirements face is really figuring

208
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:56,579
out what it how much<font color="#E5E5E5"> security is enough</font>

209
00:07:53,589 --> 00:07:58,899
and what's your risk and then also

210
00:07:56,579 --> 00:08:01,539
setting what the engagement process is

211
00:07:58,899 --> 00:08:03,519
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be like okay so figuring out</font>

212
00:08:01,539 --> 00:08:04,990
when the rhythms<font color="#CCCCCC"> our feature reviews</font>

213
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:07,029
when when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> sit down a look at new</font>

214
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:09,069
features and review them for security

215
00:08:07,029 --> 00:08:10,869
how frequently will you do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that how will</font>

216
00:08:09,069 --> 00:08:13,239
you measure security what's the

217
00:08:10,869 --> 00:08:15,399
definition of done when do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we know that</font>

218
00:08:13,239 --> 00:08:16,659
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> finished with our security these</font>

219
00:08:15,399 --> 00:08:18,159
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> some of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the things that you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font>

220
00:08:16,659 --> 00:08:20,438
<font color="#E5E5E5">to think about coming into your</font>

221
00:08:18,159 --> 00:08:23,229
requirements phase and then put them on

222
00:08:20,439 --> 00:08:24,809
a schedule put them in your backlog if

223
00:08:23,229 --> 00:08:27,339
you're agile put them on your calendar

224
00:08:24,809 --> 00:08:29,050
otherwise make sure they get written

225
00:08:27,339 --> 00:08:32,500
down and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's one of the key themes</font>

226
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:35,229
for your own sdl is that you write it

227
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:37,929
down a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of people especially people</font>

228
00:08:35,229 --> 00:08:39,819
in agile hate that idea and this really

229
00:08:37,929 --> 00:08:41,948
<font color="#E5E5E5">is the one place where kind of break</font>

230
00:08:39,818 --> 00:08:44,469
with the agile concept of not<font color="#E5E5E5"> having a</font>

231
00:08:41,948 --> 00:08:46,000
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of documentation really we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

232
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:48,009
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sdl documented and the</font>

233
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,339
activities in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> sdl somehow integrated</font>

234
00:08:48,009 --> 00:08:53,680
into your your processes a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

235
00:08:51,339 --> 00:08:57,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">think well I'm agile or I'm</font>

236
00:08:53,680 --> 00:09:00,310
a water waterfall agile which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I call</font>

237
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:02,589
water fragile or we're just random

238
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:04,180
Cowboys but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know what no matter what</font>

239
00:09:02,589 --> 00:09:05,620
your approach is you<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually do have an</font>

240
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:07,630
approach it may not be written<font color="#E5E5E5"> down and</font>

241
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:09,160
defined in IBM method blue with a

242
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:12,820
hundred thousand pages of documentation

243
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:14,709
you have a culture then the<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is to</font>

244
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:16,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">figure out how to integrate your secure</font>

245
00:09:14,709 --> 00:09:19,239
development practices into your culture

246
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:22,480
so it takes some definition and it takes

247
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:24,459
some observation but it can be done<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

248
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,779
design phase this is where we're sitting

249
00:09:24,459 --> 00:09:27,160
down<font color="#E5E5E5"> and trying to figure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out okay how</font>

250
00:09:25,779 --> 00:09:28,810
are we going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> build this new feature</font>

251
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:31,149
how we're going to build<font color="#E5E5E5"> this new</font>

252
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:33,010
product and here's where we start<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

253
00:09:31,149 --> 00:09:34,240
really talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about how are we going to</font>

254
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:37,149
meet these security and privacy

255
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:39,100
requirements it the idea here is that

256
00:09:37,149 --> 00:09:40,390
we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> backing into the security of</font>

257
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:42,399
our application we're actually planning

258
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:44,380
ahead and thinking about ahead and

259
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:46,000
that's the only real difference with a

260
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:47,140
secure development<font color="#E5E5E5"> lifecycle like I said</font>

261
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,870
we're being proactive instead of

262
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:51,790
reactive what third-party components are

263
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:55,510
we going to use and let's do a review of

264
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:57,430
them before<font color="#CCCCCC"> we do I can't tell you the</font>

265
00:09:55,510 --> 00:10:00,279
number of times that I've done pen tests

266
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:02,800
or static code analysis for clients who

267
00:10:00,279 --> 00:10:05,709
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> taken on third party dependencies</font>

268
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:07,959
and the holes in<font color="#E5E5E5"> their applications all</font>

269
00:10:05,709 --> 00:10:10,300
came through their third parties because

270
00:10:07,959 --> 00:10:13,479
they didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think about them in fact we</font>

271
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:16,089
had to do a major bit of work because<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

272
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:17,980
had a<font color="#E5E5E5"> client building mobile</font>

273
00:10:16,089 --> 00:10:21,040
applications in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the healthcare space and</font>

274
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:22,450
they picked up a platform so that good

275
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:24,099
right you know iOS and Android at the

276
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:26,170
same time and it turns out that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

277
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:29,770
platform unbeknownst to them was cashing

278
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:31,479
all sorts of data<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we discovered it</font>

279
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:33,640
in a pen test and it took them a couple

280
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:37,240
of weeks to<font color="#E5E5E5"> really figure out how to get</font>

281
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:39,370
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cash data out and the root root</font>

282
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:40,900
cause analysis for that was simply we

283
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:42,130
picked<font color="#E5E5E5"> up a framework because we knew is</font>

284
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:44,050
going to accomplish what we wanted to do

285
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:45,820
but we didn't have the time as

286
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:47,859
developers to analyze the framework to

287
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:50,950
figure out what weaknesses it introduced

288
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:53,170
and that's really what this design phase

289
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:55,029
is all about is figuring<font color="#CCCCCC"> out if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

290
00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:56,890
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> take on a dependency what's it</font>

291
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:58,720
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do read</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the documentation play</font>

292
00:10:56,890 --> 00:11:00,730
with it do a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit of pen testing</font>

293
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,380
on your<font color="#E5E5E5"> own look into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bit</font>

294
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:06,130
and figure out what risk you're taking

295
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:07,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I like to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about the ABCDE of</font>

296
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:09,550
security

297
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:11,319
when we're doing iterative software

298
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:12,370
processes where<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe it's a product</font>

299
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:15,340
that we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> built or something like that</font>

300
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:17,890
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to ask questions</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about ABCD and E</font>

301
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:19,450
actors are<font color="#E5E5E5"> we going to change in this</font>

302
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:20,830
phase of our product design we're going

303
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:22,780
to change who interacts with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

304
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:25,090
application may be up until now the

305
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:26,680
application was internal only but now

306
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:28,360
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to open it up to external</font>

307
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:30,880
clients well that really changes the

308
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:32,740
world right it changes all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of our risk</font>

309
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:34,930
assumptions and it changes the

310
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:37,630
technologies that were dependent upon

311
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:38,770
and so forth B is business so what are

312
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:41,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">some of the changes are going to happen</font>

313
00:11:38,770 --> 00:11:43,240
like I've got clients that have come<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

314
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:45,609
me and said hey up until now our product

315
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:48,310
does not contain any HIPAA regulated

316
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:49,840
data but we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to change</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that ok</font>

317
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:52,239
that's a that's a business change

318
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:54,970
channel you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of times we'll</font>

319
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:58,050
build I worked<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a company once that</font>

320
00:11:54,970 --> 00:12:00,700
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know had a bunch of HTTP</font>

321
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:02,500
applications https applications they

322
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:07,240
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to move to mobile so their answer</font>

323
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:09,820
was to take no j/s server and scrape

324
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:11,830
their HTML pages and then manipulate

325
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:14,770
them into something<font color="#E5E5E5"> a mobile application</font>

326
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:16,750
could consume right it's it's a strategy

327
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:18,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">maybe not the best strategy but it's a</font>

328
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:20,770
strategy and it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> decision people need</font>

329
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:22,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">to make and talk about data what data</font>

330
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:25,180
are going to store in the system I have

331
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:26,950
a client who we have always<font color="#CCCCCC"> had this</font>

332
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:29,199
requirement that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there will never be any</font>

333
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:31,360
pH I stored on a mobile device well they

334
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:33,100
they decided recently that there may be

335
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:35,080
a business case for that so we had to do

336
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:37,120
a business case review and talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

337
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:39,490
the security of it and by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

338
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:41,680
clients very agile very small team

339
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:43,420
there's about<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 developers total we did</font>

340
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,949
that business case review it sounds so

341
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:47,560
formal doesn't it I mean it<font color="#E5E5E5"> sounds like</font>

342
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:48,790
we all flew into a major<font color="#E5E5E5"> city and you</font>

343
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:50,410
know got a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of white boards out and</font>

344
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:52,420
stuff like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> nah we did in an hour we</font>

345
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:53,890
just did a phone call documented the

346
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:56,860
results of the phone call this is how we

347
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:58,240
do agile in healthcare world they have

348
00:12:56,860 --> 00:13:01,390
these quick calls we do a lot of stuff

349
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:02,830
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> slack document it with email and we</font>

350
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:05,110
have a place where<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> store all these</font>

351
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:06,610
emails so when regulators actually show

352
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:08,940
up we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can show proof of oh yeah here's</font>

353
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:11,020
our feature review for XYZ feature

354
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:12,190
finally environment<font color="#CCCCCC"> whether if we're</font>

355
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:14,170
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to change in the environment you</font>

356
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:15,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">know what happens today whoo-wee let's</font>

357
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:17,589
go take advantage of the clouds so we

358
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:19,540
were running stuff in in on-premise

359
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:21,050
servers and we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> pick those</font>

360
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:22,579
on-premise servers up and move them

361
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:24,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">EMS on the cloud what could possibly go</font>

362
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:26,269
wrong<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so these are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all things in</font>

363
00:13:24,890 --> 00:13:30,080
the design phase that we think about I

364
00:13:26,269 --> 00:13:31,399
love the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the idea of just ABCDE just</font>

365
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:33,410
keep driving that home in your mind

366
00:13:31,399 --> 00:13:36,320
what's you know what is changing this

367
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:38,660
time around<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay when we get to</font>

368
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:41,600
implementation here's where<font color="#E5E5E5"> we talk</font>

369
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:43,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">about you know like users what we call</font>

370
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:46,310
requirements and waterfall are the user

371
00:13:43,579 --> 00:13:48,620
stories and abuse cases in our agile

372
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:50,149
world all right and during

373
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:52,459
implementation we want to make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

374
00:13:50,149 --> 00:13:54,440
the code<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we've designed and</font>

375
00:13:52,459 --> 00:13:55,550
hopefully we've architected in a secure

376
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:57,680
manner we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure it's</font>

377
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:58,550
implemented in a secure manner right are

378
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,839
we avoiding cross-site scripting

379
00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:01,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">vulnerability sequel injection</font>

380
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:05,269
vulnerabilities the real easy things

381
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:07,970
this is where I'm a big advocate of

382
00:14:05,269 --> 00:14:11,510
static code analysis it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the cheapest</font>

383
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:16,730
way to prevent or find a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these</font>

384
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:28,010
low-level simple vulnerabilities and so

385
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:30,740
yeah question I actually my business I

386
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:31,880
own check marks they're actually here if

387
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:36,110
you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a demo of them there</font>

388
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:37,550
it's a great tool I work I consult for a

389
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:40,190
major<font color="#E5E5E5"> financial organization right now</font>

390
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:41,479
they use fortify I'm a big fan of check

391
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:43,520
marks you can get<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of that</font>

392
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:45,680
functionality out of brakeman and lint

393
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:48,579
and so forth but to really get a good

394
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:50,329
scan you want to invest in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a tool or</font>

395
00:14:48,579 --> 00:14:52,130
find someone who'll do it as a

396
00:14:50,329 --> 00:14:54,260
subscription service for you which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

397
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:57,079
one of the services that I offer for my

398
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:58,490
clients as well and when it comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

399
00:14:57,079 --> 00:15:01,370
shoestring budget this is where i

400
00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:02,959
recommend you break a shoestring spend

401
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:05,120
the money it takes to either acquire a

402
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:06,829
static code analysis tool or to use

403
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:08,660
someone on a regular basis to look at

404
00:15:06,829 --> 00:15:10,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">your code and the more frequently you</font>

405
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:12,520
look at it<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like anything agile the</font>

406
00:15:10,279 --> 00:15:14,689
more often you look at that code the

407
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:18,880
faster you find the vulnerability is the

408
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:22,070
easy it is to<font color="#E5E5E5"> fix them okay and you know</font>

409
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:25,310
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a great time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for all that</font>

410
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:29,600
training to be put to use<font color="#CCCCCC"> i teach a</font>

411
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:31,550
course called a wasp<font color="#E5E5E5"> top</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 programming</font>

412
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:34,730
countermeasures it's about<font color="#CCCCCC"> a six hour</font>

413
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:34,939
course and you would think<font color="#E5E5E5"> with all of</font>

414
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:36,500
the

415
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:37,910
talk now about web vulnerabilities and

416
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:40,310
stuff like that you would<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that</font>

417
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:42,079
that course would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be boring that the</font>

418
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:44,390
developers would never hear anything new

419
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:45,830
I mean how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> times have we heard</font>

420
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:48,050
about sequel injection vulnerabilities

421
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:50,000
right it amazes me though every time I

422
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:52,490
teach the course how many things people

423
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,930
learn and a lot of times what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll do is</font>

424
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:56,150
I'll combine I'll do static code

425
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:57,739
analysis and then I'll take<font color="#E5E5E5"> the results</font>

426
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:59,840
of the static code analysis and actually

427
00:15:57,740 --> 00:16:03,020
put<font color="#CCCCCC"> it into the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> course as the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sample</font>

428
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:05,330
code of what not to do it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> hilarious to</font>

429
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:08,120
see the finger<font color="#CCCCCC"> pointing right oh my gosh</font>

430
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:10,370
that's Joe's code look at that it's

431
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:11,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">really incredible</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to see that kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

432
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:13,760
live interaction and see developers

433
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:16,430
recognizing their own code in their own

434
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:20,540
mistakes<font color="#E5E5E5"> the the very simple basics it's</font>

435
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:22,370
the top<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just the top ten it's not</font>

436
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:24,260
all of the ways you can write vulnerable

437
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:25,580
code however it's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten most common</font>

438
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:27,560
ways that you can write vulnerable code

439
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:29,510
it's a great<font color="#E5E5E5"> way to start for two</font>

440
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:32,420
reasons number one it teaches developers

441
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:35,240
how to write more secure code but to it

442
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:36,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">really just raises awareness developers</font>

443
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:39,260
start thinking about sequel injection

444
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:41,120
and stuff like that really the goal of

445
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:43,040
your training in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this phase or before</font>

446
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:45,080
this phase<font color="#E5E5E5"> the goal of them of the</font>

447
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:47,150
impact is to have your developers<font color="#CCCCCC"> ask</font>

448
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:50,120
the question what could possibly go

449
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:55,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">around because what is a developer focus</font>

450
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:58,220
on features that's right they never

451
00:16:55,970 --> 00:17:00,140
think about the unintended consequences

452
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:02,030
I had a<font color="#E5E5E5"> really cool experience this year</font>

453
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:03,650
I got to speak with a company i'm

454
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:09,199
actually going to work<font color="#CCCCCC"> for in about a</font>

455
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:11,270
week at CES<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay we the company has</font>

456
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:12,589
started a cybersecurity summit at CES

457
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:14,359
which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually really well attended</font>

458
00:17:12,589 --> 00:17:17,208
just probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> good thing but i had the</font>

459
00:17:14,359 --> 00:17:19,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">opportunity to wander the couple of</font>

460
00:17:17,209 --> 00:17:21,079
different floors at CES and look at all

461
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:23,180
the new devices and all the really new

462
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:24,409
cool things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are out there and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

463
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:27,050
kept picking these things up thinking

464
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:28,670
what could possibly go wrong what are

465
00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:30,950
the unintended consequences of this

466
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:32,330
device and it was amazing<font color="#E5E5E5"> i mean you've</font>

467
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:33,740
got<font color="#E5E5E5"> health care devices you've got</font>

468
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:35,899
shirts that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can wear that have</font>

469
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:38,810
sensors in them right so what happens if

470
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:42,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">i can do something in like actually send</font>

471
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:44,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">shock waves you know electronic pulses</font>

472
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:45,919
through the<font color="#E5E5E5"> shirt instead of reading</font>

473
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:47,570
them just all sorts<font color="#E5E5E5"> of really wild</font>

474
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:48,220
things the automotive place was really

475
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:51,428
scary

476
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:53,530
self-driven cars people didn't really

477
00:17:51,429 --> 00:17:55,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">like me cuz kept asking hey who who does</font>

478
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:56,970
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> security like how do you how do you</font>

479
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:59,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">figure out these things are secure and</font>

480
00:17:56,970 --> 00:18:01,450
they didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really like having security</font>

481
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:04,780
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask questions about their their</font>

482
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:06,700
product I don't know why and make sure

483
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:08,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">in this you know one of the things that</font>

484
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:09,400
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have success with is</font>

485
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:11,400
making sure they have unit and

486
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:14,590
acceptance tests integrated into their

487
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:16,059
including security and keep in mind

488
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:18,520
during your implementation phase that

489
00:18:16,059 --> 00:18:21,520
secure features are not the same as

490
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:24,850
security features how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> times have we</font>

491
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:28,450
had gone<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a client and our vp of</font>

492
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:30,100
engineering who used to code tells the

493
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:32,110
client eyewear secara we use we use

494
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:36,250
windows form forms based authentication

495
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:38,080
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> HTTPS we're good</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so keep in</font>

496
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:39,940
mind that every feature needs to be

497
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:42,039
written securely not just the security

498
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:43,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">features and by</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the way we're having</font>

499
00:18:42,039 --> 00:18:44,950
some explanation about how to do secure

500
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:47,559
code we're going to jump to how to build

501
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:48,460
an SD l in a minute here so verification

502
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:50,350
phase and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm running a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> little bit</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">faster verification phase the</font>

504
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:54,100
opportunity to validate your security

00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:55,450
features<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so if I built the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> login</font>

506
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:56,980
let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure the login works it's</font>

507
00:18:55,450 --> 00:18:58,330
also your opportunity<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make sure all</font>

508
00:18:56,980 --> 00:19:00,250
of your features are implemented

509
00:18:58,330 --> 00:19:01,928
securely this is where you do fuzz

510
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:03,970
testing this is where burp comes in

511
00:19:01,929 --> 00:19:06,250
really handy having it knowing how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

512
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:08,710
use<font color="#E5E5E5"> it best investment you can ever make</font>

513
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:10,809
in security three hundred dollars for

514
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:13,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">burp it is the most powerful tool in the</font>

515
00:19:10,809 --> 00:19:14,770
world a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> times I'll do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> rfps and</font>

516
00:19:13,059 --> 00:19:18,610
people will ask me<font color="#E5E5E5"> well what tools do</font>

517
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:22,059
you use and i'll say i use burp and the

518
00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:23,260
command line and well what about<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

519
00:19:22,059 --> 00:19:24,908
these you know they list all these

520
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:26,559
dynamic analysis tools and all this

521
00:19:24,909 --> 00:19:28,600
stuff and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like no I use burp in the</font>

522
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:30,730
command line with what do you need all

523
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:32,110
the other tools for right burp has a

524
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:33,760
great scanner in it actually that works

525
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:35,620
pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> well so it's a good dynamic</font>

526
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:37,960
scanning tool you can check<font color="#CCCCCC"> that box but</font>

527
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:39,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">really burp just puts a lot of power in</font>

528
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:41,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">the hands of the person that's using it</font>

529
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:42,820
this is where<font color="#E5E5E5"> your agile abuse cases</font>

530
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:44,440
will be used and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is where you</font>

531
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:46,059
confirm your logging auditing and

532
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:47,890
incident detection capabilities we'll

533
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:50,320
talk about that in a minute the time to

534
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:51,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">find out that you don't have auditing</font>

00:19:55,929 --> 00:20:00,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just wrapped</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up an incident for</font>

someone we got away<font color="#E5E5E5"> really really cheap</font>

540
00:20:00,429 --> 00:20:03,690
on that one

541
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:06,930
but they learned a lot about their

542
00:20:03,690 --> 00:20:11,250
systems and what they don't have they

543
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:12,240
were lucky<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay release phase this is</font>

544
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:13,950
when you want to make sure you have an

incident response plan this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is when you</font>

down on the on the the main branch and

560
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:50,070
you need to do innocent response and you

561
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:52,560
can't unravel everything you've coded

562
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:55,230
your about 24 17 new features out into

production to resolve your issues and

564

and very ugly the other thing that

566
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:04,350
happens that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've seen work for company</font>

567
00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:07,170
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> found a wonderful critical</font>

568
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:09,719
vulnerability it was awesome there was a

569
00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:12,780
password reset feature and as a

570
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:15,030
convenience to their clients they had

571
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:16,680
this concept of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a default password so</font>

572
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:19,170
you know someone forgot their password

573
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:21,030
you could set the default you just reset

574
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:22,170
it say oh well it's the default<font color="#CCCCCC"> password</font>

575
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:23,670
and everyone in the company knew the

576
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:26,130
default password<font color="#E5E5E5"> was very convenient</font>

577
00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:29,100
well the problem was that the default

578
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:31,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">password was actually sent down with the</font>

579
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:32,909
<font color="#CCCCCC">password reset form where you would</font>

580
00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:34,680
request the password reset so you'd

581
00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:37,440
click it and it would auto populate your

582
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:39,420
next password login screen with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

583
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:42,150
default password really convenient right

584
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:46,560
and it was in the HTML source<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

585
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:48,570
stupid<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fixed it that's great three</font>

586
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:51,690
months later the new release went out

587
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:54,480
and guess what was back someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> lost the</font>

588
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:55,590
change so taking good care in the

589
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,390
release face of your bits really

590
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:59,730
important and then finally response face

591
00:21:57,390 --> 00:22:01,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is not the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time to find</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out that</font>

592
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:04,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">you don't know how to do response it's</font>

593
00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:07,470
very very expensive<font color="#CCCCCC"> to bring someone in</font>

594
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:09,570
to do response for you my clients are

595
00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:11,730
lucky I'm a terrible consultant I don't

596
00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:12,929
don't charge what I should but you know

597
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:14,100
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you actually have an incident where</font>

598
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:15,120
you have to bring in an incident

599
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:16,889
response team like

600
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:18,840
and Ian or someone like that you pay

601
00:22:16,890 --> 00:22:20,970
through the nose for it and when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

602
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:22,860
could have prevented it or at least made

603
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:24,390
it a lot easier by actually preparing

604
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:27,179
your it's in a response<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so this is</font>

605
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:29,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is what an SD l is ok so now let's</font>

606
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:31,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk let's go well any questions to what</font>

607
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:32,520
an<font color="#CCCCCC"> SD l is first before we go on this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

608
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:36,080
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the core</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> components of a secure</font>

609
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:38,700
develop my life cycle clear as mud right

610
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:40,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">ok good all right so how much is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

611
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:42,360
to cost so you'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> notice here my wife</font>

612
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:44,250
yelled at me she's like<font color="#E5E5E5"> no one can read</font>

613
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:45,929
that and I kept saying yeah I know that

614
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:49,290
I just want you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to remember that we had</font>

615
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:50,309
a slide on training<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there what</font>

616
00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:51,659
do you think<font color="#CCCCCC"> he would need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

617
00:22:50,309 --> 00:22:57,450
training face what's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> goal of a</font>

618
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:59,100
training face build competency yep<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

619
00:22:57,450 --> 00:23:00,360
what sorts of competencies who do you

620
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:05,010
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to build if you were going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to train</font>

621
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:07,169
a product organization I was going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

622
00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:08,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">stop and get candy bars and I just I ran</font>

623
00:23:07,170 --> 00:23:11,960
out of time this morning I love throwing

624
00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:11,960
candy bars out for answers

625
00:23:19,370 --> 00:23:24,469
so you want to build awareness of not

626
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:26,270
all the different ways something can go

627
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:29,090
wrong but awareness just of the fact

628
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:30,860
that things can go wrong I like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk</font>

629
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:33,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">about developers who've not been trained</font>

630
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:34,699
in security I compare them to owning a

631
00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:36,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">Rottweiler which you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know a lot of</font>

632
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:38,180
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> have this really negative impact</font>

633
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:39,890
of a Rottweiler they're just safe or

634
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:42,260
dangerous than any other dog but think

635
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:43,490
about a Rottweiler it's not trained so

636
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:45,070
you have all<font color="#E5E5E5"> this power and all this</font>

637
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:47,830
strength with absolutely no self-control

638
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:51,260
welcome to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the world of developers</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

639
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:53,000
so here are some basic<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

640
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:55,010
might want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> train about one would be</font>

641
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,720
your<font color="#CCCCCC"> stl process probably want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to teach</font>

642
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:59,179
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> how to follow the sdl you've</font>

643
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:00,980
designed it would actually be very

644
00:23:59,179 --> 00:24:03,590
difficult to argue that you have an SD l

645
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:05,360
if you can't produce to a regulator some

646
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:08,750
aspect of training around<font color="#E5E5E5"> that s do</font>

647
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:11,479
other things threat modeling right so

648
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:14,000
typical block and tackling aspects of

649
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:16,250
secure code you probably want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to teach</font>

650
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,740
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> secure coding and guidelines and</font>

651
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:20,390
then also offer individual training on

652
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:22,130
coding and testing we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about that</font>

653
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:25,370
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little bit more but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know you</font>

654
00:24:22,130 --> 00:24:27,980
probably want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have one or two experts</font>

655
00:24:25,370 --> 00:24:30,949
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> your company who really really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

656
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:34,040
about secure coding and or who<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

657
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:35,840
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> good pen testers because they can</font>

658
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:38,330
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> on loan those services aren't needed</font>

659
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:40,040
24 7 but you know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> every week or two</font>

660
00:24:38,330 --> 00:24:41,480
someone's going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to pull on them so send</font>

661
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:42,500
a couple of your people away to a sans

662
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:44,390
course you probably don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have</font>

663
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:46,880
everyone go and get certified<font color="#CCCCCC"> in Java</font>

664
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:48,920
or.net but having one or two people do

665
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:50,240
that as a great idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so how much</font>

666
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:52,220
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is all going to cost well you know</font>

667
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:54,410
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mentioned</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> earlier i'm pretty much</font>

668
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:55,790
all self-trained I do have a GU app so

669
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:56,960
you know I spent<font color="#CCCCCC"> a fair amount of money</font>

670
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:59,600
on that everyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> knows how much sans</font>

671
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:01,670
training costs and you know you might

672
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:04,850
want to probably send someone to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a good</font>

673
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:06,020
code training and maybe you know instant

674
00:25:04,850 --> 00:25:09,080
response training you might want to get

675
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:10,970
one person<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> GC IH certification so</font>

676
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:13,159
you've got you know any level of

677
00:25:10,970 --> 00:25:15,800
investment but really honestly all of

678
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:16,880
that stuff is available freely as long

679
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:18,740
as you find someone who's passionate

680
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:20,480
about them and give them the opportunity

681
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:22,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">to be trained or to train themselves</font>

682
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:24,940
that's what's important so your training

683
00:25:22,610 --> 00:25:26,780
budget could be anywhere from<font color="#CCCCCC"> zero to</font>

684
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:28,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">24,000 if you want to send people to</font>

685
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:31,490
what three or four sans courses or

686
00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:33,050
higher if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to send more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

687
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:35,059
so here's your shoe string budget

688
00:25:33,050 --> 00:25:37,040
training where are you going to find

689
00:25:35,059 --> 00:25:38,090
your best training<font color="#CCCCCC"> owasp</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is a great</font>

690
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:40,070
source<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we're going to talk about</font>

691
00:25:38,090 --> 00:25:41,540
sources in a minute but just you know

692
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:44,389
it's out there it's everyone on the

693
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:45,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">internet requirements what do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you what</font>

694
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:47,090
are your goals during the requirements

695
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:54,678
phase and what do people need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do to</font>

696
00:25:47,090 --> 00:25:55,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">accomplish those goals ideas so the</font>

697
00:25:54,679 --> 00:25:58,490
requirements phases where we're trying

698
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:59,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">to figure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out how secure our application</font>

699
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:03,500
has to be we've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to understand</font>

700
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:05,419
regulation and again you can bring in

701
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:06,860
consultants and sometimes it's a good

702
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:09,559
idea right<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you have someone if you're</font>

703
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:11,120
moving into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the hip of space and you can</font>

704
00:26:09,559 --> 00:26:12,530
reach<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to a consultant and pay them</font>

711

have someone spend time reading up on

HIPAA reading up on how to how to write

not a lot of regulation<font color="#CCCCCC"> around it it's</font>

719
00:26:38,690 --> 00:26:42,620
more about documenting what you've done

this is also<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you want to have the</font>

are we going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> conduct a security</font>

751
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:52,340
review what is a security review that's

752
00:27:50,539 --> 00:27:54,408
looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at a feature and asking yourself</font>

753

what could possibly go wrong with this

feature based on the answer<font color="#E5E5E5"> what our</font>

isn't broken<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay it's this is a</font>

your SD l during the implementation

00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:11,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">phase this is one place</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> where like I</font>

760
00:28:10,010 --> 00:28:13,850
said<font color="#CCCCCC"> earlier I advocate spending money</font>

761
00:28:11,779 --> 00:28:15,470
static code analysis is probably the

762
00:28:13,850 --> 00:28:17,840
cheapest way to prevent vulnerabilities

763
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:20,120
either by engaging with someone who will

764
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:22,789
scan your coat for you on a regular

765
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:25,340
basis or by purchasing static code

766
00:28:22,789 --> 00:28:27,169
analysis tools you can start small lint

767
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:29,059
is a great start brakeman is a great

768
00:28:27,169 --> 00:28:30,950
start right there's some things that you

769
00:28:29,059 --> 00:28:32,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">can do almost for free if you're running</font>

770
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:35,360
a mobile application you can do sort of

771
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:38,570
a combination of static binary dynamic

772
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:41,209
analysis quark is a tool that was built

773
00:28:38,570 --> 00:28:43,210
by linkedin that's now open source it's

774
00:28:41,210 --> 00:28:46,010
a great tool for analyzing android

775
00:28:43,210 --> 00:28:48,159
binaries to look for most common

776
00:28:46,010 --> 00:28:50,840
vulnerabilities things like you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

777
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:52,299
intense and so forth that kind of stuff

778
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:54,199
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are some free tools out there</font>

779
00:28:52,299 --> 00:28:56,149
they're not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to cover everything</font>

780
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:59,230
but they'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> get you started while you're</font>

781
00:28:56,149 --> 00:29:01,520
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make decisions</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on other tools</font>

782
00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:03,230
so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> your big spenda static code</font>

783
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:04,700
analysis but other things<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do code</font>

784
00:29:03,230 --> 00:29:06,200
review how much does<font color="#E5E5E5"> it cost to learn</font>

785
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:08,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">how to do a code review not much at all</font>

786
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:10,429
sit<font color="#CCCCCC"> down look at the code I one of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

787
00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:12,620
favorite code reviews that I ever did

788
00:29:10,429 --> 00:29:15,710
was was my very first one<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we were</font>

789
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:18,739
looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at the logic for the login page</font>

790
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:23,149
and in the log in class there was a

791
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:25,580
boolean is authenticated equal to true

792
00:29:23,149 --> 00:29:27,918
and then I went<font color="#E5E5E5"> through a series of</font>

793
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:31,970
checks and if it failed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> check it set</font>

794
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:34,370
it to false<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> upside-down</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> logic what</font>

795
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:36,409
happens if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I break somehow in the middle</font>

796
00:29:34,370 --> 00:29:39,529
of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> authentication process before</font>

797
00:29:36,409 --> 00:29:40,850
true gets set to false it's true if I

798
00:29:39,529 --> 00:29:42,320
can break<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of it I move forward okay</font>

799
00:29:40,850 --> 00:29:43,668
that's the kind of stuff that you do in

800
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:45,500
a code review doesn't take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of</font>

801
00:29:43,669 --> 00:29:47,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">money to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> train it you just have to</font>

802
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:49,520
decide we're going to do the code review

803
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:51,439
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then sit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> down and get it done okay</font>

804
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:53,840
security unit tests also need to be

805
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:56,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">written at this point by the way I call</font>

806
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:58,300
out in in design phase I called out

807
00:29:56,630 --> 00:29:59,740
security standards

808
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:01,889
an implementation I call out security

809
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:04,270
guidelines standards and guidelines

810

freaking out about this<font color="#E5E5E5"> right and in</font>

also guidelines how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> times have you</font>

seen encryption implemented poorly oh I

00:30:55,570 --> 00:31:00,490
forgot to salt it right or you know just

832
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,900
a number of different<font color="#E5E5E5"> ways</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you can</font>

break it<font color="#CCCCCC"> up so having written guidelines</font>

834
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:05,950
and this is a concept<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I've come</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">I would wear you you know you could just</font>

00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:14,170
inherit these standards and guidelines

839
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:15,850
instead of having to write them yourself

840

developer guide is pretty good a lot of

00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:22,090
the cheat sheets for OAuth spar great so

843
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:23,680
that stuff is available really you want

844
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:25,899
to grab<font color="#CCCCCC"> it there are there these are</font>

845

just patterns right there just security

846
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:29,050
patterns instead of patterns for

847
00:31:27,370 --> 00:31:31,270
accessing a database or patterns for

848
00:31:29,050 --> 00:31:32,649
logging people in and so forth<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay you</font>

849
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:35,470
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to write those down that's that's</font>

850
00:31:32,650 --> 00:31:39,820
in a time sink but it's worth<font color="#CCCCCC"> the effort</font>

851
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:40,870
it really<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a verification phase this</font>

852
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:42,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">is where you're going to do feature</font>

853
00:31:40,870 --> 00:31:44,709
level pen test so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wrote a new feature</font>

854
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:47,439
I'm going to give it<font color="#CCCCCC"> to my pen test</font>

855
00:31:44,710 --> 00:31:49,270
people to have them look at it do we pen

856
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:51,160
test every single feature know what we

857
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:52,810
do is back in the design or in the

858
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:55,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">requirements phase and in the design</font>

859
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:59,530
phase we tag user stories that have

860
00:31:55,690 --> 00:32:01,210
security implement implications<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we</font>

861
00:31:59,530 --> 00:32:03,580
know when it hits verification that

862
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:05,260
feature needs to be pen tested every

863
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:07,030
once in a while<font color="#CCCCCC"> we want to do a full pen</font>

864
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:09,640
test we also want to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> some fuzz</font>

865
00:32:07,030 --> 00:32:11,110
testing a dynamic analysis this is

866
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:11,710
another phase where<font color="#CCCCCC"> I would recommend</font>

867
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:12,928
that you

868
00:32:11,710 --> 00:32:15,909
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of break your shoe string budget</font>

869
00:32:12,929 --> 00:32:18,669
pay someone to pen test your application

870
00:32:15,909 --> 00:32:19,929
a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> companies will say well we've</font>

871
00:32:18,669 --> 00:32:21,880
got<font color="#E5E5E5"> a guy who knows how to do pen</font>

872
00:32:19,929 --> 00:32:23,860
testing in house<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay that's great how</font>

873
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:25,750
many hours are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you going to give one of</font>

874
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:27,580
your developers who knows how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pen</font>

875
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:31,690
test how many hours<font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you give that</font>

876
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:34,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">person to test your app any guesses I</font>

877
00:32:31,690 --> 00:32:38,529
mean do you think<font color="#E5E5E5"> you could strip a</font>

878
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:42,850
developer away for eight hours how about

879
00:32:38,529 --> 00:32:44,740
for 60 hours<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay it's not going to</font>

880
00:32:42,850 --> 00:32:46,539
happen so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a place where I</font>

881
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:48,130
recommend making an investment maybe

882
00:32:46,539 --> 00:32:49,720
it's self-interested because I do a lot

883
00:32:48,130 --> 00:32:51,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">of pen testing but i really recommend</font>

884
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:53,470
that you bring in outside help for two

885
00:32:51,789 --> 00:32:55,750
reasons<font color="#E5E5E5"> number one your internal</font>

886
00:32:53,470 --> 00:32:57,669
staffing requirements will not allow you

887
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:59,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">to dedicate the amount of time that</font>

888
00:32:57,669 --> 00:33:03,399
needs to be dedicated<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do a real pen</font>

889
00:32:59,470 --> 00:33:05,710
test number two someone a pen test day

890
00:33:03,399 --> 00:33:07,870
in and day out will find stuff that<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

891
00:33:05,710 --> 00:33:10,720
internal guy won't that's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way</font>

892
00:33:07,870 --> 00:33:13,270
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> works so you know is how often is</font>

893
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:14,649
often enough annual is probably the

894
00:33:13,270 --> 00:33:16,779
minimal amount that you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do with</font>

895
00:33:14,649 --> 00:33:18,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">the third party and then depending on</font>

896
00:33:16,779 --> 00:33:20,020
the sensitivity of the data you're in or

897
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:21,730
the regulation in your industry you

898
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:24,549
might want to do it more<font color="#CCCCCC"> frequently or a</font>

899
00:33:21,730 --> 00:33:26,350
combination I have a lot of clients who

900
00:33:24,549 --> 00:33:27,970
do their own internal pen testing and

901
00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:30,250
then they'll have<font color="#E5E5E5"> me do an annual pen</font>

902
00:33:27,970 --> 00:33:32,500
test for them and that works out<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

903
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:33,789
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so you want to make sure at</font>

904
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:34,990
some point that you do some pen testing

905
00:33:33,789 --> 00:33:38,020
and this is where<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would say you want</font>

906
00:33:34,990 --> 00:33:40,390
to spend<font color="#CCCCCC"> some money all right in your</font>

907
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:43,000
release phase again releases zero dollar

908
00:33:40,390 --> 00:33:44,770
cost to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> ret to build into your sdl</font>

909
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:47,169
you just have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to stop and think about it</font>

910
00:33:44,770 --> 00:33:49,120
what are your release gates we talked

911
00:33:47,169 --> 00:33:51,730
about defining the definition of done up

912
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:53,320
front this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is where you make sure you're</font>

913
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:55,690
actually done before you<font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out the door</font>

914
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:57,370
so you do your final<font color="#E5E5E5"> security review you</font>

915
00:33:55,690 --> 00:34:00,340
make sure you have a response plan if

916
00:33:57,370 --> 00:34:02,739
you've decided<font color="#CCCCCC"> to use a vendor for</font>

917
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:04,510
Incident Response you make that<font color="#CCCCCC"> decision</font>

918
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:07,659
who it's going to be make that decision

919
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:09,909
here sign the paperwork here<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did an</font>

920
00:34:07,659 --> 00:34:12,700
incident response recently where I

921
00:34:09,909 --> 00:34:15,129
actually dug in and we we stopped the

922
00:34:12,699 --> 00:34:19,000
bleeding but their internal contracting

923
00:34:15,129 --> 00:34:21,879
process to two weeks<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it just SAT for</font>

924
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:23,349
two weeks on hold and their CEO kept

925
00:34:21,879 --> 00:34:24,609
asking what's going on what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

926
00:34:23,349 --> 00:34:25,210
where we hacked where we hacked where we

927
00:34:24,609 --> 00:34:27,069
hacked and we

928
00:34:25,210 --> 00:34:28,089
saying they kept saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> we don't know</font>

929
00:34:27,070 --> 00:34:30,159
yet we haven't gotten through

930
00:34:28,089 --> 00:34:33,040
contracting so if you're going to

931
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:36,129
contract for an external people do it do

932
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:40,449
it now before you need it and then

933
00:34:36,129 --> 00:34:42,190
monitor verification so this kind of

934
00:34:40,449 --> 00:34:43,658
weird<font color="#E5E5E5"> concept for people that we might</font>

935
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:45,879
actually want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to monitor stuff that's</font>

936
00:34:43,659 --> 00:34:48,520
going on in production more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than just</font>

937
00:34:45,879 --> 00:34:49,719
who's clicking<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're right we talked to</font>

938
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:52,418
product owners and their idea of

939
00:34:49,719 --> 00:34:54,009
monitoring is mixed panel whoo I know

940
00:34:52,418 --> 00:34:56,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">that users go from here to here to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here</font>

941
00:34:54,010 --> 00:34:57,970
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> here that's great okay the real</font>

942
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:59,349
monitoring that you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do is up</font>

943
00:34:57,970 --> 00:35:00,730
time on your servers right because

944
00:34:59,349 --> 00:35:02,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's important if you're in IT and</font>

945
00:35:00,730 --> 00:35:04,690
you're being measured by it but also you

946
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:07,598
want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> monitor activity and you don't</font>

947
00:35:04,690 --> 00:35:09,160
know if it's going to work the you don't

948
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:11,260
want to find out whether it works or not

949
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:11,950
when you push it to production so here's

950
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:13,359
we're going to do your final

951
00:35:11,950 --> 00:35:15,730
verification of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then you do</font>

952
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:19,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">really sign off ok this is process</font>

953
00:35:15,730 --> 00:35:21,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">oriented this requires agreement if</font>

954
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,869
you're in an agile world how long does

955
00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:26,460
it take<font color="#CCCCCC"> for you to say hey did all of</font>

956
00:35:22,869 --> 00:35:28,720
our security user cases get executed

957
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:30,730
half an hour someone looking at it right

958
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:32,230
how long does it take to say we have a

959
00:35:30,730 --> 00:35:34,150
response plan<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay well you had to write</font>

960
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:35,470
one and you might have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go and review</font>

961
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:36,880
you might have to spend an hour to

962
00:35:35,470 --> 00:35:39,580
reviewing it not a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of time invested</font>

963
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:40,720
there and monitor verification that

964
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:42,098
might<font color="#E5E5E5"> take a little bit more time that's</font>

965
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:43,839
some testing to make sure this monitor

966
00:35:42,099 --> 00:35:45,970
is going to work and<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> integrate into</font>

967
00:35:43,839 --> 00:35:48,190
your organization<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting side note</font>

968
00:35:45,970 --> 00:35:50,859
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mentioned I'm working for a major</font>

969
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:53,109
financial firm we just had this big

970
00:35:50,859 --> 00:35:54,790
breakthrough because a person I went to

971
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:57,970
high school with years and years and

972
00:35:54,790 --> 00:36:01,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">years ago well before there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was managed</font>

973
00:35:57,970 --> 00:36:03,939
code let's just put it that way is now a

974
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:05,799
sim engineer and was just hired and we

975
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:06,880
sort of just realized at some point<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

976
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:08,170
we were<font color="#E5E5E5"> working at the same major</font>

977
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:10,210
financial firm which is kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> cool</font>

978
00:36:08,170 --> 00:36:12,250
anyhow we were chatting and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was</font>

979
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:13,660
chatting<font color="#CCCCCC"> one of my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> co-workers about how</font>

980
00:36:12,250 --> 00:36:16,119
I knew this person who was<font color="#CCCCCC"> a sim</font>

981
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:18,549
engineer and he he was all<font color="#CCCCCC"> exciting is</font>

982
00:36:16,119 --> 00:36:19,660
like oh that's our phase<font color="#CCCCCC"> three we really</font>

983
00:36:18,550 --> 00:36:21,490
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to figure out how to tie our</font>

984
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:22,868
applications into the sim so it actually

985
00:36:21,490 --> 00:36:26,140
works<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we want to build a living</font>

986
00:36:22,869 --> 00:36:28,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">breathing almost self-aware system okay</font>

987
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:29,830
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> this concept of what's going on</font>

1000
00:36:55,910 --> 00:37:00,770
hack that happened a couple of<font color="#E5E5E5"> months</font>

1001
00:36:57,980 --> 00:37:03,160
ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> for my client the IT team had</font>

1002
00:37:00,770 --> 00:37:05,900
absolutely no clue what they were doing

their response to their<font color="#CCCCCC"> WordPress server</font>

1008
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:20,540
it absolutely wiped out every single

<font color="#CCCCCC">piece of evidence the only thing I could</font>

1010
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:25,970
tell them was I have log data up until

1011
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:28,850
this date and I have log data after this

1012
00:37:25,970 --> 00:37:33,470
date so clearly you were owned for these

1013
00:37:28,850 --> 00:37:34,819
35 days how no idea I can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell you</font>

1014
00:37:33,470 --> 00:37:36,980
because I can't look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the logs because</font>

1015
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:38,840
you wiped him out what did they do I

1016
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:42,140
don't know how do they attack you I

1017
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:43,850
think it was this right so if you

1018
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:45,950
tabletop your response and include your

1019
00:37:43,850 --> 00:37:47,690
entire response team it will be a good

<font color="#CCCCCC">idea what will happen is your IT</font>

1021
00:37:47,690 --> 00:37:51,710
administrators will realize they're

1022
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:54,170
absolutely clueless about what to do

1023
00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:56,000
during a response and you'll teach them

1024
00:37:54,170 --> 00:38:00,110
the five things they can do to preserve

1025
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:02,030
evidence simple right your management is

1026
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:04,940
absolutely clueless they have no idea

1027
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:06,740
how long it takes I swear managers think

1028
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:08,120
we're going to call<font color="#CCCCCC"> this guy he's going</font>

1029

to<font color="#E5E5E5"> come in an hour later we're going to</font>

1030
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:11,359
know what happened right it's like I'm

1031
00:38:09,290 --> 00:38:12,950
pulling<font color="#E5E5E5"> my car into the the tune-up</font>

1032
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:14,180
place and then going to open the hood

1033
00:38:12,950 --> 00:38:15,140
and connect a computer to it they're

1034
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:17,240
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to tell me what's wrong</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

1035

that's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> how it works incident</font>

1036
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:21,740
response takes a fair amount of time

1037
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:23,840
especially when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have either a lot of</font>

1038
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:25,129
data or no data because with no data<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1039
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:27,320
keep looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> and looking and looking and</font>

looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so you really want to spend</font>

1041
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:30,590
the time to do a tabletop response how

1042
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:33,259
much does it cost for you to do that

1043
00:38:30,590 --> 00:38:35,690
take an afternoon buy some pizza buy

1044
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:37,520
some soda get<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone in a room come up</font>

1045
00:38:35,690 --> 00:38:39,110
with a mock incident and then start

1046
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:40,580
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about okay how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are we going to</font>

1047
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:41,870
where are the logs what logs do we have

1048
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:43,340
what tools are going to use<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go</font>

1049
00:38:41,870 --> 00:38:48,220
through those logs so on and so forth

1050
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:51,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay all right we're moving</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right along</font>

1051
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:52,609
resources when it comes to the building

work<font color="#CCCCCC"> with they have the microsoft sdl</font>

1058
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:10,490
which describes how we built software

1059
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:13,100
internal to Microsoft I used to work at

1060
00:39:10,490 --> 00:39:16,279
Microsoft on that they have the

1061
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:17,660
simplified sdl which is basically whoa

1062
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:19,760
that's kind of the crawl walk run

1063
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:21,290
approach simplified sdl is just easier

1064
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:25,610
and then they have the<font color="#E5E5E5"> sdl a which is</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">aimed toward agile sdl activities be sim</font>

1066
00:39:25,610 --> 00:39:30,520
is a great resource as well and by the

1067
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:34,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">way all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of these resources</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are free</font>

1068
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:35,660
besom is it is really kind of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> sdl</font>

1069
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:37,730
that everyone models themselves after

1070
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:40,040
the nice thing is it's a maturity model

1071
00:39:37,730 --> 00:39:43,220
which means you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> rate yourself in</font>

1072
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:45,470
maturity and figure out where you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are so</font>

1073
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:47,450
if you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> just getting into it you'll</font>

1074
00:39:45,470 --> 00:39:49,189
pick their easiest maturity level and

1075
00:39:47,450 --> 00:39:51,680
it's like two or three things from<font color="#E5E5E5"> each</font>

1076
00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:53,210
category it's pretty easy to do it

1077
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:55,549
represents a great ramp up in your

1079

safe code earlier safe code has some

good documentation a lot of it's kind of

a repeatable you'll see on on the

those user stories and those use of

1085
00:40:07,790 --> 00:40:13,009
stories are really valuable if you're

1086
00:40:09,470 --> 00:40:14,359
sort of a formal agile shop those user

1087
00:40:13,010 --> 00:40:16,940
stories will really integrate well into

if you can have your developers read

these or if someone can prepare training

1114

for the developers based on these

1119
00:41:21,110 --> 00:41:27,170
you know build slides around it very

the Microsoft file fuzzer is an example

thought of grab those documents read

through them pick what works for you

a forced workflow process okay that's

1143

that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really not true they're good true</font>

00:42:13,970 --> 00:42:17,689
they're good tools they were great tools

1145
00:42:15,830 --> 00:42:20,319
before they got integrated into all the

1146

other tools that<font color="#E5E5E5"> people want to sell you</font>

1147
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:24,410
but there are tools out there that are

1148
00:42:22,250 --> 00:42:28,640
inexpensive that work really really well

1149
00:42:24,410 --> 00:42:31,640
or even free<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so kind of a wrap</font>

1155
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:42,980
the mobile security guidelines so I

1156
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:44,540
wrote over the course of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the last few</font>

included sample code how to do things

1159
00:42:46,850 --> 00:42:53,420
securely can you guess where that code

1160
00:42:49,430 --> 00:42:55,009
came from most of it came off the apple

1161

00:42:55,010 --> 00:43:00,320
site and was then modified<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay these</font>

1163
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:02,390
are great resources to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go for code when</font>

1164
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:04,040
it comes to stl design we<font color="#E5E5E5"> already talked</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">well things to consider buying it might</font>

1167
00:43:06,890 --> 00:43:11,750
make sense to pay<font color="#E5E5E5"> sands or someone else</font>

1168
00:43:09,110 --> 00:43:13,190
to do more advanced stuff or if you're

1169
00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:15,230
really really pressed for time and you

1170
00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:16,880
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the time to do those basic</font>

1171
00:43:15,230 --> 00:43:18,830
fundamental training courses then bring

1172
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:19,940
someone in you can find people who come

1173
00:43:18,830 --> 00:43:22,910
in and do that relatively

1174
00:43:19,940 --> 00:43:24,590
affordably<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay requirements you may</font>

00:43:22,910 --> 00:43:26,270
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to consider looking to consultants</font>

who have expertise in an area<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1177
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:30,290
you're moving into if you don't have the

00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:31,730
expertise there it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not required again</font>

1179
00:43:30,290 --> 00:43:35,300
it's a trade-off between time and money

1180
00:43:31,730 --> 00:43:38,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">I really feel strongly about static code</font>

1181
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:40,760
analysis break your bank on static code

1182
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:42,380
analysis break your bank on pen testing

1183
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:45,080
have a third party coming into your pen

1184
00:43:42,380 --> 00:43:47,990
testing right so how to get started how

1185
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:50,299
we doing on time poop scope your project

1186
00:43:47,990 --> 00:43:52,910
what are your goals why are you doing

1187
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:56,210
this why do you care<font color="#CCCCCC"> about this figure</font>

1188
00:43:52,910 --> 00:43:58,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">that out to determine what your the how</font>

1189
00:43:56,210 --> 00:44:01,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">you're you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that you're building the</font>

1190
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:03,050
right sdl<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay if it's if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

1191
00:44:01,010 --> 00:44:03,920
compliance with a regulatory board then

1192
00:44:03,050 --> 00:44:05,870
you're probably gonna have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go look</font>

1193
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:08,360
and see what their sdl requirements are

1194
00:44:05,870 --> 00:44:10,630
as opposed to we<font color="#CCCCCC"> just want to build good</font>

1195
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:13,430
secure code congratulations that's great

1196
00:44:10,630 --> 00:44:16,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay maturity start</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> small be realistic</font>

1197
00:44:13,430 --> 00:44:18,890
leverage existing knowledge and then the

1198
00:44:16,940 --> 00:44:21,170
key here<font color="#E5E5E5"> is to document it have it</font>

1199
00:44:18,890 --> 00:44:24,920
written down and have your executives by

1200
00:44:21,170 --> 00:44:27,530
in on it and be part of it<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I wrote</font>

1201
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:29,840
the most beautiful secure development

1202
00:44:27,530 --> 00:44:32,270
lifecycle I have ever in my career I

1203
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:34,820
spent on a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of weeks researching</font>

1204
00:44:32,270 --> 00:44:36,470
it taking<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of the expertise I had at</font>

1205
00:44:34,820 --> 00:44:38,690
Microsoft in other places and putting it

1206
00:44:36,470 --> 00:44:43,189
together and it had absolutely zero

1207
00:44:38,690 --> 00:44:45,680
support from management so it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> shelf</font>

1208
00:44:43,190 --> 00:44:46,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">where don't don't do these projects</font>

1209
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:48,589
without getting approval and buy-in

1210
00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:51,730
because it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a waste</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of your time</font>

1211
00:44:48,590 --> 00:44:53,780
you might as well game all afternoon

1212
00:44:51,730 --> 00:44:55,640
designing and implementing your<font color="#CCCCCC"> stl</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

1213
00:44:53,780 --> 00:44:57,950
an iterative<font color="#CCCCCC"> process it's a crawl walk</font>

1214
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:59,600
run process figure<font color="#CCCCCC"> out what your goals</font>

1215
00:44:57,950 --> 00:45:01,819
are pick your framework figure out what

1216
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:03,589
you already do find<font color="#E5E5E5"> your gaps address</font>

1217
00:45:01,820 --> 00:45:05,900
those gaps implement it and then do it

1218
00:45:03,590 --> 00:45:07,490
all over again step by step by step

1219
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:10,160
eventually you'll come to a point where

1220
00:45:07,490 --> 00:45:11,569
you have enough security and you'll know

1221
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:14,210
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have enough security you'll</font>

1222
00:45:11,570 --> 00:45:15,500
feel right about it management will feel

1223
00:45:14,210 --> 00:45:17,240
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> about how much time and money</font>

1224
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:18,980
you're spending you that's when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

1225
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:20,660
you've arrived at least for that week

1226
00:45:18,980 --> 00:45:23,990
and then the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next week everything will</font>

1227
00:45:20,660 --> 00:45:25,399
change okay so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the end of the</font>

1228
00:45:23,990 --> 00:45:31,450
presentation are there any questions

1229
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:31,450
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can answer yes</font>

1230
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:40,950
good and bad examples in a secure agile

1231
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:43,558
environment of what how to know when

1232
00:45:40,950 --> 00:45:46,140
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> done huh that's a great question</font>

1233
00:45:43,559 --> 00:45:47,549
so the bad examples are easy the bad

1234
00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:50,519
examples is our that you haven't

1235
00:45:47,549 --> 00:45:53,849
measured anything the good examples

1236
00:45:50,519 --> 00:45:56,879
really I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> say are those teams that</font>

1237
00:45:53,849 --> 00:45:57,990
push user stories into their rhythm and

1238
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:00,839
in fact here I'll show<font color="#E5E5E5"> you really</font>

1239
00:45:57,990 --> 00:46:03,089
quickly<font color="#E5E5E5"> here so in agile this is the</font>

1240
00:46:00,839 --> 00:46:05,880
Microsoft diagram they have this every

1241
00:46:03,089 --> 00:46:08,490
sprint requirement they have the idea of

1242
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:10,109
buckets so they got one time things that

1243
00:46:08,490 --> 00:46:11,490
you do once for your product design they

1244
00:46:10,109 --> 00:46:13,769
<font color="#CCCCCC">have every sprint things you do for</font>

1245
00:46:11,490 --> 00:46:15,720
every<font color="#E5E5E5"> single sprint buckets that you do</font>

1246
00:46:13,769 --> 00:46:17,368
every<font color="#E5E5E5"> once in a while okay a good</font>

1247
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:19,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">process is where you've defined those</font>

1248
00:46:17,369 --> 00:46:21,779
items and you're actually following them

1249
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:23,339
what those items are will change by team

1250
00:46:21,779 --> 00:46:25,349
and by technology and so forth but

1251
00:46:23,339 --> 00:46:26,670
that's the best really the idea here is

1252
00:46:25,349 --> 00:46:29,269
that you're proactive and you've thought

1253
00:46:26,670 --> 00:46:29,269
your way through<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

1254
00:46:34,830 --> 00:46:36,830
Oh

1255
00:47:02,099 --> 00:47:04,130
I

1256
00:47:08,849 --> 00:47:11,690
mm-hmm

1257
00:47:15,970 --> 00:47:25,618
you should be up here it's great answer

1258
00:47:19,270 --> 00:47:25,619
great answer good other questions yeah

1259
00:47:29,490 --> 00:47:37,029
do it recommendations in terms of

1260
00:47:32,619 --> 00:47:38,500
technology or strategy or all of it that

1261
00:47:37,030 --> 00:47:40,990
could probably be a talk in and of

1262
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:44,680
itself but<font color="#E5E5E5"> first my first recommendation</font>

1263
00:47:40,990 --> 00:47:46,540
is do it and start with you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

1264
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:51,310
funny<font color="#E5E5E5"> windows what's the default logging</font>

1265
00:47:46,540 --> 00:47:54,550
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> windows logins what is it only</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> log</font>

1266
00:47:51,310 --> 00:47:56,770
by default anyone know successful<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

1267
00:47:54,550 --> 00:47:58,180
so my client<font color="#E5E5E5"> got hacked what is the</font>

1268
00:47:56,770 --> 00:47:59,560
first thing I do I go look at the

1269
00:47:58,180 --> 00:48:02,589
windows event logs and guess what I find

1270
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:04,140
nothing<font color="#CCCCCC"> well all successes right I</font>

1271
00:48:02,590 --> 00:48:08,410
couldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> find any evidence of failure</font>

1272
00:48:04,140 --> 00:48:10,080
yeah so so log your failures they're

1273
00:48:08,410 --> 00:48:13,180
more important they're more interesting

1274
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:15,430
repeated failures right or if you're

1275
00:48:13,180 --> 00:48:17,919
using<font color="#E5E5E5"> something like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> iptables and failed</font>

1276
00:48:15,430 --> 00:48:19,810
a man log your log things that break the

1277
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:22,440
threshold things that go above the

1278
00:48:19,810 --> 00:48:24,700
signal-to-noise ratio is that helpful

1279
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:26,020
it's a good start there's that's a long

1280
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:30,970
conversation we could have other

1281
00:48:26,020 --> 00:48:35,020
questions so let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me wrap it all up by</font>

1282
00:48:30,970 --> 00:48:38,500
saying what I started<font color="#E5E5E5"> with I can't in an</font>

1283
00:48:35,020 --> 00:48:40,900
hour teach you what to do in your<font color="#E5E5E5"> secure</font>

1284
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:42,010
development life cycle because number

1285
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:44,080
one there's not enough time and<font color="#E5E5E5"> number</font>

1286
00:48:42,010 --> 00:48:45,369
two it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> different for everybody it</font>

1287
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:48,160
really should be different for every

1288
00:48:45,369 --> 00:48:49,780
team hopefully<font color="#E5E5E5"> we had a really high</font>

1289
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:51,279
level overview of what a secure

1290
00:48:49,780 --> 00:48:52,950
development lifecycle is training

1291
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:56,530
requirements design implementation

1292
00:48:52,950 --> 00:48:58,779
verification release and support right

1293
00:48:56,530 --> 00:49:00,849
and then we talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> I tried to show</font>

1294
00:48:58,780 --> 00:49:02,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">hey look really all you have to do is</font>

1295
00:49:00,849 --> 00:49:04,359
<font color="#CCCCCC">think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about these things and write down</font>

1296
00:49:02,830 --> 00:49:06,250
your plan you don't have to spend a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font>

1297
00:49:04,359 --> 00:49:07,690
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> money to get that done a couple of</font>

1298
00:49:06,250 --> 00:49:10,210
places where you do probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

1299
00:49:07,690 --> 00:49:11,710
invest money but most of it is just

1300
00:49:10,210 --> 00:49:12,970
stepping back and building an organized

1301
00:49:11,710 --> 00:49:14,470
approach and the last thing we talked

1302
00:49:12,970 --> 00:49:16,450
about were<font color="#CCCCCC"> some of your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> resources out</font>

1303
00:49:14,470 --> 00:49:18,430
there there's all of<font color="#CCCCCC"> this stuff has been</font>

1304
00:49:16,450 --> 00:49:19,980
done<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's published it's free it's out</font>

1305
00:49:18,430 --> 00:49:22,890
there all you have to do is grab<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

1306
00:49:19,980 --> 00:49:26,080
synthesize it for your organization and

1307
00:49:22,890 --> 00:49:28,120
get into<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> step-by-step crawl walk run</font>

1308
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:30,610
