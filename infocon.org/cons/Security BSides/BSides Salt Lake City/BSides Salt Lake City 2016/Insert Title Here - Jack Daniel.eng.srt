69
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,349
a community we have a lot of them some

70
00:04:20,089 --> 00:04:25,340
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have noticed there's some of us</font>

71
00:04:21,349 --> 00:04:27,650
that are like real information security

72
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:31,099
people and professionals and work for

73
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:32,630
companies and like usually have to go to

74
00:04:31,099 --> 00:04:34,099
the corporate conferences and then we

75
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:36,650
get<font color="#CCCCCC"> to come to events like this that we</font>

76
00:04:34,099 --> 00:04:40,760
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we kind of straddle it because</font>

77
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:42,349
the RSA community at large is different

78
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:43,880
than this community it's different than

79
00:04:42,349 --> 00:04:45,620
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> DEF CON community the black hat</font>

80
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:49,300
community is not the same as Def Con

81
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:52,190
anymore sometimes we get wound up and

82
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:53,810
don't play nice you may have<font color="#E5E5E5"> noticed</font>

83
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:58,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> folks like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to create drama</font>

84
00:04:53,810 --> 00:05:02,419
especially<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the Internet it's fun but</font>

85
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:04,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">not productive but we have to find the</font>

86
00:05:02,419 --> 00:05:06,948
good in the communities if I were more

87
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:09,489
of a sociologist I would probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

88
00:05:06,949 --> 00:05:12,139
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use the word tribes to describe this</font>

89
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:13,729
tribes and nations I think the the

90
00:05:12,139 --> 00:05:17,030
hacker tribes there are a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

91
00:05:13,729 --> 00:05:19,909
and sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of under that that nation flag</font>

92
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:23,119
move tribes but it's extremely valuable

93
00:05:19,909 --> 00:05:24,530
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm already wandering so just so</font>

94
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:27,230
that i can say i gave<font color="#E5E5E5"> you some</font>

95
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:29,750
information of some<font color="#CCCCCC"> value</font>

96
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:31,850
I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to throw three slides up if</font>

97
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:33,770
you're involved<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a hacker club</font>

98
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:37,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">especially at a school or high school</font>

99
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:40,340
tech school<font color="#E5E5E5"> University pivot project is</font>

100
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:43,660
a new project they're a handful i think

101
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:46,900
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> at six or seven labs there now</font>

102
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:50,540
these are great resources for

103
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:52,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">under-resourced hacker clubs</font>

104
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:54,500
particularly in education but they're

105
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:57,200
open<font color="#CCCCCC"> to anyone they tend to work best if</font>

106
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:59,030
it's you know some sort of leadership to

107
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:00,710
kind of to support<font color="#CCCCCC"> people there are an</font>

108
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:02,330
hour to hour<font color="#E5E5E5"> and a half they're</font>

109
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:04,940
continuously being driven a lot of

110
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:07,370
educators are involved<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this a couple</font>

of folks from sands at<font color="#CCCCCC"> scotus is one of</font>

112
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:13,460
the driving forces Alan Paller is behind

113
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:15,080
it which means<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's some some finance</font>

114
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:16,099
available to it but anyway this is a

115
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:18,200
cool resource for anybody that's

116
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:19,940
involved<font color="#E5E5E5"> in education you know if you're</font>

117
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:21,650
somewhere that<font color="#E5E5E5"> has a killer program</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> MIT</font>

118
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:25,010
doesn't need this help but your average

119
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:27,859
school does or club does if you're into

120
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:29,690
software assurance and you pay taxes in

online software security testing thing

125
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:43,310
load your code in see how it works it's

126
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:45,650
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the DHS it's one of the things</font>

security it'll overwhelm you but it's a

130
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:53,720
good place to go to get some some

131
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:57,770
baselines for free it's already paid for

132
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:59,060
so it's free free as in we've already

133
00:06:57,770 --> 00:07:02,000
paid for<font color="#CCCCCC"> it so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you might as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> well use it</font>

opportunity to look over our shoulder

142

and figure out how<font color="#E5E5E5"> we got where we are</font>

know I'll paraphrase hunter s thompson

bad decisions he was under stress he was

214
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:07,390
overconfident he knew what<font color="#CCCCCC"> he was doing</font>

better<font color="#E5E5E5"> than anybody else in the world</font>

216
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:13,220
and made a bad decision<font color="#E5E5E5"> I doesn't ring</font>

any bells with anybody in this room I'm

221
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:29,540
standing on the deck of his ship he was

222
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:32,120
the master and captain of the bounty the

223
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:38,589
replica built for the Marlon Brando

224
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:41,690
movie made in the early 60s he had done

225
00:11:38,589 --> 00:11:43,970
riverboats steam and paddle wheel as

226
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:46,880

the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Gulf to the east coast tanker</font>

228
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:52,310
routes he has he had navigated

229
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:56,030
everything from canoes and kayaks and

230
00:11:52,310 --> 00:12:00,140
rowboats to super tankers had decades on

231
00:11:56,030 --> 00:12:04,600
square riggers he was the second on the

00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:10,339
regular service that's rotting somewhere

234
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:11,630
on the west coast now but bounty was had

235
00:12:10,339 --> 00:12:12,800
a couple of interesting things was made

236
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:14,210
as a movie prop they were going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> burn</font>

237
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,010
it at the end of they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a scuttle</font>

238
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:17,300
it at the end<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the movie Brando said</font>

239
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:20,060
it was too nice a boat they couldn't do

240
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:21,939
that and therefore that kept its entire

241
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:24,410
life from the 60s until a few years ago

242
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:28,570
being patched up because it was built to

243
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:31,040
be thrown away this is her under sail

244
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:33,470
not much sale just enough<font color="#E5E5E5"> to kind of</font>

245
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:34,819
make it picturesque because the engines

00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:36,860
are running or it wouldn't be moving

247
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:39,170
with sales dang

248
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:42,260

bounty by the way they made extra large

259
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:09,890
to carry all the gear because all the

260
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:12,200
cameras and everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> went on on that</font>

Robin<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I became</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> friends there that's</font>

285
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:14,240
us closing or off thats us launching her

286
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:17,089
you'll note the things sticking up our

287
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:21,320
that rail that railway she was on and

288
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:25,400
yes we cracked the ice to launch her a

289
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:26,900
couple days<font color="#E5E5E5"> later we sailed south so I</font>

290
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:29,199
spent a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> weeks his crew on her</font>

291
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:33,560
helped rescue her a few times she had a

292
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:35,240
sinking incident so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> spent a lot of</font>

293
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:40,910
time on her and stayed<font color="#CCCCCC"> in touch with the</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">captain and he was a great friend and he</font>

00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:44,290
made a<font color="#E5E5E5"> bad decision a few years ago</font>

this<font color="#E5E5E5"> bag this is hurricane sandy October</font>

297
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:56,630
2012 she had sailed through worse Robin

298
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:58,520
had been on her through worse but<font color="#E5E5E5"> he</font>

299
00:14:56,630 --> 00:15:00,350
underestimated the size of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> storm</font>

300
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:03,380
and how long he and the crew and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

301
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:09,500
ship could handle hurricane sandy how

302
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:14,150
massive that storm was there were 16

303

people onboard the Coast Guard retrieved

304
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:20,990
14 souls as they like to say in the

going 90 miles offshore in a hurricane

314
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:43,550
90 miles offshore means they're about<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

315
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:45,589
forget how far inland the<font color="#CCCCCC"> air station is</font>

00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:47,329
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they fly out of but they didn't</font>

have more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than about 30 minutes on site</font>

318
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:51,890
because they were running<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of fuel</font>

319
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:53,390
every drop they would he<font color="#E5E5E5"> would drop</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> them</font>

320
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:54,770
they would have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to pick him up and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

321
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:57,319
take<font color="#E5E5E5"> him back because the life rafts</font>

322
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:58,520
were blowing<font color="#CCCCCC"> away</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> too fast camera points</font>

323
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:00,470
at him and says you know how do you feel

324
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:03,980
about this like I'm kind of scared but

325
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:06,860
this is what I signed up for yep that's

326
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:08,980
coasties anyway one person was lost and

327
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:11,510
recovered her name is Claudine Christian

328
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:16,850
actually a descendant<font color="#CCCCCC"> of Fletcher</font>

329
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:20,180
Christian and Robin was lost with the

330
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:22,070
ship we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know for sure but one of</font>

331
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:26,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">those orange bits is probably Robin</font>

332
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:28,790
trapped in rigging in his life vest it

333
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:31,209
is a survival suit it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> probably the</font>

334
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:33,920
last picture my friend Robin this hat

335
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:37,160
last<font color="#E5E5E5"> time I saw him I was wearing my</font>

336
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:39,020
green George Caribbean<font color="#CCCCCC"> son's paint hat</font>

337
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:41,689
and he said I want one of those I didn't

338
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:42,860
know they had hats I'll get<font color="#E5E5E5"> you one so I</font>

339
00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:45,650
bought it for him I haven't<font color="#CCCCCC"> been able to</font>

340
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:47,300
give it to him<font color="#E5E5E5"> someday</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if I'm</font>

341
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:50,699
sentimental and sailing again I might

342
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:53,250
sail out and drop it overboard but

343
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:56,580
Oh time<font color="#CCCCCC"> for a tangent</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all right so</font>

344
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:58,500
completely off here we go if you have a

345
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:59,850
family run business and don't have a web

346
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:02,040
presence you might want to think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

347
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:05,720
having<font color="#E5E5E5"> a web presence especially if you</font>

348
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:07,949
google your<font color="#CCCCCC"> family run businesses name</font>

349
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:09,360
and the only thing that shows up on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

350
00:17:07,949 --> 00:17:14,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">first page of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Google is the EPA</font>

351
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:16,290
Superfund site information get Kirby has

352
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,510
been doing paint for a very long time

353
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:19,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">and so they sort of had</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> problem so</font>

354
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:21,540
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys really need a website</font>

355
00:17:19,619 --> 00:17:23,399
everybody comes to us it's like<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

356
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:24,959
just don't want people to try to find

357
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:28,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> phone number</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> find your a</font>

358
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:31,980
Superfund site uh so anyway that's a

359
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:33,480
story I added<font color="#CCCCCC"> that because i was in</font>

360
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:34,890
Tampa last week and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was on the water</font>

361
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:36,540
on a cruise ship very different than

362
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:38,820
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I realized the last time i was</font>

363
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:42,540
on those waters I was in a ship which is

364
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:46,740
now at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bottom of the ocean so anyway</font>

365
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:49,260
a little perspective hopefully none of

366
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:52,740
our<font color="#E5E5E5"> decisions but people's lives in</font>

367
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:58,470
danger and not just the 16 of you on the

368
00:17:52,740 --> 00:18:02,090
boat<font color="#CCCCCC"> but the crews it had to go out but</font>

369
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:04,350
I our decisions do have consequences and

370
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:05,850
sometimes we make bad decisions so some

371
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:07,560
of you may know<font color="#E5E5E5"> some years ago a group</font>

372
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:10,530
of us did a study on stress and burnout

373
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:12,179
this is not that talk that talks pretty

374
00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:14,310
depressing there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> some depressing bits</font>

375
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:18,210
here like this let's scare the shit out

376
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:20,399
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them story I just told you but we</font>

377
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:22,890
learned<font color="#E5E5E5"> some things about that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and from</font>

378
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:25,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we learned that you know a lot of</font>

379
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:26,850
people like<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we do we tend to stay</font>

380
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:29,760
in the business we like it then it burns

381
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:33,629
us out and we leave most of us think we

382
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:35,600
have a strong support<font color="#CCCCCC"> network we later</font>

383
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:37,680
found out that that was a skewed number

384
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:39,870
the reason it was skewed is because most

385
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:41,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the respondents came from people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

386
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:43,290
we knew from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the b-sides community and</font>

387
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:45,270
therefore we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a strong</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> support</font>

388
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:49,500
network it's like hey that's sweet not

389
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:54,600
everybody has that we consider our work

390
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:56,490
valuable to us personally others value

391
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:58,439
our work let's sort hit or miss you know

392
00:18:56,490 --> 00:19:00,690
sometimes people do a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of times they</font>

393
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:04,220
don't we try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make the world</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a safer</font>

394
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:04,220
place and sometimes succeed

395
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:10,179
we like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> think critically we like to</font>

396
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:11,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">problem-solve maybe we'd like the</font>

397
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:13,810
problems to back off just a little bit

398
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:16,060
from<font color="#CCCCCC"> time to time but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know we like</font>

399
00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:18,429
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem solve and you know it tends</font>

400
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:21,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">to pay well but that's not the critical</font>

401
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:24,310
reason we do<font color="#E5E5E5"> it you know we don't like</font>

402
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:26,620
management politics we don't like egos

403
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:29,800
and rock stars and media hypes is the

404
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:32,770
idiot<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the long beard and top hat we</font>

405
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:34,659
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> media hype we don't like the bad</font>

406
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:36,340
business decisions and more on that

407
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:37,780
later some of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> aren't bad we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

408
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:41,889
don't understand them and nobody tells

409
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:44,410
us why but we like the<font color="#CCCCCC"> fact that there's</font>

410
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:46,180
a lot to learn we like<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fact we</font>

411
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:50,230
actually have fun doing we're doing at

412
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:53,290
times we go to great conferences we hang

413
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:54,790
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> with smart people room full of</font>

414
00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:56,350
brilliant people here while you're

415
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:58,750
listening<font color="#E5E5E5"> to me I don't know but they</font>

416
00:19:56,350 --> 00:20:01,780
asked me<font color="#CCCCCC"> to here's something that I've</font>

417
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:05,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">learned and it didn't just come on one</font>

418
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:07,510
in old age something about stress and

419
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:08,740
memory<font color="#CCCCCC"> loss if you find</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yourself under</font>

420
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:09,760
stress and don't manage your stress

421
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:11,950
you're going to find your job

422
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:14,140
performance<font color="#CCCCCC"> goes to hell because you</font>

423
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:17,710
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know stuff to be an infosec and</font>

424
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:19,300
stress will screw<font color="#CCCCCC"> up your memory like</font>

425
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:20,800
you wouldn't believe it drives too far

426
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:23,409
if any of you have had major health

427
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:25,090
issues major family crises and

428
00:20:23,410 --> 00:20:27,520
unfortunately<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know that's fairly</font>

429
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:29,560
common you probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> noticed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that and if</font>

430
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:32,620
you have sustained family medical issues

431
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:34,419
or you have medical issues you can

432
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:35,919
<font color="#CCCCCC">probably handle that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and if you hate</font>

433
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:37,990
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> job</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and your job is driving you</font>

434
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:39,730
stark raving mad on top of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it you're</font>

435
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:41,620
going to find that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have notepads</font>

436
00:20:39,730 --> 00:20:43,090
everywhere and you can't even<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out</font>

437
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:46,300
what you know pet as the important notes

438
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:47,620
for your stuff and it's on you<font color="#E5E5E5"> no</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way so</font>

439
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:49,930
one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the side effects and one of the</font>

440
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:51,189
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that we actually if we let</font>

441
00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:53,590
ourselves drill into it you know a

442
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:55,780
stressed<font color="#E5E5E5"> state our performance goes off</font>

443
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:57,490
in large part because a memory should

444
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:59,710
you be fortunate enough to live to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

445
00:20:57,490 --> 00:21:03,300
somewhat older this gets a lot worse I

446
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:03,300
think I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> remember</font>

447
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:09,190
so I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about three words</font>

448
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:11,680
these are the bad words and the bad

449
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:14,800
words well two<font color="#CCCCCC"> are bad and one is good</font>

450
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:17,350
but these are<font color="#E5E5E5"> the words we watch for as</font>

451
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:18,820
we're trying to stay away from from

452
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:23,139
problem areas of three words one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

453
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:26,139
words is efficacy this is a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> word if</font>

454
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:27,940
we feel we're personally effective that

455
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:31,030
doesn't mean we're beating the bad guys

456
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:35,920
but we feel we're doing our job we feel

457
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:38,110
productive that's healthy when you lose

458
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:39,580
that that becomes problematic so when

459
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:41,320
you see that<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing where you don't feel</font>

460
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:42,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">you're being is effective you need to</font>

461
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:45,520
look at it and stop and<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is I go</font>

462
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:47,140
what's what's going on exhaustion is

463
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:50,730
another one these two turn out to be

464
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:52,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">highly interrelated in crisis cases</font>

465
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:56,230
because if you think<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're doing a good</font>

466
00:21:52,900 --> 00:22:00,370
job you will<font color="#E5E5E5"> drive yourself ragged and</font>

467
00:21:56,230 --> 00:22:02,530
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay because you're being effective</font>

468
00:22:00,370 --> 00:22:04,719
and then something<font color="#E5E5E5"> goes wrong and you</font>

469
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:06,910
realize or you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not being</font>

470
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:09,370
effective and now you no longer have the

471
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:12,550
emotional drive to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and the</font>

472
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:13,989
exhaustion collapses on you and those

473
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:15,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">are the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> folks that we often see in the</font>

474
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:18,640
third one it's kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of hard to talk</font>

475
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:20,260
about because it's cynicism and in

476
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:22,450
everything we've looked at that's like

477
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:27,340
cynicism that's core competency for info

478
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:29,290
SEC and the trick there I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

479
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:31,449
distinction it's hard to measure without

480
00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:34,510
a conversation tests can't really

481
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:38,910
measure it well standardized<font color="#CCCCCC"> test you</font>

482
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:43,870
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hard to be effective in</font>

483
00:22:38,910 --> 00:22:48,390
infosec if you are not skeptical now

484
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:52,300
skeptical is cool it's like yeah okay

485
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:56,590
can you<font color="#E5E5E5"> back that up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you back</font>

486
00:22:52,300 --> 00:23:00,930
that up without citing<font color="#CCCCCC"> poem on friends</font>

487
00:22:56,590 --> 00:23:00,929
don't let friends site poonam on

488
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:20,350
ah<font color="#CCCCCC"> isn't that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the truth so yeah don't</font>

489
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:22,029
fall for stuff right again there was

490
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:24,219
that thing last week in San Francisco

491
00:23:22,029 --> 00:23:26,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">and there was a lot of stuff for fall</font>

492
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:27,820
for so don't fall for stuff but there's

493
00:23:26,679 --> 00:23:30,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">a difference between that and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

494
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:32,559
believing in anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> although one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of my</font>

495
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:34,990
favorite<font color="#E5E5E5"> carlin quotes is inside every</font>

496
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:37,600
cynic is a disappointed idealist that

497
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:39,309
may personally sting a bit but anyway

498
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:41,110
those are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the words you're trying to do</font>

499
00:23:39,309 --> 00:23:44,168
so we did a study on burn out the cool

500
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:46,178
thing was that half the people had no

501
00:23:44,169 --> 00:23:50,320
indicators they were nice and healthy

502
00:23:46,179 --> 00:23:52,539
and it was fantastic and a handful<font color="#E5E5E5"> of us</font>

503
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:54,189
did analysis on those respondents to

504
00:23:52,539 --> 00:23:57,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">figure out what the patterns were what</font>

505
00:23:54,190 --> 00:24:00,370
the keys were and this is what<font color="#CCCCCC"> we found</font>

506
00:23:57,690 --> 00:24:06,100
it's a better random number generator

507
00:24:00,370 --> 00:24:09,668
than NSA has given this to give us there

508
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:11,350
were no<font color="#E5E5E5"> patterns so I know where I am so</font>

509
00:24:09,669 --> 00:24:14,980
some you I know are not coffee drinkers

510
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:16,750
that's cool but you don't have to drink

511
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:21,519
coffee to appreciate the metaphor this

512
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:22,870
is a part of my breakfast shrine as a

513
00:24:21,519 --> 00:24:26,909
toaster there I hardly ever use that

514
00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:30,309
there's also<font color="#E5E5E5"> a giant fruit press juicer</font>

515
00:24:26,909 --> 00:24:33,580
is next to that so I can have fresh

516
00:24:30,309 --> 00:24:35,260
orange juice here's something really

517
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:37,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">weird we've got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we got a place for the</font>

518
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:39,330
winter down in coastal georgia sore

519
00:24:37,090 --> 00:24:42,370
minutes from 30<font color="#E5E5E5"> minutes for more</font>

520
00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:44,260
northern florida so good fresh oranges

521
00:24:42,370 --> 00:24:48,129
are readily available in bags at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

522
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:49,809
supermarket cheap can anybody explain to

523
00:24:48,130 --> 00:24:51,730
me why it is if you buy fresh oranges

524
00:24:49,809 --> 00:24:53,559
even juice oranges cut them in half and

525
00:24:51,730 --> 00:24:55,470
squeeze them and drink what comes out it

526
00:24:53,559 --> 00:24:58,960
doesn't taste like orange<font color="#CCCCCC"> juice</font>

527
00:24:55,470 --> 00:25:00,880
commercial product rant anyway so the

528
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:04,049
way this works is think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the poor</font>

529
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:07,539
coffee bean you picked a little bean

530
00:25:04,049 --> 00:25:10,360
ship it across the<font color="#CCCCCC"> world you roast it</font>

531
00:25:07,539 --> 00:25:12,399
grind it<font color="#E5E5E5"> up add hot water under extreme</font>

532
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:14,389
pressure and something<font color="#E5E5E5"> comes out the</font>

533
00:25:12,399 --> 00:25:18,169
bottom<font color="#E5E5E5"> that might be good or bad</font>

534
00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:19,940
if you've done it right wait abused all

535
00:25:18,170 --> 00:25:21,380
through your life and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then add heat and</font>

536
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:26,450
pressure that sounds like working an

537
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:27,710
infosec right so what do you do with

538
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:29,960
that well most people don't shoot

539
00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:31,250
espresso straight but you know if it

540
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:32,660
comes out right<font color="#CCCCCC"> you get a nice rich</font>

541
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:34,310
crema and you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know you can</font>

542
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:36,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually taste flavors other than</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

543
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:38,030
the the puckering bitterness and then we

544
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:41,270
you know maybe add water or sweeteners

545
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:42,950
or creamers or flavorings to taste and

546
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:46,400
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of where we are we have to</font>

547
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:50,450
take where we land going through life

548
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:51,770
and I hate<font color="#E5E5E5"> this slide I did this some mo</font>

549
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:53,000
while ago and there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just way too much</font>

550
00:25:51,770 --> 00:25:58,190
stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we're going to talk through it</font>

551
00:25:53,000 --> 00:26:02,600
because i hears that coffee grinder

552
00:25:58,190 --> 00:26:03,860
press steamer thing boiled down and we

553
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:05,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">take some of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the stuff that comes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in at</font>

substance abuse that's a whole nother

559

a few of them and talking about we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

562
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:31,430
a bunch of really smart people in the

and they like to push their body to

565

00:26:43,850 --> 00:26:47,679
stance on recreational pharmaceuticals

569
00:26:49,090 --> 00:26:55,340
but let me just say this you can call it

570
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:57,409
biohacking but when<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's drug abuse</font>

old people be upset about this this is

618

620
00:28:56,450 --> 00:28:59,450
for it and if I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it I can go</font>

621

622
00:28:59,450 --> 00:29:03,020
jobs I don't know what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> wrong</font>

626
00:29:11,810 --> 00:29:15,200
minutes<font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk let's talk one of the</font>

627
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:17,120
things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I didn't realize because I</font>

628
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:18,770
dropped out of I had the decency to drop

629
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:20,989
out of college early and drop<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of a</font>

630
00:29:18,770 --> 00:29:22,220
cheap school my children<font color="#CCCCCC"> also had the</font>

631
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:25,310
same<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing they dropped out a cheap</font>

632
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:28,420
colleges so the number of<font color="#E5E5E5"> young people</font>

633
00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:31,669
that are under an enormous financial aid

634
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:33,700
student loan burden is really depressing

635
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:39,230
and that's not just an infosec problem

636
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:41,440
one of my Congress my congressman I was

637
00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:43,700
at a fundraiser for him and one of his

638
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:45,860
another congressperson from an adjacent

639
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:50,260
district was there and that the topic

640
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:52,310
came up and she had an<font color="#CCCCCC"> aide so you know</font>

641
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:54,290
congressional aides don't make a lot of

642
00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:55,790
money carrying about a hundred and<font color="#E5E5E5"> forty</font>

643
00:29:54,290 --> 00:29:57,830
five thousand dollars in student debt

644
00:29:55,790 --> 00:29:59,300
that's not for a medical degree you know

645
00:29:57,830 --> 00:30:01,580
that's political science or something

646
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:06,260
that pays nothing until you make<font color="#CCCCCC"> it to K</font>

647
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:08,050
Street and become a lobbyist so where do

648
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:10,160

hand-cut canals carved by according to

669
00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:09,970
the tourism people carved by pirates to

670
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:11,590
hide their stuff more likely hacked by

671
00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:13,450
fishermen to get to the giant lagoon and

672
00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:16,270

985
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:39,369
a giant it's by providing that now we

986
00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:41,440
all have<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know things to do and as</font>

00:44:39,369 --> 00:44:44,520
Gandhi famously said the problem with

988
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:47,530
altruism is there's nothing in it for me

989
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:49,660
I think you said something about<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

992
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:58,330
there is something in it<font color="#E5E5E5"> for you you</font>

993
00:44:56,560 --> 00:45:03,310
feel better because you do cool stuff

<font color="#E5E5E5">you make connections you network and I'm</font>

995
00:45:03,310 --> 00:45:09,250
not saying do it for mercenary reasons

996
00:45:05,020 --> 00:45:10,839
but when you do good stuff when you help

997
00:45:09,250 --> 00:45:13,330
other people they're more likely to help

998
00:45:10,839 --> 00:45:14,529
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you need it and they're more</font>

1000
00:45:14,530 --> 00:45:22,180
it so anyway education learn something

1004
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:29,250
satisfying

1005
00:45:31,190 --> 00:45:34,410
sometimes you need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make little</font>

1006
00:45:32,910 --> 00:45:37,859
changes sometimes you may need to make

00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:49,520
too many qualified trained employees and

1010
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:54,870
is it easy hiring the folks you need I

1011
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:57,980
know the answer<font color="#E5E5E5"> to that one from a study</font>

1012
00:45:54,870 --> 00:46:00,420
this is one like psychologists and other

1013
00:45:57,980 --> 00:46:02,790

and why we don't understand the time oh

1039
00:47:07,710 --> 00:47:13,770

people understand why goes a long way

1042
00:47:15,870 --> 00:47:23,580
it's like look you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the company just</font>

00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:31,440
maybe you want to go to when your

1049
00:47:33,060 --> 00:47:39,870
oh I get it you know I have some control

1050
00:47:38,100 --> 00:47:41,100
that provide feedback you know let

1051
00:47:39,870 --> 00:47:43,690
people know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what's going on don't let</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">them face challenges alone</font>

1053
00:47:43,690 --> 00:47:47,540

1054
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:49,610
enough qualified incident responders and

1055
00:47:47,540 --> 00:47:52,970
so they get work piled on them until

1056
00:47:49,610 --> 00:47:54,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">they melt down and leave and then there</font>

1057
00:47:52,970 --> 00:47:58,850
are even fewer people in need burn

1058
00:47:54,440 --> 00:48:05,120
amount allow employees to disconnect

1059
00:47:58,850 --> 00:48:07,220
maybe force it offer education I you've

1063
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:15,980
what if we train them<font color="#CCCCCC"> and they leave the</font>

1064
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:23,210
other one says what if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we don't train</font>

1066
00:48:23,210 --> 00:48:27,860
lot of this comes down to really

1067
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:29,570
understanding what's important to you

1074
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:42,590
and people will get<font color="#E5E5E5"> over it right there</font>

1075
00:48:41,030 --> 00:48:44,600
other places where a female goes down

hard that the higher note strings are on

1106

the shorter machine heads so the strings

named<font color="#E5E5E5"> that guitar and every guitar yet</font>

afterwards Lucille to remind him never

00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:51,049
to do anything that stupid again so he

1135
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:53,880
found a guitar that was good for him<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1136
00:51:51,050 --> 00:51:57,150
his guitar mechanic would take an

1137
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:59,250
off-the-shelf model and put a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of</font>

1138
00:51:57,150 --> 00:52:02,700
tweaks in it and off we go so the

1139
00:51:59,250 --> 00:52:04,830
reality is<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know you see a master</font>

1140
00:52:02,700 --> 00:52:07,080
guitarist dick dale or BB king or

1141
00:52:04,830 --> 00:52:09,779
somebody look at that guitar and think

1142
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:11,490
it's important to<font color="#CCCCCC"> him you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know BB</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> king</font>

1143

don't need whatever it is you're doing

1145
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:18,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">Dick Dale leaves it if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that if you've</font>

1146
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:20,910
got that acts that that Leo built for

1147
00:52:18,030 --> 00:52:22,950
you in the 50s take care of it it'll

1148
00:52:20,910 --> 00:52:24,960
take<font color="#CCCCCC"> care of you but know what matters</font>

1149
00:52:22,950 --> 00:52:27,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's really what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it what it's</font>

1150
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:30,330
about focus on what's important to you

1151
00:52:27,230 --> 00:52:33,540
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna leave you with another quote</font>

1152
00:52:30,330 --> 00:52:38,370
one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> my favorite quotes for b-sides</font>

1153
00:52:33,540 --> 00:52:40,860
audiences from Isaac Newton I do not

1154
00:52:38,370 --> 00:52:42,960
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I may appear</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the world but</font>

1155
00:52:40,860 --> 00:52:44,660
to myself I seem to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been only like</font>

1156
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:47,220
a boy playing<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the seashore and</font>

1157
00:52:44,660 --> 00:52:49,740
diverting myself and now and then

1158
00:52:47,220 --> 00:52:52,259
finding a smoother pebble or prettier

1159
00:52:49,740 --> 00:52:54,779
shell than ordinary whilst the great

1160
00:52:52,260 --> 00:52:58,470
ocean of truth lay all undiscovered

1161
00:52:54,780 --> 00:53:03,660
before me Newton felt that way about his

1162
00:52:58,470 --> 00:53:08,899
discoveries he found interesting shells

1163
00:53:03,660 --> 00:53:08,899
and pretty pebbles and changed the world

1164
00:53:09,290 --> 00:53:14,520
if you go out and you find your shells

1165
00:53:12,210 --> 00:53:15,900
and find your pebbles you're going to

1166
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:17,550
change<font color="#E5E5E5"> your world for the better and</font>

1167
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:19,560
maybe other people's worlds for the

1168
00:53:17,550 --> 00:53:23,400
better because you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing things that</font>

1169
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:26,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">matter to you and then the stupidity at</font>

1170
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:28,770
work doesn't matter as much the family

1171
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:30,599
stuff is easier to<font color="#E5E5E5"> deal with the bad</font>

1172
00:53:28,770 --> 00:53:32,220
stuff and the good stuff is even better

1173
00:53:30,599 --> 00:53:35,670
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can share it with people and</font>

1174
00:53:32,220 --> 00:53:37,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">with that it is not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the end this is the</font>

1175
00:53:35,670 --> 00:53:41,220
beginning of two days of cool stuff and
