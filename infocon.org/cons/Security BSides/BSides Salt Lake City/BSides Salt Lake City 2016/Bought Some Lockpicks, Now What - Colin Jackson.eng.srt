78
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,380
read and researched it seems like it's

79
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:30,320
classified as possession of burglary

80
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:32,959
tools and the main<font color="#E5E5E5"> focus of it is the</font>

81
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:34,100
intent so just shout out real quick

82
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:38,920
other than lockpicks what are some

83
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:43,430

or the car thing the car thing love

86
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:52,370
brick a rock so technically if you carry

87
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,790
a brick around you could be carrying a

88
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:58,880
burglary tool but all<font color="#CCCCCC"> depend or what or</font>

89
00:03:55,790 --> 00:04:01,609
Mason yes if you're a Mason or a poser

in Utah I don't expect<font color="#E5E5E5"> you to read all</font>

93
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:11,000
of this but this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the Utah law</font>

94
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:13,420
basically comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on to don't be stupid</font>

95
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:17,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't burgle don't attempt burglary</font>

96
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:22,550
stuff like that so why lock picking an

97
00:04:17,329 --> 00:04:24,710
infosec reason why is you know they are

98
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:25,940
related<font color="#E5E5E5"> disciplines you know locks are</font>

99
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:28,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">literally a brand</font>

100
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:32,450
physical security one of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 domains</font>

101
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:35,330
type thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you know knowing how to</font>

102
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:37,729
pick locks you know especially if you're

103
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:39,620
a security<font color="#E5E5E5"> consultant doing physical</font>

104
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:40,820
penetration tests things like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

105
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:43,190
can get access to a lot of stuff you

106
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:45,680
shouldn't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> access to like you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

107
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:50,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">lot terminals laptops and routers</font>

108
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:51,710
network devices you know access to

109
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:53,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">internal network you can plug something</font>

110
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:56,960
in you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> wiring closets usually</font>

111
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:59,240
aren't monitored well I guess it depends

112
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:02,390
where you're at you can even access a

113
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:04,070
data center like you know always<font color="#E5E5E5"> do this</font>

114
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:06,860
with permission if you do do this in an

115
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:09,620
engagement just saying and<font color="#E5E5E5"> access</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

116
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:12,350
satellite branches or whatever one thing

117
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:15,710
so physical security breaches can be as

118
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:18,380
damaging as a computer breach in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

119
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:20,210
sense that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know physical access is</font>

120
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:22,610
almost always better because you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

121
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:24,320
just grab a server and walk out<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then</font>

122
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:27,980
you can you know take<font color="#CCCCCC"> it into your own</font>

123
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:31,280
home pull hashes you know get domain

124
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:33,380
information you know anyone know the

125
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:37,099
going rate for a laptop on the black

126
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:38,750
market with the data on it<font color="#E5E5E5"> I heard it</font>

127
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:40,760
somewhere like some people<font color="#E5E5E5"> will pay like</font>

128
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:41,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">14 thousand dollars if it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> connected to</font>

129
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:43,250
like a corporate account and has

00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:45,770
corporate<font color="#E5E5E5"> data just so they can have the</font>

132
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:51,020
interesting I don't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a source on</font>

133
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:52,220
that but I heard it once I did read it

134
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:56,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">on the internet they don't let anyone</font>

135
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:59,330
post stuff on the internet so so

136
00:05:56,900 --> 00:06:01,429
continued I'd kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of mentioned this</font>

137
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:03,469
earlier definitely security consultants

138
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:05,840
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> Red Team people that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are hired</font>

139
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:08,300
for engagements you know no lock picking

140
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:10,520
what about regular IT guys how<font color="#E5E5E5"> often are</font>

141
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:12,560
we in a server room and you know if our

142
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:15,229
server acts are locked and you don't

00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:17,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">have the keys or like you know Bob the</font>

144
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:20,600
network guy is on vacation and the keys

145
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,680
to whatever is on his<font color="#E5E5E5"> keychain maybe you</font>

146
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:25,700
need it may be you have permission to

147
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:27,950
get into<font color="#E5E5E5"> that don't expect you to read</font>

148
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:29,570
all of this but<font color="#E5E5E5"> this it's interesting</font>

149
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:31,789
how companies will invest hundreds of

150
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:34,610
thousands<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dollars in the latest</font>

151
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:37,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">next-gen firewall equipment you know all</font>

152
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:39,200
this different stuff and then they will

153
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:42,410
protect it with

154
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:45,890
cabinets walked with just dollar just

155
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:48,530
like cheap hardware store locks and even

156
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:50,120
basic rooms like basic door locks like

157
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:52,880
but we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> supposed to lock the server</font>

158
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:55,570
room so here's this a generic brand

159
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:59,590
thing lock in our server room<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind um</font>

160
00:06:55,570 --> 00:07:03,650
this is a study done by some pen testers

161
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:05,030
that was anyway they found<font color="#CCCCCC"> that more</font>

162
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:06,530
than fifty percent of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the cases neither</font>

163
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:08,210
server rooms nor the racks were even

164
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:09,440
locked probably for convenience it's

165
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:11,830
just I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have to unlock this</font>

166
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:14,390
every time and do maintenance on it and

167
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:15,680
they also do a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of stuff for Latin</font>

168
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:17,900
America and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they say Latin America is</font>

169
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:20,540
ahead and far advanced when it comes to

170
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:24,169
physical security around<font color="#CCCCCC"> S&P</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> markets and</font>

171
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:26,270
stuff like that and they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not as many</font>

172
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:29,110
breaches as in other countries due to

173
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:31,549
the physical security that they have so

174
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:32,840
you know understanding that take a look

175
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:35,330
around your organization think about

176
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:36,770
your server rooms like how important is

177
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:39,340
your corporate data and how are you

178
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:41,419
protecting it not only like you know a

179
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:45,580
network and everything but physically

180
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:49,190
how are you protecting that stuff so

181
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:52,190
first I'm going up physical security is

182
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:54,380
something that everybody deals with<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

183
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:58,700
just by show of hands how many people's

184
00:07:54,380 --> 00:08:00,380
job is the security at your company<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

185
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:02,719
I would argue that everyone's job is

186
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:04,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">security in one way or another like if</font>

187
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:08,030
you see something<font color="#E5E5E5"> say something type</font>

188
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:09,980
stuff and you know especially like we

189
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:12,559
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you know due diligence say like</font>

190
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:13,850
hey that's a really poor lock that's

191
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:17,270
really dumb I've got a couple examples

192
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:20,210
here in a second yeah but this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

193
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:24,080
something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> a hacks hacks</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and vil</font>

194
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:26,570
mentioned at the b-sides in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Orlando see</font>

195
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,800
and this is from<font color="#CCCCCC"> high chaos at rubicon</font>

196
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:31,219
he says no matter<font color="#E5E5E5"> what security measures</font>

197
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:34,250
are implemented physical when physical

198
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:36,070
access is impossible or wow it's early

199
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:39,950
no<font color="#E5E5E5"> matter what security measures</font>

200
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:44,360
physical access is still the worst<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind</font>

201
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:46,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">of access that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> could lose so</font>

202
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:49,459
ok so how effective are locks I have a

203
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:51,860
good friend of mine<font color="#E5E5E5"> he's a doctor and he</font>

204
00:08:49,459 --> 00:08:56,390
he does pick locks and he<font color="#E5E5E5"> got hired on</font>

205
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:58,070
and they were at their their urgent care

206
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:59,870
there after hours clinic and you know

207
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:01,579
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> had a medicine cabinet and their</font>

208
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:02,899
company policy was you know prescription

209
00:09:01,579 --> 00:09:04,339
and controlled substances keep it locked

210
00:09:02,899 --> 00:09:06,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">in a medicine-cabinet he was looking at</font>

211
00:09:04,339 --> 00:09:08,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">it you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know I had like vicodin percocet</font>

212
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:10,790
her you know who<font color="#E5E5E5"> knows what in it and</font>

213
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:13,189
he's like and as he was going<font color="#CCCCCC"> through he</font>

214
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:14,870
says that is a horrible lock and that is

215
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:16,279
terrible I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> like oh well we have to</font>

216
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:17,480
keep it locked it's like let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me show you</font>

217
00:09:16,279 --> 00:09:18,709
something he didn't even pull out his

218
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:20,300
lock picks he pulled out<font color="#E5E5E5"> the little</font>

219
00:09:18,709 --> 00:09:21,739
Swiss Army knife keychains Swiss Army

220
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:23,300
knife and picked it<font color="#E5E5E5"> with that and opened</font>

221
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:25,070
it up<font color="#CCCCCC"> as like this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is in the patient</font>

222
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:26,569
area we should really<font color="#E5E5E5"> get rid of that</font>

223
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:29,420
cabinet or replace the<font color="#E5E5E5"> lock because that</font>

224
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:31,240
is dumb you know just putting a lock

225
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:33,140
their doesn't necessarily deter people

226
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:34,820
another example how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many people have</font>

227
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:37,220
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like this at their work where</font>

228
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:39,670
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a key closet you know what what</font>

229
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:42,589
are the keys inside<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to what</font>

230
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:45,050
everything a lot of times they have this

231
00:09:42,589 --> 00:09:46,370
in custodial closets because custodians

232
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:48,290
need to go in after hours and clean

233
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:50,240
stuff you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what if you get in and</font>

234
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:53,140
access that what if it's where you keep

235
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:56,209
all your motor pool keys and you know

236
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:58,760
somewhere in your statement of work if

237
00:09:56,209 --> 00:10:00,439
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing an on-site like access to</font>

238
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:01,910
corporate assets you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> like well those</font>

239
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:03,440
are corporate owned cars i guess i could

240
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:04,459
go park the cars<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a big circle in the</font>

241
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,949
parking lot see<font color="#E5E5E5"> if anyone notices</font>

242
00:10:04,459 --> 00:10:08,060
because it is you know but if you look

243
00:10:06,949 --> 00:10:11,510
at<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's protected with just a</font>

244
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:14,479
simple wafer wafer lock very simple<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

245
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:16,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">know so think about like how you're</font>

246
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:18,560
protecting things and some people think

247
00:10:16,339 --> 00:10:20,899
hey if I see a lock you know it's going

248
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:22,609
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> deter me it's all on how you</font>

249
00:10:20,899 --> 00:10:24,949
implement it if it's a really dumb lock

250
00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:28,490
or you're just dumb and you implement it

251
00:10:24,949 --> 00:10:32,630
poorly you know you're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to stop</font>

252
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:35,930
some people<font color="#CCCCCC"> thanks infosec reactions for</font>

253
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:37,670
that one so why learn lock picking it's

254
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:41,269
easy everyone can learn<font color="#CCCCCC"> lock-picking you</font>

255

never used like on cabinets and stuff

271
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:20,100

273
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:23,430
go to the local locksmith and say hey

00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:28,950
that you've cut off and don't need

277
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:33,750
anymore you know lots of places to get

278
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:34,950
it Newsbeat so and another thing the

279
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:36,779
reason I want people<font color="#CCCCCC"> to know</font>

280
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:39,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">lock-picking is to understand how</font>

281
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:40,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">vulnerable locks are to be able to take</font>

282
00:11:39,089 --> 00:11:42,420
a look at a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> can be like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that is not</font>

283
00:11:40,829 --> 00:11:44,699

284
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:46,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">definitely invest a couple hundred</font>

285
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:48,540
dollars or even the hundred dollars to

286
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:50,910
get a better lock to protect the

287
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:56,360
thousands that we're protecting<font color="#E5E5E5"> behind</font>

00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:59,279
it you know due diligence you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know II</font>

289
00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:01,980
it's your job to you know speak up and

290
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:04,170
say you know speaking<font color="#CCCCCC"> from a security</font>

291
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:07,560
standpoint that should be you know

292
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:10,890
better protected and then and then if

293
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:12,329
you do have a red team if you go on site

294
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:14,459
and you have a team you<font color="#CCCCCC"> should have at</font>

295
00:12:12,329 --> 00:12:16,469
least one physical penetration

297
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:20,130
well as others there's like under the

298
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:22,170
door tools and you know shimming and

299
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:23,519
stuff like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> but if you do do</font>

300
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:27,349
engagements like that you should<font color="#CCCCCC"> have at</font>

301
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:29,430
least one person proficient in it so

302
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:31,890
we'll go over this a little bit i will

303
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:33,239
explain<font color="#E5E5E5"> the different parts of a lock so</font>

304
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:34,980
for those of you that aren't familiar

305
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:37,860
with lock picking this is a basic pin

306
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:38,940
tumbler<font color="#CCCCCC"> it works the blue pin that</font>

307
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:40,620
you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> on top that's called the</font>

308
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:42,240
drive pin and then the red pin on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

309
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:43,649
bottom<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the key pin it's the pin that</font>

310
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,720
actually comes in contact with the key

311
00:12:43,649 --> 00:12:49,760
and the key pins are different sizes and

312
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:52,380
they match the the correct key and then

313
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:55,110
if you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the top view which is</font>

314
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:56,519
what that this one is they aren't in a

315
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:57,420
straight line like the holes aren't

316
00:12:56,519 --> 00:12:59,310
drilled in a perfectly straight line

317
00:12:57,420 --> 00:13:01,439
they slightly stagger a little bit and

318
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:03,779
the reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> for that is one makes it a</font>

319
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:06,390
little harder to<font color="#E5E5E5"> pick not really but it</font>

320
00:13:03,779 --> 00:13:08,579
also presents<font color="#E5E5E5"> a major flaw so when I</font>

321
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:10,660
show you how to pick in a second the

322
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:12,370
drive pins will actually catch above

323
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:14,259
and the key pins will fall free and once

324
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:17,410
all the drive pins are set<font color="#E5E5E5"> it'll turn</font>

325
00:13:14,259 --> 00:13:20,500
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then when you insert</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the correct key</font>

326
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:23,110
basically what it does you'll notice<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

327
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:25,720
drive pins are different sizes<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the</font>

328
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:27,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">key comes in and then once they all line</font>

329
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:29,350
up on that line that's called the shear

330
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:30,970
line you're able to turn the lock

331
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:34,209
basically what we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be doing</font>

332
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:36,639
with picking locks is getting it lined

333
00:13:34,209 --> 00:13:40,989
up on that and then turn it without use

334
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:42,850
of the key so basic types of pics almost

335
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:44,649
any lock pick set you're going to see

336
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:46,930
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to have these first there's</font>

337
00:13:44,649 --> 00:13:48,720
hooks and feelers this is for single pin

338
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:52,989
picking where you would go in and pick

339
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:54,970
individual pins hooks feeler pics um Jay

340
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:57,040
hooks sometimes it that's the thing

341
00:13:54,970 --> 00:14:00,250
there's lots of different<font color="#E5E5E5"> names for pics</font>

342
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:03,849
so you know you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can call it at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> least a</font>

343
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:05,740
relatively understandable name this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

344
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:07,029
snake<font color="#E5E5E5"> pick or an S rake because it</font>

345
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:08,769
shaped<font color="#CCCCCC"> like an S and they come in very</font>

346
00:14:07,029 --> 00:14:10,750
different variations some have like lots

347
00:14:08,769 --> 00:14:13,810
of squiggles sometimes like a half s and

348
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:15,220
things like that there's a half diamond

349
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:17,229
which has a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> diamond shape on the</font>

350
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:19,860
end there's full diamonds and full

351
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:21,939
circles and things like that half ball

352
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:24,639
there's some that have to they call them

353
00:14:21,939 --> 00:14:26,110
a snowman anyway most difference and

354
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:28,360
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one is especially for people</font>

355
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:30,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">who do like kind of a raking scrubbing</font>

356
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:33,250
type pick method it's called an<font color="#CCCCCC"> L rake</font>

357
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:34,719
some people call<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a saw rake or a comb</font>

358
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:36,339
rake it's not really a comb rate or a

359
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:40,269
comb pick that's a different<font color="#CCCCCC"> type</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of pic</font>

360
00:14:36,339 --> 00:14:44,350
but so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know so you need a lock pick</font>

361
00:14:40,269 --> 00:14:45,670
and you also need a tension tool any

362
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:46,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">lock fix that you're going to buy is</font>

363
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:50,319
going to come with attention tool

364
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:51,430
because it's a necessary part<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a</font>

365
00:14:50,319 --> 00:14:52,990
couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> different kinds these are like</font>

366
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:54,250
double ended ones some are shorter

367
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:56,949
somewhere longer<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you have like a more</font>

368
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:58,660
recessed cylinder and then these twists

369
00:14:56,949 --> 00:15:01,439
flex they have a 90-degree twist in it

370
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:03,399
and i<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually prefer these over i</font>

371
00:15:01,439 --> 00:15:05,110
prefer these over the<font color="#CCCCCC"> straight edge one</font>

372
00:15:03,399 --> 00:15:06,639
because if you have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> heavy hand they'll</font>

373
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:10,899
actually bend a little bit more than

374
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:12,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a rigid rigid tension on it and</font>

375
00:15:10,899 --> 00:15:15,279
that's good because you want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

376
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:18,939
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> really light on how how much</font>

377
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:20,470
pressure you put peterson is a great

378
00:15:18,939 --> 00:15:22,149
supplier of<font color="#CCCCCC"> lock picks</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wise they have a</font>

379
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:24,200
peterson pry bar and what<font color="#CCCCCC"> i like about</font>

380
00:15:22,149 --> 00:15:25,520
this one is it has a serration on the

381
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:27,530
and so it doesn't slide out very easily

382
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:30,260
once you have it in the pic you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font>

383
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:32,630
pick it from the top of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the pin or the</font>

384
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:33,980
top of the cylinder so you have all<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

385
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:35,390
real<font color="#CCCCCC"> estate for your pic to go in</font>

386
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:37,040
underneath whereas most of them you put

387
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:38,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">them in and you're kind of sharing that</font>

388
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:40,250
real estate with your pic and with the

389
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:44,990
tension tool I'll show that<font color="#E5E5E5"> here in the</font>

390
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:46,370
demo explaining how that works<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bogota</font>

391
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:47,540
pics so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what they're going to be</font>

392
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:50,720
doing at the lockpick<font color="#E5E5E5"> village at three</font>

393
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:53,120
but these are basically the pics can<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

394
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:55,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">either a tension wrench or attention</font>

395
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,630
tool or a pic and they usually fold

396
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:57,920
together they're really concealable

397
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:59,630
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> really good pics if you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> only</font>

398
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:02,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">going to carry it like the bare minimum</font>

399
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:06,980
of pics those are some<font color="#CCCCCC"> very good ones to</font>

400
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:08,530
carry um see other<font color="#E5E5E5"> non pics I'm not</font>

401
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:10,850
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to go into this too much</font>

402
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:13,490
for getting into cars there's this thing

403
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:15,560
called<font color="#CCCCCC"> Auto jigglers you don't use a</font>

404
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:17,360
tension tool for them you basically like

405
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:20,089
jiggle it in and<font color="#E5E5E5"> out and you can open</font>

406
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:21,260
most cars there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> pic guns a lot of</font>

407
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:23,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">people that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> take time to</font>

408
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:24,500
learn like a law enforcement<font color="#E5E5E5"> officers</font>

409
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:25,880
for example if they just need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font>

410
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:29,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">into the door they'll use these pic guns</font>

411
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:31,850
and a similar<font color="#E5E5E5"> picking method is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> also</font>

412
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:33,980
bump keys bump keys are<font color="#E5E5E5"> keys specific to</font>

413
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:37,040
that locks like quick search like master

414
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:38,270
American but they have their cut all the

415
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:40,610
way down so there's just little bumps

416
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:42,470
and you basically tap on them you bump

417
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:45,500
them and it will cause the drive pins to

418
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:47,630
jump up and then you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can get in if</font>

419
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:49,520
there's time I have a little extra thing

420
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:50,900
to show on that it works on the same

421
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:52,040
principle as like a line of billiard

422
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:54,079
balls you hit the ball and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

423
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:56,510
the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> pops so that's how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the pic gun</font>

424
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:58,280
and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bump keys would work there's</font>

425
00:16:56,510 --> 00:17:01,040
also shims like slim jims and things

426
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:04,129
like that plug spinner is a locksmith

427
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:05,420
tool like if if you can't pick<font color="#CCCCCC"> it one</font>

428
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:06,800
direction you pick it the direction that

429
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:09,020
would end up locking it and they use a

430
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:10,698
plug spinner to spin it<font color="#E5E5E5"> so fast that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

431
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:13,339
goes past<font color="#E5E5E5"> the reset point it doesn't</font>

432
00:17:10,699 --> 00:17:14,839
reset the pins and then there's other

433
00:17:13,339 --> 00:17:17,270
tools<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are non</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pigs it's like an</font>

434
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:19,310
under the door tool did<font color="#E5E5E5"> anyone to attend</font>

435
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:22,550
the physical<font color="#CCCCCC"> pen test shop last night</font>

436
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:25,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">the workshop did they go over this at</font>

437
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:28,159
all I didn't attend it but so basically

438
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:31,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is this something you stick under</font>

439
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:33,800
the door and you have the little cable

440
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:35,750
part and the ad a compliant lever

441
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:37,970
handles you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> go right under the doors</font>

442
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:39,440
and then you know pull

443
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:42,559
it and it will actually open it and you

444
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:45,320
can open the door from the inside yay

445
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:47,450
for compliance but it's an interesting

446
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:50,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">tool but those are non pics not going to</font>

447
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:52,520
cover those um a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> different types</font>

448
00:17:50,809 --> 00:17:55,668
of picking so there's just you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

449
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:58,190
have your hobbyist like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lock pick you</font>

450
00:17:55,669 --> 00:17:59,809
know I pick locks for fun<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know some</font>

451
00:17:58,190 --> 00:18:03,049
people consider it an<font color="#CCCCCC"> art it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> quite an</font>

452
00:17:59,809 --> 00:18:04,850
art form you know do it this way there's

453
00:18:03,049 --> 00:18:06,860
also quick and dirty which you know

454
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:09,049
learning that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> almost always started</font>

455
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:10,658
out doing like some sort of raking<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

456
00:18:09,049 --> 00:18:12,230
scrubbing<font color="#E5E5E5"> the lock kind of thing</font>

457
00:18:10,659 --> 00:18:13,760
jiggling is where<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

458
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:18,110
shaking it and hope you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> lucky sort</font>

459
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:20,200
of thing brute force now that's not

460
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:22,668
necessarily a type of picking but like

461
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:23,929
you know some locks you can stick in a

462
00:18:22,669 --> 00:18:25,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">screwed up these are very cheap locks</font>

463
00:18:23,929 --> 00:18:27,260
sticking a screwdriver and turn it and

464
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:29,890
it will like pop the pins or whatever

465
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:31,760
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> turn the cylinder brute force</font>

466
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:33,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">carding the lock that it would be like</font>

467
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:35,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">shim or something you know come and just</font>

468
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:40,699
card the actual shackle<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the door sort</font>

469
00:18:35,539 --> 00:18:43,039
of thing um yeah covert entry um so this

470
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:44,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">is like highly specialized stuff like</font>

471
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:47,000
you're very<font color="#CCCCCC"> familiar with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the alarm</font>

472
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:48,799
system and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're very familiar with the</font>

473
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,809
locks or what they have in place and how

474
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:52,039
to bypass them and I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

475
00:18:50,809 --> 00:18:55,970
cover<font color="#E5E5E5"> that stuff because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

476
00:18:52,039 --> 00:18:58,460
much<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is basically a</font>

477
00:18:55,970 --> 00:19:02,740
single pin lifting or single pin<font color="#E5E5E5"> pick</font>

478
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:05,210
spp this is good to start learning<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

479
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:08,059
the key to lock picking no pun intended

480
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:09,830
is really being able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to fill inside the</font>

481
00:19:08,059 --> 00:19:11,658
lock and because you can't see inside it

482
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:13,039
<font color="#CCCCCC">and being able to feel like k is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

483
00:19:11,659 --> 00:19:14,450
one pushing a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> harder than</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

484
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:17,210
other ones it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably a taller pin</font>

485
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:19,460
you know and because<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you remember</font>

486
00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:21,230
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't line up the holes don't line</font>

487
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:22,610
up in a perfect line so that's why even

488
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:24,350
though you're picking it above the shear

489
00:19:22,610 --> 00:19:26,149
line it doesn't quite set it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably</font>

490
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:29,928
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> the one perfectly you know offset</font>

491
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:31,309
enough like the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other ones are so you</font>

492
00:19:29,929 --> 00:19:32,990
know you just<font color="#E5E5E5"> go through and you try the</font>

493
00:19:31,309 --> 00:19:34,760
different ones<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if there's no nothing</font>

494
00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:36,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">pushing back then you know it's set like</font>

495
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:38,960
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't feel any spring pushing back</font>

496
00:19:36,130 --> 00:19:40,789
then once you get them all picked

497
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:43,480
because you have tension on it it'll

498
00:19:40,789 --> 00:19:48,049
twist and then you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got the lock open</font>

499
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:50,510
so that's a single pin picking see and

500
00:19:48,049 --> 00:19:51,590
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is more like raking and</font>

501
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:53,029
scrubbing type stuff

502
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:54,500
where you'd have your different rakes

503
00:19:53,029 --> 00:19:57,169
and you know you kind of just shove it

504
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:59,600
in you kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of get it and kind of goes</font>

505
00:19:57,169 --> 00:20:02,679
this this works<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a lot of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> locks some</font>

506
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:05,149
of them like some people actually like

507
00:20:02,679 --> 00:20:06,679
get it in they will they'll quickly

508
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:07,909
scrub the lock and set like three or

509
00:20:06,679 --> 00:20:11,299
four pins or something and then they'll

510
00:20:07,909 --> 00:20:13,370
switch to to like a feeler hook it it's

511
00:20:11,299 --> 00:20:17,900
really like what works for you kind of a

512
00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:25,539
thing so yeah scrubbing a lock stuff

513
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:25,539
like that so time<font color="#CCCCCC"> for demo let's go to</font>

514
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:43,309
see now i will get<font color="#E5E5E5"> this going hey that's</font>

515
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:48,980
my face<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so coming down here I'll</font>

516
00:20:43,309 --> 00:20:50,960
show you oops okay so this is a

517
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:53,419
transparent block so you can actually

518
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:56,480
see the individual pins hold it up like

519
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:58,399
that you can see the individual pins you

520
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:00,350
can't see the key pins very well and

521
00:20:58,399 --> 00:21:03,408
then what you're going to want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do is</font>

522
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:04,789
you'll get your lock pick this is one

523
00:21:03,409 --> 00:21:08,720
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I carry with me every day this is</font>

524
00:21:04,789 --> 00:21:11,240
the RCS<font color="#E5E5E5"> tool company jackknife it's very</font>

525
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:13,580
very good you can get it<font color="#CCCCCC"> from southern</font>

526
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:16,279
specialties I really really like<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

527
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:19,070
one and this locking lever kind of works

528
00:21:16,279 --> 00:21:20,809
like the forks on your bike securing the

529
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:22,730
tire so it locks it in place and<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

530
00:21:20,809 --> 00:21:25,399
pics don't move they don't wiggle it's

531
00:21:22,730 --> 00:21:28,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">really nice standard comes with you know</font>

532
00:21:25,399 --> 00:21:31,549
eight different pics yeah I really<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

533
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:33,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">it so I'm just going to go do a single</font>

534
00:21:31,549 --> 00:21:37,340
pin picking I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pull out my J</font>

535
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:40,209
hook and then lock it in place now you

536
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:42,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">can see this is not going to move yeah</font>

537
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:46,880
it's in there good comes with the

538
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:48,260
tension tool so<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically this is what I</font>

539
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:51,620
was talking about earlier you're putting

540
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:53,510
your tension tool inside it's more ideal

541
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:55,879
sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> depending on the lock really</font>

542
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:58,250
to put actually up above and then you

543
00:21:55,880 --> 00:22:00,740
have all<font color="#E5E5E5"> this real estate in here to put</font>

544
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:01,820
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> pics whereas a lot of times you're</font>

545
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:03,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to end up putting your attention</font>

546
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:05,168
tool inside the lock and then you have

547
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:09,109
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> share real estate with it</font>

548
00:22:05,169 --> 00:22:10,789
so I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to try to do this okay</font>

549
00:22:09,109 --> 00:22:12,678
you're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay it's</font>

550
00:22:10,789 --> 00:22:14,839
upside<font color="#CCCCCC"> down but it's easier to pick that</font>

551
00:22:12,679 --> 00:22:16,519
way so basically I'm just going in and

552
00:22:14,839 --> 00:22:19,668
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> pushing up individual pins just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

553
00:22:16,519 --> 00:22:22,159
in that animation earlier and then once

554
00:22:19,669 --> 00:22:23,629
you get it like they're all lined up and

555
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:27,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">I felt it kind of move and I just move</font>

556
00:22:23,629 --> 00:22:30,709
the rest of the way and you're in does

557
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:34,158
anyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to see that again one more</font>

558
00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:35,749
time awesome so<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually this time let's</font>

559
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:40,969
do it instead of<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing a single</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pin pick</font>

560
00:22:35,749 --> 00:22:43,429
let's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just do a scrubbing type pic i</font>

561
00:22:40,969 --> 00:22:46,789
will actually use more often than not<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

562
00:22:43,429 --> 00:22:50,659
use an<font color="#CCCCCC"> S pick because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I learned first by</font>

563
00:22:46,789 --> 00:22:53,359
scrubbing and you know single pin pic is

564
00:22:50,659 --> 00:22:55,399
good because once you get a better sense

565
00:22:53,359 --> 00:22:58,908
of what your fingers are telling you the

566
00:22:55,399 --> 00:23:00,168
inside the lock is but for the moon for

567
00:22:58,909 --> 00:23:02,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">the most part you start out with this so</font>

568
00:23:00,169 --> 00:23:04,489
picking it<font color="#CCCCCC"> upside down again but you</font>

569
00:23:02,809 --> 00:23:08,658
know this one you can just kind of push

570
00:23:04,489 --> 00:23:10,369
it in you can you know very similar you

571
00:23:08,659 --> 00:23:14,179
<font color="#CCCCCC">know put in and move it in and out kind</font>

572
00:23:10,369 --> 00:23:16,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">of thing get it working and starting out</font>

573
00:23:14,179 --> 00:23:18,349
I suggest you get a you know some cheap

574
00:23:16,099 --> 00:23:20,539
blocks as well as some clear transparent

575

579
00:23:30,889 --> 00:23:34,428
they don't even make this one anymore

580
00:23:32,089 --> 00:23:35,989
they make a metal one but I picked

581
00:23:34,429 --> 00:23:37,369
probably over 300 different locks of

582
00:23:35,989 --> 00:23:38,690
this thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it just wore out over</font>

south or doesn't pay me to say this<font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font>

this<font color="#E5E5E5"> has lots of different tension tools</font>

596
00:24:11,899 --> 00:24:17,209
you notice<font color="#E5E5E5"> how it has a lots of</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">different</font>

599
00:24:18,850 --> 00:24:23,449
pics like that and a lot of times you do

600
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,770
this long enough you'll notice that

601
00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:27,230
you'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually start carrying a lot</font>

602
00:24:24,770 --> 00:24:29,000
more tension tools I've been given a

603
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:32,360
bunch of way out of this kit so I don't

604
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:34,490
have as many and have a couple different

605
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:35,750
things and really it depends on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the type</font>

606
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:37,010
of lock you can become familiar with

00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:39,770
lock some people have gone through and

608
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:41,510
said you know with this type of slag we

609
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:43,760
recommend using this sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> lock and</font>

610
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:45,170
things like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know it's a really</font>

615
00:24:52,040 --> 00:25:02,659
like that I sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of stick</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with my</font>

616
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:04,550
favorites it's sort of like<font color="#E5E5E5"> taking your</font>

something like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do what's what</font>

619
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:12,140
works for you which you're familiar with

620
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:16,040
more often<font color="#CCCCCC"> than not I i use my s pic i</font>

621
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:17,420
use one of these to feel ur pics i use

622
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:20,180
this one which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is pretty standard</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

623
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:25,040
one's kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a reach around pretty</font>

625
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:39,639
half diamond quite a bit so let's see so

626
00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:39,639
the ones i use are these

627
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:46,400
so these are probably the four most

628
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:48,410
common pics that i use i only use this

629
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:50,120
one kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> like in and out set the pics</font>

630
00:25:48,410 --> 00:25:51,230
and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'll switch and do like the</font>

631
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:53,209
half diamond so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i can get like the</font>

632
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:55,910
individual and<font color="#E5E5E5"> not bump other pins that</font>

633
00:25:53,210 --> 00:25:58,190
are already<font color="#E5E5E5"> set kind of thing but really</font>

634
00:25:55,910 --> 00:25:59,840
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know try a bunch of different locks</font>

635
00:25:58,190 --> 00:26:01,730
get proficient one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things I like</font>

636
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:03,649
to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> I actually have a big set of</font>

637
00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:05,030
padlocks that are just locked<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

638
00:26:03,650 --> 00:26:07,250
on to each other and then while I'm

639
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:08,540
watching TV<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know I'll just be</font>

640
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:10,310
sitting and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll just you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know not</font>

641
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:12,050
thinking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> just go through and pick</font>

642
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:12,919
the different locks<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

643
00:26:12,050 --> 00:26:14,930
good because sometimes if you're

644
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:17,090
focusing you're like really like pushing

645
00:26:14,930 --> 00:26:21,050
too hard and oh that's one thing I did

646
00:26:17,090 --> 00:26:23,260
want to mention so tension is like super

647
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:25,850
important for<font color="#E5E5E5"> one tension you can fill</font>

648
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:27,950
kind of the different cliques once you

649
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:29,570
set the pins so I don't know how well we

650
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:32,630
can see this so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> about how much</font>

651
00:26:29,570 --> 00:26:34,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">tension you want eat if you're pushing</font>

652
00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:35,810
so hard that you can start<font color="#CCCCCC"> seeing the</font>

653
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:37,970
blood run out of your finger and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

654
00:26:35,810 --> 00:26:41,139
white you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> pushing way too hard it's</font>

655
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:43,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">surprising how little you have to push</font>

656
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:46,160
iron geek Adrian Crenshaw says think of

657
00:26:43,850 --> 00:26:47,899
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you have a pet ant and you you</font>

658
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:49,670
want to pet that amp that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you love so</font>

659
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:52,700
much but you don't want to squash it so

660
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:57,230
you're literally pushing that little bit

661
00:26:52,700 --> 00:27:00,080
on it so if you just<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it or if</font>

662
00:26:57,230 --> 00:27:02,450
you're pushing and like none<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the pins</font>

663
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:06,409
are moving your your tension is way too

664
00:27:02,450 --> 00:27:09,350
way too hard a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of times I'll use my</font>

665
00:27:06,410 --> 00:27:10,820

666
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:13,429
starting<font color="#E5E5E5"> out it's a little more awkward</font>

667
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:14,810
but push with your<font color="#CCCCCC"> pinky if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're if</font>

668
00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:17,120
you have a heavy hand push with your

669
00:27:14,810 --> 00:27:21,350
pinky like it's so much lighter and

670
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:22,610
easier there are some like you pick the

671
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:25,100
other direction and you know I'm right

672
00:27:22,610 --> 00:27:26,360
handed so you know use your thumb but

673
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:27,860
then again<font color="#E5E5E5"> your thumb is one of your</font>

674
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:33,520
strongest fingers and you have to really

let up something<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know let's see</font>

safety pin and you can pin them on your

703
00:28:39,309 --> 00:28:43,870
lapel you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> pin him inside your pant</font>

704
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:45,010
leg so like you can sneak<font color="#CCCCCC"> omit lock</font>

705
00:28:43,870 --> 00:28:46,899
picks you can sneak them in a lot of

706
00:28:45,010 --> 00:28:48,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">places especially if they're titanium</font>

707
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:50,980
because typically titanium won't trip a

708
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:54,070
lot of metal detectors they're more

709
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:57,250
expensive titanium has anyone seen these

710
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:59,139
lockpick cards they're cool they're fun

711
00:28:57,250 --> 00:29:00,340
to carry<font color="#CCCCCC"> around your wallet tool makes a</font>

712
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:02,830
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> good one I'm told I actually</font>

713
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:05,649
don't have it that's kevin Mitnick

714
00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:10,178
business card and<font color="#E5E5E5"> he gives out to people</font>

715
00:29:05,650 --> 00:29:11,620
there they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> great you know but once</font>

716
00:29:10,179 --> 00:29:13,080
you pop them out they're used and you

717
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:14,979
can put them on a keyring or whatever

718
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:17,439
and then that's a picture<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

719
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:20,200
lockpick credit card which doesn't look

720
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:25,059
fake at all you know card owner is James

721
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:27,610
Bond expires a<font color="#CCCCCC"> January 2003 so no one's</font>

722
00:29:25,059 --> 00:29:29,200
going to notice that it is about two to

723
00:29:27,610 --> 00:29:31,449
three times thicker than a standard

724
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:34,090
credit card so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> little bulky but</font>

725
00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:35,110
then again it's it's reusable like you

726
00:29:34,090 --> 00:29:36,280
pull<font color="#CCCCCC"> them out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not like you snap</font>

727
00:29:35,110 --> 00:29:39,939
them out you can't snap them back in you

728
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:42,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">just put it back in the sleeve so this</font>

729
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:44,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">is a these are some shoes some platform</font>

730
00:29:42,730 --> 00:29:46,450
wedges now I didn't have a picture of

731
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:49,928
her she usually wears like a<font color="#CCCCCC"> miniskirt</font>

732
00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:51,160
cocktail dress and a very low-cut top

733
00:29:49,929 --> 00:29:53,260
and that's what she<font color="#E5E5E5"> does all our</font>

734
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:56,620
engagements on so she has no pockets no

735
00:29:53,260 --> 00:30:00,730
places<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hide you know a bulky lockpick</font>

736
00:29:56,620 --> 00:30:02,199
set type thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> so for a lot of her</font>

737
00:30:00,730 --> 00:30:06,640
engagement she actually designed these

738
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:07,190
she 3d printed them and inside it she

739
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,630
can put

740
00:30:07,190 --> 00:30:10,340
wireless router that she can plug into

741
00:30:08,630 --> 00:30:13,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">the network and then access remotely and</font>

742
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:15,169
then on the other side she has you know

743
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:17,600
her key logger she has a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

744
00:30:15,170 --> 00:30:18,950
extension thing and then she<font color="#E5E5E5"> has a</font>

745
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:21,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">couple set of pics and some tension</font>

746
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:23,840
wrenches and she also has a padlock sham

747
00:30:21,470 --> 00:30:26,630
I didn't talk about padlock shims at all

748
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:27,919
but and she all of her engagements

749
00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:29,660
that's what<font color="#E5E5E5"> she brings she doesn't bring</font>

750
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:31,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">a purse she a lot of times she has to</font>

751
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:33,650
check in her cell phone I mean you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

752
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:35,540
hide padlocks and Eric<font color="#CCCCCC"> Wow you can hide</font>

753
00:30:33,650 --> 00:30:36,800
lock picks in your cell phone case like

754
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:40,310
if you have an external case I've done

755
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:41,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">that before so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really clever and she</font>

756
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:44,560
goes through<font color="#E5E5E5"> and explains how she did it</font>

757
00:30:41,450 --> 00:30:48,050
was it was really cool really<font color="#E5E5E5"> inventive</font>

758
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:52,370
so some of the problems this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a that's</font>

759
00:30:48,050 --> 00:30:56,180
a picture<font color="#E5E5E5"> of one that i have here with</font>

760
00:30:52,370 --> 00:30:58,330
me so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lockpick card that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i got</font>

761
00:30:56,180 --> 00:31:02,000
it's actually a seer card like a

762
00:30:58,330 --> 00:31:04,580
survival evade resist escape card so as

763
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,560
like some padlock some handcuffs shims

764
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:11,030
and stuff too let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> get that out of the</font>

765
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:12,860
way sorry and then you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was cool</font>

766
00:31:11,030 --> 00:31:14,210
tried<font color="#E5E5E5"> it out but the thing is like as</font>

767
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:16,219
soon as<font color="#CCCCCC"> I popped out first</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing I</font>

768
00:31:14,210 --> 00:31:19,010
noticed like<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's very small but also</font>

769
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:21,020
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> little tabs where I had the where it</font>

770
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:23,210
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> connected were really sharp I didn't</font>

771
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:25,850
like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I did and it's a one-time use</font>

772
00:31:23,210 --> 00:31:27,200
thing this the tension<font color="#CCCCCC"> tool is flat so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

773
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:29,780
actually had<font color="#CCCCCC"> to bend</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it at a right angle</font>

774
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:33,170
to use it<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it came with just you know</font>

775
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:35,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">your standard filler and rake I mean</font>

776
00:31:33,170 --> 00:31:36,710
it's cool four in a pinch as like<font color="#CCCCCC"> throw</font>

777
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:41,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">away pics and that's kind of what their</font>

778
00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:45,740
intended for one one time use so

779
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:47,030
switching back so some problems that you

780
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:48,710
might<font color="#CCCCCC"> come across you might be at a</font>

781
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:50,510
facility where you know there's metal

782
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:52,490
detectors and your<font color="#CCCCCC"> steel pics you can't</font>

783
00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:54,110
get them in you know titanium would be

784
00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:56,270
great if anyone can think of a

785
00:31:54,110 --> 00:32:00,320
nonmetallic material for lock picks<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

786
00:31:56,270 --> 00:32:02,240
very<font color="#CCCCCC"> interested carbon fiber at that</font>

787
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:05,090
thickness isn't strong enough it's

788
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:07,730
almost like a dry twig like it might

789
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:10,220
work as a pic but as a tension too

790
00:32:07,730 --> 00:32:13,370
little snap almost immediately I<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

791
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:15,110
maybe some kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you know g10 or like</font>

792
00:32:13,370 --> 00:32:16,489
some sort of polymer or something I

793
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:18,830
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know it's a pet project of mine</font>

794
00:32:16,490 --> 00:32:20,509
trying to think out good<font color="#E5E5E5"> pics can take</font>

795
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:22,009
up space

796
00:32:20,509 --> 00:32:23,449
granted if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're going to take if you</font>

802
00:32:32,749 --> 00:32:39,469
something small concealable if you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

under 7 inches it's ok to carry on board

809
00:32:54,589 --> 00:33:00,198
you still might get you know the you

810
00:32:57,499 --> 00:33:02,359
know power-hungry TSA agents be like oh

811

826
00:33:42,919 --> 00:33:50,739
collars and so he could fit so he

827
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:53,359
actually fits a full<font color="#E5E5E5"> length pic in it so</font>

00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:30,439
if anyone's familiar and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think you</font>

843
00:34:29,179 --> 00:34:31,789
<font color="#CCCCCC">know a security professional should be</font>

844
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:33,049
at least from they were like if they see

845
00:34:31,789 --> 00:34:34,490
something like that looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a</font>

846
00:34:33,049 --> 00:34:37,429
lockpick why are you wearing though

847
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:38,750
you take those off you know maybe you're

848
00:34:37,429 --> 00:34:40,399
at a place<font color="#E5E5E5"> where the totally clueless I</font>

849
00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:45,050
don't know but you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can get those on etsy</font>

850
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:46,520
they're like 35 bucks so this was kind

851
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:48,409
of the thing I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was thinking about I was</font>

852
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:50,090
up late one night thinking like how can

853
00:34:48,409 --> 00:34:54,770
I make a reusable lockpick that would be

854
00:34:50,090 --> 00:34:56,780
cool and you know easily concealed small

855
00:34:54,770 --> 00:34:58,580
and this this is just something that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

856
00:34:56,780 --> 00:35:01,040
was trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> out and I want people's</font>

857
00:34:58,580 --> 00:35:02,810

858
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:05,270
I'm calling<font color="#CCCCCC"> him</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gentlemen covert pics</font>

that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know patent pending by the way</font>

860
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:13,040
and I got the domain name last night but

861
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:15,040
anyway these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some lockpick collar</font>

862
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:16,940
stays that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I designed a little while ago</font>

863
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:18,470
they're nice they're easily concealable

864
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:19,700
comes in a set of four<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you fold them</font>

865
00:35:18,470 --> 00:35:21,618
over each other those familiar with

866
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:23,359
collar stays you know you fold them like

867
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:26,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">that and they fill out the shape of the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">collar</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> State dapper classy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's kind of</font>

869
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:32,480
James Bondish span boys would totally

870
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:35,089
heart this ultra concealable I mean even

871
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:36,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">if you don't wear a collared shirt you</font>

872
00:35:35,090 --> 00:35:39,680
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> hide them in your cell phone case</font>

873
00:35:36,170 --> 00:35:43,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">you can hide them in your wallet these</font>

874
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:44,750
are steel if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do mass-produce these in</font>

875
00:35:43,310 --> 00:35:49,310
market them<font color="#CCCCCC"> they be available in</font>

876
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:51,080
titanium as well so yeah I make them

877
00:35:49,310 --> 00:35:52,670
with a<font color="#E5E5E5"> CNC machine I have a machinist</font>

878
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:54,980
that makes them for me this is a pretty

879
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:59,359
good job and I'm actually wearing them

880
00:35:54,980 --> 00:36:00,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">Oh demo time so yeah you'll notice they</font>

881
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:02,150
aren't the full length one so it's not

882
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:04,730
going to stab me in the neck is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

883
00:36:02,150 --> 00:36:08,510
like you know good four inches away and

884
00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:13,820
so I designed<font color="#CCCCCC"> these let me switch over</font>

885
00:36:08,510 --> 00:36:15,590
to this again so I carry these just

886
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:17,480
because I'm trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> them out I'm right</font>

887
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:19,250
now I'm just in design testing and stuff

888
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:22,190
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> this so what you get is you get</font>

889
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:23,150
your three pics this isn't a sales pitch

890
00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:26,510
by the way<font color="#CCCCCC"> but if you are interested</font>

891
00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:28,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">talk to me I really just want feedback</font>

892
00:36:26,510 --> 00:36:29,900
like if<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is a good design pic is it</font>

893
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:31,100
practical I've got a couple sets of them

894
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:32,210
here so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'll have them over in the</font>

895
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:35,089
lockpick village if you want to try them

896
00:36:32,210 --> 00:36:36,830
out so anyway comes with the your half

897
00:36:35,090 --> 00:36:39,650
diamond your snake<font color="#CCCCCC"> pick in your L rake</font>

898
00:36:36,830 --> 00:36:41,660
and then also a tension tool i went with

899
00:36:39,650 --> 00:36:43,070
kind of the hockey shape hockey stick

900
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:44,990
shape design because if it was a

901
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:46,520
straight 90 degree angle<font color="#E5E5E5"> sometime this</font>

902
00:36:44,990 --> 00:36:47,229
part would get in the way of the lock

903
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:50,310
and

904
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:59,619
I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> it kind of angled like that so</font>

905
00:36:50,310 --> 00:37:01,390
time for demo fail so very minimal you

906
00:36:59,619 --> 00:37:03,070
know Bogut oz would probably work better

907
00:37:01,390 --> 00:37:06,700
but this is a fun little pet project I

908
00:37:03,070 --> 00:37:08,680
didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to do like a straight type</font>

909
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:11,290
tension tool because I didn't want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

910
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:14,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">something like this because I prefer the</font>

911
00:37:11,290 --> 00:37:18,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">twist flex because this one has no give</font>

912
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:21,149
whereas this one you know you can bend

913
00:37:18,250 --> 00:37:24,190
it a bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you have a lot more</font>

914
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:26,470
forgiveness I guess you can call it but

915
00:37:24,190 --> 00:37:27,850
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know very similar and I've</font>

916
00:37:26,470 --> 00:37:30,700
tried<font color="#E5E5E5"> this on a couple different locks</font>

917
00:37:27,850 --> 00:37:37,210
and seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work fine but you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

918
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:38,470
come in here and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> good</font>

919
00:37:37,210 --> 00:37:40,600
a lock-picking do it in front of an

920
00:37:38,470 --> 00:37:43,330
audience by the way so your nerves can

921
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:51,040
be like totally shot or whatever then

922
00:37:43,330 --> 00:37:53,259
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just oh oh oh so still still in</font>

923
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:55,240
the design stage but this is something

924
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:57,760
that I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know it might be sort</font>

925
00:37:55,240 --> 00:38:05,129
of fun see if there's a market for it at

926
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:07,150
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay let's try a different one</font>

927
00:38:05,130 --> 00:38:08,950
that's the thing if you're starting<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

928
00:38:07,150 --> 00:38:12,130
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> lock-picking like sometimes you</font>

929
00:38:08,950 --> 00:38:14,230
might be real comfortable with a with a

930
00:38:12,130 --> 00:38:15,580
certain type of pic and it just for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

931
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:18,430
life of you it is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> not working with</font>

932
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:19,750
that lock you should be able to use a

933
00:38:18,430 --> 00:38:24,419
bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of different locks you know</font>

934
00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:31,720
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> more tools to your arsenal</font>

935
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:33,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay come on now these do work I promise</font>

936
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:40,049
did it this morning before I got in

937
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:40,050
front of people oh stop<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

938
00:38:44,290 --> 00:38:55,250
maybe yeah this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is why we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

939
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:58,400
audience try a little better it again

940
00:38:55,250 --> 00:39:00,080
still in demo stage by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way but there</font>

943
00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:13,250

944
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:14,870

945
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:16,910

it doesn't slide out very easily I've

982
00:40:56,240 --> 00:41:01,899
actually thought of integrating it into

983
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:05,260
mine but it's it's a really good pic<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

984
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:07,190
want me to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> back for that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

985
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:08,390
recommendations so these are<font color="#CCCCCC"> some great</font>

986
00:41:07,190 --> 00:41:11,480
websites where you can get more

987
00:41:08,390 --> 00:41:13,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">information about it tool is probably</font>

988
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:16,120
one of the best open organization of

989
00:41:13,190 --> 00:41:19,970
lock Pickers I'm la quickie<font color="#CCCCCC"> Schuler Town</font>

990
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:22,520
South or does the supplier south or they

991
00:41:19,970 --> 00:41:23,750
are better quality locks sometimes when

992
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:24,950
you're looking at locks you might notice

993
00:41:23,750 --> 00:41:26,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">that it looks like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they just took a</font>

994
00:41:24,950 --> 00:41:28,339
hacksaw blade and they<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of cut it</font>

995
00:41:26,510 --> 00:41:30,170
out there sort of serrations on the top

996
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:32,990
which one is<font color="#E5E5E5"> there like a really smooth</font>

997
00:41:30,170 --> 00:41:33,950
one that's smoothly cut out something<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

998
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:37,040
look for<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you're looking to lock</font>

999
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:40,250
picks southward also has a clearance

1000
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:42,290
section so scratched or blemished pics

1001
00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:43,490
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can get them at a discount because</font>

1002
00:41:42,290 --> 00:41:46,450
you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to stick them in a metal</font>

1003
00:41:43,490 --> 00:41:50,149
lock anyway and scratch them so whatever

1004
00:41:46,450 --> 00:41:52,220
the subreddits really good<font color="#E5E5E5"> also two guys</font>

that I follow pretty closely iron geek

1006
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:57,080

1013
00:42:08,870 --> 00:42:16,060
anyone have<font color="#E5E5E5"> any questions I think we got</font>

1014
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:16,060
15 minutes or 10 minutes yeah Thomas

1015
00:42:29,670 --> 00:42:36,010
mm-hmm do you mean like like the

1016
00:42:34,030 --> 00:42:37,870
padlocks like the have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the different</font>

1017
00:42:36,010 --> 00:42:46,000
dials type things or do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you mean like</font>

1018
00:42:37,870 --> 00:42:48,100
the actual dial walk on a safe okay I

1019
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:50,260
know what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're talking about so he's</font>

1020
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:53,009
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about are the combination locks</font>

1021
00:42:50,260 --> 00:42:56,170
more secure and the answer is it depends

1022
00:42:53,010 --> 00:42:58,420
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> master lock right now that has</font>

1023
00:42:56,170 --> 00:43:01,270
it's got the 10 it's got the four pins

1024
00:42:58,420 --> 00:43:02,830
and has the 10 digit numbers on them or

1025
00:43:01,270 --> 00:43:05,740
you roll them and then you pop it open

1026
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:07,870
that actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> has a bypass flaw in it so</font>

1027
00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:09,580
I didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about bypass tools those</font>

1028
00:43:07,870 --> 00:43:11,770
are basically like pics that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you would</font>

1029
00:43:09,580 --> 00:43:14,350
put like along the<font color="#E5E5E5"> number tumblers for</font>

1030
00:43:11,770 --> 00:43:16,360
example<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> reach and flip</font>

1031
00:43:14,350 --> 00:43:19,060
the ER like catch the<font color="#CCCCCC"> release lever and</font>

1032
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:24,450
pop<font color="#CCCCCC"> it open that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> master lock one has is</font>

1033
00:43:19,060 --> 00:43:24,450
a known vulnerability actually on my

1034
00:43:24,870 --> 00:43:34,270
this tool or on my<font color="#CCCCCC"> lockpick card so on</font>

1035
00:43:31,390 --> 00:43:35,799
this this is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> handcuff shim but you</font>

1036
00:43:34,270 --> 00:43:37,360
notice how it's a point I wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> take</font>

1037
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:39,280
this on a plane by the way because<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

1038
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:41,350
could argue that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a blade I would</font>

1039
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:43,870
take this but this is can also function

1040
00:43:41,350 --> 00:43:45,430
as a bypass tool it's very thin you can

1041
00:43:43,870 --> 00:43:48,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually put it between those tumblers</font>

1042
00:43:45,430 --> 00:43:54,069
and go in and disengage the catch

1043
00:43:48,010 --> 00:43:55,990
release so something to consider yeah it

1044
00:43:54,070 --> 00:43:57,970
really just depends there's some that

1045
00:43:55,990 --> 00:44:01,060
are great secure there's some that are

1046
00:43:57,970 --> 00:44:03,390
not secure at all but any<font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

1047
00:44:01,060 --> 00:44:03,390
questions

1048
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:13,400
so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> question was what's a good lock</font>

1049
00:44:09,569 --> 00:44:16,140
and actually here<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the extra section</font>

1050
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:18,780
this is deviant<font color="#CCCCCC"> ohlins list this is what</font>

1051
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:22,558
he said he recommends these are

1052
00:44:18,780 --> 00:44:26,520
different locks scorpion get a schlage

1053
00:44:22,559 --> 00:44:27,960
Primus they have a instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the they</font>

1054
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:30,119
have the regular tumblr pins but they

1055
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:34,730
also have a security<font color="#E5E5E5"> pin in it I'm not</font>

1056
00:44:30,119 --> 00:44:37,950
covering that but at<font color="#CCCCCC"> 11 they are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> albus</font>

1057
00:44:34,730 --> 00:44:41,369
basically any kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of they're called s</font>

1058
00:44:37,950 --> 00:44:42,689
fake or SF I see it's a small format

1059
00:44:41,369 --> 00:44:45,900
interchangeable cylinder they're all

1060
00:44:42,690 --> 00:44:47,760
good locks mr. locksmith he has a lock

1061
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:49,740
he's a locksmith based in Canada he has

1062
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:51,780
a pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> active youtube channel but he</font>

1063
00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:54,000
says the a ploy protect<font color="#CCCCCC"> to high-security</font>

1064
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:57,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">deadbolt is the best lock you can buy</font>

1065
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:59,730
for deadbolt he's<font color="#CCCCCC"> its pick resistant he</font>

1066
00:44:57,990 --> 00:45:01,680
argues it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> pic proof the reason why</font>

1067
00:44:59,730 --> 00:45:03,839
it's been out for like a year<font color="#E5E5E5"> or so now</font>

1068
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:05,669
there are no known vulnerabilities there

1069
00:45:03,839 --> 00:45:08,190
are lots of people trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to pick that</font>

1070
00:45:05,670 --> 00:45:10,619
and no one has<font color="#E5E5E5"> been able to he puts it</font>

1071
00:45:08,190 --> 00:45:12,299
on his he he says it's unpickable until

1072
00:45:10,619 --> 00:45:14,579
someone has done it but no one's been

1073
00:45:12,299 --> 00:45:16,950
able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do it so if you have a hundred</font>

1074
00:45:14,579 --> 00:45:20,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">seventy-five bucks do that medicos are</font>

1075
00:45:16,950 --> 00:45:22,109
good so I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have any slides of that</font>

1076
00:45:20,099 --> 00:45:23,880
but if you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at a medco key you'll</font>

1077
00:45:22,109 --> 00:45:25,380
notice<font color="#CCCCCC"> that a lot of keys</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like they're</font>

1078
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:27,119
just cut straight on so you put the key

1079
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:29,220
in its cut straight on medco keys they

1080
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:31,859
actually make the cuts like this the

1081
00:45:29,220 --> 00:45:33,149
reason why<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the pin hole instead of</font>

1082
00:45:31,859 --> 00:45:34,950
like a circle like this it's actually

1083
00:45:33,150 --> 00:45:36,290
flatten and the pin has to be twisted a

1084
00:45:34,950 --> 00:45:39,569
certain direction before it'll go up

1085
00:45:36,290 --> 00:45:44,308
medco keys are really nice like they're

1086
00:45:39,569 --> 00:45:46,200
a bugger to pick so yeah those are some

1087
00:45:44,309 --> 00:45:48,630
that they recommend<font color="#CCCCCC"> I haven't tested</font>

1088
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:54,450
them all out but they have so hopefully

1089
00:45:48,630 --> 00:45:57,180
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> helps any other questions cool I do</font>

1090
00:45:54,450 --> 00:45:59,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">have a I did mention on auto jigglers I</font>

1091
00:45:57,180 --> 00:46:02,220
do have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a set of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> those up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here or</font>

1092
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:04,140
somewhere but so you'll notice<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

1093
00:46:02,220 --> 00:46:05,700
isn't a tension tool type thing you

1094
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:08,549
literally put it in and you just kind of

1095
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:10,259
jiggle it and most car automotive locks

1096
00:46:08,549 --> 00:46:13,440
are a<font color="#E5E5E5"> double-sided wafer lock which is</font>

1097
00:46:10,260 --> 00:46:16,319
similar to a pin tumbler lock but a lot

1098
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:17,940
weaker and you can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> how easy it is to</font>

1099
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:18,880
get<font color="#CCCCCC"> in it really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> depends and you just</font>

1100
00:46:17,940 --> 00:46:20,559
kind of

1101
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:22,359
you pull it in and out up and down and

1102
00:46:20,559 --> 00:46:26,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">you twist it slightly they're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that easy</font>

1103
00:46:22,359 --> 00:46:29,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">to use downside is you can't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really most</font>

1104
00:46:26,589 --> 00:46:30,788
cars are chipped you can't really still

1105
00:46:29,049 --> 00:46:32,319
a car but you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a car you</font>

1106
00:46:30,789 --> 00:46:33,339
could get the registration info and find

1107
00:46:32,319 --> 00:46:38,019
out where people<font color="#CCCCCC"> live you could do all</font>

1108
00:46:33,339 --> 00:46:40,058
sorts of creepy stuff I didn't mention

1109
00:46:38,019 --> 00:46:43,348
bump keys this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is just a little image of</font>

1110
00:46:40,059 --> 00:46:46,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">help bump keys work I have a set up here</font>

1111
00:46:43,349 --> 00:46:49,450
bump keys are cool those that consider

1112
00:46:46,329 --> 00:46:52,359
art pick or lock picking an art kind of

1113
00:46:49,450 --> 00:46:54,759
you know they're like this isn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> picking</font>

1114
00:46:52,359 --> 00:46:58,328
this is just burglar manipulation like

1115
00:46:54,759 --> 00:46:59,950
block manipulation stuff anyone can do

1116
00:46:58,329 --> 00:47:01,119
<font color="#CCCCCC">this the downside to this if you're</font>

1117
00:46:59,950 --> 00:47:02,710
trying to sneak into a house you're

1118
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:05,259
literally knocking on the door you're

1119
00:47:02,710 --> 00:47:06,880
trying to sneak into it's very<font color="#E5E5E5"> loud you</font>
