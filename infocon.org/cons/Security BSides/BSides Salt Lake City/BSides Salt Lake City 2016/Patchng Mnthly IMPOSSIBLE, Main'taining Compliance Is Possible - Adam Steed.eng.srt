5
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:28,949
you would rather be going to a dentist

6
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:30,598
or a root canal sounds pretty appealing

7
00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:33,450
at this point but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am going to talk</font>

8
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:36,989
about patch management and a new way

9
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:39,390
that a new methodology that I've used<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

10
00:00:36,989 --> 00:00:41,370
the past that's been<font color="#E5E5E5"> very successful on</font>

11
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:43,790
how to do patch management a little bit

12
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:43,790
different

13
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:58,530
so here's a kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of an agenda</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of what</font>

14
00:00:56,580 --> 00:01:02,160
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to walk through a little bit</font>

15
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:05,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">about myself okay i worked for protiviti</font>

23
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:36,420
remediation so I come from I'm kind of

24
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:38,910
new to the world of a consulting and in

25
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:40,950
my role in past organizations I was over

26
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:44,220
patch management and some of the

27
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:46,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">organizations I had over</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 6,000 servers</font>

28
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:49,140
that I had that I was in charge of

29
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:51,590
keeping of running a patch and

30
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:55,590
vulnerability management program for as

31
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:58,710
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> imagine patching becomes a</font>

32
00:01:55,590 --> 00:02:02,160
full-time job and when you ever you say

33
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:03,330
the word patching to assist<font color="#E5E5E5"> adnan all of</font>

a<font color="#CCCCCC"> sudden he's going to have flashbacks</font>

35
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:11,700
of late nights energy drinks at 3am and

36
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:15,870
a nightmare<font color="#E5E5E5"> of having to roll patches</font>

37
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:18,230
back because stuff broke so commonly

38
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:21,600
when I go<font color="#E5E5E5"> out to see see organizations</font>

39
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:24,859
organizations<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would say typically they</font>

40
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:27,510
will patch every single month but

41
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:30,750
typically once or twice a year they have

42
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:35,239
to roll patches back because of

43
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:37,799
compatibility issues so according to

44
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:41,730
HP's brand new paper their<font color="#E5E5E5"> cybersecurity</font>

45
00:02:37,799 --> 00:02:43,290
paper that HP just released they don't

46
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:45,810
like the currents Fayette a patch

47
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:47,220
management either I think it's funny

48
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:51,120
that they would use such strong words

49
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:54,239
like while it is laudable with laudable

50
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:57,930
that Adobe and Microsoft<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bulls releases</font>

51
00:02:54,239 --> 00:03:01,200
patches at any point in their history so

52
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:03,690
basically it remains unclear if this

53
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:06,298
level of patching can be continued can

54
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:07,980
be sustained so Microsoft on average

55
00:03:06,299 --> 00:03:11,819
right now<font color="#CCCCCC"> is averaging about a</font>

56
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:14,510
to 150 security patches per year per

57
00:03:11,819 --> 00:03:17,099
year<font color="#E5E5E5"> and from a testing at the</font>

58
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:19,200
deployment standpoint this is time

59
00:03:17,099 --> 00:03:23,940
consuming this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> expensive to</font>

60
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:26,579
organizations and also risking because

61
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:31,319
when we whenever we make<font color="#E5E5E5"> changes it</font>

62
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:33,660
introduces risk the organization<font color="#CCCCCC"> also we</font>

63
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:37,260
find out<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the most commonly breached</font>

64
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:40,190
security hole<font color="#E5E5E5"> today is the same hole</font>

65
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:43,560
that it has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been for the last five years</font>

66
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:46,230
we are not<font color="#E5E5E5"> catching and because we're</font>

67
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:47,730
not patching hackers are lazy we're

68
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:49,500
going to use the same tricks that worked

69
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:52,768
yesterday we're going to try them again

70
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:55,319
today<font color="#E5E5E5"> because that it's still working</font>

71
00:03:52,769 --> 00:03:57,269
<font color="#CCCCCC">today because companies find that</font>

72
00:03:55,319 --> 00:04:03,510
patching is too difficult it's too

73
00:03:57,269 --> 00:04:05,430
complicated and it's too costly so when

74
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:08,429
I go out<font color="#E5E5E5"> and do an assessment against an</font>

75
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:11,940
organization I find very levels of

76
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:14,310
patching maturity from a walk in an

77
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:17,010
organization and they do absolutely no

78
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:19,430
patching and what I commonly here is we

79
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:22,289
can't patch here because it breaks stuff

80
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:24,210
then I'll walk into an organization at

81
00:04:22,289 --> 00:04:26,639
the next maturity level and they'll

82
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:28,349
basically say hey I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to turn on</font>

83
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:31,500
auto updates I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to do any</font>

84
00:04:28,349 --> 00:04:34,830
type of catching testing or anything I'm

85
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:37,050
just turn<font color="#E5E5E5"> on auto updates but there's no</font>

86
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:40,440
management<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that there's no reporting</font>

87
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:43,349
there's no maturity around that and it's

88
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:45,150
typically only around OS patches not

89
00:04:43,349 --> 00:04:47,729
around<font color="#E5E5E5"> third-party patches it's not</font>

90
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:50,159
around any of that then we get<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a</font>

91
00:04:47,729 --> 00:04:53,060
level where I'm going to use wsus I'm

92
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,840
going to have this centralized

93
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:57,450
infrastructure now and I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

94
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:59,789
control patching but this doesn't

95
00:04:57,450 --> 00:05:03,690
address third-party<font color="#E5E5E5"> patching this is</font>

96
00:04:59,789 --> 00:05:08,010
like java and flash all these other

97
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:10,919
products<font color="#CCCCCC"> that have to be patched so then</font>

98
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:12,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">i'll see a maturity level of well we're</font>

99
00:05:10,919 --> 00:05:14,698
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have we're actually going to</font>

100
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:16,859
patch and we're also going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> purchase a</font>

101
00:05:14,699 --> 00:05:19,349
vulnerability scanner like<font color="#CCCCCC"> Nessus or</font>

102
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:20,380
next pose a we're actually going to scan

103
00:05:19,349 --> 00:05:22,360
our entire

104
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:25,090
and keep track of our missing patches

105
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:26,410
and our missing vulnerabilities little

106
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:30,400
something I have learned over<font color="#E5E5E5"> the years</font>

107
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:33,190
when you run windows update and<font color="#E5E5E5"> windows</font>

108
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:36,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">update runs and it says I install this</font>

109
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:37,930
patch all it does<font color="#E5E5E5"> is it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

110
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:39,970
says<font color="#E5E5E5"> it installed a patch all it does is</font>

111
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:42,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">it goes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and flips a couple registry key</font>

112
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:46,420
values it doesn't actually validate that

113
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:48,309
the install was correct and the dll

114
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:50,890
versions and the libraries were actually

115
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:52,960
updated to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> right version so commonly</font>

116
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:54,729
when i see at organization go out and do

117
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:57,580
a vulnerability scan for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first time</font>

118
00:05:54,730 --> 00:06:01,360
the vulnerability scanner will come back

119
00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:03,849
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> say hey these servers aren't patched</font>

120
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:06,940
in the admins like well we applied the

121
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:08,860
patch to it well it does it not

122
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:11,620
necessarily<font color="#CCCCCC"> because it doesn't mean that</font>

123
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:13,360
the patch was installed correctly so

124
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:15,970
it's important<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you do validation</font>

125
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:19,450
with a Volm ability<font color="#CCCCCC"> scanned in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

126
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:21,580
scanner or using Microsoft mbsa it's

127
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:26,950
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> validates the patches are</font>

128
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:29,919
installed correctly now lastly we'll all

129
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:31,659
see this complete program<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay that work</font>

130
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:35,290
we're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> patch every month we're</font>

131
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:38,260
very mature we have a process down what

132
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:41,980
I'm introducing today is is a six bullet

133
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:45,010
point at the very bottom when we talk

134
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:46,300
about evolving to the program to a point

135
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:52,330
where you<font color="#E5E5E5"> only have to patch a couple</font>

136
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:54,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">times a year instead of every month so</font>

137
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:58,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">we talked</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about their several risks just</font>

138
00:06:54,760 --> 00:07:00,460
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> by applying a patch okay so</font>

139
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:02,710
typically<font color="#E5E5E5"> why do patches fell when i</font>

140
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:05,080
deploy a patch out why<font color="#CCCCCC"> does that fail</font>

141
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:10,599
the number one reason is the lack of

142
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:13,419
testing so typically IT departments go

143
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:16,600
out they go out and<font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> oh we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> need to</font>

144
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:18,640
deploy these pouches I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to deploy</font>

145
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:21,580
it to it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a test server or a couple</font>

146
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:24,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">test machines today and we'll see if it</font>

147
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:26,409
really breaks anything okay did it<font color="#E5E5E5"> break</font>

148
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:29,620
anything let's go ahead<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> roll it out</font>

149
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:31,900
to production well that<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't mean</font>

150
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:34,009
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they thoroughly tested all the</font>

151
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:38,119
features and compatibility

152
00:07:34,009 --> 00:07:40,819
the entire application also the second

153
00:07:38,119 --> 00:07:44,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">most common reason I see is when we can</font>

154
00:07:40,819 --> 00:07:46,339
we do reboots when you reboot a box it

155
00:07:44,059 --> 00:07:48,589
doesn't always<font color="#E5E5E5"> come back and even more</font>

156
00:07:46,339 --> 00:07:50,869
<font color="#CCCCCC">so when it's a physical server if you</font>

157
00:07:48,589 --> 00:07:54,789
when you reboot a physical server it's

158
00:07:50,869 --> 00:07:58,699
<font color="#CCCCCC">10 times more likely not to come back</font>

159
00:07:54,789 --> 00:08:03,520
then you know if you didn't reboot it so

160
00:07:58,699 --> 00:08:03,520
that's when failures occur is on reboot

161
00:08:03,879 --> 00:08:10,069
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talked about that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> aighty we lack</font>

162
00:08:07,729 --> 00:08:13,729
the skill set and the tools to

163
00:08:10,069 --> 00:08:16,839
adequately test patches so to properly

164
00:08:13,729 --> 00:08:19,758
test a patch most organizations<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a</font>

165
00:08:16,839 --> 00:08:21,559
software development department and in

166
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:23,509
<font color="#CCCCCC">that software development department</font>

167
00:08:21,559 --> 00:08:26,360
typically<font color="#E5E5E5"> they'll have a QA Department</font>

168
00:08:23,509 --> 00:08:28,370
and the QA<font color="#CCCCCC"> department was really good at</font>

169
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:31,189
writing test case and<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're really</font>

170
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:35,389
they have great tools<font color="#E5E5E5"> to actually test</font>

171
00:08:31,189 --> 00:08:38,029
the features of an<font color="#CCCCCC"> application but I t</font>

172
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:41,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">usually handles our own testing of a</font>

173
00:08:38,029 --> 00:08:44,810
patch we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have the skill set in the</font>

174
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:46,699
IT department we need to mature our IT

175
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:49,518
departments to have these the

176
00:08:46,699 --> 00:08:52,160
availability to tools to<font color="#CCCCCC"> not just be</font>

177
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:54,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">able</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be able to test every feature of</font>

178
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:57,740
a box to simulate what a user does

179
00:08:54,319 --> 00:09:00,769
stimulate an average user opening

180
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:02,360
applications actually loading a file

181
00:09:00,769 --> 00:09:04,670
making sure that the file loads

182
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:07,040
correctly all this can be scripted and

183
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:11,300
it can<font color="#CCCCCC"> be automated it doesn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

184
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:13,099
be time-consuming I find that that with

185
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:15,279
through automation you can reduce the

186
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:19,100
amount of testing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it takes by</font>

187
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:21,439
seventy to eighty five percent if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do</font>

188
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:23,569
automation the other common reason that

189
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:26,540
icy patches fail is you deploying a

190
00:09:23,569 --> 00:09:28,849
patch out to all these servers it worked

191
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:31,670
great in testing I had no problems but

192
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:34,040
the second I put load on that server all

193
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:38,029
of a sudden CPU<font color="#E5E5E5"> spikes after I applied</font>

194
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:42,099
that patch we don't trust we typically

195
00:09:38,029 --> 00:09:46,160
do not load test when we deploy a patch

196
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:47,510
so we need to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure our programs to</font>

197
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,939
the point where

198
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:52,460
a we're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to when we test the patch</font>

199
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:53,990
we're going to simulate actual load so

200
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:57,410
we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> really understand what this is</font>

201
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:59,960
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do the problem though is if we</font>

202
00:09:57,410 --> 00:10:01,790
increase our testing it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

203
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:03,890
increase our<font color="#E5E5E5"> costs to deploy the patch</font>

204
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:05,990
and it's also going to increase the time

205
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:08,120
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> us to deploy the patch as well so</font>

206
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:11,540
cost and time to deployment increases

207
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:14,960
but on the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> side it reduces risks</font>

208
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:20,000
so risk to the organization for business

209
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:23,150
disruption so<font color="#CCCCCC"> comedies we talk about</font>

210
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:28,040
cost and risk should cheer the business

211
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:31,340
make this investment and should what is

212
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:34,069
the risk the organization if we don't we

213
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:37,070
talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this all day in cissp classes</font>

214
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:41,480
risk to the business you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make</font>

215
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:43,870
catching a risk to the business<font color="#E5E5E5"> so most</font>

216
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:47,720
organizations i go into<font color="#E5E5E5"> i asked if i say</font>

217
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:49,550
okay for you to patch once a month what

218
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:52,550
how much<font color="#E5E5E5"> does a cost your organization</font>

219
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:54,560
that deploy a patch every month and most

220
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:56,390
companies cannot tell me the cost to

221
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:59,660
patch if i'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to write a business</font>

222
00:10:56,390 --> 00:11:01,819
case to organization whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> i should</font>

223
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:04,480
patch or not<font color="#E5E5E5"> i should understand what</font>

224
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:07,430
the cost is to the organization to patch

225
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:10,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so so typically i need to</font>

226
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:13,719
understand these variables of<font color="#E5E5E5"> typically</font>

227
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:16,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">i keep track of these matrix every month</font>

228
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:18,830
how many hours<font color="#E5E5E5"> did it take me to test</font>

229
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:20,840
how many hours did it take<font color="#E5E5E5"> to deploy how</font>

230
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:23,060
many<font color="#E5E5E5"> hours from various business the</font>

231
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:27,470
business units that take for them to

232
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:29,000
validate traditionally<font color="#CCCCCC"> i also track the</font>

233
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:32,360
number of<font color="#E5E5E5"> times we have to roll back</font>

234
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:34,820
patches every year so typically<font color="#E5E5E5"> in most</font>

235
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:36,790
organizations<font color="#E5E5E5"> i would patch failure</font>

236
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:39,830
rates are between five and ten percent

237
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:41,599
if they patch every month one to two

238
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:44,450
times a year they're going to have to

239
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:46,250
roll back some patches track that

240
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:48,320
information you need you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

241
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:50,690
understand that<font color="#E5E5E5"> information so that you</font>

242
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:55,400
can build the business business cases of

243
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:57,830
wind a patch now when I look at what I'm

244
00:11:55,400 --> 00:12:00,350
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to assess whether I should catch</font>

245
00:11:57,830 --> 00:12:01,670
or not we<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to understand the</font>

246
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:04,280
severity of the path

247
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:06,910
okay and we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to we're going to</font>

248
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:09,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk about a lot about using</font>

249
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:12,650
compensating controls to remediate

250
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:15,740
patches okay but<font color="#E5E5E5"> when I look at</font>

251
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:20,180
compensating controls like save a

252
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:22,400
network IPS or a firewall when I look at

253
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:24,319
these things<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't care</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about them</font>

254
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:27,439
anymore I don't care<font color="#E5E5E5"> about a fire while</font>

255
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:30,680
I don't care about an IP IP s anymore

256
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:32,840
because the most common way breaches are

257
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:35,900
occurring today is through pivot attacks

258
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:38,900
so we look at the target incident that

259
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:41,050
occurred at target they were able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

260
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:44,959
breach heating and air conditioning

261
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:47,719
desktop machine and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> they use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

262
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:50,120
to to attack another desktop and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

263
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:52,730
they use that desktop to attack a server

264
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:55,160
and then a cash register a point<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

265
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:57,020
sales unit so all of a sudden you have

266
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:59,360
these pivot attack sins are coming in

267
00:12:57,020 --> 00:13:02,650
these attacks are coming from the inside

268
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:06,140
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the network not from the outside so</font>

269
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:08,750
when I'm assessing the security of a

270
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:11,960
server I do not take into account

271
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:18,410
perimeter security because most attacks

272
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:20,270
now are coming from the inside so let's

273
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:23,510
talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about this concept of risk-based</font>

274
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:26,689
patch management most compliance

275
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:29,200
programs like PCI compliance regulatory

276
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:32,870
compliance programs like high trust

277
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:35,060
HIPAA if you read through<font color="#E5E5E5"> the programs</font>

278
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:37,070
they all will say a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them will say</font>

279
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:40,250
do you apply patches monthly what is

280
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:42,020
your what what is your policy around

281
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:44,780
patch management most companies say

282
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:47,660
monthly but they also will say do you

283
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:50,750
patch monthly or do you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

284
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:52,760
risk-based patch management program when

285
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:54,590
I ask people what this base patch

286
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:57,740
management programs me and I get a

287
00:13:54,590 --> 00:14:00,200
hundred different answers so let me show

288
00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:02,480
you what my definition<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a risk-based</font>

289
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:06,980
patch management program is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I that</font>

290
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:09,230
I've deployed before so we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

291
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:11,740
talk about compensating controls on the

292
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:14,780
server so a server will typically have

293
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:15,529
antivirus<font color="#CCCCCC"> it might have it memory</font>

294
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:18,499
protection

298
00:14:24,439 --> 00:14:31,279
whitelisting these are<font color="#E5E5E5"> all security</font>

299
00:14:28,579 --> 00:14:34,430
layers that are on the server itself

300
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:37,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I tried</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to exploit that</font>

301
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:39,019
server it would have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> go through every</font>

302
00:14:37,069 --> 00:14:42,469
one of these layers to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

303
00:14:39,019 --> 00:14:43,910
exploit and as that exploit travels

304
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:46,790
through these<font color="#E5E5E5"> different layers of</font>

305
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:48,680
security it's going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> interact and it's</font>

306
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:51,649
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> change the behavior of that</font>

307
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:55,248
exploit so even though<font color="#E5E5E5"> Microsoft comes</font>

308
00:14:51,649 --> 00:14:59,930
in and says hey this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a hypothesis</font>

309
00:14:55,249 --> 00:15:01,730
this is high severity<font color="#CCCCCC"> but when I</font>

310
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:05,269
actually try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to exploit it on that</font>

311
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:08,300
machine it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a high severity because</font>

312
00:15:05,269 --> 00:15:10,629
my my<font color="#CCCCCC"> host IPS picked it up and it</font>

313
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:13,849
stopped that exploit from occurring and

314
00:15:10,629 --> 00:15:17,300
so since it stopped it it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a high</font>

315
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:20,990
severity anymore I can reevaluate the

316
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:23,479
risk because I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to assign I'm</font>

317
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:27,529
going to now track hey this exploit can

318
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:30,110
be stopped by this compensating control

319
00:15:27,529 --> 00:15:37,250
that this this<font color="#E5E5E5"> security product here</font>

320
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:39,439
stop this exploit so when we do

321
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:40,699
assessing on a box we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk</font>

322
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:42,860
about two different<font color="#E5E5E5"> things we're talking</font>

323
00:15:40,699 --> 00:15:45,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">about vulnerability scanning we're going</font>

324
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:47,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">to talk about penetration testing and</font>

325
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:49,910
exploitation<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so typically</font>

326
00:15:47,959 --> 00:15:54,878
vulnerability scanners that use today

327
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:56,930
like Nessus next pose a these are<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

328
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:59,899
vulnerability scanners what they do is

329
00:15:56,930 --> 00:16:03,739
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at a box and they what they're</font>

330
00:15:59,899 --> 00:16:06,649
looking for is like dll versions they

331
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:09,949
don't actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> try the actual exploit</font>

332
00:16:06,649 --> 00:16:13,249
they say based on this dll version your

333
00:16:09,949 --> 00:16:16,279
server is vulnerable to<font color="#CCCCCC"> this exploit it</font>

334
00:16:13,249 --> 00:16:19,040
doesn't try the actual exploit it just

335
00:16:16,279 --> 00:16:22,610
it just evaluates what you could be

336
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:25,339
susceptible for okay now a penetration

337
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:29,269
test or an exploitation software like

338
00:16:25,339 --> 00:16:29,960
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> metasploit or core impact that's</font>

339
00:16:29,269 --> 00:16:33,680
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go</font>

340
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:36,500
and actually try the actual exploit big

341
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:38,449
difference there so penetration test

342
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:40,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually tries the actual exploit and</font>

343
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:44,600
sees what I can actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> do with that</font>

344
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:46,459
exploit can I<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a shell access can I</font>

345
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:50,330
take<font color="#E5E5E5"> control of the whole desktop can I</font>

346
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:56,090
pull data out it's just<font color="#CCCCCC"> I need I need to</font>

347
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:58,250
use both tools so by approach to to

348
00:16:56,090 --> 00:17:00,980
patch management is there's varying

349
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:03,320
phases to the approach to risk based

350
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:05,450
patch management program the first phase

351
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:07,580
is the inventory phase I need to

352
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:09,860
understand what hardware is out there I

353
00:17:07,579 --> 00:17:12,199
need to understand what software is<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

354
00:17:09,859 --> 00:17:14,060
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> I need to understand where the</font>

355
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:18,589
sensitive data in the organization

356
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:20,629
exists on the network<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> also</font>

357
00:17:18,589 --> 00:17:22,760
need to understand the impact of that

358
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:25,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">system if that system goes down what is</font>

359
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:27,290
the impact of the organization because

360
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:29,570
not all servers are created equal if I

361
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:31,639
bring down<font color="#E5E5E5"> a database server it's more</font>

362
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:34,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">than likely going to have a much larger</font>

363
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:42,290
ramification than bringing down a like

364
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:44,510
an app server the next phase when you

365
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:47,510
we've talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the importance of</font>

366
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:50,030
testing and how important it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is this</font>

367
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:54,640
test but<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you work in an environment</font>

368
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:57,770
that has<font color="#CCCCCC"> 5,000 servers you cannot do</font>

369
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:59,240
5,000 test case that's too many things

370
00:17:57,770 --> 00:18:02,090
to test against it would take you

371
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:03,740
literally months to deploy patches

372
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:05,929
because you would have<font color="#E5E5E5"> so many test case</font>

373
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:08,060
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to be able to reduce your</font>

374
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:10,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">test case down so what you want to do is</font>

375
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:13,280
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> take your servers that have the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> same</font>

376
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:15,320
footprint the same applications loaded

377
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:17,149
on them so you have a bunch of web

378
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:18,620
servers they might be different web

379
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:20,960
servers but they have the same version

380
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:24,709
of tomcat on them they have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same</font>

381
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:26,420
exact version of all these different

382
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:29,240
applications so they're configured

383
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:31,520
identically I mean they have the same

384
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:33,050
vulnerabilities on it if I if I conduct

385
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:34,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">a vulnerability scan on these two</font>

386
00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:37,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">different systems and they're exactly</font>

387
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:40,070
the same they're configured the same i'm

388
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:41,929
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lump lump them into my into</font>

389
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:44,178
their own test group so i can reduce<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

390
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:49,190
number of test case so I've been able

391
00:18:44,179 --> 00:18:52,669
to successfully go from over<font color="#CCCCCC"> 5000</font>

392
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:56,779
servers to 50 test case so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i only have</font>

393
00:18:52,669 --> 00:19:03,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">to test 50 test cases now I don't have</font>

394
00:18:56,779 --> 00:19:05,419
<font color="#CCCCCC">to do six thousand now the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> next thing I</font>

395
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:07,580
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> is I perform that vulnerability scan</font>

396
00:19:05,419 --> 00:19:11,499
we talked about earlier<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what I'm</font>

397
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:14,689
looking for is not<font color="#CCCCCC"> just missing patches</font>

398
00:19:11,499 --> 00:19:17,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Microsoft releases a patch it</font>

399
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:20,179
doesn't it it can contain multiple

400
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:23,769
exploits so exploits are usually tracked

401
00:19:20,179 --> 00:19:26,960
by<font color="#CCCCCC"> cve numbers so a common vulnerability</font>

402
00:19:23,769 --> 00:19:30,559
exploit there'll be an actual<font color="#E5E5E5"> number for</font>

403
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:33,440
it so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at a Microsoft patch</font>

404
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:37,039
it might contain 10 different<font color="#CCCCCC"> CVE</font>

405
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:39,049
numbers so what we want what we want to

406
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:43,610
do is we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at the server and</font>

407
00:19:39,049 --> 00:19:48,908
say okay tell me what what Steve E's is

408
00:19:43,610 --> 00:19:51,559
does this server is it vulnerable to I

409
00:19:48,909 --> 00:19:53,809
need to know a list of those exact<font color="#E5E5E5"> SI</font>

410
00:19:51,559 --> 00:19:55,879
VES because what I'm going to do next is

411
00:19:53,809 --> 00:19:58,850
I'm going to take<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that list to see</font>

412
00:19:55,879 --> 00:20:01,309
bees now and plug it into my penetration

413
00:19:58,850 --> 00:20:05,119
testing software and i'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to point</font>

414
00:20:01,309 --> 00:20:09,230
my penetration test sir my penetration

415
00:20:05,119 --> 00:20:12,230
test tool to that server intake<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay the</font>

416
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:14,659
vulnerability scan said it's it's it's

417
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:17,450
vulnerable to these things<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want you</font>

418
00:20:14,659 --> 00:20:19,549
actually to try to exploit that that

419
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:22,429
small list i'm not i'm not talking about

420
00:20:19,549 --> 00:20:24,320
testing hundreds of thousands of

421
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:26,299
different exploits<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm taking a small</font>

422
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:28,610
list of maybe a couple hundred exploits

423
00:20:26,299 --> 00:20:30,470
that I'm testing it gets the goal here

424
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:33,949
is to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to automate this and to</font>

425
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:38,809
automate your testing so you're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

426
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:40,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">go out and actually exploit that the</font>

427
00:20:38,809 --> 00:20:43,309
next<font color="#E5E5E5"> step is what you're going to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now</font>

428
00:20:40,519 --> 00:20:46,039
is when that expert<font color="#E5E5E5"> went when those</font>

429
00:20:43,309 --> 00:20:48,559
exploits ran you need to capture the log

430
00:20:46,039 --> 00:20:50,990
files from your very various

431
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:53,090
compensating controls on that server so

432
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:55,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">you need to look at the AV logs you need</font>

433
00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:58,470
to look at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the log files from your</font>

434
00:20:55,490 --> 00:21:01,350
host IPS the log files from

435
00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:04,740
kishin whitelisting and look in those

436
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:06,629
log files and see where it stopped that

437
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:08,760
vulnerability which which of those

438
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:13,289
caught that vulnerability and stopped it

439
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:15,390
or which one changed its behavior so for

440
00:21:13,289 --> 00:21:17,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">example like I only get partial access</font>

441
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:20,730
to a box instead of full access to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a box</font>

442
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:22,830
I no longer<font color="#E5E5E5"> can get rude because one of</font>

443
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:25,200
my one of my compensating controls

444
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:30,418
change this behavior you need to be able

445
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:33,570
to create an in a list I track an excel

446
00:21:30,419 --> 00:21:36,260
list of<font color="#CCCCCC"> CVE for each server each test</font>

447
00:21:33,570 --> 00:21:39,750
group I keep a list of CDE numbers and

448
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:41,129
then exactly that are that the

449
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:43,590
vulnerability scanner says I'm

450
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:46,559
vulnerable to and then I keep a list of

451
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:49,649
exactly which compensating control

452
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:53,700
caught them because the end of the day I

453
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:57,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">need to be able to go to an auditor like</font>

461
00:22:09,299 --> 00:22:14,340
of an SD scan so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to take a</font>

462
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:16,350
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at that that's a scan and what you</font>

463
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:18,330
can do is you can come to me and say<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font>

464
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:21,510
here's here's a list of vulnerabilities

465
00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:24,299
at this box that message out our next

466
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:27,059
pose a showed and here's a list of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

467
00:22:24,299 --> 00:22:29,250
exact compensating controls that<font color="#E5E5E5"> stop</font>

468
00:22:27,059 --> 00:22:31,799
each one of those CVEs you have to be

469
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:35,659
able to demonstrate to me the auditor

470
00:22:31,799 --> 00:22:38,820
that those compensating controls worked

471
00:22:35,659 --> 00:22:43,590
so you have to keep this evidence for an

472
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:45,030
audit now there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> always a big question</font>

473
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:47,668
who should decide when to patch

474
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:49,740
typically the IT department or the

475
00:22:47,669 --> 00:22:53,789
information security department will

476
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:56,549
will say hey we need patch now but

477
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:58,169
should we this is we're talking about

478
00:22:56,549 --> 00:23:00,960
spending money we're talking about

479
00:22:58,169 --> 00:23:04,409
spending resources in most organizations

480
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:07,289
they holistically will track the the

481
00:23:04,409 --> 00:23:09,450
risk of an entire organization so

482
00:23:07,289 --> 00:23:12,570
they're out there they're going to

483
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:17,730
and typically<font color="#CCCCCC"> if the risk committee is</font>

484
00:23:12,570 --> 00:23:19,260
is is fronted by the CFO and the CFO

485
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:22,289
will look at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the risk to the</font>

486
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:24,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">business and what a cost to fix those</font>

487
00:23:22,289 --> 00:23:27,750
particular risks to remediate those

488
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:30,240
risks week when we take this approach of

489
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:33,090
understanding what the cost is to patch

490
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:35,070
and we understand what the risk is to

491
00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:38,459
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> business we can have discussions</font>

492
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:41,789
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> people like the CFO and say okay</font>

493
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:44,700
here is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> actual cost here is the</font>

494
00:23:41,789 --> 00:23:46,440
actual<font color="#E5E5E5"> risk here is the percentage we</font>

495
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:48,539
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> look and see what the percentage of</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">what the impact is if you exploit these</font>

499
00:23:55,200 --> 00:24:01,500
particular servers<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so typically I</font>

500
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:03,690
will right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> a business case to the</font>

501
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:07,470
business<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying why we need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to make the</font>

502
00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:10,139
investment to patch it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> fascinating</font>

503
00:24:07,470 --> 00:24:14,549
when when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you change the methodology of</font>

504
00:24:10,139 --> 00:24:17,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">going from hey this is just regular</font>

505
00:24:14,549 --> 00:24:20,370
maintenance to this is a business

506
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:21,990
decision<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the business has decided</font>

507
00:24:20,370 --> 00:24:26,189
<font color="#CCCCCC">to deploy this patch this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a business</font>

508
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:28,590
decision all of a sudden<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was it became</font>

509
00:24:26,190 --> 00:24:30,720
a hundred times easier for me to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

510
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:32,939
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> business and get support from the</font>

511
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:37,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">business to patch because this was a</font>

512
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:39,480
business decision not an IT decision it

513
00:24:37,049 --> 00:24:40,950
was phenomenal phenomenal change in the

514
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:43,559
end in the way that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> business</font>

515
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:46,289
perceived patching because this this was

516
00:24:43,559 --> 00:24:50,279
a this was a business decision to reduce

517
00:24:46,289 --> 00:24:53,190
this risk so we talked about this we

518
00:24:50,279 --> 00:24:55,409
treat<font color="#CCCCCC"> it as a project</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> when you treat</font>

519
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:57,990
patching as just regular maintenance I

520
00:24:55,409 --> 00:24:59,789
find that organizations they they get

521
00:24:57,990 --> 00:25:01,679
halfway through their patching cycle

522
00:24:59,789 --> 00:25:04,019
though they never really<font color="#E5E5E5"> finished it and</font>

523
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:06,720
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> now they really have these these</font>

524
00:25:04,019 --> 00:25:10,169
clusters of servers that could never be

525
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:12,870
patched and so and we lose sight of

526
00:25:10,169 --> 00:25:16,649
these patches on these these special

527
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:19,379
case servers so<font color="#E5E5E5"> typically that's where</font>

528
00:25:16,649 --> 00:25:21,539
that the hackers are going after they're

529
00:25:19,379 --> 00:25:22,559
going after these systems that for some

530
00:25:21,539 --> 00:25:24,840
reason or<font color="#E5E5E5"> another have never</font>

531
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:26,789
been patched but they don't we don't

532
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:28,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">even track the compensating controls on</font>

533
00:25:26,789 --> 00:25:30,120
these servers either as well as so even

534
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:32,129
if they have vulnerabilities we're not

535
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:34,049
tracking how we're going to even though

536
00:25:32,129 --> 00:25:36,629
we've made a bit decision as an IT

537
00:25:34,049 --> 00:25:39,509
department not<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pachi servers we're</font>

538
00:25:36,629 --> 00:25:43,289
not thinking of ways to compensate for

539
00:25:39,509 --> 00:25:45,240
not patching so one of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> big challenge</font>

540
00:25:43,289 --> 00:25:48,299
that I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I had when I use this</font>

541
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:51,090
method was coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> up with in a test</font>

542
00:25:48,299 --> 00:25:55,679
environment that accurately represented

543
00:25:51,090 --> 00:25:58,860
my production environment and it can't

544
00:25:55,679 --> 00:26:00,509
just be well it's a vm okay because

545
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:02,340
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do load testing and when</font>

546
00:26:00,509 --> 00:26:04,919
we understand load testing we need

547
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:08,759
physical hot we<font color="#CCCCCC"> need hardware that can</font>

548
00:26:04,919 --> 00:26:11,220
have the same capacity of a production

549
00:26:08,759 --> 00:26:12,960
even in the cloud environment<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay if</font>

550
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:16,679
I'm if I'm going to spin up<font color="#E5E5E5"> a cloud</font>

551
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:18,690
environment a cloud instance in eight<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

552
00:26:16,679 --> 00:26:21,149
us I need to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's Peck the</font>

553
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:23,970
same so that I can put the same amount

554
00:26:21,149 --> 00:26:26,189
of load and make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I have all</font>

555
00:26:23,970 --> 00:26:28,169
the same dependencies I can't just spin

556
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:29,970
up a local copy of the database on that

557
00:26:28,169 --> 00:26:32,129
web server I need to actually have a

558
00:26:29,970 --> 00:26:35,029
database server that I can I can load

559
00:26:32,129 --> 00:26:35,029
test against

560
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:46,489
so we talked about the importance of

561
00:26:41,809 --> 00:26:48,050
automated testing so I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been able to</font>

562
00:26:46,490 --> 00:26:50,420
like what I talked<font color="#CCCCCC"> about before I've</font>

563
00:26:48,050 --> 00:26:52,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">been able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to reduce the number of hours</font>

564
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:54,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">that it took to patch so I worked in</font>

565
00:26:52,790 --> 00:26:56,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">this organization it was it was costing</font>

566
00:26:54,830 --> 00:27:00,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">us a hundred thousand dollars</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> every</font>

567
00:26:56,930 --> 00:27:02,660
month for us to patch that's 1.2 million

568
00:27:00,890 --> 00:27:05,270
dollars every year that sounds like a

569
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:08,960
huge number but this wasn't a huge

570
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:13,010
organization this it is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> uncommon for</font>

571
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:14,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">for companies between 21</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and 5,000</font>

572
00:27:13,010 --> 00:27:17,390
employees to be spending<font color="#E5E5E5"> this kind of</font>

573
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:19,850
money in labor every month on patching

574
00:27:17,390 --> 00:27:22,730
and support calls and helpdesk

575
00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:26,000
technicians to support this effort it

576
00:27:22,730 --> 00:27:28,010
adds up quickly and so the more you can

577
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,780
you can reduce the number of times you

578
00:27:28,010 --> 00:27:32,510
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to patch and reduce the time it</font>

579
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:35,000
takes to test the patch and the number

580
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:42,140
of times you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> roll back from the</font>

581
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:44,360
patch is going to save you money I got a

582
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:50,600
little little excited I talked a little

583
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:53,389
fast you know so just<font color="#CCCCCC"> to wrap up some</font>

584
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:58,270
key takeaways of what we talked about

585
00:27:53,390 --> 00:28:01,160
today once again my name<font color="#E5E5E5"> is Adam steep</font>

586
00:27:58,270 --> 00:28:03,530
if you saw my talk last<font color="#E5E5E5"> year on on why I</font>

587
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:05,780
love LinkedIn and using why I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

588
00:28:03,530 --> 00:28:09,350
linkedin is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a better pen testing tool</font>

589
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:11,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">than then in map go ahead please go</font>

590
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:13,189
ahead and<font color="#CCCCCC"> link me in my name is Adam</font>

591
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:15,530
steed on linkedin go ahead<font color="#E5E5E5"> and link me</font>

592
00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:19,070
in i have a bit really large network<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

593
00:28:15,530 --> 00:28:21,770
love hard questions if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

594
00:28:19,070 --> 00:28:24,620
questions around pci or coming up with a

595
00:28:21,770 --> 00:28:26,889
remediation for this audit<font color="#E5E5E5"> fighting feel</font>

596
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:29,809
free<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hit me up I love hard</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> questions</font>

597
00:28:26,890 --> 00:28:33,550
does anyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> have any</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> questions around</font>

598
00:28:29,809 --> 00:28:33,550
this go

599
00:28:56,260 --> 00:29:01,480
so what I did is I says okay if we're

600
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:04,409
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to change our methodology we need</font>

601
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:06,490
to increase when we do patch we need to

602
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:09,760
dramatically increase the amount of

603
00:29:06,490 --> 00:29:11,950
testing so I took them the number of

604
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:14,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">hours for testing that we were spending</font>

605
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:16,330
per month and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I doubled it okay and then</font>

606
00:29:14,770 --> 00:29:19,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">I also doubled the amount of</font>

607
00:29:16,330 --> 00:29:21,820
documentation so from a monthly cost

608
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:24,310
perspective when we did patch it was

609
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:28,899
costing us forty forty percent more

610
00:29:24,310 --> 00:29:31,389
money for us to do a patch so we were

611
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:35,440
investing more money when we did we were

612
00:29:31,390 --> 00:29:37,860
just doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> it less often but the what's</font>

613
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">that go ahead</font>

614
00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:05,720
you have to pay<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone eventually</font>

615
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:07,639
you're going to have to pay but can you

616
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:10,340
reduce the<font color="#E5E5E5"> number of times you have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

617
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:11,990
pay at the end of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> year I can tell</font>

618
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:15,709
you flat out i was spending a lot less

619
00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:18,110
the end of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> year but you bring up a</font>

620
00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:20,600
great point I've increased my dependency

621
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:23,360
now on my tools I need to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure my</font>

622
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:27,549
tools are healthy and they're running by

623
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:27,549
because now I'm very tool to pin it

624
00:30:42,210 --> 00:30:45,570
so you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the point I want to make is</font>

625
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:49,590
this doesn't work in every organization

626
00:30:45,570 --> 00:30:51,510
I think there's use cases that it is

627
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:54,570
that are for the most part there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

628
00:30:51,510 --> 00:30:56,220
it's probably triggered it's for most

629
00:30:54,570 --> 00:30:58,470
organizations patching monthly is a

630
00:30:56,220 --> 00:31:02,040
better way to do it I'm just saying<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

631
00:30:58,470 --> 00:31:05,520
in certain certain use cases it doesn't

632
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:07,920
work for<font color="#CCCCCC"> example I've been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing a lot</font>

633
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:10,200
of work out at<font color="#CCCCCC"> a hospital and they have</font>

634
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:12,930
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> these medical devices and and the</font>

635
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:15,060
medical<font color="#CCCCCC"> device manufacturers will only</font>

636
00:31:12,930 --> 00:31:17,370
approve they have to prove every OS

637
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:19,320
patch that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is applied onto a medical</font>

638
00:31:17,370 --> 00:31:21,870
device and they they will only approve

639
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:24,450
those patches a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> times a year and</font>

640
00:31:21,870 --> 00:31:26,969
so I physically<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can't patch those</font>

641
00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:30,420
devices every single month because the

642
00:31:26,970 --> 00:31:32,820
the manufacturer says I can't and I and

643
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:34,980
I often will see that on appliances as

644
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:38,370
well when when a vendor strips you an

645
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:40,980
appliance their appliance they will<font color="#E5E5E5"> only</font>

646
00:31:38,370 --> 00:31:49,520
allow you to patch it when they when

647
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:53,750
they bless it so any other questions

648
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:53,750
cool thanks guys appreciate it
