00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:22,350
communication resources and faster and

2
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:27,630
more reliable high performance can you

3
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:31,410
hear me now<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh good thanks everyone this</font>

4
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:36,930
is a self-contained pen testing lab so

5
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:40,070
let's get started I'm marb white I'm a

6
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:44,340
network security analyst for a local

7
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:46,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">health care supplement company all the</font>

8
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:48,870
requisite certifications that everybody

9
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:52,019
has and I like to say that I collect

10
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:53,760
hobbies as a hobby I tend to<font color="#E5E5E5"> jump from</font>

11
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:59,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">one thing to another and this is just</font>

12
00:00:53,760 --> 00:01:01,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">one of those projects so today this is</font>

13
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:04,769
what we're going to talk about going to

14
00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:09,170
go over the what the hack in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> box is</font>

15
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:14,310
how I came<font color="#E5E5E5"> around to do it kind of the</font>

16
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:16,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">idea where I'd</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like to see it go the</font>

17
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:19,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">problems that i ran into when I was</font>

18
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:21,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">building it the challenges that I was</font>

19
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:25,170
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to overcome some of the decisions</font>

20
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:27,180
that I made will also want to make it

21
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:29,159
better<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I invite anybody who's</font>

22
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:31,829
interested in this just let<font color="#CCCCCC"> me know I'll</font>

23
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:35,150
be happy to take any input particularly

24
00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:37,889
if anybody wants to help build some labs

25
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:40,799
we're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what all is in the kit</font>

26
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:42,630
and there's really nothing of value in

27
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:45,930
this talk so I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to set that bar</font>

28
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:49,199
really low to begin with it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going</font>

29
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:51,659
to go over how to use cali any specific

30
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:54,570
attacks anything like that this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is more</font>

31
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:58,049
the framework that you can use to learn

32
00:01:54,570 --> 00:02:02,609
how to build one of these to help teach

33
00:01:58,049 --> 00:02:05,729
other people mission statements got to

34
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:06,470
love these r a reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I wanted to</font>

35
00:02:05,729 --> 00:02:10,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">do this</font>

36
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:12,740
as the the project involve<font color="#E5E5E5"> evolved does</font>

37
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:14,350
I'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have something that you can</font>

38
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:20,330
take into a classroom you can give to

39
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:22,130
kids to to a hacker camp or a scout

40
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:26,150
troop or something like that and give

41
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:28,130
someone the the beginnings of this is

42
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:32,120
how you do some pen testing get people

43
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:35,810
interested in infosec into security in

44
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:37,910
general<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to have a really</font>

47
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:47,540
of ruined that this morning so I'll skip

48
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:49,130
that bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> but yeah let's let's get the</font>

00:02:55,100 --> 00:03:01,880
you know I I find security fund for a

53
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:07,820
reason I'd like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that interest for</font>

54
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:09,470
other people<font color="#CCCCCC"> too again I want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to make</font>

55
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:13,810
sure we're setting<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bar appropriately</font>

56
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:16,609
here but a little bit of back story

57
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:19,570
about a year and a<font color="#CCCCCC"> half ago I was</font>

58
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:24,860
studying for<font color="#CCCCCC"> my certified ethical hacker</font>

59
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:27,739
sir and had an introduction into it was

60
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:28,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">back track that we were using but it was</font>

61
00:03:27,739 --> 00:03:31,130
kind of my<font color="#E5E5E5"> first foray into the</font>

62
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:32,900
offensive set of security having been

63
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:36,320
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of blue team defensive side for</font>

64
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:38,269
most of my career I decided I needed a

65
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:41,299
lab so I could<font color="#E5E5E5"> use some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the tools</font>

66
00:03:38,269 --> 00:03:46,690
that I've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> learning and have a way</font>

67
00:03:41,299 --> 00:03:46,690
to kind of work with what i was using

68
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:53,420
also i am innately curious and just

69
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:57,019
wanted to kind of dive into that you

70
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:59,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">know it's self education is recurring</font>

71
00:03:57,019 --> 00:04:02,080
theme amongst people or profession so

72
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:06,100
this was just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a nap</font>

73
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:08,440
progression for me originally my idea

74
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:11,019
was just to use BMS there's a ton of

75
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:14,079
them out there that you know you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font>

76
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:18,820
get Callie directly from offensive

77
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:20,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">security and vm app already ready to go</font>

78
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:22,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">out of the box there's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> metasploit of all</font>

79
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:24,940
things like that so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I started</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> looking</font>

80
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:27,239
around my house what hardware did I have

81
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:30,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">that I could use to to build up a</font>

82
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:32,640
hypervisor and set up some VMS and set

83
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:35,140
up a lab well<font color="#E5E5E5"> I didn't have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a whole lot</font>

84
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:38,710
the only spare machine ahead lying

85
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:40,870
around used old ddr2 memory which was

86
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:45,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">just stupidly expensive when I started</font>

87
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:48,400
this so started to think about you know

88
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:52,600
what else could I use what could I do to

89
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:55,169
build this out and also<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know when it</font>

90
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:57,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">comes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to setting up a pen testing lab</font>

91
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:59,770
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> running vulnerable systems</font>

92
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:00,849
intentionally vulnerable systems you

93
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:03,280
don't want those running on your

94
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:04,510
corporate or on<font color="#E5E5E5"> your home network what</font>

95
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:07,599
if someone else<font color="#E5E5E5"> gets to them then they</font>

96
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:08,650
can pivot around attack you so I was

97
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">also looking at ways</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I could</font>

98
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:13,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">protect myself I'm no vmware expert so I</font>

99
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:18,820
didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> feel comfortable</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> setting</font>

100
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:21,150
all this up on my<font color="#CCCCCC"> home network that's</font>

101
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:24,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">when I came up with the hack in the Box</font>

102
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:26,229
concept here it's all Raspberry Pi base

103
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:27,310
and really the reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is is I was</font>

104
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:31,480
looking for an excuse to<font color="#CCCCCC"> play the</font>

105
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:36,550
raspberry PI's right they're cheap you

106
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:39,490
can get<font color="#E5E5E5"> them very easily and so I picked</font>

107
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:41,890
up a couple and started setting it up

108
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:43,510
and then I got<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> idea let's let's</font>

109
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:45,340
throw it all in a box a literal box

110
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:48,280
let's have it all self contains where

111
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:50,890
it's portable and then that's that's

112
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:52,239
when the idea of this is something<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

113
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:54,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">than</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me this is for other</font>

114
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:59,710
people to play<font color="#CCCCCC"> with this is for a</font>

115
00:05:54,900 --> 00:06:02,500
different audience right and in talking

116
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:06,570
with a bunch of colleagues about it at

117
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:09,090
work it kind of evolved into this idea

118
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:12,550
but let's have a standalone

119
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:13,750
self-contained system let's let's use it

120
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:15,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">for more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> than just my own</font>

121
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:20,920
a little personal lab let's start

122
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:22,359
teaching other people with it so how do

123
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:24,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">we put it together you know obviously</font>

124
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:27,970
step one you have to cut a hole in a box

125
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:33,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">and that's just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> where I'm running the</font>

126
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:36,310
power to for the display I looked at a

127
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:38,980
few different options here there are

128
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:40,750
some little mini HDMI<font color="#E5E5E5"> seven inch</font>

129
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:43,210
displays that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can get their little</font>

130
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:47,040
spendy also pretty small so it was kind

131
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:49,450
of hard to see I was poking around I

132
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:53,520
think I ran to walmart with<font color="#E5E5E5"> a coworker</font>

133
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:56,380
and i saw this TV I'm like wait a minute

134
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:58,120
that's cheap that's hdmi this will work

135
00:06:56,380 --> 00:07:00,669
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I picked</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it up and I had already</font>

136
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:03,820
picked up this<font color="#E5E5E5"> toolbox so I take it back</font>

137
00:07:00,669 --> 00:07:06,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">to the office take the TV apart and</font>

138
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:09,849
magically fit it just happened to wedge

139
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:12,610
perfectly in there I decided you know

140
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:16,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's this is now a thing we're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

141
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:18,640
go that was the original concept which

142
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:21,120
we'll get into a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit later and I</font>

143
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:24,520
ended up landing on this gaming display

144
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:26,050
which was significantly smaller<font color="#E5E5E5"> by I was</font>

148
00:07:33,669 --> 00:07:38,140
together everything's just kind of elk

149
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:42,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">wrote in so you can pop it out at needed</font>

150
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:45,010
or at will the power supplies in there

151
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:47,800
had an old tackle box lying around that

152
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:50,770
i<font color="#CCCCCC"> took some some of the inserts out they</font>

00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:52,180
used for storage internally<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was</font>

00:07:54,220 --> 00:08:01,660

00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:03,640

keyboard full-size mouse couldn't fit

159
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:12,450
that in so it changed again over the

baked into it that you can attack at

00:09:00,329 --> 00:09:03,599
well as i said ii and this is kind of a

176

useless talk and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to go over</font>

various vendors<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're open links later</font>

181
00:09:16,079 --> 00:09:23,699
in the slides this is what it looked

182
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:25,050
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to begin with there's a fair little</font>

00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:38,029
using a switch just a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think i</font>

186
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:41,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">used a netgear</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for ports which initially</font>

187
00:09:38,029 --> 00:09:44,189
and at one point I had as many as three

188
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:46,529
victims servers that I was going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to run</font>

189
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:51,029
but I decided to pair it<font color="#E5E5E5"> down just for</font>

190
00:09:46,529 --> 00:09:52,410
usability sake<font color="#E5E5E5"> into its current form and</font>

191
00:09:51,029 --> 00:09:54,689
this is another problem that i was

192
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:56,370
running into had giant wall warts for

193
00:09:54,690 --> 00:10:00,570
everything you needed<font color="#CCCCCC"> a you needed one</font>

194
00:09:56,370 --> 00:10:02,399
for the switch one for the TV one for

195
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:04,920
each<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the the raspberry PI's and they</font>

196
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:07,110
take up a significant amount of space on

197
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:08,849
a power strip as you can see there I've

198
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:11,880
got one little slot that I might be able

199
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:13,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">to wedge a plug into if I was lucky and</font>

200
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:14,860
this is only running with one victim

201
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:19,030
server and wanted

202
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:23,230
server it was kind of hard to keep

203
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:26,560
things tidy or elegant inside the the

204
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:29,080
box it was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> giant mess of cables and</font>

205
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:33,189
and everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't real happy</font>

206
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:35,740
with that and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously i decided i</font>

207
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:37,360
needed to change it but this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what the</font>

208
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:41,560
original display look like as you can

209
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:45,310
see it<font color="#CCCCCC"> just fit right into the edges of</font>

210
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:47,020
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> toolbox i'm using the downside of</font>

211
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:50,410
this is that you can't reach the the

212
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:53,110
power or input buttons on the side of

213
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:56,020
the display because<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're appreciated</font>

214
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:58,360
by the by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the case so you had to use the</font>

215
00:10:56,020 --> 00:11:02,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">TV remote control something that you</font>

216
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:03,940
could lose batteries could die<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

217
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:08,410
I didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really like that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> solution</font>

218
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:11,140
either and also<font color="#E5E5E5"> that giant power brake</font>

219
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:13,630
was really kind of a was harshing my

220
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:17,590
vibe a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> I couldn't I couldn't</font>

221
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:19,300
make<font color="#E5E5E5"> that fit and to the end of the</font>

222
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:22,380
whole case you know in a way that made

223
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:26,229
sense to me and so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> started looking for</font>

224
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:30,540
some other solutions and so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is kind</font>

225
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:30,540
of how the whole kit evolved over time

226
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:35,110
originally when I started this this is

227
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:39,790
about a year and a half ago I use the

228
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:41,620
the raspberry pi b plus and a raspberry

229
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:44,020
might be that where the original ones

230
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:46,540
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i had and then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a few months later</font>

231
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:51,220
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> year ago the raspberry pi</font>

232
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:53,939
foundation introduced the PI<font color="#E5E5E5"> to which if</font>

233
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:57,730
you know much about<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think the</font>

234
00:11:53,940 --> 00:12:01,660
raspberry pi 2 has about six times the

235
00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:04,870
CPU is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> raspberry pi be four times the</font>

236
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:06,850
ram it was a it makes cali usable

237
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:09,940
because in the old ones there was a cali

238
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:11,500
image for it but if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into X</font>

239
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:12,970
Windows you could hardly use it so it

240
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:17,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">was really only usable from the command</font>

241
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:20,970
line so was the first change then just

242
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:23,739
last week<font color="#CCCCCC"> Raspberry Pi</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 3s were announced</font>

243
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:26,550
this currently isn't running those

244
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:32,920
I don't have images yet for those but

245
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:36,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">that that's for future engagement for</font>

246
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:40,839
networking again I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> originally using</font>

247
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:42,760
a small ethernet switch I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

248
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:44,350
simulate actual attacks where you're

249
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:47,850
going from<font color="#E5E5E5"> one house to another which is</font>

250
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:50,020
why they're two separate boxes in this

251
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:51,730
and so I felt it was important to have

252
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:53,350
some kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> network</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's why</font>

253
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:55,480
there was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a switch in there but again</font>

254
00:12:53,350 --> 00:13:00,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's another big wall wart on the power</font>

255
00:12:55,480 --> 00:13:02,440
supply and I didn't it just was kind of

256
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:05,860
ugly so I didn't like<font color="#CCCCCC"> it so I switched</font>

257
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:08,440
to Wi-Fi there are small little USB

258
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:10,390
powered Wi-Fi routers that you can get

259
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:13,990
there they're designed for hotel use

260
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:18,939
when you're on the road so you can hook

261
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:20,530
up to the hotel<font color="#E5E5E5"> Wi-Fi you can connect</font>

262
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:23,560
multiple devices that way without having

263
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:25,780
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> pay for that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of thing I use that</font>

264
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:29,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">for a little while but I found them to</font>

265
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:31,150
be quite unreliable they're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

266
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:35,620
designed for two devices to talk across

267
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:37,959
them so then I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just decided let's just</font>

268
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:41,590
use a crossover cable it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay well</font>

269
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:45,130
let's keep it simple and that<font color="#CCCCCC"> made that</font>

270
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:49,120
made a great<font color="#CCCCCC"> deal of sense also I stole</font>

271
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:54,970
the cable so hey it's free<font color="#E5E5E5"> thanks 801</font>

272
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:57,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">lapse for that all right thank you i</font>

273
00:13:54,970 --> 00:14:00,820
also have multiple<font color="#CCCCCC"> victim services</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> set</font>

274
00:13:57,550 --> 00:14:02,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">up and that's something that i still</font>

275
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:06,370
want to do but i think i'll tackle there

276
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:08,730
in a different matter again the victim

277
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:10,690
service<font color="#E5E5E5"> just uses a lamp stack i</font>

278
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:13,180
investigated for a little while the

279
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:16,450
Windows 10 IOT image for raspberry pi

280
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:18,189
there's some drawbacks to that one it's

281
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:20,890
not really running Windows 10 it's

282
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:22,430
effectively a sensor you have to connect

283
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:25,310
to it from another windows

288
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:39,170
interesting to see as the whole IOT

289

world evolves if they improve the

291
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,899
it enough that it can run<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a little</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of fun but right now it's not</font>

295
00:14:53,240 --> 00:15:02,839
usable enough to to be a good victim

296
00:14:56,690 --> 00:15:05,350
server for this so and also space that

297
00:15:02,839 --> 00:15:07,399
would have been another<font color="#E5E5E5"> Raspberry Pi and</font>

298
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:08,810
my wife was starting to look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> me a</font>

00:15:07,399 --> 00:15:10,130
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> weird when I had half a dozen</font>

00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:11,420
Raspberry Pi sticking around the house

301
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:16,089
and what are you doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> with all these</font>

302
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:16,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">things so I trimmed it down a little bit</font>

303
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:22,250
so what do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have today and you can</font>

304
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:25,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">come up and look at it later so right</font>

305
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:27,440
now there's two raspberry PI's<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font>

306
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:32,390
just velcro together and then to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

307
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:34,550
case crossover cable together with a USB

308
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:38,300
power supply everything in this is

309
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:40,010
running off a USB and again little

310
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:43,910
storage bins I just took out of a tackle

311
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:46,130
box that I have so in this I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got a</font>

312
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:47,689
little stories for memory cards etc and

313
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:51,020
I threw my law to pick stuff in there

314
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:57,200
which I think will be that's a fun

315
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:58,910
little tool that you can use for when

316
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:00,980
you put this in front of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a student you</font>

00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:02,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">know it's not just information security</font>

318
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:05,360
that we care about we care about

319
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:08,239
physical security to right so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

320
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:09,890
the lock picks in there and teach people

321
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:13,310
to be interested in locked it and it's

322
00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:15,079
all part of part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we do so it's</font>

323
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:17,779
not really factored into the cost of

324
00:16:15,079 --> 00:16:21,290
this but that's that's why I have it in

325
00:16:17,779 --> 00:16:24,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">the case today just I think it's a good</font>

326
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:27,819
corollary to the rest of you the kid

327
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:34,060
as you can see the the gaming displays

328
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:40,020
up there and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm using a wireless</font>

logitech keyboard mouse combo for i/o

330
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:44,160
and again everything that's physically

331
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:48,400
attached to the case is just using

332
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:50,380
industrial strength velcro just go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

333
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:56,530
your craft store and<font color="#E5E5E5"> find out it's</font>

334
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:59,050
pretty easy to get so raspberry pi 2 for

335
00:16:56,530 --> 00:17:02,140
the compute side and this will change to

336

<font color="#E5E5E5">they won't boot so the the raspbian the</font>

341
00:17:14,589 --> 00:17:17,010

342
00:17:15,849 --> 00:17:23,859
because you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to do all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

343
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:25,869
through raspbian or noobs the cali the

<font color="#CCCCCC">step of this probably is going to be the</font>

added security because<font color="#E5E5E5"> i thought that</font>

358
00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:08,379
was a fundamental thing and everybody

everybody that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talked to you about</font>

handcuffed to your wrist toolbox so

362
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:19,180
that's in there the the display i'm

363
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:20,510
using is from<font color="#CCCCCC"> gains thanks to grifter</font>

for telling me about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

365
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:27,830
to solve the few problems for me and

366
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:30,020
then the power source is from anchor and

367
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:32,120
I'll get a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit more into the</font>

368
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:41,180
power supplies because I've did run into

369
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:44,120
some issues there and then the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> bonus</font>

370
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:47,960
stuff in here are some practice locks

371
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:51,679
and lock picking a lock picks I still

372
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:54,490
have the USB Wi-Fi stuff in there so if

373
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:56,930
I'm out somewhere and I need to upgrade

374

a package<font color="#E5E5E5"> or something like that I've</font>

got that connectivity and you know you

376
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:06,500
want the fuzzy handcuffs on this that

00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:08,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">really just kind of seals in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hill so</font>

378
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:11,480
the the problems that I ran<font color="#E5E5E5"> into while</font>

379
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:16,520
building this one of the first things

00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:19,580
when when I built the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> final four</font>

381
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:23,870
more current form of this was finding

00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:27,379
reliable USB power to run<font color="#CCCCCC"> everything you</font>

383
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:29,600
will have to find one<font color="#CCCCCC"> that works I went</font>

384
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:31,400
through<font color="#E5E5E5"> about three that didn't I would</font>

385
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:34,760
plug two or three devices in and when I

386
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:37,730
plug that say that<font color="#CCCCCC"> third device it would</font>

387
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:41,750
dump it wasn't able to provide enough

388
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:43,550
power on each USB port to actually power

389
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:49,640
there as berry pies the display the wife

390
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:52,850
I'm that was probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> the biggest</font>

391
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:56,150
challenge when I decided to power

392
00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:59,810
everything via a USB was to to find a

393
00:19:56,150 --> 00:20:05,990
reliable power source the<font color="#CCCCCC"> power-on</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">procedure cali is very picky about both</font>

396
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:14,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">in this setup so you do have to power on</font>

397
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:18,080
the display first<font color="#E5E5E5"> before you power on</font>

398
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:23,379
the the cali box otherwise<font color="#E5E5E5"> it never</font>

399
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:23,379
picks up the signal from the hdmi and

400
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:29,659
also when you're powering down if you

401
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:31,520
don't gracefully power down cali it will

402
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:31,980
more than likely corrupt and you're

403
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:35,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to be</font>

404
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:38,610
building your cali box asking how<font color="#E5E5E5"> i know</font>

405
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:42,240
this happened several times I think I

00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:45,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">wore out a couple of micro SD cards the</font>

407
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:47,610

00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:06,090
very well could be the router that i

sorry the raspberry pi 2 has a fun

little it's not really<font color="#E5E5E5"> buggy it's just</font>

physics but if you take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a picture of it</font>

Raspberry Pi there's a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of fun</font>

426
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:40,919
little articles about a recommended that

427
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:42,660
you'd watch or read up on I don't know

428
00:21:40,919 --> 00:21:46,710
if the raspberry pi 3 is susceptible to

429
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:50,280
this the older ones are not<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think all</font>

430
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:51,720
the Raspberry Pi tues definitely are so

431
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:54,510
it's as something they keep in mind so

432
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:58,309
if you do like I am and and you want to

433
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:58,309
take some pictures for<font color="#CCCCCC"> your presentation</font>

434
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:01,830
you're going to be reinstalling cali

435
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:05,610
because we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going back to the other</font>

436
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:08,040
problem and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i was talking about ran into</font>

437
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:09,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">that a couple</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> times and the if you</font>

438
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:11,340
use<font color="#CCCCCC"> the TV</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and there's some valid</font>

439
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:12,840
reasons to use the TV rather than this

440
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:15,240
gaming monitor that will get into<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

441
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:18,928
don't lose the TV remote<font color="#CCCCCC"> i did for about</font>

442
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:21,270
three weeks and wound up under my couch

443
00:22:18,929 --> 00:22:27,240
got to thank my dog for that one I guess

444
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:30,720
but so<font color="#E5E5E5"> just uh I didn't find a good</font>

445
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:33,840
solution for that if you build one of

446
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:36,150
these I'm sure you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> find some way</font>

447
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:41,159
maybe any velcro it i use the ton of

448
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:43,880
in here so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> proof of concept finally</font>

449
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:48,870
got all the software up and running and

450
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:52,320
downloaded a lab from googling dvw a

451
00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:56,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">walkthrough because i'm not going to</font>

452
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:59,540
reinvent<font color="#CCCCCC"> the wheel there and started</font>

453
00:22:56,760 --> 00:23:01,800
running through the exercises in that

454
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:05,129
the one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the first things that I ran</font>

455
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:07,620
into the current release of cali for

456
00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:12,120
raspberry pi elise does not include some

457
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:15,239
basic packages specifically<font color="#E5E5E5"> crow wasn't</font>

458
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:16,530
in there and half of the little

459
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:19,080
walkthrough thing if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> were going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

460
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:23,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">use curl you could probably use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> w</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yet to</font>

461
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:27,629
but so you may need to install some

462
00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:29,520
packages packages yourself and you don't

463
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:32,730
absolutely have to use cali for this you

464
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:35,810
could use arch linux and do black arch

465
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:38,370
and something like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that as well but</font>

466
00:23:35,810 --> 00:23:41,070
again<font color="#CCCCCC"> i've only tested this with with</font>

467
00:23:38,370 --> 00:23:42,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">callie and with DV wa</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i think the</font>

468
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:46,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">problem that i ran</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into is the lab that</font>

469
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:50,580
i was<font color="#CCCCCC"> using actually was based off an</font>

470
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:52,610
older version a backtrack and so when

471
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:56,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">they change from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> backtracked cali they</font>

472
00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:58,530
changed some of their base repositories

473
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:00,780
i guess and that's why curl isn't in

474
00:23:58,530 --> 00:24:03,450
there so that's something that you'll

475
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:05,550
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do but a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the labs work</font>

476
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:08,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">because some of it is just URL</font>

477
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:11,129
manipulation for password changes things

478
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:13,550
like that I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> the that's the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> level</font>

479
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:15,540
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this web app is designed for is</font>

480
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:17,669
intentional vulnerabilities and there's

481
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:19,530
different levels of security that you

482
00:24:17,670 --> 00:24:21,750
can set the web app to and then the

483
00:24:19,530 --> 00:24:25,680
lowest ones it's using the dumbest

484
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:27,720
security practices you can so sometimes

485
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:31,110
you're just doing URL manipulation that

486
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:32,179
stuff is working<font color="#E5E5E5"> I didn't go through</font>

487
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:34,668
everything on the

488
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:36,200
the labs that I found but a lot of the

489
00:24:34,669 --> 00:24:40,249
world to walk through stuff that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I found</font>

490
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:44,409
work and to go forward<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this in the</font>

491
00:24:40,249 --> 00:24:46,639
future I definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to see labs</font>

492
00:24:44,409 --> 00:24:48,529
that are really on Rails that you can

493
00:24:46,639 --> 00:24:50,389
put<font color="#E5E5E5"> in front of somebody without any</font>

494
00:24:48,529 --> 00:24:53,990
background in this and they'll be able

495
00:24:50,389 --> 00:24:55,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do a lot of this again if you have</font>

496
00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:58,759
any interest in working with me on that

497
00:24:55,580 --> 00:25:04,158
please let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me know it I want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to make</font>

498
00:24:58,759 --> 00:25:07,999
<font color="#CCCCCC">this a more full fledged product going</font>

499
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:11,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">into the improvements I want to find</font>

500
00:25:07,999 --> 00:25:15,320
better or more i should say victim

501
00:25:11,389 --> 00:25:17,330
services<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'll throw together maybe an</font>

502
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:23,928
ftp service or<font color="#CCCCCC"> something like that you</font>

503
00:25:17,330 --> 00:25:26,408
can pull some passwords out of with TCP

504
00:25:23,929 --> 00:25:28,610
dump or something like that just other

505
00:25:26,409 --> 00:25:32,929
victim services I'd like to see other

506
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:34,340
than just<font color="#E5E5E5"> be D D bwa</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> metasploit able</font>

507
00:25:32,929 --> 00:25:39,799
which if you're not familiar with is a

508
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:42,289
intentionally<font color="#E5E5E5"> weak system that's an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> OVA</font>

509
00:25:39,799 --> 00:25:44,480
that you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> download to vm I'd like to</font>

510
00:25:42,289 --> 00:25:45,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">see that something like that ported to</font>

511
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:48,769
this that you can use<font color="#CCCCCC"> metasploit</font>

512
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:50,289
framework to attack it because there's

513
00:25:48,769 --> 00:25:53,210
tons<font color="#E5E5E5"> of laps out there for that as well</font>

514
00:25:50,289 --> 00:25:55,700
also because who doesn't love Lego and

515
00:25:53,210 --> 00:25:57,669
3d printers I figure instead of using

516
00:25:55,700 --> 00:26:00,919
just off the shelf cases for the

517
00:25:57,669 --> 00:26:02,809
raspberry PI's you know throw together

518
00:26:00,919 --> 00:26:05,659
something with lego that you can connect

519
00:26:02,809 --> 00:26:10,009
both of the raspberry PI's together or

520
00:26:05,659 --> 00:26:12,919
3d print something again I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make</font>

521
00:26:10,009 --> 00:26:15,679
a better guided lab I want I want

522
00:26:12,919 --> 00:26:20,179
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is very approachable</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to a</font>

523
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:23,659
young audience I really feel that the

524
00:26:20,179 --> 00:26:25,999
end goal for this project is something

525
00:26:23,659 --> 00:26:30,950
that you put in<font color="#E5E5E5"> front of kids yeah a</font>

00:26:25,999 --> 00:26:32,419

529
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:40,580
better geared for that most of the most

530
00:26:38,629 --> 00:26:43,279
of the labs that I've seen are more gear

531
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:47,620
for people<font color="#CCCCCC"> with a little stronger</font>

USB battery packs that's out there if

545
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:22,250
they can jumpstart a car that can

546
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:26,299
probably power this for a little bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

547

548
00:27:26,299 --> 00:27:34,279
for real portability so it does running

<font color="#E5E5E5">off of one plug which is great but how</font>

550
00:27:34,279 --> 00:27:38,840
about zero plugs<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that would be</font>

553
00:27:43,850 --> 00:27:48,559
would give it that portability that you

could take it<font color="#E5E5E5"> out it doesn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> matter</font>

further and go in the future and any

in front of other people and the sky's

00:29:15,570 --> 00:29:20,370
the limit on this as far as where it

584
00:29:17,670 --> 00:29:23,670
could go particularly in the victim

585
00:29:20,370 --> 00:29:25,409
services site there's millions of

586

applications out there a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> run</font>

587
00:29:25,410 --> 00:29:33,810
on Linux there's no reason they couldn't

588
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:36,090
run on the Raspberry Pi and the I really

589
00:29:33,810 --> 00:29:38,790
think that a lot more work can be done

590
00:29:36,090 --> 00:29:42,360
on that side and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's where where I'm</font>

591
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:44,070
going to work in the future also there

592
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:46,080
are ways that you can cut prices on

593
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:48,110
these I want to make this<font color="#E5E5E5"> approachable</font>

594
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:50,550
and affordable for people to build<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

595
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:52,919
there's several way or several places

596
00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:56,129
that you can cut significant costs out

597
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:58,740
of this the original TV that I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> using</font>

598
00:29:56,130 --> 00:30:00,780
in this rant about 99 bucks and I was

599
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:04,250
this play is far and away the most

600
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:04,250
expensive<font color="#E5E5E5"> part of all this by the way</font>

601
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:12,420
the gaming display that I'm running now

602
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:15,420
that is 170 so you can save significant

603
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:18,360
costs right there there are also some

604
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:19,590

616
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:53,750
that removes half of the cost of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:58,530
you can use the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Raspberry Pi zero</font>

619
00:30:56,120 --> 00:31:02,219
Raspberry Pi zero came out

620
00:30:58,530 --> 00:31:05,670
four or five months ago it runs five

621
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:09,930
dollars and so the 35 or so dollars for

622
00:31:05,670 --> 00:31:12,330
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Raspberry Pi there are some extra</font>

624
00:31:12,330 --> 00:31:19,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">have a built-in network port so you'll</font>

625
00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:21,690
have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use like an OTG cable and then a</font>

626
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:24,360
network adapter it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit more</font>

627
00:31:21,690 --> 00:31:26,580
as far as moving parts drives the price

628
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:27,990
up a little bit more because all of the

629
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:29,699
peripherals for the Raspberry Pi zero

630
00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:32,460
cost about as much as<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Raspberry Pi</font>

631
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:37,530
zero OTG cable is the same amount cases

632
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:39,600
the same amount but it's also there you

633
00:31:37,530 --> 00:31:41,250
can omit the toolbox you don't need<font color="#E5E5E5"> it I</font>

634
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:42,780
just felt that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was kind of a fun</font>

635
00:31:41,250 --> 00:31:46,310
little gimmick and kept everything else

636
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:48,420
self-contained save a couple bucks there

637
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:51,360
also on the compute side there are

638
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:53,670
alternatives<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the Raspberry Pi the</font>

use a different<font color="#E5E5E5"> display you could do set</font>

the cable mess inside the box there are

a couple bucks stole the ethernet cable

729
00:36:05,090 --> 00:36:09,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">I highly recommend doing that wherever</font>

you can even<font color="#CCCCCC"> the cables you shouldn't</font>

00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:15,470
buy them hdmi cable it's a little one

00:36:15,470 --> 00:36:23,209
bucks the logitech k400 keyboard it's a

734
00:36:20,390 --> 00:36:26,600
really great keyboard last week or<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

735
00:36:23,210 --> 00:36:29,030
week before somebody disclosed some nice

736
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:33,470
vulnerabilities for that so if you do

737
00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:36,200
buy any wireless non bluetooth keyboard

738
00:36:33,470 --> 00:36:38,270
go see if it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of the affected ones</font>

739
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:39,919
upgrade<font color="#E5E5E5"> your firmware if it's a logitech</font>

740
00:36:38,270 --> 00:36:41,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">or Microsoft they're the only two</font>

741
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:43,790
vendors I've seen that have upgraded

742
00:36:41,330 --> 00:36:46,100
firmware for it something to keep in

743
00:36:43,790 --> 00:36:49,520
mind you know who<font color="#E5E5E5"> knows where we're</font>

744
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:51,440
going to see attacks against next I was

745
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:52,970
a little surprised to<font color="#CCCCCC"> see that one I'm</font>

746
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:56,480
not surprised but a little dismayed i

747
00:36:52,970 --> 00:37:03,500
guess everything that you see here save

748
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:05,119
the the USB router and lock picks<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm in</font>

under 370

750
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:10,529
so for less than a price<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the laptop</font>

751
00:37:08,189 --> 00:37:13,618
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> build all this and its really</font>

752
00:37:10,529 --> 00:37:15,059
extensible you can you don't have to

this needs a little bit more

00:40:03,230 --> 00:40:08,450
investigation on my part to see why or

something like that if you needed a pull

really<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to see you go that way</font>

820
00:40:48,530 --> 00:40:52,100
particularly with the raspberry pi 3

add a another Wi-Fi card to the mix

00:42:04,810 --> 00:42:10,029
that you can run to download everything

843
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:15,069
and build a cali image on top of as

844
00:42:10,030 --> 00:42:18,400
being not yet<font color="#E5E5E5"> i don't suspect there will</font>

845
00:42:15,070 --> 00:42:22,300
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the limitations of USB</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

846
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:25,150
power it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a USB 3 power supply</font>

847
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:28,390
requirement and i just plugged it<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

848
00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:30,310
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> i was testing it i just plugged it</font>

849
00:42:28,390 --> 00:42:35,319
directly into<font color="#CCCCCC"> my existing infrastructure</font>

850
00:42:30,310 --> 00:42:38,020
and it works yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can install raspbian</font>

851
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:42,340
on it and get it to work that way but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

852
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:43,930
haven't run any any scripts to try and

853
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:45,610
build cali or anything like that yet but

854
00:42:43,930 --> 00:42:49,589
power wise there should be no

855
00:42:45,610 --> 00:42:49,590
differences yes

856
00:42:53,710 --> 00:42:57,369
don't know I'm an old-school networking

857
00:42:55,540 --> 00:43:00,640
guys so the first thing came to mine<font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

858
00:42:57,369 --> 00:43:02,530
a crossover cable I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think they're</font>

859
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:05,319
10 I don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> their gig I think there</font>

860
00:43:02,530 --> 00:43:07,450
are 10 100 so they probably don't auto

861
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:13,270
switch would be my<font color="#CCCCCC"> errata since would be</font>

862
00:43:07,450 --> 00:43:17,470
my yes but I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know anything else</font>

863
00:43:13,270 --> 00:43:20,710
anyone well I'll be kicking around up

864
00:43:17,470 --> 00:43:22,720
here I think we got<font color="#E5E5E5"> a few minutes if</font>

865
00:43:20,710 --> 00:43:24,520
anyone wants to see it unfortunately

866
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:27,609
apparently someone stole the dongle for

867
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:32,410
my keyboard because it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in there</font>

868
00:43:27,609 --> 00:43:35,380
and it was earlier so I can't actually

869
00:43:32,410 --> 00:43:38,319
log into my Kelly box so when I power it

870
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:39,849
down I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have to reimage it but</font>

871
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:41,859
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of see how I've got</font>

872
00:43:39,849 --> 00:43:47,760

873
00:43:41,859 --> 00:43:47,759
and happy to walk through it<font color="#E5E5E5"> thanks</font>
