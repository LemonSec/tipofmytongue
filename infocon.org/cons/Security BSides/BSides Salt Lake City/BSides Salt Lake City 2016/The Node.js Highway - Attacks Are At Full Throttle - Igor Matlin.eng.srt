1
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:19,169
communication resources and faster and

2
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:21,539
more reliable I children walking<font color="#CCCCCC"> around</font>

3
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:25,140
so nobody's<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to see me in a wet</font>

4
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:28,320
t-shirt don't worry but we're going to

5
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:31,349
play a<font color="#CCCCCC"> game</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and the winner will get a</font>

6
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:34,530
t-shirt not this particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> one but just</font>

7
00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:35,489
like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> one we will talk about if we</font>

8
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:38,629
have time we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to talk about</font>

9
00:00:35,489 --> 00:00:42,780
potential risks of developing nodejs

10
00:00:38,629 --> 00:00:46,489
although this is not the prime goal of

11
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:50,489
the presentation<font color="#E5E5E5"> well we have 30 minutes</font>

12
00:00:46,489 --> 00:00:54,089
all right let's go how did we come up

13
00:00:50,489 --> 00:00:57,360
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the idea well a couple of my</font>

14
00:00:54,090 --> 00:01:01,340
colleagues actually wasn't me there were

15
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:03,989
it black hat<font color="#CCCCCC"> a couple of years ago they</font>

16
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:07,619
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're walking around and saw a big</font>

17
00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:10,970
wall with code snippets on it and a

18
00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:13,590
bunch of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> just staring it at wall</font>

19
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:15,390
it turns out they were looking trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

20
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:20,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">find vulnerabilities and in other</font>

21
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:24,810
people's code right have you ever seen

22
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:30,079
things like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that yeah it's pretty cool</font>

23
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:35,460
right now<font color="#CCCCCC"> at that same conference a</font>

24
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:39,179
study came out that bio asp no less that

25
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:41,179
the top of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> sea so concerns around</font>

26
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:45,869
the country around the world probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

27
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:49,140
that developers don't have a lot of

28
00:01:45,869 --> 00:01:50,729
security training they're not trained in

29
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:53,700
developing secure code there isn't

30
00:01:50,729 --> 00:02:00,930
enough awareness of the need to develop

31
00:01:53,700 --> 00:02:06,479
secure code so put one and one together

32
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:09,390
and we have a game of hacks website we

33
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:12,000
built a game for developers to test the

34
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:13,619
application security knowledge all right

35
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:18,629
we'll launched it

36
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:23,540
at again black cotton 2014 in the first

37
00:02:18,629 --> 00:02:26,280
24 hours<font color="#E5E5E5"> we had over 35,000 players</font>

38
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:28,739
responses really caught us by surprise

39
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:30,090
completely didn't think it was you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

40
00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:32,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">check marks is not really a big</font>

41
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:36,000
household name wouldn't command a whole

42
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:39,390
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of attention from media since then</font>

43
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,209
it's been over<font color="#E5E5E5"> 300,000 games played the</font>

44
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:46,890
game is<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually still up available</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> free</font>

45
00:02:42,209 --> 00:02:51,569
completely free no sign ups needed so

46
00:02:46,890 --> 00:03:01,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually let's take a look going to</font>

47
00:02:51,569 --> 00:03:05,010
switch to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the browser</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Scott works you</font>

48
00:03:01,379 --> 00:03:08,810
can play<font color="#CCCCCC"> our self you can charge your</font>

49
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:12,739
colleagues it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> always more fun and</font>

50
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:12,739
great should have done

51
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:30,380
kind of like some popular TV shows of

52
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:33,350
trivia games right<font color="#E5E5E5"> right you look at the</font>

53
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:37,700
code you pick<font color="#E5E5E5"> the answer that you think</font>

54
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:39,500
is correct well I can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really read</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

55
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:44,810
code I know<font color="#CCCCCC"> about you so I'm going to</font>

56
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:48,940
pick one and it's either right around by

57
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:51,440
the way this oops the answer was wrong

58
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:54,680
so the idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> course</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is to answer as</font>

59
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:56,930
many questions as you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can in the</font>

60
00:03:54,680 --> 00:04:01,070
shortest possible time<font color="#CCCCCC"> you get points</font>

61
00:03:56,930 --> 00:04:05,989
for doing that and if you win your name

62
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:09,079
is at the top of the leaderboard well

63
00:04:05,989 --> 00:04:13,670
what could go wrong right when you when

64
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:15,530
you invite when you kind of talk about

65
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:19,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">this at the hackers conference sorry the</font>

66
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:28,460
black hat invite hackers to play game

67
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:31,299
against other side so let's see I'm

68
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:34,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to go back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> presentation I</font>

69
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:40,850
do encourage you to check that game out

70
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:45,050
right so what else was behind this

71
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:48,220
development it wasn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> just the game we</font>

72
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:53,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually developed it using new to us</font>

73
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:57,050
techniques at the moment we wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

74
00:04:53,210 --> 00:05:00,080
extend our services to cover nodejs for

75
00:04:57,050 --> 00:05:03,110
example so we use no GS nodejs was nude

76
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:07,580
to our development team I will still

77
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:10,610
decided that the game definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font>

78
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:12,770
be attacked right so we try to plant a

79
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:16,700
few honey pots to see what the hackers

80
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:19,549
would go after first not everything

81
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:24,020
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> was planned on purpose I admit</font>

82
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:28,810
some things did surprise us but so let's

83
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:28,810
talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about what happened right</font>

84
00:05:29,969 --> 00:05:37,300
these are<font color="#CCCCCC"> some messages from a from the</font>

85
00:05:32,919 --> 00:05:39,849
message boards right see<font color="#E5E5E5"> that some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

86
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:44,129
this was not very<font color="#E5E5E5"> flattering some was</font>

87
00:05:39,849 --> 00:05:47,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay but these are kind of high scores</font>

88
00:05:44,129 --> 00:05:52,000
notice<font color="#E5E5E5"> the problem none of these class</font>

89
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:56,530
scores look real I can get<font color="#E5E5E5"> that much let</font>

90
00:05:52,000 --> 00:06:00,430
me<font color="#E5E5E5"> get points so let's see how how this</font>

91
00:05:56,530 --> 00:06:02,138
happened<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'd said game of Fox</font>

92
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:05,849
architecture there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> web client</font>

93
00:06:02,139 --> 00:06:09,639
JavaScript web client there's no GS on

94
00:06:05,849 --> 00:06:14,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">the server hosted by Heroku scores our</font>

95
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:18,879
users are kept on a MongoDB database

96
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:21,210
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple right that anybody</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> has apps</font>

97
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:31,569
that that look similar to this one

98
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:34,210
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> not that uncommon on the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actual</font>

99
00:06:31,569 --> 00:06:38,860
client page you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have question you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

100
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:40,479
question you have source code you know

101
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:45,240
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> object of the question you have the</font>

102
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:51,219
question itself answers count score

103
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:54,069
difficulty level in the timer pretty

104
00:06:51,219 --> 00:06:57,669
<font color="#CCCCCC">simple these all kind of objects in the</font>

105
00:06:54,069 --> 00:07:02,830
client-side JavaScript so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first</font>

106
00:06:57,669 --> 00:07:06,240
problem was that wouldn't actually keep

107
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:10,719
track of which answers were answered

108
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:13,629
right so what happened was that there

109
00:07:10,719 --> 00:07:17,650
was a call back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the server to submit</font>

110
00:07:13,629 --> 00:07:19,960
an answer turned out<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can actually</font>

111
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:26,109
call this over and over again I didn't

112
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:29,109
have to to run the client so once you

113
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:31,629
figure out the right answer you can just

114
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:35,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">call</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it and call it and call it and get</font>

115
00:07:31,629 --> 00:07:35,400
points and get points and get points

116
00:07:35,939 --> 00:07:42,780
what's the mitigation well you actually

117
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:45,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">had a flag whether the sensors been</font>

118
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:48,210
submitted or not and so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> prevents</font>

119
00:07:45,129 --> 00:07:53,800
somebody from trying multiple times

120
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:55,900
seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of logical but oh so it's</font>

121
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:57,789
good to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have somebody else find it for</font>

122
00:07:55,900 --> 00:08:04,780
you right interesting makes life

123
00:07:57,789 --> 00:08:07,060
interesting timer in in the first

124
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:09,008
version of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the app the timer was handled</font>

125
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:13,120
by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the client side JavaScript you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

126
00:08:09,009 --> 00:08:15,849
<font color="#CCCCCC">its 60-second timer you you put your</font>

127
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:18,550
submit n surplus time spent on the

128
00:08:15,849 --> 00:08:27,310
answer as part of the request to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

129
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:29,949
server what could possibly<font color="#CCCCCC"> go wrong well</font>

130
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:32,320
JavaScript if you know on runs on the

131
00:08:29,949 --> 00:08:34,329
client doesn't really take a whole lot

132
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:41,229
to modify the JavaScript which runs on

133
00:08:34,328 --> 00:08:44,969
the client so you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> submit a time that</font>

134
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:51,310
you want with your answer right negative

135
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:59,170
very very low it was all been I was all

136
00:08:51,310 --> 00:09:03,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">built being done by um by users so app</font>

137
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:07,479
send ANSWER Answer one and time spent

138
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:11,170
negative billion or whatever<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's ten</font>

139
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:13,209
billion so you see the hacker community

140
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:15,990
is very helpful right it kind of tell

141
00:09:13,209 --> 00:09:18,518
each other how to how to hack the game

142
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:21,850
it's pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool so we had to modify the</font>

143
00:09:18,519 --> 00:09:24,630
game a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit and start competing</font>

144
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:28,600
time on the server there's certainly

145
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:32,380
possibility for a lag being introduced

146
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:34,690
all right but now<font color="#E5E5E5"> with decent Wi-Fi and</font>

147
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:39,850
decent direct connection that's typical

148
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:42,760
not an issue right keep that<font color="#CCCCCC"> in mind for</font>

149
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:46,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">your own development this is a soul for</font>

150
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:46,050
your benefit

151
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:51,180
now what else now these are kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

152
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:56,190
things we thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> about writing in</font>

153
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:59,459
advance but there's the interesting find

154
00:09:56,190 --> 00:10:00,900
that somebody did and you play this game

155
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:04,950
and it actually there's a

156
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:07,050
mobile-friendly website too if you play

157
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:08,910
it on an iPhone you're going to call

158
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:12,300
down<font color="#E5E5E5"> your finger to the word web browser</font>

159
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:15,089
and it stops the time so you can pause

160
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:18,209
figure out the correct answer and then

161
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:22,770
click it now that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have to say I really</font>

162
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:28,230
would get no clue to expect couldn't

163
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:31,170
expect that some hacking the hack<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

164
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:32,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">right so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I mentioned the contest this is</font>

171
00:10:47,430 --> 00:11:00,750
line of code nobody admits to that but

172
00:10:57,210 --> 00:11:04,380
that's fine so we'll find out a promise

173

192
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:19,329
selected one of the answers sorry don't

193
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:23,439
try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use your back button</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay let's</font>

204
00:14:42,649 --> 00:14:49,089
don't you<font color="#E5E5E5"> two make the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> code larger hard</font>

205
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:49,089
to see<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

206
00:14:53,580 --> 00:15:03,280
all right nicely done everybody what's

207
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:09,209
the key combination to zoom in somebody

208
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:19,030
remember ctrl + is that control shift<font color="#E5E5E5"> +</font>

209
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:26,290
you know all right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> think might be</font>

210
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:30,670
better oh wait I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not playing well that</font>

211
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:41,670
happen<font color="#E5E5E5"> well namesake in the audience</font>

212
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:41,670
great is it better back there a little

213
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:52,350
so the previous one was<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty simple</font>

214
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:55,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">right there was a format string so no</font>

215
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:58,560
check what kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of format string you are</font>

216
00:15:55,710 --> 00:16:09,540
using the<font color="#CCCCCC"> for unformatted uncontrolled</font>

217
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:12,359
format strangers to vulnerability path

218
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:17,520
traversal anybody tell me<font color="#E5E5E5"> what can</font>

219
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:19,440
happen when you do that you can open any

220
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:23,069
file you want you can overwrite any file

221
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:25,860
you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically whatever the</font>

222
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:33,510
privilege level of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your application so</font>

223
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:40,730
what happens serious stuff all<font color="#E5E5E5"> right hey</font>

224
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:40,730
what happened to you or can do better

225
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:58,680
then you pay actual remember this very

226
00:16:52,290 --> 00:17:00,449
politically incorrect cartoon<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok I don't</font>

227
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:08,040
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> I never I don't think my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kids</font>

228
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:11,250
actually I've ever seen that bonus

229
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:16,339
question what's the what's the mouse

230
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:16,339
named there you go good

231
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:28,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">All Right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we have a clear winner</font>

232
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:42,300
ah this is nice the questions by the way

233
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:43,500
our random out of the database so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

234
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:47,340
don't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what's what's going to</font>

235
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:49,290
be next every<font color="#E5E5E5"> time I play save save with</font>

236
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:53,490
game of hacks there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> big database of</font>

237
00:17:49,290 --> 00:18:02,670
questions and now it's some sort of

238
00:17:53,490 --> 00:18:04,710
random order I'll have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> say these are</font>

239
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:12,390
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a beginner level questions right</font>

240
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:21,210
right ah how many of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you got confused by</font>

241
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:30,290
all the sequel statements in there there

242
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:33,180
you go Igor's pretty close<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting so oh</font>

243
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:39,930
you know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I should have talked about</font>

244
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:44,160
that when<font color="#E5E5E5"> client randomizes the how the</font>

245
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:46,350
answer order right actually the server

246
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:49,680
sends the questions the client and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

247
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:53,870
client presents them in random order in

248
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:57,060
order to<font color="#E5E5E5"> prevent script script running</font>

249
00:18:53,870 --> 00:19:00,209
right if the client does it there's no

250
00:18:57,060 --> 00:19:02,240
way for the server to match what was not

251
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:08,510
was number one what was number two Oh

252
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:12,810
ABC whatever it is but you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know good</font>

253
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:15,170
good try questions there you go things

254
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:15,169
back on track

255
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:24,429
so where should we validate the answer

256
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:32,920
any cultural references<font color="#E5E5E5"> in here</font>

257
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:53,750
that should be easy right right those

258
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:55,970
are because that server good answer this

259
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:59,660
that client think of<font color="#E5E5E5"> what could happen</font>

260
00:19:55,970 --> 00:20:04,809
right what happened to our game of hacks

261
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:04,809
right you can submit any answer you want

262
00:20:06,910 --> 00:20:14,320
and I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have the last now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> next to</font>

263
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,320
last

264
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:40,530
I think this might<font color="#E5E5E5"> be the code snippet</font>

265
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:42,480
straight from our game you just<font color="#CCCCCC"> had to</font>

266
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:44,850
pay<font color="#CCCCCC"> attention we didn't really have to</font>

267
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:52,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">look at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the code have to say check the</font>

268
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:56,070
pay attention to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> presentation and</font>

269
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:59,780
now you also have to pay attention<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

flaws in the app<font color="#E5E5E5"> that sort of allowed</font>

hackers to to to to hack the app on<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

287
00:22:34,129 --> 00:22:39,830
really want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say hat but abused or</font>

288
00:22:37,789 --> 00:22:41,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">bypassed the verification of the rules</font>

289
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:44,480
so what are things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that you should</font>

290
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:49,370
remember about programming<font color="#E5E5E5"> no GS in</font>

291
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:52,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">general nodejs is a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> single-threaded has</font>

292
00:22:49,370 --> 00:22:56,570
single<font color="#E5E5E5"> ferret architecture there's an</font>

293
00:22:52,129 --> 00:23:02,269
event loop that calls out<font color="#E5E5E5"> workers to do</font>

294
00:22:56,570 --> 00:23:04,220
actual job for non-programmers among you

295
00:23:02,269 --> 00:23:08,269
this is the metaphor right there's a

296
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:11,960
single<font color="#E5E5E5"> thread order taker and maybe</font>

297
00:23:08,269 --> 00:23:14,029
several people who go around and fulfill

298
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:19,730
the orders the problem is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> if the</font>

299
00:23:14,029 --> 00:23:23,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">single thread is busy right the order</font>

300
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:25,610
taker is busy there are no<font color="#E5E5E5"> more orders</font>

301
00:23:23,179 --> 00:23:32,629
coming in and customers aren't being

302
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:35,449
served so the attack is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the denial of</font>

303
00:23:32,629 --> 00:23:38,529
service I see not everybody is laughing

304
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:44,629
but you should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so actually</font>

305
00:23:38,529 --> 00:23:48,350
kind of a very appropriate a picture

306
00:23:44,629 --> 00:23:54,789
here now every simple piece<font color="#CCCCCC"> of code like</font>

307
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:57,649
that with sufficiently large bound

308
00:23:54,789 --> 00:24:04,809
boundary condition can actually hold up

309
00:23:57,649 --> 00:24:07,668
your kick-ass machine for yep seconds

310
00:24:04,809 --> 00:24:10,870
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> typically enough to do denial</font>

311
00:24:07,669 --> 00:24:15,909
of service if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> do it on a large scale</font>

312
00:24:10,870 --> 00:24:18,408
so the key is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not to put any</font>

313
00:24:15,909 --> 00:24:21,529
computationally intensive code inside

314
00:24:18,409 --> 00:24:22,850
the main thread and no GS so first thing

315
00:24:21,529 --> 00:24:27,740
that you

316
00:24:22,850 --> 00:24:32,270
probably get burned on but yet people

317
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:36,410
still get burned on it and I guess the

318
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:38,030
protection also is to verify any input

319
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:48,430
especially if these boundary conditions

320
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:53,060
come from user as my eyes 3pm here<font color="#E5E5E5"> well</font>

321
00:24:48,430 --> 00:24:56,780
yes okay well we'll we'll run quickly

322
00:24:53,060 --> 00:25:02,030
from a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> others just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually 11</font>

323
00:24:56,780 --> 00:25:04,930
so another interesting thing about no GS

324
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:08,300
is that it's all JSON based right<font color="#CCCCCC"> um</font>

325
00:25:04,930 --> 00:25:10,520
language you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can do queries against</font>

326
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:13,040
databases based on<font color="#E5E5E5"> JSON objects you can</font>

327
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:18,290
you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> easily manipulate</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> JSON object</font>

328
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:22,090
right so typically<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can use actual</font>

329
00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:24,649
JSON values for the fine method now this

330
00:25:22,090 --> 00:25:27,260
if you do this let's say to validate a

331
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:31,390
username<font color="#E5E5E5"> and password it's very easy to</font>

332
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:34,100
bypass this<font color="#E5E5E5"> this validation by supplying</font>

333
00:25:31,390 --> 00:25:37,490
something that actually looks will be

334
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:41,120
interpreted<font color="#CCCCCC"> by by the database as a code</font>

335
00:25:37,490 --> 00:25:44,750
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the conditions</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that will be</font>

336
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:48,260
interpreted<font color="#E5E5E5"> by databases code so what do</font>

337
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:50,480
people do the typical defense<font color="#E5E5E5"> against</font>

338
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:53,510
this is to find<font color="#E5E5E5"> the user first and then</font>

339
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:58,940
compare it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to to the password stored for</font>

340
00:25:53,510 --> 00:26:04,750
that user but remembering that jace that

341
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:08,480
no GS is a single single threaded app

342
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:10,880
it's easy actual to supply a regex for

343
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:13,610
that last password parameter that will

344
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:16,100
hold up your server<font color="#E5E5E5"> by this big crib</font>

345
00:26:13,610 --> 00:26:20,620
compare hold up your server for a couple

346
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:23,810
seconds it's also not good leads to

347
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:26,239
denial of service rep regex to the

348
00:26:23,810 --> 00:26:32,120
health service sorry we didn't have much

349
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:36,100
time to to to<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go in details to this</font>

350
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:36,100
but a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of takeaways</font>

351
00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:40,870
applications application development is

352
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:43,710
difficult to secure application

353
00:26:40,870 --> 00:26:46,719
development is even more difficult

354
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:50,500
developers learn much better when they

355
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:54,280
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> part of a game right special if they</font>

356
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:57,490
compete with<font color="#CCCCCC"> each other so anytime you</font>

357
00:26:54,280 --> 00:27:01,510
have a chance to integrate elements of

358
00:26:57,490 --> 00:27:03,970
games into education take it and also

359
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:06,210
you know all different all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same</font>

360
00:27:03,970 --> 00:27:09,400
rules apply to programming in newer

361
00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:14,980
frameworks like no GS as they applied to

362
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:18,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">Java for example validate input and be</font>

363
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:25,600
careful with them with strings<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so</font>

364

this is it questions thank yous<font color="#CCCCCC"> phrases</font>

00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:32,409
you know what's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> best</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do is</font>

366
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:37,170
to stop by our booth you can you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can win</font>
