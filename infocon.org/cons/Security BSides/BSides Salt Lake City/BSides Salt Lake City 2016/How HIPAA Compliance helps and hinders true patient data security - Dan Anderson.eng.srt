super<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so we want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk a</font>

16
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:10,500
little bit about HIPAA today all right

17
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:15,298
and why it sort of works and sort of

18
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:19,470
doesn't work i have this fun disclaimer

19
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:21,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">i can't think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of anything that's not</font>

20
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:27,689
covered there but if you can let me<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

21
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:29,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">and i'll add to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it later okay so this is</font>

22
00:01:27,689 --> 00:01:31,258
basically my thoughts and

23
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,960
representations so it doesn't represent

24
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:38,939
my employer that's important to know or

25
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:42,600
employers or customers or friends

26
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:46,289
unknown alien aliens so a little bit

27
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:49,020
about me gosh I've been doing this stuff

28
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:51,240
for quite a while so how do you how do

29
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:54,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">you get into how do you become a HIPAA</font>

30
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:57,839
security expert I always like to ask my

31
00:01:54,930 --> 00:02:00,119
peers how they did it because everyone's

32
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">got a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bit different story my</font>

33
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:06,680
story<font color="#E5E5E5"> is I came</font>

34
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:10,250
from had a background in the in the US

35
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:14,959
Air Force<font color="#E5E5E5"> and eventually found my way</font>

36
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:16,310
into the medical realm and ended up

37
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:19,310
consulting at a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> different</font>

38
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:23,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">hospitals and so doing big installations</font>

39
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:26,900
and so I had an eye towards security and

40
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:32,510
about that time in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> late 90s HIPAA</font>

41
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:34,489
was forming and coming about and and

42
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:36,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">people would ask me well you have a</font>

43
00:02:34,489 --> 00:02:38,270
background you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> about security what</font>

44
00:02:36,709 --> 00:02:39,620
what do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we should do here what</font>

45
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:42,230
do you think we should do there and so

46
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:44,480
before long I became a HIPAA security

47
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:46,459
expert not because I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> certified it's</font>

48
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:49,130
just because I had some thoughts about

49
00:02:46,459 --> 00:02:52,519
security I had some training about

50
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:54,500
security and I touched<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of</font>

51
00:02:52,519 --> 00:03:02,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">different hospital systems and business</font>

52
00:02:54,500 --> 00:03:07,180
processes in hospitals so today let's

53
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:10,809
talk a little bit about what<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

54
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:13,850
happens with HIPAA what's entailed their

55
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:15,820
security risk assessments the rule

56
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:18,290
enforcement I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to get into that</font>

57
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:23,440
what are the important elements of a

58
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:26,480
risk assessment some tips and takeaways

59
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:31,070
I've added a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> I presented this</font>

60
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:32,869
talk most of this talk at st.<font color="#E5E5E5"> con so if</font>

61
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:34,190
you if you've seen it before please bear

62
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:35,959
with me because there's some things

63
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:38,420
towards the end that I think you'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> find</font>

64
00:03:35,959 --> 00:03:41,390
interesting how to depend<font color="#E5E5E5"> on yourself</font>

65
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:47,929
for HIPAA Security something I want to

66
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:50,450
talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay as I go through this if</font>

67
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:52,489
you have questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> or thoughts or you</font>

68
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:55,548
want to heckle please feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> free to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

69
00:03:52,489 --> 00:03:58,820
that I love all those things it's a lot

70
00:03:55,549 --> 00:04:00,970
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> fun to come and be able to talk about</font>

71
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:03,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you're passionate about</font>

72
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:06,739
I've been challenged to see how many

73
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:10,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">times I can drop the f-bomb so as i did</font>

74
00:04:06,739 --> 00:04:13,040
my some work with hockey over the years

75
00:04:10,849 --> 00:04:15,119
and some of the training that I've had

76
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:17,399
there they told us a lot

77
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,829
that especially at the high level when

78
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:22,289
we were hearing from the NHL<font color="#E5E5E5"> coaches you</font>

79
00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:24,360
should swear a lot you should<font color="#E5E5E5"> drop the</font>

80
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:27,090
f-bomb a lot so so we'll see how<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

81
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:31,290
goes I like to<font color="#CCCCCC"> hold that back just a bit</font>

82
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:33,419
usually so there's a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of</font>

83
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:36,000
confusion and there's all these great

84
00:04:33,419 --> 00:04:41,010
numbers right and<font color="#CCCCCC"> parentheses and sub</font>

85
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:43,919
<font color="#CCCCCC">parenthesis and sub numbers so so the</font>

86
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:47,610
security rule is about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the risk analysis</font>

87
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:51,090
the Privacy Rule talks about the

88
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:53,760
safeguards the breach notification rule

89
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:57,419
is a separate thing and they<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of all</font>

90
00:04:53,760 --> 00:05:01,349
blend into one<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing and and so</font>

91
00:04:57,419 --> 00:05:04,370
sometimes it's not always apparent which

92
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:04,370
thing is in scope

93
00:05:09,669 --> 00:05:14,479
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I love this this quote security risk</font>

94
00:05:12,949 --> 00:05:17,840
assessments are the cornerstone of

95
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:23,080
compliance<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and that was from Jana</font>

96
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:23,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">Ileana Peters she's with the HHS</font>

97
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:29,299
actually it's a good cornerstone of any

98
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:31,820
any security program doesn't have to be

99
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:33,199
<font color="#CCCCCC">specific to HIPAA you want you to want</font>

100
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:37,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do a risk assessment and know where</font>

101
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:39,350
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> at but it's a start on the road</font>

102
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:43,729
right you put your foot on the pathway

103
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:51,020
and you know you start to identify

104
00:05:43,729 --> 00:05:53,659
things that you can fix or work on so

105
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:55,280
today in the breaches there's only two

106
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:59,180
kinds of companies those that have been

107
00:05:55,280 --> 00:06:02,388
breached and those those that don't even

108
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:05,229
yet know they've been breached so we're

109
00:06:02,389 --> 00:06:07,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to talk about breach a little bit</font>

110
00:06:05,229 --> 00:06:10,669
ninety-seven percent of organizations

111
00:06:07,669 --> 00:06:14,570
were breached from fire I and Mandy at

112
00:06:10,669 --> 00:06:15,889
2014 that's a pretty bold statement so

113
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:18,550
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of companies out there</font>

114
00:06:15,889 --> 00:06:24,650
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> may not know their breached yet</font>

115
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:26,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so I also love this Pope a breach</font>

116
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:30,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">gets you on our visit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> list right and</font>

117
00:06:26,659 --> 00:06:32,750
nobody really<font color="#E5E5E5"> wants that from the HHS</font>

118
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:34,570
non-compliance gets us<font color="#CCCCCC"> to stay and</font>

119
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:38,440
there's probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> nothing worse than</font>

120
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:41,990
having them come and<font color="#CCCCCC"> hang around and</font>

121
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:46,840
audit you and monitor you and then

122
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:46,840
continue that process and be<font color="#E5E5E5"> very costly</font>

123
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:56,599
so cyber attacks are on the rise you all

124
00:06:51,139 --> 00:07:02,659
know this okay seventy-five percent of

125
00:06:56,599 --> 00:07:08,300
networks are owned I don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a</font>

126
00:07:02,659 --> 00:07:11,330
high number that's also 1970 jargon so

127
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:14,030
the defense in depth is something that's

128
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:17,500
worked for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a while</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and if you're a</font>

129
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:20,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">little more secluded like we are in Utah</font>

130
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:21,720
that goes<font color="#E5E5E5"> to our advantage and it kind</font>

131
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:23,700
of goes to our<font color="#E5E5E5"> disadvantage because</font>

132
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:26,190
nothing ever bad happens in utah right

133
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:27,860
we're all good people there's no hackers

134
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:30,780
here nobody's trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to steal our money</font>

135
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:33,960
but then there's that internet thing

136
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:35,849
we're connected<font color="#CCCCCC"> to it and so now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

137
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:39,989
everybody that you're connected to<font color="#CCCCCC"> may</font>

138
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:42,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">be in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> utah so I like this the average</font>

139
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:47,010
goes 229 days without really being

140
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:49,050
detected<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so some of the people I</font>

141
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:51,210
travel around with if you allow them to

142
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:53,970
go undetected in your network for 229

143
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:55,950
days it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to be a very</font>

144
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:58,440
fun time for you they're going to

145
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:59,670
exfiltrate data they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

146
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:02,730
kinds of things they're going to create

147
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:04,560
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of persistence and back doors and</font>

148
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:15,030
they're going to constantly have ways in

149
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:18,990
so that's a long time big<font color="#E5E5E5"> cost to take</font>

150
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:20,789
care<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this so what's going on so it's</font>

151
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:23,400
trending downward so we're finding

152
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:25,560
things a little bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> earlier right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I was</font>

153
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:28,799
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> at RSA last week this is with a lot</font>

154
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:30,270
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> vendors so a lot of the tricks and</font>

155
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,640
tools and things that were put into

156
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:37,079
place or the companies do put into place

157
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:39,419
help so defense in depth is something

158
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:42,930
you don't just give up on so it helps

159
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:46,410
but still that's a long time I don't

160
00:08:42,929 --> 00:08:53,189
have a number 4 2015 yet or nothing

161
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:56,850
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> for 2016 I think it's pretty</font>

162
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:58,740
interesting that you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find</font>

163
00:08:56,850 --> 00:09:00,540
out from the outside so you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

164
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:02,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">find out from social</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> media you're going</font>

165
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:04,410
to find out if you're monitoring maybe

166
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:05,730
the dark web all right you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

167
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:08,610
find out you'll get a call from the FBI

168
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:13,520
hey you might want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at this or we</font>

169
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:13,520
discovered this not really very fun day

170
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:22,890
you guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> like these things the bubbles</font>

171
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:26,820
in the words<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay here's spent some of</font>

172
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:28,680
our biggest breaches so far ebay JP JP

173
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:29,370
Morgan right the bigger the book the

174
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:33,270
bigger the

175
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:35,640
the bigger the breach home depot we just

176
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:38,189
recently heard Home Depot had set aside

177
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:42,420
some monies for settlement and

178
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:46,500
remediation<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay it's happening in</font>

179
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:48,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">health care Jay alluded earlier in his</font>

180
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:51,710
talk to the Hollywood Presbyterian

181
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:55,260
breach boy did that create some fun

182
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:59,310
around my neck of the woods lots of

183
00:09:55,260 --> 00:10:07,410
discussion<font color="#CCCCCC"> some maturity levels let's</font>

184
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:09,300
talk about that a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit basically</font>

185
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:12,300
what you have to decide is how how good

186
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:16,410
do you need to be so do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to just</font>

187
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:18,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">be better than your neighbor so if my</font>

00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:20,750
day jobs at Intermountain Healthcare do

189
00:10:18,089 --> 00:10:27,420
I just need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be better than the you or</font>

190
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:30,240
I asus or morning star but I'm connected

191
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:33,089
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the network maybe I need to be as</font>

192
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:35,779
good or better than most maybe that's

193
00:10:33,089 --> 00:10:35,779
where I<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to be</font>

194
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:47,290
so in all of this the thing to know is

195
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:53,010
administrators are probably a real

196
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:55,270
concern we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a lot of effort around</font>

197
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:58,240
making<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure that the right people have</font>

198
00:10:55,270 --> 00:11:01,600
the right access so<font color="#E5E5E5"> access control helps</font>

199
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:03,640
a lot and logging so we do a lot of

200
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,890
auditing a lot of logging to make sure

201
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:08,260
that people<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the access their</font>

202
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:10,930
supposed to even on the patient level

203
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:13,750
the right clinicians are looking at the

204
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:19,719
<font color="#CCCCCC">right medical records all this stuff is</font>

205
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:24,610
important to do so what<font color="#CCCCCC"> are some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

206
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:28,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">consequences of non-compliance okay well</font>

207
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:30,670
reputation is a big<font color="#E5E5E5"> one so in Hollywood</font>

208
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:34,300
if you're a movie star and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have a</font>

209
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:36,400
choice of where to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go may not choose to</font>

210
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:38,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">go sometimes you don't have a choice</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

211
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:40,090
an emergency you're going to get care

212
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:41,740
where you need it most quickly most

213
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:46,060
urgently but if you have a little choice

214
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:47,890
you might choose somewhere else so we

215
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:50,199
know some folks at cedars-sinai maybe

216
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:53,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">you go there maybe not hollywood</font>

217
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:58,510
presbyterian so reputation is a big deal

218
00:11:53,770 --> 00:12:03,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">and it's hard</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to it's hard to fix so a</font>

219
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:07,780
lot of money thousands<font color="#E5E5E5"> of hours maybe</font>

220
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:11,819
there's a scapegoat all those<font color="#E5E5E5"> things so</font>

221
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:14,770
how do you how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you navigate all this</font>

222
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:19,140
so the anthem breach was pretty

223
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:22,870
interesting 778 million customers PII

224
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:25,030
big dollars spent just think for a

225
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:30,640
moment about the requirement to send out

226
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:32,560
snail mail what's that<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to cost is</font>

227
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:34,390
that fifty cents these days to send out

228
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:37,030
a piece of mail or maybe you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can get a</font>

229
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:40,000
bulk rate maybe can get 35 cents so what

230
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:43,780
if you have to send<font color="#E5E5E5"> out 78 million of</font>

231
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,850
them so those monies could probably be

232
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:49,270
spent a little bit better<font color="#E5E5E5"> on some</font>

233
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:51,870
security right if you have if you didn't

234
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:51,870
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> that breach</font>

235
00:12:52,000 --> 00:13:01,810
and and it just goes on and on with the

236
00:12:55,720 --> 00:13:06,210
costs going up and up 2015 these were

237
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:12,189
some of the top breaches anthem<font color="#CCCCCC"> primeira</font>

238
00:13:06,210 --> 00:13:15,070
on down you guys know any of these

239
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:18,580
they're familiar names hopefully this is

240
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:25,480
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of this data is off the the HHS</font>

241
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:29,200
website beacon this is what the premiere

242
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:34,320
of breach looked like it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not quite as</font>

243
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:37,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">many they had a little bit of warning</font>

244
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:41,770
but they weren't really able to react<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

245
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:49,060
it right they're still figuring out<font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font>

246
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:52,689
much that's one is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to cost so</font>

247
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:56,020
expected losses here's some ranges we

248
00:13:52,690 --> 00:14:00,430
love charts and graphs don't we where do

249
00:13:56,020 --> 00:14:05,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">you want to find yourself so limiting</font>

250
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:09,510
access to numbers of records<font color="#CCCCCC"> now keeping</font>

251
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:11,829
keeping data on servers versus you know

252
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:15,630
laptops and things that can grow legs

253
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:18,610
and walk out all those things<font color="#E5E5E5"> can help</font>

254
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:21,070
those<font color="#E5E5E5"> are some predictions pretty big</font>

255
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:23,700
numbers does anybody have that kind of a

256
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:23,700
security budget

257
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:34,100
hopefully some people do you don't have

258
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:35,420
to spend that much money but<font color="#CCCCCC"> you need to</font>

259
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:40,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">have a program and that's really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

260
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:43,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">point of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that so from an OCR perspective</font>

261
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:47,979
what what's expected they expect you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

262
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:50,120
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have heard of HIPAA and you have</font>

263
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:53,389
they want you to have a compliance

264
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:58,940
program in place they want you to be

265
00:14:53,389 --> 00:15:01,430
familiar<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the rules they want and</font>

266
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:03,290
this fourth<font color="#E5E5E5"> one is pretty interesting be</font>

267
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:07,399
able to demonstrate active participation

268
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:09,889
I think I can speak for for my employer

269
00:15:07,399 --> 00:15:19,910
there's some active participation really

270
00:15:09,889 --> 00:15:21,829
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of effort so that's good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right so</font>

271
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:23,980
risk assessment an incident risk

272
00:15:21,829 --> 00:15:27,620
assessment we started practicing that

273
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:30,050
hopefully you<font color="#E5E5E5"> are too how do you how do</font>

284
00:15:56,930 --> 00:16:03,258
from 2008 or starting to see a little

<font color="#E5E5E5">bit more a little bit more settlements a</font>

little bit more as time goes on 2015

287
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:16,220
numbers so here's the question<font color="#E5E5E5"> I ask</font>

288
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:20,540
sometimes but also there's a lot of buzz

289
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:23,089
about it is HIPAA a toothless tiger so

290
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:24,740
if you're famous right and your record

291
00:16:23,089 --> 00:16:27,439
gets breached and that might get some

292
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:29,660
news what if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not famous what if</font>

293
00:16:27,439 --> 00:16:32,779
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> just an everyday Joe or what if</font>

294
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:34,699
you're like me I'm really lucky I'm you

295
00:16:32,779 --> 00:16:37,309
know have pretty good health I hardly

296
00:16:34,699 --> 00:16:38,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">ever</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see the doctor usually my</font>

297
00:16:37,309 --> 00:16:42,429
experience in the hospital

298
00:16:38,769 --> 00:16:45,730
stem from taking hockey players to the

299
00:16:42,429 --> 00:16:52,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">ER to get sewn up so so I have no record</font>

300
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:54,309
or no trail of much<font color="#CCCCCC"> of anything so when</font>

301
00:16:52,329 --> 00:16:56,799
there's a complaint made that's when the

302
00:16:54,309 --> 00:17:01,238
OCR gets involved and that's where the

303
00:16:56,799 --> 00:17:02,860
fun that's where the fun begins so

304
00:17:01,239 --> 00:17:08,890
repeat offenders and we'll talk about

305
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:11,529
that a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more here's some of</font>

00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:17,140

devices<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay those kinds of things</font>

313
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:39,158
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of the low-hanging fruit</font>

314
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:40,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">isn't it those are the first things</font>

315
00:17:39,159 --> 00:17:43,450
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to find if you walk in and</font>

316
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:46,750
somebody doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have much of a security</font>

317
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:48,610
posture or they haven't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought</font>

318
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:50,350
about it you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know you turn over</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

319

320
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:56,709
you're going to find a sticky with

321
00:17:52,389 --> 00:18:00,729
password on the bottom and I've seen in

322
00:17:56,710 --> 00:18:04,539
some cases it's going to be the doctors

323
00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:07,350
creds right the person who needs the

324
00:18:04,539 --> 00:18:10,889
most access and needs to<font color="#E5E5E5"> try and do some</font>

325
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:18,428
basically dictation or other signing of

326
00:18:10,889 --> 00:18:23,260
things to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get drugs so here's the total</font>

327
00:18:18,429 --> 00:18:24,610
of investigated resolutions corrective

328
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:26,020
action so they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you're going</font>

329
00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:29,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">to probably have a corrective action</font>

330
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:33,370
plan of some kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> and they're looking</font>

331
00:18:29,289 --> 00:18:37,408
<font color="#E5E5E5">for change how soon are they going to</font>

332
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:37,408
come<font color="#E5E5E5"> back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and monitor and check</font>

333
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:50,179
so here's here's some more common things

334
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:52,459
<font color="#CCCCCC">that are exposed lack of safeguards like</font>

335
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:55,010
a patient<font color="#E5E5E5"> access to the protected data</font>

336
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:57,800
so we all<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ability to get our</font>

337
00:18:55,010 --> 00:19:00,760
data right and I'll get<font color="#E5E5E5"> into that a</font>

338
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:04,580
little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> more towards the end lack of</font>

339
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:06,410
administrative safeguards use and

340
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:07,840
disclosure so when you go in you're

341
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:10,540
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to sign a whole bunch of papers</font>

342
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:13,820
don't don't blame that<font color="#CCCCCC"> on me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all right</font>

343
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:16,340
but that that was the beginning of some

344
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:18,770
of my handiwork we better have people

345
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:24,500
sign that they know what they're they're

346
00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:27,050
doing so this this is off the site

347
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:28,220
recently<font color="#E5E5E5"> these are some case examples</font>

348
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:31,909
and we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> drill down a little</font>

349
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:36,740
bit here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the common ones access right</font>

350
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:38,240
access control authorization how's your

351
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:43,480
baa you're going to have some business

352
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:47,030
associates conditioning and compliance

353
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:50,720
confidential communications disclosure

354
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:52,460
to avert assert a<font color="#E5E5E5"> serious threat we may</font>

355
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:55,250
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually seen that with a Hollywood</font>

356
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:57,380
Presbyterian that may have been they

357
00:19:55,250 --> 00:20:00,830
might<font color="#E5E5E5"> have been motivated because they</font>

358
00:19:57,380 --> 00:20:04,150
needed some patient data right to pay

359
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:06,740
their pay the ransom minimum necessary

360
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:09,830
some people with too much access or

361
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:13,490
access that accumulates one of my pet

362
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:17,230
peeves and favorite hot topic novices

363
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:20,060
and safeguards those kinds of things so

364
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:26,050
if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> look at safeguards and we drill</font>

365
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:30,649
down a little bit the pharmacy chain is

366
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:32,570
what I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at so they're going</font>

367
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:35,480
to institute some new safeguards so

368
00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:37,639
they're under a protocol they've had a

369
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:40,790
complaint they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to go through</font>

370
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:43,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">the steps and this is what I'm going to</font>

371
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:45,110
drill down into a little bit so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a</font>

372
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:47,679
little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> of an eye chart hopefully you</font>

373
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:47,679
can see it

374
00:20:56,440 --> 00:21:03,760
so basically the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the pharmacy was</font>

375
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:08,140
maintaining some logbooks right and they

376
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:10,450
weren't securing them well and so the

377
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:13,930
result was the OCR wanted them to

378
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:16,210
improve their policies now who here

379
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:19,590
thinks that<font color="#E5E5E5"> just improving your policies</font>

380
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:23,980
is really going to secure those logs I

381
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:25,570
don't see even one hand and that's

382
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:30,720
really the<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem isn't it because</font>

383
00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:34,780
security is not really privacy it helps

384
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:39,240
so what's missing what's missing is the

385
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:42,430
actual security so I went down<font color="#E5E5E5"> this list</font>

386
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:44,740
these are the ones that have the

387
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:48,820
complaints<font color="#E5E5E5"> that have been investigated</font>

388
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:50,320
the grouped by categories but what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

389
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:53,500
don't see because<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you're doing</font>

390
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:54,939
anything in HIPAA security and trying to

391
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:58,030
follow a protocol you're going to have

392
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:59,500
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> other things you have a lot more to</font>

393
00:21:58,030 --> 00:22:01,600
do about encryption you're going to have

394
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:03,910
more to do about business continuity and

395
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:07,959
disaster recovery one of my things I'm

396
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:11,050
focused on media reuse that sort of

397
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:15,610
thing we've seen nothing yet complained

398
00:22:11,050 --> 00:22:18,700
about or reported to the OCR nothing's

399
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:22,479
been investigated by<font color="#CCCCCC"> them around these</font>

400
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:25,930
things so they've looked<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the</font>

401
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:28,750
low-hanging fruit I'm trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give you</font>

402
00:22:25,930 --> 00:22:31,570
an idea what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> next what are they going</font>

403
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:32,560
to look at next so when I think of

404
00:22:31,570 --> 00:22:35,439
business continuity and disaster

405
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:39,909
recovery and I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the situation</font>

406
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:41,530
at hollywood presbyterian if they were

407
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:43,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing a good job there they could have</font>

408
00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:45,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">just told the hackers you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> nevermind</font>

409
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:48,280
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not paying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll just recover our</font>

410
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:50,379
systems we've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> our data archive we're</font>

411
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:53,350
going to recover and we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> really not</font>

412
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:55,870
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do anything so thanks for for</font>

413
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:58,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing that you know give us an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> idea but</font>

414
00:22:55,870 --> 00:23:01,689
we're not paying but they decided<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pay</font>

415
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:04,330
in times coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm predicting there's a</font>

416
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:06,160
nice prediction I like predictions we'll

417
00:23:04,330 --> 00:23:08,939
see how long it<font color="#CCCCCC"> takes before I'm right</font>

418
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:10,980
I'm predicting that the OCR latches

419
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:13,710
under the idea that if you're paying a

420
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:16,260
ransom you're going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> pay a fine to go</font>

421
00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:17,910
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously you haven't</font>

422
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:25,230
done<font color="#E5E5E5"> a good job in business continuity</font>

423
00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:28,200
and disaster recovery so in 2016 not too

424
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:30,120
much will change we'll see a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

425
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:33,630
same sort of discoveries because we're

426
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:38,159
in the initial learning part of having

427
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:40,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">the OCR and HHS and the IG</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from the HHS</font>

428
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:43,860
which I get to visit<font color="#E5E5E5"> with we're in the</font>

429
00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:46,680
process of them learning how to do this

430
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:49,050
you know what are we going to look at so

431
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:50,700
they're learning how to do it and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Jay</font>

432
00:23:49,050 --> 00:23:54,780
talked about the FDA they're also

433
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:58,520
learning how to do it so<font color="#CCCCCC"> device vendors</font>

434
00:23:54,780 --> 00:24:03,750
and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> supply chain might be the most</font>

435
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:06,360
significant place where we can find help

436
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:09,540
or where we can find good places to do

437
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:12,510
some solid work so maybe the<font color="#E5E5E5"> BAS are</font>

438
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:14,970
helping all right if you've not gone

439
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:18,900
through the contracting process of<font color="#CCCCCC"> a VA</font>

440
00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:21,210
a discussion I hope you get that

441
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:24,390
opportunity it's a it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> great it's great</font>

442
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:28,770
fun to watch the squirming and gnashing

443
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:31,320
of teeth happen so when we hear that

444
00:24:28,770 --> 00:24:34,970
recent areas of focus from the OCR<font color="#CCCCCC"> our</font>

445
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:37,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">DS business continuity disaster recovery</font>

446
00:24:34,970 --> 00:24:39,690
risk assessment<font color="#CCCCCC"> we've heard a lot about</font>

447
00:24:37,170 --> 00:24:42,540
that they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you've done</font>

448
00:24:39,690 --> 00:24:44,940
one that you're working<font color="#CCCCCC"> at access to</font>

449
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:47,639
control that's something that you know

450
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:49,350
that they've done work around that and

451
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:54,540
that's where they're getting some of

452
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:56,340
their findings privacy audits security

453
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:58,770
awareness and training that's a that's

454
00:24:56,340 --> 00:25:03,179
an important component humans always the

455
00:24:58,770 --> 00:25:07,590
weakest link human is and the vendor be

456
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:09,390
a relationship<font color="#E5E5E5"> management so so along</font>

457
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:15,090
the lines of the relationship management

458
00:25:09,390 --> 00:25:16,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay if a company does a ssae 16 and</font>

459
00:25:15,090 --> 00:25:19,620
they have whatever level they've got

460
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:21,389
that might give you some comfort but

461
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:22,500
there's still a need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> delve into it</font>

462
00:25:21,390 --> 00:25:25,590
and see you know you

463
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:27,150
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on site look check make sure</font>

464
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:30,030
that they're actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing what they</font>

465
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:33,540
say they're going to do so there's value

466
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:37,740
in it but you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> you trust but verify</font>

467
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:41,250
is what I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> say so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is the OCR</font>

468
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:44,640
expect so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just a paper exercise</font>

469
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:48,450
they expect you to<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually be working</font>

470
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:51,630
it right have some findings in your risk

471
00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:53,430
assessment and be working<font color="#CCCCCC"> it from a</font>

472
00:25:51,630 --> 00:25:55,350
consulting perspective I love to hear

473
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:58,440
this because I<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk about security risk</font>

474
00:25:55,350 --> 00:26:00,449
assessment a lot it<font color="#CCCCCC"> really gives us a</font>

475
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:04,890
nice place to start to build a road map

476
00:26:00,450 --> 00:26:06,240
and help customers and and it's

477
00:26:04,890 --> 00:26:07,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">something they can really hang their hat</font>

478
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:12,780
on they can take that to leadership

479
00:26:07,850 --> 00:26:15,689
obtain monies so so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really an</font>

480
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:20,040
important thing so<font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe from that</font>

481
00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:22,320
perspective hip is helping right site

482
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:25,050
visits my favorite thing and interviews

483
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:27,090
I can find out more<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a person</font>

484
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:28,500
one-on-one interview than a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

485
00:26:27,090 --> 00:26:30,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">people that's not because i'm going to</font>

486
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:34,890
use water boarding or other techniques

487
00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:36,629
which I aware of how they work I'm not

488
00:26:34,890 --> 00:26:40,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to say I ever did that before or</font>

489
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:43,740
not but it's just watching people react

490
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:45,270
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a simple question</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and then letting</font>

491
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:48,270
them know that you're there to help them

492
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:50,850
if you're an auditor and one of their

493
00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:54,120
concerns and it's surprising how people

494
00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:56,370
will open up to you and really realize

495
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:58,469
<font color="#CCCCCC">that they don't have to be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the one</font>

496
00:26:56,370 --> 00:27:06,719
that's bringing that message to

497
00:26:58,470 --> 00:27:09,420
leadership so looking for remediation

498
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:14,070
and action plans and some evidence that

499
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:15,600
it's that it's being worked on so you

500
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:19,790
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep this stuff around for six</font>

501
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:23,570
years so everybody doing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> helps them</font>

502
00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:23,570
keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> your documentation</font>

503
00:27:24,570 --> 00:27:31,490
some additional<font color="#CCCCCC"> things okay some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> vom</font>

504
00:27:28,529 --> 00:27:34,350
testing and testing is even better<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

505
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:36,509
would venture to say that most<font color="#CCCCCC"> health</font>

506
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:40,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">care is not really ready for advance of</font>

507
00:27:36,509 --> 00:27:44,490
pen testing it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> always a fun exercise</font>

508
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:48,000
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get to do that we love pen</font>

509
00:27:44,490 --> 00:27:51,269
testing in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> consulting world and but</font>

510
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:53,759
a lot of times we take a quick look and

511
00:27:51,269 --> 00:27:55,830
say you know you're not really<font color="#E5E5E5"> ready for</font>

512
00:27:53,759 --> 00:27:57,929
pen testing let's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> start with</font>

513
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:59,610
something a little more simple let's

514
00:27:57,929 --> 00:28:02,250
start<font color="#CCCCCC"> with a risk assessment and see how</font>

515
00:27:59,610 --> 00:28:05,668
we can help you get ready<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be able to</font>

516
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:10,889
do a pen test so copiers and fax

517
00:28:05,669 --> 00:28:12,450
machines always a fun time those things

518
00:28:10,889 --> 00:28:16,949
have a lot of capabilities these days

519
00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:19,649
they have a lot of storage and and and

520
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:21,450
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what happens if you work</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

521
00:28:19,649 --> 00:28:25,620
any copier guys they're going to bring

522
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:28,710
their little basically several bags and

523
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:30,000
pieces of<font color="#E5E5E5"> equipment and if they can't</font>

524
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:33,509
fix the machine while<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're going to</font>

525
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,860
do I'm going to roll<font color="#CCCCCC"> it out of the we're</font>

526
00:28:33,509 --> 00:28:37,440
going to probably roll it out of the

527
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:40,229
enterprise they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to roll</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it out</font>

528
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:42,360
of the office if it's a smaller machine

529
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:44,100
right if it's not what a big one that

530
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:45,990
requires several men and a truck<font color="#E5E5E5"> and all</font>

531
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:48,059
that if it's a smaller machine it's

532
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:50,220
gonna have a lot of data and they're

533
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:53,360
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have it in you know social</font>

534
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:55,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">engineering opportunity right there</font>

535
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:58,949
employee and contractor background

536
00:28:55,679 --> 00:29:01,049
checks so check once when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> hire them</font>

537
00:28:58,950 --> 00:29:05,330
that are you doing those constantly

538
00:29:01,049 --> 00:29:09,450
right most companies don't do that so

539
00:29:05,330 --> 00:29:11,759
reach insurance people are people are

540
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:13,889
buying that and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> there one breaches</font>

541
00:29:11,759 --> 00:29:15,840
happen they find that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're not</font>

542
00:29:13,889 --> 00:29:18,719
covered so they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> using all the breach</font>

543
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:21,019
assurance insurance and then and then

544
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:24,450
there's more more money needs to go out

545
00:29:21,019 --> 00:29:26,820
encryption is a safe harbor oh man that

546
00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:30,360
one just about drives me crazy<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay is</font>

547
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:32,908
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> really a safe harbor so if my laptop</font>

548
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:37,168
is encrypted or my desktop is encrypted

549
00:29:32,909 --> 00:29:38,440
and I've got patient data it<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

550
00:29:37,169 --> 00:29:43,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">depends on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how do I</font>

551
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:47,169
use this<font color="#CCCCCC"> device so does anybody here use</font>

552
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:48,730
hibernate mode I do I'm sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't</font>

553
00:29:47,169 --> 00:29:50,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">have any patient data but I use</font>

554
00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:53,950
hibernate mode and I just close the lid

555
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:56,110
so now the lids closed and when I flip

556
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:59,559
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> open it's right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there the only</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font>

557
00:29:56,110 --> 00:30:02,559
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's not encrypted so it doesn't</font>

558
00:29:59,559 --> 00:30:06,418
go to encryption when I hibernate<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

559
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:09,158
encrypted if I<font color="#E5E5E5"> turn it off right so</font>

560
00:30:06,419 --> 00:30:11,080
encryption is a safe harbor is the thing

561
00:30:09,159 --> 00:30:13,720
that's allowed people will claim safe

562
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:16,269
harbor right if they have a breach oh

563
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:18,580
that device was encrypted so it's it's

564
00:30:16,269 --> 00:30:21,490
safe well maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> it wasn't maybe it's not</font>

565
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:25,178
so if your data if you're the patient

566
00:30:21,490 --> 00:30:29,100
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> your data is on that device how do</font>

567
00:30:25,179 --> 00:30:29,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know that it wasn't really accessed</font>

568
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:41,280
encrypt whatever can sprout legs so

569
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:44,240
lapped I laptops desktops copier

570
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:46,830
machines medical devices right

571
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:49,590
everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> that moves or everything that</font>

572
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:51,000
can move<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because it's in bolted to</font>

573
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:55,949
the wall doesn't mean it can't be moved

574
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:57,990
or unbolted or taken so even even big

575
00:30:55,950 --> 00:31:00,330
things in fact it's the big things and

576
00:30:57,990 --> 00:31:03,720
the social engineering component of

577
00:31:00,330 --> 00:31:05,189
having some guys in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> moving van but</font>

578
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:06,810
look like they're supposed to be there

579
00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:13,370
those are the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things to really worry</font>

580
00:31:06,810 --> 00:31:18,179
about right strong authentication

581
00:31:13,370 --> 00:31:20,840
complex one-time passwords it's always

582
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:24,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">been</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a fun discussion back when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I first</font>

583
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:26,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">got into HIPAA a little bit we were</font>

584
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:28,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">having discussions about well password</font>

585
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:30,929
complexity and what we learned was it's

586
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:35,400
a really<font color="#CCCCCC"> hard thing the clinician wants</font>

587
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:37,380
to they might have one hand gloves and

588
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:39,660
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be able to type</font>

589
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:43,950
their password with one hand that's not

590
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:45,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">gloved and so it needs to be complex but</font>

591
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:47,910
they still need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able to do their</font>

592
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:49,500
password with one hand I think we're

593
00:31:47,910 --> 00:31:51,330
kind of getting away<font color="#CCCCCC"> from that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font>

594
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:53,400
getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> used</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to you know unloving or</font>

595
00:31:51,330 --> 00:31:54,689
whatever and so hopefully<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can get a</font>

596
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:57,960
little bit more complexity in the

597
00:31:54,690 --> 00:31:59,670
passwords but every time it's always<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

598
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:01,890
fight we're always fighting that battle

599
00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:04,140
how are we going to how are we going to

600
00:32:01,890 --> 00:32:08,190
get the clinicians and the end users to

601
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:10,260
really use this administrator

602
00:32:08,190 --> 00:32:13,500
credentials so once you get in and you

603
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:15,270
can if you remember the pyramid right at

604
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:18,240
the top is the administrator so if I can

605
00:32:15,270 --> 00:32:21,629
become<font color="#E5E5E5"> that administrator okay that's</font>

606
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:24,000
that's where I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be then another</font>

607
00:32:21,630 --> 00:32:27,410
fun thing another fun thing that I like

608
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:31,680
to talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot and we all do this</font>

609
00:32:27,410 --> 00:32:35,460
we send out as business processes emails

610
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:38,670
that ask our people to click and at the

611
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:41,970
same time we tell people in security

612
00:32:38,670 --> 00:32:45,210
awareness and training don't click why

613
00:32:41,970 --> 00:32:46,310
do we do that I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it my banks</font>

614
00:32:45,210 --> 00:32:50,730
not sending me

615
00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:52,409
emails to click on people from Nigeria

616
00:32:50,730 --> 00:32:54,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">are trying to send</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me stuff that looks</font>

617
00:32:52,410 --> 00:32:57,210
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's from my bank for me to click</font>

618
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:59,280
on not clicking on it but from an

619
00:32:57,210 --> 00:33:02,610
internal perspective if your company is

620
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:04,889
sending things oh it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> business</font>

621
00:33:02,610 --> 00:33:07,139
process<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's HR oh I need to do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

622
00:33:04,890 --> 00:33:09,750
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> for my employee so yep</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I get the</font>

623
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:10,860
thing and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a click no no that</font>

624
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:13,080
shouldn't be what's happening what

625
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:17,149
should be happening is I get a notice

626
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:20,580
and email it says your employee bob is

627
00:33:17,150 --> 00:33:22,380
needing a review please go on to the HR

628
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:24,899
system and do the<font color="#E5E5E5"> appropriate thing</font>

629
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:28,710
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the only notice i get not a click</font>

630
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:30,930
on this and make<font color="#CCCCCC"> it easy and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm trying</font>

631
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:34,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">really hard with some companies I'm</font>

632
00:33:30,930 --> 00:33:36,990
marking with to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> that recognized and</font>

633
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:38,520
acknowledged because you can't on the

634
00:33:36,990 --> 00:33:41,610
one hand tell people well don't click on

635
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:44,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">anything in their training but then be</font>

636
00:33:41,610 --> 00:33:47,879
sending out stuff that<font color="#CCCCCC"> has links in it</font>

637
00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:49,610
it just<font color="#CCCCCC"> doesn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make sense and if there</font>

638
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:52,020
were ever going to be an F bomb dropped

639
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:54,360
that would be the place<font color="#E5E5E5"> to drop one</font>

640
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:59,100
because it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just maddening what happens</font>

641
00:33:54,360 --> 00:34:04,800
there still didn't drop<font color="#CCCCCC"> it so developing</font>

642
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:08,100
trust relationships right you know

643
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:10,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">working with your c-suite having the</font>

644
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:12,690
tone from the top having them realize

645
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:15,300
that they need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to apply money's all</font>

646
00:34:12,690 --> 00:34:18,840
these things collaborating with external

647
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:21,270
resources hopefully you all while<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

648
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:24,169
all here so that's great you're seeing

649
00:34:21,270 --> 00:34:27,330
you're going to industry things there's

650
00:34:24,168 --> 00:34:32,069
professional associations<font color="#CCCCCC"> InfraGard</font>

651
00:34:27,330 --> 00:34:35,399
there's isaca there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> gush a lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

652
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:37,230
there st. and we have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of those</font>

653
00:34:35,399 --> 00:34:40,549
things to belong to you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to hear</font>

654
00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:43,500
and collaborate with some great<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

655
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:46,520
because you can't know everything right

656
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:46,520
you just can't know everything

657
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:56,920
so independent reporting kind of a big

658
00:34:52,989 --> 00:34:58,270
deal the sea level<font color="#E5E5E5"> people you know get</font>

659
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:59,650
worried about this<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's usually a</font>

660
00:34:58,270 --> 00:35:02,980
couple of them on the hook that might

661
00:34:59,650 --> 00:35:04,720
have to you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> potentially dawn an</font>

662
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:07,240
orange suit and spend some<font color="#E5E5E5"> time in jail</font>

663
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:10,959
but really I haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen that happening</font>

664
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:15,399
much I mean it<font color="#CCCCCC"> really would take some</font>

665
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:17,830
some some basically it<font color="#E5E5E5"> would take some</font>

666
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:22,900
illegal activity and it would take a

667
00:35:17,830 --> 00:35:25,000
real you'd have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work hard to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

668
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:28,600
neglecting things enough to<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have that</font>

669
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:33,250
happen manager be a relationship<font color="#CCCCCC"> risk</font>

670
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:36,160
right so it's not enough just to do get

671
00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:39,220
a report from external third party on

672
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:40,899
the ssae 16 but you need to go there<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

673
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:42,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">you see what they're doing you walk</font>

674
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:49,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">around you need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to ask some questions</font>

675
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:53,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things all take time you have</font>

676
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:55,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">to have your documentation on order so</font>

677
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:58,300
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> are some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things you can do make</font>

678
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:59,860
sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have bhi on local</font>

679
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:04,350
machines so hopefully<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're keeping it</font>

680
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:06,610
in your networks right reporting

681
00:36:04,350 --> 00:36:09,100
security incidents<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay if you see</font>

682
00:36:06,610 --> 00:36:11,500
something say something we get a fair

683
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:13,360
bit of email from people say hey I got

684
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:16,900
this weird look an email or there's this

685
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:18,670
email with an attachment or theirs or I

686
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:20,380
saw somebody weird driving<font color="#E5E5E5"> around the</font>

687
00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:24,250
parking lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really get a lot of weird</font>

688
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:26,800
things breach notification plan<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

689
00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:32,350
these need to be timely there's time

690
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:34,420
there's you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know set time times that</font>

691
00:36:32,350 --> 00:36:37,150
things must happen once once you've been

692
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:39,880
notified<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it goes all up and down the</font>

693
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:43,360
chain so if you have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> really long chain</font>

694
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:46,590
of contracted<font color="#CCCCCC"> third-party vendors who</font>

695
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:50,260
have contracted out who contracted out

696
00:36:46,590 --> 00:36:52,180
it the clock starts running down at the

697
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:54,520
end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the chain so if they're not good</font>

698
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:57,490
at communicating up the chain you might

699
00:36:54,520 --> 00:37:00,500
find out<font color="#E5E5E5"> after 45</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> days have gone by that</font>

700
00:36:57,490 --> 00:37:04,419
oh crap there's this thing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> happened</font>

701
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:08,240
and I didn't get a whole 60 days right

702
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:11,330
so don't delay in responding here's

703
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:13,669
here's something I learned if you if you

704
00:37:11,330 --> 00:37:16,610
get a letter from the OCR and you need

705
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:18,530
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make a response it's okay to ask for</font>

706
00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:22,880
more time so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just called up the OCR</font>

707
00:37:18,530 --> 00:37:25,190
and I said I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> just getting this landed</font>

708
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:28,220
on my desk today it looks<font color="#CCCCCC"> like it's due</font>

709
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:31,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">in two days and it's bounced around our</font>

710
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:35,540
system<font color="#CCCCCC"> for 45 days can I have a little</font>

00:37:31,430 --> 00:37:38,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">bit more time the response was sure you</font>

712
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:40,370
can have another week no problem but

713
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:41,540
it's because I at least asked if I

714
00:37:40,370 --> 00:37:43,790
wouldn't have asked I would have been

715
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:46,250
running around all weekend and trying to

716
00:37:43,790 --> 00:37:48,590
kill myself and can't get to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the people</font>

717
00:37:46,250 --> 00:37:53,450
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to so it's okay to ask for</font>

718
00:37:48,590 --> 00:37:57,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">a little bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more time so what kind of</font>

719
00:37:53,450 --> 00:38:00,040
evidence oh you know screenshots are

720
00:37:57,350 --> 00:38:04,910
huge and they're used a lot data dumps

721
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:07,160
on some auditors are good at going

722
00:38:04,910 --> 00:38:12,830
through data dumps some maybe not so

723
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:14,810
good log files records really looking

724
00:38:12,830 --> 00:38:18,350
for two artifacts / control if you can

725
00:38:14,810 --> 00:38:20,390
get<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and reputation so one of the</font>

726
00:38:18,350 --> 00:38:23,150
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I like to do is have it have</font>

727
00:38:20,390 --> 00:38:25,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">someone demonstrate how how they work</font>

728
00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:29,210
something that's usually a pretty

729
00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:31,280
telltale sign so do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have a program</font>

730
00:38:29,210 --> 00:38:34,760
rather than just a project is it true is

731
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:37,130
it is it funded as it treated like it's

732
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:38,810
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> serious or is it just a hey</font>

733
00:38:37,130 --> 00:38:41,420
let's hurry<font color="#E5E5E5"> up in Kabul a bunch of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff</font>

734
00:38:38,810 --> 00:38:44,290
together and get some documents to try

735
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:44,290
and answer audit

736
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:54,060
what are<font color="#CCCCCC"> some of the technologies</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

737
00:38:50,970 --> 00:38:57,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">obviously encryption right strong</font>

738
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:59,190
authentication detection tools stuff

739
00:38:57,390 --> 00:39:03,450
that goes beyond just the firewall stuff

740
00:38:59,190 --> 00:39:07,730
the general stuff having a pen test if

741
00:39:03,450 --> 00:39:10,410
you're up to that integrated solutions

742
00:39:07,730 --> 00:39:13,500
continuous auditing and monitoring and

743
00:39:10,410 --> 00:39:15,600
so when you get some time on the network

744
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:17,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">and you understand what's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> supposed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

745
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:20,700
going on then hopefully you can

746
00:39:17,970 --> 00:39:23,669
recognize when something looks like it

747
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:28,350
shouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> be going on tools for instant</font>

748
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:34,020
response continua sodding that's a huge

749
00:39:28,350 --> 00:39:38,700
thing other other tools to automate the

750
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:41,780
GRC process so what are<font color="#E5E5E5"> the behaviors</font>

751
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:45,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">that can help the tone from the top I</font>

752
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:49,680
talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that security awareness and</font>

753
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:51,860
training<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay is it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just a an exercising</font>

754
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:53,940
what i like to call click area or

755
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:58,380
actually causing people to think a

756
00:39:53,940 --> 00:40:04,230
little bit right what's the security

757
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:06,300
posture the c-suite engaged you can tell

758
00:40:04,230 --> 00:40:09,810
a lot about that how your funding and

759
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:12,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">supported attitude right attitudes</font>

760
00:40:09,810 --> 00:40:14,460
everything everyone is on the security

761
00:40:12,630 --> 00:40:17,010
team it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not just a security team or</font>

762
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:20,070
the physical security team it's the

763
00:40:17,010 --> 00:40:22,400
whole company<font color="#CCCCCC"> and if you see something</font>

764
00:40:20,070 --> 00:40:22,400
say something

765
00:40:28,730 --> 00:40:33,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright this is one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the funniest</font>

766
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:36,960
discussions in<font color="#CCCCCC"> healthcare today</font>

767
00:40:33,830 --> 00:40:41,339
apparently you own your data who here

768
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:49,230
has a copy of their medical record one

769
00:40:41,339 --> 00:40:51,660
person<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay if you were to ask for a</font>

770
00:40:49,230 --> 00:40:56,609
copy of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your rental medical record what</font>

771
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:57,930
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> you think you're going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get you're</font>

772
00:40:56,609 --> 00:41:00,330
going to make you you<font color="#CCCCCC"> might</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get some</font>

773
00:40:57,930 --> 00:41:01,589
paper you might<font color="#CCCCCC"> get a PDF they're</font>

774
00:41:00,330 --> 00:41:06,839
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to give you something</font>

775
00:41:01,589 --> 00:41:09,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">you can consume electronically so the</font>

776
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:12,060
OCR and organizations will tell you you

777
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:14,549
own your data but do<font color="#CCCCCC"> you really own your</font>

778
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:17,970
data possessions nine-tenths of the law

779
00:41:14,550 --> 00:41:19,440
we hear that<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot the people who have</font>

780
00:41:17,970 --> 00:41:21,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">the data are the people that are the</font>

781
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:26,130
organization they're the people who own

782
00:41:21,690 --> 00:41:32,310
your data right so you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really own</font>

783
00:41:26,130 --> 00:41:34,140
you data but you can ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> for it that's</font>

784
00:41:32,310 --> 00:41:37,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably the most important point you</font>

785
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:40,410
can ask for you data so are there ever

786
00:41:37,230 --> 00:41:44,160
errors on medical records<font color="#CCCCCC"> of course</font>

787
00:41:40,410 --> 00:41:45,750
there are so it happens all the time so

788
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:48,930
if you get<font color="#CCCCCC"> your medical record and you</font>

789
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:51,180
look down through<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you say wow this</font>

790
00:41:48,930 --> 00:41:54,470
this wasn't even me or it doesn't look

791
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:58,609
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> me identity theft is a real concern</font>

792
00:41:54,470 --> 00:42:00,750
so you have a chance to verify your<font color="#E5E5E5"> data</font>

793
00:41:58,609 --> 00:42:03,450
when you get a home of that and probably

794
00:42:00,750 --> 00:42:05,580
be a good idea to encrypt it and take

795
00:42:03,450 --> 00:42:07,200
care<font color="#CCCCCC"> of it properly and I say this to</font>

796
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:09,359
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> audience but what would I say to</font>

797
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:11,640
the general public who can't do that for

798
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:14,640
themselves<font color="#E5E5E5"> very well or who aren't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> good</font>

799
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:16,230
at doing that i would say maybe should

800
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:20,250
consider<font color="#CCCCCC"> put it on an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> iphone even the</font>

801
00:42:16,230 --> 00:42:27,180
FBI can't crack that but but we all can

802
00:42:20,250 --> 00:42:29,580
write or maybe we can so security

803
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:32,310
self-reliance and I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting to the end</font>

804
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:34,319
of the talk here and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just want to talk</font>

805
00:42:32,310 --> 00:42:38,670
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> little bit so take some</font>

806
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:40,050
time monitor<font color="#CCCCCC"> your credit report okay</font>

807
00:42:38,670 --> 00:42:42,430
there's a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Dan Anderson's in the</font>

808
00:42:40,050 --> 00:42:43,809
world maybe that's a good thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> or maybe</font>

809
00:42:42,430 --> 00:42:48,368
depending on who<font color="#CCCCCC"> you talk to you that</font>

810
00:42:43,809 --> 00:42:50,530
may<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be such a good thing but if you</font>

811
00:42:48,369 --> 00:42:51,819
take some<font color="#CCCCCC"> time and see and get your</font>

812
00:42:50,530 --> 00:42:53,800
baseline and you know where you're at

813
00:42:51,819 --> 00:42:56,290
then you'll be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to recognize for</font>

814
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:58,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">yourself when something's there because</font>

815
00:42:56,290 --> 00:43:01,270
identity theft especially for medical

816
00:42:58,780 --> 00:43:04,180
and people who are<font color="#CCCCCC"> really sick and need</font>

817
00:43:01,270 --> 00:43:09,430
medical is going to be more<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more of</font>

818
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:15,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">a theme lifelock anybody here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use</font>

819
00:43:09,430 --> 00:43:17,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">lifelock okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm the only one</font>

820
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:19,270
interesting that's not the<font color="#CCCCCC"> only service</font>

821
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:22,270
out there and you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> certainly do it</font>

822
00:43:19,270 --> 00:43:27,069
for yourself<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright physical security</font>

823
00:43:22,270 --> 00:43:34,030
quickly all right your home your car and

824
00:43:27,069 --> 00:43:36,339
you you're around got you<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I'm going</font>

825
00:43:34,030 --> 00:43:38,349
to get kind of a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit short on</font>

826
00:43:36,339 --> 00:43:40,150
this but I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to give you some</font>

827
00:43:38,349 --> 00:43:42,550
things to think about so get your

828
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:45,819
medical record know what's on your

829
00:43:42,550 --> 00:43:48,490
credit report ok what's your situational

830
00:43:45,819 --> 00:43:51,700
awareness then you walk<font color="#CCCCCC"> it around with</font>

831
00:43:48,490 --> 00:43:54,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">your head down and texting a you might</font>

832
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:58,328
get ran over or you might encounter the

833
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:59,950
first person shooter right so there's a

834
00:43:58,329 --> 00:44:01,089
time and a place for those things and

835
00:43:59,950 --> 00:44:04,390
there's a time of the place<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

836
00:44:01,089 --> 00:44:07,808
thinking about what's there so your

837
00:44:04,390 --> 00:44:09,609
profile what's in<font color="#E5E5E5"> your car</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok what are</font>

838
00:44:07,809 --> 00:44:11,079
you keeping your car you pack your

839
00:44:09,609 --> 00:44:15,009
backpack around because it's got<font color="#E5E5E5"> your a</font>

840
00:44:11,079 --> 00:44:17,470
really important laptop on those kinds

841
00:44:15,010 --> 00:44:19,960
of things what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have on you can</font>

842
00:44:17,470 --> 00:44:21,609
you give<font color="#CCCCCC"> it up easily all right so you</font>

843
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:23,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">got your wallet on you you've got a</font>

844
00:44:21,609 --> 00:44:29,078
phone on<font color="#CCCCCC"> you what are you going to give</font>

845
00:44:23,650 --> 00:44:33,230
up first your wallet or<font color="#E5E5E5"> your phone who</font>

846
00:44:29,079 --> 00:44:36,290
says wallet phone<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font>

847
00:44:33,230 --> 00:44:40,430
if it's an apple even the FBI<font color="#E5E5E5"> can get in</font>

848
00:44:36,290 --> 00:44:44,259
so you're probably going to give up your

849
00:44:40,430 --> 00:44:49,040
phone first right but is that what the

850
00:44:44,260 --> 00:44:51,800
person is holding you up wants no they

851
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:53,150
probably want your wallet because it's
