male clients and all those passwords are

147
00:07:52,720 --> 00:08:02,440
clear text AWS could run tools so look

148
00:07:59,139 --> 00:08:05,590
at them a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little bit IDRs a is the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> file</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">name for some private keys and github</font>

150
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:17,940

etsy password and 1.1 k shadow files

152
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:24,360
those are a lot of fun and then some of

153
00:08:22,389 --> 00:08:27,639
them more<font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting ones that i like</font>

154
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:32,709
SFTP configs he actually log into their

155
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:37,810
servers because why not so<font color="#E5E5E5"> after looking</font>

156
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:39,369
at all of this<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> decided hey wouldn't</font>

157
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:46,869
that be cool<font color="#E5E5E5"> if somebody wrote a tool to</font>

158
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:48,850
take all of that and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i did pretty</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> much</font>

159
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:51,940
the night<font color="#E5E5E5"> after i sent that tweet i</font>

160
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:53,440
started coding furiously in<font color="#CCCCCC"> python and</font>

161
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:57,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">it took</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me all night</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because i'm not a</font>

162
00:08:53,440 --> 00:09:02,860
coder but in the morning I came up with

163
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:05,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">the first</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> working copy get harvester and</font>

164
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:08,350
what it<font color="#E5E5E5"> does out of the box is you run</font>

165
00:09:05,829 --> 00:09:10,520
it without any configuration whatsoever

166
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:13,310
it will just automatically pull where

167
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:17,770
press configs parse them out dump

168
00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:19,939
username password and host to the screen

169
00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:22,569
and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> I added a whole bunch of other</font>

170
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:24,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">features I actually have a slight felis</font>

you're trying to look for<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:37,579
can't actually drill down with the

177
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:39,830

181
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:53,750
off a little bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that shall we does</font>

182
00:09:52,190 --> 00:10:03,350
anybody have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> chicken to sacrifice so</font>

183
00:09:53,750 --> 00:10:05,480
this works no<font color="#E5E5E5"> damn</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it all right so show</font>

184
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:09,230
up basic functionality you run it like i

185
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:11,210
said no parameters whatsoever it's going

186
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:15,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">to start grabbing a whole bunch of</font>

187
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:18,010

188
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:18,010
doing

189
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:28,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright</font>

190

everyone see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that all right</font>

192
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:54,980
so there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are some live creds now do I</font>

193
00:10:52,970 --> 00:11:01,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> any volunteers they want to try</font>

197
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:22,190
right now<font color="#CCCCCC"> no so right now it just runs</font>

198
00:11:16,519 --> 00:11:26,060
and it scrapes github so no input on it

199
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:28,519
whatsoever and what it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do is</font>

200
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:29,750
it's going by default like I said it's

201
00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:31,399
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to just search for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> WordPress</font>

202
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:38,779
config files parse everything out and

203
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:43,399
dump it to the screen so that's kind of

204
00:11:38,779 --> 00:11:49,300
neat now I have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> couple other things so</font>

205
00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:54,110
if we wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to check out that line</font>

206
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:56,719
check out some RSA private keys let me

207
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:59,720
actually walk through that command with

208
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:01,550
you the<font color="#CCCCCC"> fervour vote verbose mode you</font>

209
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:03,500
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually going to print out the URL</font>

210
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:07,849
of a match to the console so you can

211
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:10,579
manually go there<font color="#CCCCCC"> S is for custom search</font>

212
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:13,850
as so you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see file name ID</font>

213
00:12:10,579 --> 00:12:15,829
RSA and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> R is the custom regex so</font>

214
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:19,269
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to look for begin space RSA</font>

215
00:12:15,829 --> 00:12:19,269
space private space key

216
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:25,629
you run that and right now it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> only</font>

217
00:12:23,499 --> 00:12:27,519
going to return the first line of the

218
00:12:25,629 --> 00:12:29,949
match there will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be enough to show you</font>

219
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:34,420
that we have a whole bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of private</font>

220
00:12:29,949 --> 00:12:41,349
keys on there and if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want we can</font>

221
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:44,910
actually dumped that to a directory so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

222
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:51,179
can show you that I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> lying to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

223
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:51,179
right now I will dump a couple

224
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:58,140
a couple cat star

225
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:06,589
yay a bunch of private keys I'll go over

226
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:09,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">the numbers in a little bit of how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> many</font>

227
00:13:06,589 --> 00:13:20,110
I've actually found in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> past week</font>

228
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:24,019
while prepping for this but um September

229
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:26,600
something like that I've done a couple

230
00:13:24,019 --> 00:13:33,079
of bugs or bug fixes on it and<font color="#CCCCCC"> whatnot</font>

231
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:34,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I actually think nope here let's grab</font>

232
00:13:33,079 --> 00:13:38,859
this one this one is much more

233
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:38,860
interesting shadow files

234
00:13:45,779 --> 00:13:49,339
hey there's root ashes

235
00:13:53,249 --> 00:14:05,529
fantastic and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> asked not least let's</font>

236
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:07,389
check out some SFTP passwords which in

237
00:14:05,529 --> 00:14:09,730
the configs of the SFTP stuff they also

238
00:14:07,389 --> 00:14:15,279
have a lot of publicly accessible IPS

239
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:17,439
and domains and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have verified through</font>

240
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:20,379
a friend on the anonymous internet I

241
00:14:17,439 --> 00:14:22,238
have no<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea who they are they have told</font>

242
00:14:20,379 --> 00:14:26,679
me that many of these credentials are

243
00:14:22,239 --> 00:14:30,730
currently working one of which I was

244
00:14:26,679 --> 00:14:33,189
told you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can get into the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> backend sequel</font>

not have<font color="#E5E5E5"> access before the talk and it's</font>

248
00:14:49,299 --> 00:14:57,600
dying out fantastic<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright whatever</font>

249
00:14:53,609 --> 00:14:57,600
let's get back to

250
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:06,689
I might look for that one

251
00:15:06,819 --> 00:15:09,839
oh yeah

252
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:30,840
partially successful demo yay yeah yeah

253
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:35,550
please so yeah so ironically i am

254
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:40,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">hosting it on github and it's open so if</font>

255
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:44,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">i was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a strike network so there's the</font>

256
00:15:40,650 --> 00:15:48,350
URL to that so you can go ahead<font color="#CCCCCC"> shit's a</font>

257
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:50,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">Python script with a couple of imports</font>

258
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:52,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you'll want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to make sure that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

259
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:58,020
have things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like curl and beautiful soup</font>

260
00:15:52,500 --> 00:16:01,140
for parsing HTML so in the past week to

261
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:03,829
see what's currently on there I spent

262
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:05,910
hours grabbing everything that I could

263
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:08,580
and those are some of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the numbers of</font>

264
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:13,230
things that I have found you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know lots</font>

265
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:17,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">of WordPress database passwords 902 of</font>

266
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:19,860
them the unique we're actually 366 so

267
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:21,090
you'll see a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of test environments</font>

268
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:23,070
that are people are putting up there

269
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:28,830
that aren't all one hundred percent

270
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:35,550
legitimate you know 61 public hosts with

271
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:37,470
their databases exposed I haven't yet I

272
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:39,839
was going to and I ran out of time for

273
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:42,500
this week but<font color="#CCCCCC"> they are there and I have</font>

274
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:45,750
confirmed that they are there which is

275
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:47,910
lots of fun which by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way if you can</font>

276
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:52,160
find somebody's AWS token for one of

277
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:52,160
their GPU rigs free password cracking

278
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:59,600
so if you look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the actual</font>

279
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:03,800
passwords<font color="#CCCCCC"> I spent a little while parsing</font>

280
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:05,690
through all of them 197 blank passwords

281
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:07,879
which is fine if<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're you know</font>

282
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:10,550
uploading sample configs things like

283
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:12,140
that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty standard passwords</font>

284
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:14,680
that we've all heard hundreds of

285
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:18,260
billions<font color="#E5E5E5"> of times that these are common</font>

286
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:19,670
but there are some that actually caught

287
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:25,550
my eye that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I thought were really</font>

288
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:33,500
awesome passwords you know true love

289
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:36,169
waits that and my actual spirit animal

290
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:44,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">krieger was in there along with Adolf</font>

291
00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:48,410
Hitler<font color="#E5E5E5"> hey noted let me look at some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

292
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:52,070
the SFTP passwords that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I found a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

293
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:54,290
passwords as passwords<font color="#CCCCCC"> again pretty</font>

294
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:56,149
standard a lot of Raspberry Pi stuff for

295
00:17:54,290 --> 00:18:00,290
you know Raspberry Pi images people

296
00:17:56,150 --> 00:18:09,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">throw up on get up and here's some of</font>

297
00:18:00,290 --> 00:18:12,860
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I can but I I don't know why</font>

298
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:14,300
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> ten of them it could be the same</font>

299
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:16,899
project multiple different files

300
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:16,899
uploaded

301
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:25,399
I'm actually not sure how github returns

302
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:26,540
that I'd have to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> into that because</font>

303
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:28,970
i haven't actually look at any of the

304
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:30,920
branch stuff but what it does is it<font color="#E5E5E5"> does</font>

305
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:33,290
the search<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it takes every single</font>

306
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:38,000
item on the search and then goes through

307
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:40,550
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> scrapes it regex</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> terrain like</font>

308
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,560
that so these are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the fun ones I found a</font>

309
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:48,110
lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fun ones where SFTP passwords</font>

310
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:51,280
a lot of long ones<font color="#CCCCCC"> Illuminati 666 yeah</font>

311
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:51,280
Pizza yolo swag

312
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:06,170
some fun gmail passwords there weren't

313
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:08,330
actually a whole bunch of unique for

314
00:19:06,170 --> 00:19:10,700
many used gmail passwords there's a lot

315
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:12,139
of unique ones but not many mass used

316
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:14,450
over and over and over like password

317
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:17,510
probably that's a testament to gmail's

318
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:20,660
password policy I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> imagine but I</font>

319
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:28,070
don't really know computers in here was

320
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:30,140
probably my favorite so so tried hard I

321
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:37,240
assume<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not Oh SCP</font>

322
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:37,240
certified derp life at one

323
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:47,000
no one loves<font color="#E5E5E5"> me yeah that was a where</font>

324
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:48,950
was that one yeah no one loved me so

325
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:56,920
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not no one loves me he's telling</font>

326
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:56,920
people do not love me<font color="#E5E5E5"> yes the which one</font>

327
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:16,490
haha I am NOT surprised you know that so

328
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:18,590
then I took a lot of the shadow files

329
00:20:16,490 --> 00:20:21,890
and I spent about 10 hours last night

330
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:23,689
cracking all those<font color="#E5E5E5"> I got about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> forty</font>

331
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:29,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">five percent</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of them in the nine hours</font>

332
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:32,080
with a 1.5 billion word<font color="#E5E5E5"> West file you</font>

333
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:34,370
know pretty standard not real fun and

334
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:37,639
those are some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fun ones shells</font>

335
00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:41,060
was awesome and I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> got so giddy when</font>

336
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:42,740
I saw the only for you to see there

337
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:49,520
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was just something so satisfying</font>

338
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:53,660
about that and God the infamous God God

339
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:58,580
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> not be up this late she is up this</font>

340
00:20:53,660 --> 00:21:01,480
late posting her passwords to get out so

341
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:04,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">because why not I compiled everything</font>

342
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:11,200
unique tit all and posted all the

343
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:15,350
passwords<font color="#CCCCCC"> I found on facebook yeah I</font>

344
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:18,470
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> care so if you want to go check</font>

345
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:20,419
<font color="#CCCCCC">those out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they're pretty cool last time</font>

346
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:22,670
I gave this talk it actually got taken

347
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:24,920
down since then or I haven't found it

348
00:21:22,670 --> 00:21:27,950
again they<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually had the Chinese</font>

349
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:33,560
characters for password which was

350
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:36,560
fantastic so a couple of concerns that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

351
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:39,409
ran into all running all this you can

352
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:42,230
use<font color="#CCCCCC"> a github API or you can just search</font>

353
00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:44,840
the web interface but either one will

354
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:47,030
only give you<font color="#E5E5E5"> a maximum</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 1000 results</font>

355
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:49,340
back for whatever and there's a little

356
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:50,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">support page in their form saying they</font>

357
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:53,360
do this to keep you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know performance</font>

358
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:55,880
down because if you're returning 4.6

359
00:21:53,360 --> 00:22:01,250
million results it's going to destroy

360
00:21:55,880 --> 00:22:02,810
their servers pretty quickly<font color="#CCCCCC"> so in how</font>

361
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:06,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">its incremented is they actually have 10</font>

362
00:22:02,810 --> 00:22:08,179
results per page over a hundred pages so

363
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:10,790
I've looking into it to try and figure

364
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:13,130
out how<font color="#CCCCCC"> I could get more results and I</font>

365
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:15,230
noticed the sort by button where you can

366
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:17,030
sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> by oldest in</font>

367
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:19,490
next newest index and best match

368
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:21,110
whatever their algorithms do so

369
00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:24,830
potentially you could get three thousand

370
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:26,449
unique results back but in practice<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've</font>

371
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:28,629
generally only get in about fifteen

372
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:33,770
hundred when I hit all<font color="#E5E5E5"> three of those</font>

373
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:35,480
sorting options some other concerns is

374
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:39,160
they have a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of rate limiting</font>

375
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:41,210
that I hit many many many times and

376
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:43,400
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little pop-up they give you</font>

377
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:45,080
they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> do anything but you know time</font>

378
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:47,900
you out for a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then you</font>

379
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:50,720
can get<font color="#E5E5E5"> back in the game and play the</font>

380
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:52,640
great thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the script itself is</font>

381
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:55,880
if you're doing any kind of custom regex

382
00:22:52,640 --> 00:23:00,559
on it the regex takes just long enough

383
00:22:55,880 --> 00:23:02,450
for you to skirt by this so it's

384
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:04,750
actually really efficient and if you

385
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:07,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">ever start running into the issues where</font>

386
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:10,340
pythons start airing out due to these

387
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:12,169
these error messages then you know

388
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:14,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's probably something wrong in the</font>

389
00:23:12,169 --> 00:23:21,080
regex or the search that you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing so</font>

390
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:23,178
it's very instant feedback little bit of

391
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:25,820
a shout out to this guy over here who I

392
00:23:23,179 --> 00:23:28,280
found his you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know github thing where</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> he</font>

393
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:31,220
has a whole ton of dorks in there which

394
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:32,750
most a lot of them I knew already but

395
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:36,140
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are some of them like the gmail</font>

396
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:38,030
stuff that I did not<font color="#E5E5E5"> know about and i</font>

397
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:40,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">think there's about 30 different dorks</font>

398
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:44,120
in there for certain different things

399
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:47,660
yes what<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a dork so very similar to</font>

400
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:51,350
google dorks so the keywords<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you</font>

401
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:54,169
can use to find<font color="#E5E5E5"> certain things so if you</font>

402
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:55,969
have a moment go check that out very

403
00:23:54,169 --> 00:23:57,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">much because there's a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font>

404
00:23:55,970 --> 00:23:59,330
information that's not in these slides

405
00:23:57,470 --> 00:24:02,559
it's in there that you can use get

406
00:23:59,330 --> 00:24:02,559
harvester<font color="#CCCCCC"> to find so</font>

407
00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:11,900
so that is in the plans to start you

408
00:24:10,010 --> 00:24:13,129
know do auto searching things so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

409
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:15,890
don't have to put in your own custom

410
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:18,440
searches and reg exes for<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so you can</font>

411
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:20,030
go like you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know I want private keys</font>

412
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:28,870
it'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> just automatically do it all for</font>

413
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:28,870
you what's up that guy

414
00:24:33,929 --> 00:24:36,559
what

415
00:24:36,659 --> 00:24:44,119
I don't know who that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is if it was close</font>

416
00:24:44,989 --> 00:24:50,820
yet so I actually looked at that and

417
00:24:47,639 --> 00:24:54,779
that string is nowhere in the user name

418
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:57,029
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the email so I have no idea what</font>

419
00:24:54,779 --> 00:25:00,409
that's about I mean I have all the

420
00:24:57,029 --> 00:25:09,239
results we can pull them<font color="#E5E5E5"> up real quick</font>

421
00:25:00,409 --> 00:25:11,299
where is my let's see a whole bunch of

422
00:25:09,239 --> 00:25:11,299

like I have no<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how that password</font>

428
00:25:41,850 --> 00:25:49,709
relates to that account whatsoever so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

429
00:25:46,890 --> 00:25:53,010
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> friends on the internet that i do</font>

430
00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:55,260
not know through<font color="#CCCCCC"> the anonymous dark webs</font>

431
00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:57,540
of the internet and they have told me

432
00:25:55,260 --> 00:26:01,559
that'll tons of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these gmail credentials</font>

433
00:25:57,540 --> 00:26:03,600
do work but<font color="#CCCCCC"> Google is actually really</font>

434
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:05,190
good<font color="#E5E5E5"> at noticing when you're logging in</font>

435
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,959
from an IP address that you haven't

436
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:08,880
normally logged into and then they'll

437
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:12,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">start forcing you to do two-step</font>

438
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:13,770
verification but you can't verify that

439
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:15,179
these are correct passwords because if

440
00:26:13,770 --> 00:26:19,260
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not the correct password you never</font>

441
00:26:15,179 --> 00:26:21,419
do the two-step authentication so very

442
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:22,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">quickly you know just trying it even</font>

443
00:26:21,419 --> 00:26:23,850
though you don't get<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the email</font>

444
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:26,540
address you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> verify</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that they are</font>

445
00:26:23,850 --> 00:26:26,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">correct</font>

446
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:35,490
yeah that's a problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you don't reuse</font>

447
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:35,490
your passwords for sure

448
00:26:38,890 --> 00:26:49,860
yeah there's I did see one password that

449
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:49,860
was 56 simultaneous exits that was fun

450
00:26:50,040 --> 00:27:02,790

465
00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:31,460

you can just get pull everything to

reimage the system but either that or

490
00:30:13,359 --> 00:30:18,989
maybe a Miss configuration that just

491
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:18,989
