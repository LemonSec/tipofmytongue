9
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:46,559
for I get the dubious pleasure of being

00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:50,339
much more anonymous than he is I don't

11

00:01:10,229 --> 00:01:13,860

00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:16,619
for the past year and a half or so while

22
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:19,409
I've been doing this speaking thing for

00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:36,298
little bit better off by the end of the

31
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:39,689
talk in terms of how<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're approaching</font>

00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:42,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">this thing called security and how we're</font>

getting that message out to our

looking for the art of making somebody

do whether they know it or not it

00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:36,018
occurred to<font color="#E5E5E5"> me that I shouldn't give a</font>

without making sure everybody knew that

<font color="#CCCCCC">I was talking about since this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is a talk</font>

00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:44,659
at the end of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the day about</font>

royalties use any imagery so this is

61
00:02:52,099 --> 00:02:58,040
somewhat movie and tech media themes but

62
00:02:55,609 --> 00:03:01,159
there will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be no star wars references</font>

63
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:03,739
directly in the top throw this<font color="#E5E5E5"> out there</font>

right at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> very beginning I've been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

the security business for over 30<font color="#E5E5E5"> years</font>

66
00:03:05,659 --> 00:03:11,870
and I've got my start at that<font color="#E5E5E5"> place if</font>

67
00:03:09,889 --> 00:03:13,430
you guys<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to talk to me later if you</font>

68
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:16,129
want to buy me<font color="#E5E5E5"> drinks I might talk to</font>

00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:20,979
you about<font color="#E5E5E5"> my views on Snowden or the</font>

views on the recent FB i-- apple thing

71
00:03:20,979 --> 00:03:27,379
but you have to buy me a drink or two

72
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:29,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">first I got my start at NSA as a manual</font>

73
00:03:27,379 --> 00:03:34,129
crypt analyst I worked with these things

74
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:36,739
one-time pads in the old days it was all

75
00:03:34,129 --> 00:03:38,298
<font color="#E5E5E5">about communications security and the</font>

76
00:03:36,739 --> 00:03:40,430
communications were either encrypted

77
00:03:38,299 --> 00:03:41,540
before they were transmitted if they

78
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:43,159
were encrypted before they were

79
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:48,138
transmitted you could send them anyway

80
00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:50,929
radio telephone Ashley Morse code code

81
00:03:48,139 --> 00:03:54,409
used to be used even when I was working

82
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:57,199
there but<font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously technology was</font>

83
00:03:54,409 --> 00:03:59,448
advancing and manual crypto systems were

84
00:03:57,199 --> 00:04:00,889
changing and I actually got involved at

85
00:03:59,449 --> 00:04:02,870
the very beginning and some of the first

86
00:04:00,889 --> 00:04:05,590
software-based cryptography which was

87
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:08,090
simply implementations of a one-time tag

88
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:10,129
to try to put some reference on it

89
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:13,069
everybody's seen the moot well have you

90
00:04:10,129 --> 00:04:15,858
seen<font color="#CCCCCC"> the movie and now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm blanking on</font>

91
00:04:13,069 --> 00:04:17,570
the name<font color="#E5E5E5"> thank you the invitation games</font>

92
00:04:15,859 --> 00:04:20,840
everybody seen them anybody seen<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

93
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:24,050
movie so you know what that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is it's an</font>

00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:24,479
Enigma machine when i<font color="#CCCCCC"> started at NSA in</font>

95
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:28,500
the mid

ATS the<font color="#CCCCCC"> fact that and that US and its</font>

97
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:34,200
allies the UK had cracked the crypto<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

98
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:35,370
that was still a secret why was it so

99
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:38,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">low secret because there were still</font>

100
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:40,290
countries using it it was not

101
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:41,909
<font color="#CCCCCC">Declassified that we had broken that</font>

102
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:44,820
which happened way back in World War two

103
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:47,850
until the late 80 just trying to put

104
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:49,500
some reference on it that I'm almost as

105
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:53,910
old it but not quite<font color="#CCCCCC"> as old as Jack</font>

106
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:56,220
Daniel I left almost 20 years<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago go out</font>

107
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:58,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">into the private sector having learned</font>

108
00:04:56,220 --> 00:05:00,630
how to do some penetration testing which

109
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:04,140
later became known as red teaming with

110
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:06,060
in NSA wanted to go save the world and

111
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:08,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">make make more money go out in the</font>

112
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:10,740
private sector so I became<font color="#E5E5E5"> a pen test</font>

113
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:11,790
around the outside<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you know kind of</font>

114
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:14,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">at the very beginning of this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> whole</font>

00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:15,780
internet web security thing so back in

116
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:17,070
those days it<font color="#CCCCCC"> was teaching people how to</font>

117
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:18,780
if you're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be on the internet</font>

118
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:19,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">you really should have a firewall you</font>

119
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:21,330
should<font color="#E5E5E5"> really start thinking about</font>

120
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:23,970
having some sort of a security program

121
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:25,620
and essentially all the things we're

122
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:27,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">talking about today you know changing</font>

123
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:30,270
passwords changing default settings

124
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:31,920
removing hidden default passwords you

125
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:33,930
know this should all sound familiar that

126
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:37,320
we've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about this for over</font>

00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:39,510
20 years ago I guess I made enough

128
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:42,000
people angry enough at some point that

129
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:45,000
somehow i stumbled into pci and i ended

137
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:03,360
because of my extensive experience they

over the last year called the state of

information security that's that was for

143
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:17,880
the hacker cons if I was at other

144
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:21,090
industries I'd call it<font color="#CCCCCC"> cyber security</font>

145
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:22,920
and my message was essentially nothing

146
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:25,500
changed but<font color="#E5E5E5"> as I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to different</font>

147
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:27,750
conferences and hearing other speakers

148
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:30,480
speaking I kept hearing some themes

149
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:32,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">emerged and the biggest</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing that I was</font>

150
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:34,500
in the vibe I was getting from all the

151
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:36,600
talks that I went to<font color="#E5E5E5"> was you know this</font>

152
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:37,520
community particularly the b-sides

153
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,949
hacker

154
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:41,840
community we know a lot about how the

155
00:06:39,949 --> 00:06:44,120
technology works and we know a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot about</font>

156
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:48,138
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> security aspects but if you look at</font>

157
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:49,610
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you look at the media it seems</font>

158
00:06:48,139 --> 00:06:51,949
clear<font color="#CCCCCC"> that something's not working that</font>

159
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:54,590
our message is somehow not getting out

160
00:06:51,949 --> 00:06:56,090
to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> people within companies and</font>

161
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:58,400
organizations that need to hear the

162
00:06:56,090 --> 00:07:00,229
message why because major breaches are

163
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:02,960
still happening<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they're happening in</font>

164
00:07:00,229 --> 00:07:05,360
all in all sectors and all verticals and

165
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:10,159
all industries something seems to be

166
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:11,990
missing this mean came out just a couple

167
00:07:10,159 --> 00:07:14,270
weeks<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think this illustrates</font>

168
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:16,280
one of the problems that we have in the

169
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:20,000
industry which I will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> bold enough to</font>

170
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:22,130
mention<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys sometimes we have an</font>

171
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,780
ego sometimes when we are smarter than

172
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:25,969
others and we know more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than others</font>

173
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:29,150
sometimes we you know we<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a little</font>

174
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:32,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">bit of an ego I think that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> part of the</font>

175
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:35,090
problem so my basic premise is we need

176
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:38,150
to learn as a community how to

177
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:41,750
communicate better to all those other

178
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:44,030
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are needing to hear and know</font>

179
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:45,259
what we know and I've actually been to

180
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:47,659
several talks over the last year that

181
00:07:45,259 --> 00:07:49,069
attempted to do that and<font color="#CCCCCC"> there were some</font>

182
00:07:47,659 --> 00:07:50,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">good elements in those talks but I</font>

183
00:07:49,069 --> 00:07:52,940
thought there was something a little bit

184
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:54,800
miss him still and I've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

185
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:56,659
consultant for<font color="#E5E5E5"> 20 years I've spent 20</font>

186
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:59,960
years going<font color="#E5E5E5"> into literally hundreds of</font>

187
00:07:56,659 --> 00:08:03,050
different companies different

188
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:05,239
environments different you know hostile

189
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:07,219
and non-hostile audiences but always

190
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:08,990
with the goal of I'm a security<font color="#E5E5E5"> expert</font>

191
00:08:07,219 --> 00:08:11,270
or I know a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

192
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:14,389
security than you do I'm here<font color="#CCCCCC"> to teach</font>

193
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:16,099
you educate you in the PCI sense I need

194
00:08:14,389 --> 00:08:17,810
to get you<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> point of compliance of</font>

195
00:08:16,099 --> 00:08:19,729
course i always<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted them to be secure</font>

196
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:22,669
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i would make them compliant but</font>

197
00:08:19,729 --> 00:08:24,349
that's another talk but essentially<font color="#CCCCCC"> i've</font>

198
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:26,299
been in a role of educating and

199
00:08:24,349 --> 00:08:28,130
awareness training in my role of a

200
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:30,169
consultant for<font color="#E5E5E5"> 20 years so I thought you</font>

201
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:31,789
know there must be things that I do that

202
00:08:30,169 --> 00:08:34,130
smart people have figured out techniques

203
00:08:31,789 --> 00:08:36,588
but there but these are things that are

204
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:38,630
probably worthy of sharing with others

205
00:08:36,589 --> 00:08:41,029
as a way to learn how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> communicate</font>

206
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:42,559
differently and better<font color="#E5E5E5"> I also think that</font>

207
00:08:41,029 --> 00:08:44,990
sometimes a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of us don't really have</font>

208
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:47,239
a lot of opportunity<font color="#CCCCCC"> to speak you know</font>

209
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:49,160
there's the stereotype that that the

210
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:51,019
hacker types kind of stay in closed

211
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:53,240
rooms usually without windows and

212
00:08:51,019 --> 00:08:55,759
they're they're happy to be in front<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

213
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:57,949
their technology and you probably know

214
00:08:55,759 --> 00:09:00,350
people like<font color="#E5E5E5"> this maybe you are people</font>

215
00:08:57,949 --> 00:09:02,359
like this but put these types of people

216
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:04,100
sometimes in front of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> small audience</font>

217
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:06,980
in front of people that they don't know

218
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:09,439
a large audience they don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> necessarily</font>

219
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:11,689
have a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> good communication skills</font>

220
00:09:09,439 --> 00:09:14,449
they're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> comfortable with speaking so</font>

221
00:09:11,689 --> 00:09:16,969
the goal of this talk is to try to bring

222
00:09:14,449 --> 00:09:19,639
up some points of tips and indicators of

223
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:20,810
how you might learn to talk better and

224
00:09:19,639 --> 00:09:24,079
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> essentially what I'm trying to</font>

225
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:25,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">get at is what I think is missing so for</font>

226
00:09:24,079 --> 00:09:27,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">example I think it's important when</font>

227
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:29,870
you're speaking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to an individual or a</font>

228
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:31,910
group to get to know them now I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> seen</font>

229
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:33,560
a talk in the last year where basically

230
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:35,029
they said well you know you've got

231
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:37,239
google go out and find out everything

232
00:09:35,029 --> 00:09:39,769
you can find<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> person</font>

233
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:41,870
including social security number don't

234
00:09:39,769 --> 00:09:43,970
need to go that far<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it's helpful to</font>

235
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:45,470
know that the person<font color="#E5E5E5"> might be interested</font>

236
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:47,660
in sports or they're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> interested in</font>

237
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:50,120
sports or you know maybe their kids are

238
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:52,819
on ball teams or maybe their pet owners

239
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:54,980
maybe they<font color="#CCCCCC"> love skiing try to get to</font>

240
00:09:52,819 --> 00:09:56,719
know a little bit about them because

241
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:58,939
that gives you a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an idea</font>

242
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:01,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">of where they're coming from and it</font>

243
00:09:58,939 --> 00:10:04,389
gives you also some tips on later when

244
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:06,920
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to communicate with them</font>

245
00:10:04,389 --> 00:10:11,300
common reference points or knowing where

246
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:13,099
they're coming from so as an example by

247
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:15,709
show of hands how many<font color="#CCCCCC"> people think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

248
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:19,040
greatest hacker movie ever made is flat

249
00:10:15,709 --> 00:10:21,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">pat good nobody ever raises their hand</font>

250
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:28,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">for that we'll skip over to war games</font>

251
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:30,769
anyone one person<font color="#CCCCCC"> 23 sneakers the</font>

252
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:32,899
overwhelming<font color="#E5E5E5"> favor what does that tell</font>

253
00:10:30,769 --> 00:10:34,610
us about this audience what's what is

254
00:10:32,899 --> 00:10:36,290
significantly<font color="#CCCCCC"> different about the movie</font>

255
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:39,370
sneakers then for example the movie

256
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:43,579
wargames which is my<font color="#CCCCCC"> personal favorite</font>

257
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:45,559
more technical I think there's also the

258
00:10:43,579 --> 00:10:47,329
introduction of social engineering in

259
00:10:45,559 --> 00:10:51,019
sneakers much more so than<font color="#E5E5E5"> war games</font>

260
00:10:47,329 --> 00:10:52,550
which as things get better in security

261
00:10:51,019 --> 00:10:54,350
world you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> learn more social</font>

262
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:55,969
engineering techniques to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be successful</font>

263
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:57,950
anybody think hackers is the various

264
00:10:55,970 --> 00:11:00,590
movie hacker movie of all time

265
00:10:57,950 --> 00:11:09,470
what if Angelina Jolie who hadn't been

266
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:12,170
in it well I'm in the interest of<font color="#CCCCCC"> time</font>

267
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:19,610
I'm trying to be expedient here but

268
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:22,640
swordfish anyone Halle Berry it's all

269
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:24,410
about hacking but to have something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

270
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:26,870
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you're speaking in a group large</font>

271
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:28,880
or small some kind of icebreaker gives

272
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:30,680
you an indication a little bit of where

273
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:32,870
the people are coming<font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know this</font>

274
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:34,969
proud says sneakers so I know this crowd

275
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:36,230
largely is thinking about social

276
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:38,690
engineering maybe they're a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit</font>

277
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:40,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">deeper in than my old favorite war games</font>

278
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:45,440
which is how i<font color="#CCCCCC"> use to hack which is over</font>

279
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:49,370
a modem the next thing is<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have learned</font>

280
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:51,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">to listen over the years which sounds</font>

281
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:52,640
may be counterintuitive but the best way

282
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:54,650
to learn how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> communicate it is to</font>

283
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:56,660
learn to<font color="#E5E5E5"> listen and that's in all walks</font>

284
00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:59,300
of life that's no matter where you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

285
00:11:56,660 --> 00:12:01,760
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing it's important for</font>

286
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:03,380
several reasons I think one of our

287
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:05,150
biggest<font color="#CCCCCC"> problems is and I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

288
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:07,490
pretty well understood we<font color="#E5E5E5"> tend to speak</font>

289
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:09,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">a different language than other people</font>

290
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:12,020
in organizations and other people in the

291
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:16,370
industry we have a hacker speak we have

292
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:18,590
a technology speed I saw TV show the

293
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:20,390
other night and it wasn't a technology

294
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:22,010
show but there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a scene where</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

295
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:23,840
waiter brought some dessert out and the

296
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:27,290
person said what is it and the waiter

297
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:28,580
says this is raspberry pi had nothing to

298
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:30,980
do with the show but i'm thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

299
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:32,750
writer has to know techies and he put

300
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:35,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">that in there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just as kind of an easter</font>

301
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:37,850
egg and even in easter egg is hackers

302
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:39,440
fee so learning to listen means you're

303
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:41,870
learning the language of the people that

304
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:44,930
you're talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> to because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you have to be</font>

305
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:47,020
able to put what you know in terms that

306
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:49,760
they understand at the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the day</font>

307
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:51,350
it's it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay we're just talking</font>

308
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:53,870
about this at lunch if you're speaking

309
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:55,700
to a deaf person raising your voice and

310
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:58,280
speaking slowly doesn't do a whole lot

311
00:12:55,700 --> 00:13:00,050
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> good if they don't understand your</font>

312
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:02,240
language they're not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get it if</font>

313
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:04,430
they speak a foreign language how many

314
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:08,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">times have you seen this you try to</font>

315
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:09,569
speak slowly and loudly and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> person</font>

316
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:11,610
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't know your line</font>

317
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:13,500
which somehow they're going to magically

318
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:15,720
understand what you're saying it doesn't

319

<font color="#E5E5E5">work the only thing that works is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

320
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:19,500
learn their language we're Americans

321
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:23,430
they're supposed to learn our language

322
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:26,460
but that's a different story not a movie

323
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:28,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">but it's all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about frog protection right</font>

326

west when you when you learn to<font color="#CCCCCC"> speak</font>

327
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:41,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">their language you're learning the</font>

328
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:43,530
language of the business if you're

329
00:13:41,010 --> 00:13:45,569
working<font color="#E5E5E5"> at a company if it's a customer</font>

330
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:48,900
you're learning what their motivations

331
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:51,900
are what their drivers are these are all

332
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:54,449
necessary things it takes persistence

333
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:56,550
sometimes you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> keep at</font>

334
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:59,640
it it take I think it takes<font color="#CCCCCC"> practice I</font>

335
00:13:56,550 --> 00:14:01,020
used to in my years of consulting used

336
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:03,150
to sit<font color="#E5E5E5"> around the dinner table with my</font>

337
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:05,250
family and try to explain things to them

338
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:07,170
and none of them are really technical

339
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:08,520
but if I could<font color="#E5E5E5"> get to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a point where they</font>

340
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:10,199
were understanding what i was talking

341
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:12,120
about then I thought I was ready to go

342
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:14,850
to the customer<font color="#CCCCCC"> and usually that's where</font>

343
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:18,240
the frustration would begin because I

344
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:20,250
didn't have that much time tell stories

345
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know I said you know understand</font>

00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:23,040
their background understand where

347
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:27,569
they're coming from try to pick the

348
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:29,610
stories that<font color="#CCCCCC"> make sense to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them sports</font>

349
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:31,340
analogies you hear them all the time but

350
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:33,930
not everybody is a sports enthusiast

351
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:37,080
I've been<font color="#CCCCCC"> in audiences is going to sound</font>

352
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:39,359
sexist but you know an audience that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

353
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:42,000
group of women they may<font color="#E5E5E5"> not be into</font>

354
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:44,550
football so they may<font color="#CCCCCC"> not know sports</font>

355
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,160
analogies related to football as an

356
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:49,589
example it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really interesting if you</font>

357
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:51,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">go to a foreign country and that's when</font>

358
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:53,970
I start<font color="#CCCCCC"> to notice all the idioms and</font>

359
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:56,189
axioms and colloquialisms that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have is</font>

00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:59,250
an American and as<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm saying i Mun</font>

361
00:14:56,190 --> 00:15:00,810
realizing you know people<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the UK they</font>

362
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:02,310
don't know American football so they're

363
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:04,530
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to get the football analogy</font>

364
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:06,780
anyway so what does<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mean in terms</font>

365
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:10,230
of soccer and real football and so on so

366
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:13,439
<font color="#CCCCCC">forth anyway for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fun anybody know what</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">movie that is to shout it out big fish</font>

368
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:20,250
very good I'm a crypt analyst by trade

369
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:20,870
and I've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> to many talks about crypto</font>

370
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:22,610
and

371
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:26,270
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> cryptos in the news lately</font>

372
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:28,040
about iphones and things like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

373
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:29,750
you start going to technical talks about

374
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:31,310
elliptic curve cryptography and

375
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:33,980
symmetric and asymmetric cryptography

376
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:37,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">and public key and private key you start</font>

377
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:39,740
to lose<font color="#E5E5E5"> people very quickly so I it down</font>

378
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:41,120
into very simple<font color="#E5E5E5"> terms even if my simple</font>

379
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:43,070
terms aren't even technically accurate

380
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:45,260
sometimes if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can get the point across</font>

381
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:48,200
and the people that are receiving

382
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:49,850
understand oh you mean encryption<font color="#E5E5E5"> means</font>

383
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:51,560
you take something I can read and turn

384
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:53,390
it into something I can't read and

385
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:55,430
there's something<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the middle going on</font>

386
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:57,050
yeah that's all they really need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

387
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:58,489
understand sometimes and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font>

388
00:15:57,050 --> 00:16:00,709
start talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the costs associated</font>

with<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the benefits and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

understand their language which is very

offered their business it's great to be

security you can disagree with that but

406
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:46,209
you also have to find a<font color="#CCCCCC"> balance you have</font>

407
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:48,980
to find a way to<font color="#E5E5E5"> work that attitude and</font>

408
00:16:46,209 --> 00:16:51,050
educate them and enlighten them but also

great job explaining a concept ask them

where did you just hear me say you'd be

417

amazed at how many people times people

418
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:18,290
will come back and you can realize very

419
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:21,169
quickly wow you had no idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> what I was</font>

talking about let me try again<font color="#E5E5E5"> and don't</font>

421
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:26,380
try again<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the same story with the</font>

00:17:51,690 --> 00:18:01,619
assumption because you make an ass out

00:17:54,360 --> 00:18:02,820
of you and um shun oftentimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> when</font>

432
00:18:01,619 --> 00:18:04,230
you're presenting especially as a

433
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:06,539
consultant you have to give results

434
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:08,549
you've gone in and done a pen test a

435
00:18:06,539 --> 00:18:10,740
vulnerability assessment some sort of an

436
00:18:08,549 --> 00:18:13,889
analysis and you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to you got to</font>

technique actually from<font color="#E5E5E5"> my father but I</font>

439
00:18:17,369 --> 00:18:22,350
always<font color="#E5E5E5"> found it was good to start off</font>

440
00:18:19,409 --> 00:18:24,360
with you know say something<font color="#CCCCCC"> good like</font>

441
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:27,689
you know your website<font color="#E5E5E5"> has a lot of</font>

442
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:29,969
pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> colors but and then you move on</font>

443
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:32,429
to the bad you know we<font color="#E5E5E5"> found some issues</font>

444
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:35,100
and then you drop the bomb on them and

445
00:18:32,429 --> 00:18:37,919
the ugly you know there's some default

446
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:40,199
passwords in there so the good the bad

447
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:45,149
and the ugly is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the movie that one's a</font>

448
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:47,970
dead giveaway oh my dad I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to share</font>

449
00:18:45,149 --> 00:18:49,799
with this this part of it when I was a

450
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:52,019
kid I never got straight A's but one

451
00:18:49,799 --> 00:18:53,668
time I came home<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a report card like</font>

00:18:53,669 --> 00:18:59,249
done my dad first thing he said to me

454
00:18:56,159 --> 00:19:03,350
was why did<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get a be scarred me for</font>

455
00:18:59,249 --> 00:19:07,139
life I'm still suffering from it so

456
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:11,189
where do we go<font color="#E5E5E5"> from here practice try to</font>

457
00:19:07,139 --> 00:19:13,379
try to attempt these steps you may<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

458
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:15,659
it's daunting and impossible how many

459
00:19:13,379 --> 00:19:17,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">people want to take the red pill how</font>

460
00:19:15,659 --> 00:19:20,279
many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people want to take the blue pill</font>

461
00:19:17,299 --> 00:19:21,720
it's hard it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not easy to communicate</font>

462
00:19:20,279 --> 00:19:23,730
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> other people and get them to a</font>

463
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:25,110
point of understanding those of us that

464
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:27,320
have been in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> industry a while</font>

465
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:33,229
probably know that you know all too well

466
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:36,330
I would say don't give up it may seem

467
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:39,539
sometimes like it's not worth it I'm

468
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:43,139
sorry everybody know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> the movie is</font>

469
00:19:39,539 --> 00:19:45,690
I know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> this movie</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you were again</font>

470
00:19:43,139 --> 00:19:47,219
now the message of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> war games of was</font>

471
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:50,729
you know the moral of the story was

472
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:52,590
don't play the game because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of my</font>

475
00:19:54,779 --> 00:19:59,940
have often more than one solution but

476
00:19:57,239 --> 00:20:01,529
there is a solution so you know if one

477
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:05,340
thing doesn't work try something again

478
00:20:01,529 --> 00:20:07,200
try something different don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> even think</font>

of security as a game think of it as a

puzzle and recognized at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the end of the</font>

00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:16,499
day that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it takes time it's difficult to</font>

482

do when your especially<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you're</font>

because they have to that takes that

487
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:34,830
takes time it takes hard work it's like

488
00:20:27,419 --> 00:20:36,809
steering the there you go so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

whirlwind you know 30 years of

492
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:48,049
stepping out of your comfort zone if you

<font color="#E5E5E5">haven't done</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this before and</font>

494
00:20:48,049 --> 00:20:52,440
communicating you can do it in a small

495
00:20:50,429 --> 00:20:54,119
group setting do it with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a friend</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

496
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:56,249
<font color="#CCCCCC">say hey I want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> run something by you</font>

497
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:58,289
try to find somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> that isn't as smart</font>

498
00:20:56,249 --> 00:21:00,330
as you or isn't in the tech crown try to

499
00:20:58,289 --> 00:21:02,009
tech crowd try to find<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody that</font>

500
00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:04,109
that's outside and say hey I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> run</font>

501
00:21:02,009 --> 00:21:06,509
something by you give it a whirl see if

502
00:21:04,109 --> 00:21:09,840
it works ask them what they've heard try

503
00:21:06,509 --> 00:21:11,429
it I mentioned the the ego thing at the

504
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:16,830
very beginning with that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know I wish</font>

505
00:21:11,429 --> 00:21:18,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">I was stupid yes sometimes we do no more</font>

506
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:21,809
than others but a lot of its just

507
00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:23,580
education and awareness I find it

508
00:21:21,809 --> 00:21:25,349
challenging to try to teach people<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

509
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:27,418
get them to<font color="#E5E5E5"> a point of understanding and</font>

510
00:21:25,349 --> 00:21:29,820
I feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> like if I can't do that well</font>

511
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:34,859
maybe I'm not as smart as I think I am

512
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:36,899
so that keeps me humble I used the and I

513
00:21:34,859 --> 00:21:39,359
still talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about how I'm bilingual I've</font>

514
00:21:36,899 --> 00:21:41,699
developed<font color="#E5E5E5"> over the years the language of</font>

515
00:21:39,359 --> 00:21:43,649
the tech community but I<font color="#CCCCCC"> also speak the</font>

516
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:44,320
language of the business<font color="#CCCCCC"> non-technical</font>

517
00:21:43,649 --> 00:21:47,439
community

518
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:49,928
and I have found<font color="#E5E5E5"> it essential to get</font>

519
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:52,059
things accomplished in<font color="#E5E5E5"> my customers and</font>

520
00:21:49,929 --> 00:21:53,380
companies I've worked for to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

521
00:21:52,059 --> 00:21:56,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">communicate with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the non-technical</font>

522
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:58,120
community probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> more so important</font>

523
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:59,649
than talking to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the tech proud because</font>

524
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:01,000
it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy to talk to the people</font>

525
00:21:59,649 --> 00:22:04,768
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> catch you on the back to yeah yeah</font>

526
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,769
yeah I get it I get it I agree with<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

527
00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:09,669
to me after<font color="#E5E5E5"> 30 some years in the</font>

528
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:11,169
business I think what really is going to

529
00:22:09,669 --> 00:22:12,580
make a difference ultimately because

530
00:22:11,169 --> 00:22:14,500
everything we've done up to this point

531
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:16,570
doesn't seem to be working very well and

532
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:19,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">the technology certainly not getting</font>

533
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:21,610
easier we still<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to teach</font>

534
00:22:19,059 --> 00:22:23,860
and educate what are still the basic

535
00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:25,479
fundamentals of security knowing what it

536
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:27,580
is you're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to protect knowing that</font>

537
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:29,409
you have to do certain things knowing

538
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:33,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">that there is no such thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as ultimate</font>

539
00:22:29,409 --> 00:22:34,509
security and so on and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so forth we have</font>

540
00:22:33,009 --> 00:22:36,549
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> few minutes left does anybody have any</font>

541
00:22:34,509 --> 00:22:43,419
questions this is your chance to

542
00:22:36,549 --> 00:22:45,158
communicate you have you must have come

543
00:22:43,419 --> 00:22:46,629
in late you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to ask me that after</font>

544
00:22:45,159 --> 00:22:54,090
you've purchased me an alcoholic

button buy me alcohol buy me alcohol and

547
00:22:57,460 --> 00:23:03,490
I last note any other questions comments

548
00:23:00,809 --> 00:23:08,049
you you that were older that's all the

549
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:10,259
original Star Wars agree disagree we're

550
00:23:08,049 --> 00:23:10,259
good

551
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:14,970
sure

552
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:20,530
hmm

553
00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:37,639
so the comment is if you want to get

554
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:40,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">some opportunities to practice join your</font>

555
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:42,170
Toastmasters club local Toastmasters

556
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:43,940
club look it up find one see if there is

557
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:46,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">one my immediate question is what is a</font>

558
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:46,720
Toastmasters club

559
00:24:14,429 --> 00:24:18,869
so it's a group that gets together and

560
00:24:16,259 --> 00:24:20,039
tries to practice communication<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

561
00:24:18,869 --> 00:24:28,350
almost sounds like there's a little bit

562
00:24:20,039 --> 00:24:31,440
of improv in there<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay very good great</font>

563
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:34,379
if any<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you guys happen to be more on</font>

00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:36,210
the East Coast later in june I'm

565
00:24:34,379 --> 00:24:39,449
actually putting together a training

566
00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:41,220
course to try to actually put some of

567
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:43,139
these techniques into practice to try to
