00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:16,080
really besides we try to focus on these

30
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,180
three core principles which is first

31
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:20,040
like building connections we're all here

32
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,020
today in physical meat space once again

33
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:25,080
which I'm happy to report and we're

34
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,520
really here to kind of we're trying to

35
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,960
build the community build more

36
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,820
connections out there

37
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:34,100
help us more grow and effectively learn

38
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,820
yeah the next part kind of ties into

39
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:37,560
that that's the community right we want

40
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,700
to get everybody together from the

41
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,920
community at least once a year and help

42
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,540
strengthen our help strengthen each

43
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:44,759
other cyber security you know it can get

44
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:46,920
a little bit tough on the on The Daily

45
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:49,500
Grind so it's good to take a day break

46
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,720
kind of refresh and get reinvigorated

47
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,640
with you know kind of our passionate

48
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,100
side of the industry

49
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:58,680
and then lastly is careers we really

50
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:01,380
want to help connect people if they're

51
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:03,180
trying to get into cyber security right

52
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:05,700
or if they're trying to you know move up

53
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,860
from like a you know Junior role to an

54
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:09,239
intermediate or an intermediate to a

55
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:11,340
senior role we're trying to help level

56
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:14,280
up individuals so I know a lot of people

57
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,020
have you know helped each other out

58
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:17,940
throughout the community and in their

59
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:20,640
careers and I think that's great to see

60
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,099
love to see more of that

61
00:02:23,099 --> 00:02:24,959
to that end we have a few communities

62
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:26,640
that are specifically designed this year

63
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,340
to help Foster those type of

64
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:31,080
relationships

65
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,140
um

66
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,920
first I want to talk about the

67
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,540
networking and careers community so this

68
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:39,900
is going to be upstairs and in the back

69
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:41,599
and

70
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:45,239
we at 11 A.M through 1 p.m we're going

71
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:46,920
to have kind of a networking recruiting

72
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,840
type event as well as kind of like an

73
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,459
icebreaker to help people get to know

74
00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:52,019
each other so if you're trying to get

75
00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:54,180
into the industry into cyber security or

76
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:56,040
you're trying to level up that'd be a

77
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,080
good thing to stop by and Kirsten is

78
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,660
running that and she's doing a great job

79
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:02,879
as well I just want to make you aware we

80
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:03,780
are going to give certain color

81
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:06,500
wristbands to students that want them

82
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,940
that are kind of basically you know

83
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:10,200
letting you know they might be looking

84
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,780
for an entry-level job right so those

85
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:15,800
are yellow wristbands

86
00:03:18,659 --> 00:03:20,819
we got the home labs and lockpick

87
00:03:20,819 --> 00:03:22,140
Community that's going to be in the next

88
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:26,159
room upstairs 228 so the home lab they

89
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:27,420
have some pretty cool Hands-On

90
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:29,220
experiences you can do there and help

91
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:30,900
you kind of get more experience with

92
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:33,000
setting up different automations at your

93
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,760
house so if you're interested in iot or

94
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,440
just kind of making your life easier

95
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,879
through automation that that's

96
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:39,720
definitely something you should check

97
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,940
out as well as we're going to have some

98
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:43,500
block pick going later in the day today

99
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,360
so if you want to get some hands-on

100
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,000
experience with lockpick definitely head

101
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,540
on up there

102
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:54,540
uh we're fortunate to have Matt lormer

103
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:57,120
and the support of the saint Khan group

104
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,480
to have access to soldering irons this

105
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,959
year so there's limited availability but

106
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:06,319
we do have about 10 stations up there

107
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:10,019
and in addition we have a limited supply

108
00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:13,500
of these these

109
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:17,760
pie Picos I believe which are free of

110
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,620
charge if you just go up there and you

111
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:22,079
do something they'll give you a picot to

112
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,840
help with your lab so

113
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,040
foreign

114
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,840
you do have to solder stuff on it to use

115
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,060
it generally so

116
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:33,600
um we also have an excellent CTF there

117
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,000
is when I checked yesterday there's over

118
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,540
24 challenges and as far as I know you

119
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:42,300
know a lot of these are are new and are

120
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:45,120
tailored around the theme of the event

121
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,380
um right we kind of have like an outer

122
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:48,840
space theme right so

123
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:51,600
um we really highly encourage you to

124
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,180
participate in that as well as we are

125
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:55,560
running some other contests that I'll

126
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:58,800
cover in a minute which Marv and there's

127
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,600
a room upstairs you can go up there and

128
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:04,400
talk to Marv about them at any time so

129
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:08,040
um I think that's all the communities if

130
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,840
you just are looking for a good place to

131
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:10,919
chill

132
00:05:10,919 --> 00:05:13,680
um we there's some round tables in the

133
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,360
CTF community that would be a good place

134
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,620
to just kind of chill out and there's

135
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:18,120
power underneath them if you want to

136
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:21,320
plug in your laptops and all that

137
00:05:22,139 --> 00:05:24,600
speaking of contests

138
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,479
um this is kind of important I'll post

139
00:05:27,479 --> 00:05:30,780
the slides up after this talk but but we

140
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:33,479
have quite a few contests as as the

141
00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:35,580

00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:40,460
physically to receive a prize

144
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:42,840

145
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:43,979

starch was fortunate they provided us

177
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,520
with these books that you're seeing here

178
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,979
and so as long as you checked in using

179
00:07:10,979 --> 00:07:13,199
the Eventbrite app today we're going to

180
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,060
randomly draw names from the checked in

181
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:17,400
people at closing ceremonies and until

182
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:21,138

183
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:23,400

187
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:30,259
are some changes to the venue this year

188
00:07:30,259 --> 00:07:33,539

189
00:07:33,539 --> 00:07:35,220
Content which is awesome please keep

190
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:38,060
submitting for Content we need it

191
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:40,800
