1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,220
are going to start we're just after so

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:04,980
we'll get this going

3
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:07,740
uh some quick introductions I'm Waylon

4
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:08,820
Grange

5
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:11,280
um there's my Twitter do we do Twitter

6
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,259
handles anymore anyways I did the

7
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:17,039
hardware stuff and I am Paul Whiting

8
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:19,140
I did the software part

9
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:20,640
we don't really want to spend time talk

10
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,619
about us so this was one of the last

11
00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:24,539
renders of the board I did out of Kai

12
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:26,939
CAD before we send it off to the shop

13
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:29,220
this is what we assumed it would look

14
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:31,920
like I actually never did a prototype

15
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,559
that was this final board

16
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:36,899
um Computing was joking with me just

17
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:39,540
before this about he says he did a talk

18
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,700
at a hackers con convention where he

19
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:42,960
said in the name of this talk was

20
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,940
there's no rev2 right like you don't

21
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:46,620
have time when you're doing badges like

22
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:49,980
this to do a second run and so really I

23
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:52,980
never saw the finished badge Pro board

24
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:55,860
until the final run the the pre I did

25
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:57,539
have a prototype prior to this but that

26
00:00:57,539 --> 00:00:59,579
prototype did not have a joystick and it

27
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:00,600
was kind of laid out a little different

28
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,219
so I didn't know for sure if everything

29
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:04,140
would work and everything didn't work

30
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:06,299
but we'll get to that point

31
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:08,580
okay so a few points about the badge one

32
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:10,200
it's meant to be broken it's meant to

33
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,939
look like this not necessarily you don't

34
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:13,560
have to you can keep it all together but

35
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,540
each of these little Parts is an

36
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:18,119
individual component that you can use in

37
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:21,240
your own adreno or Raspberry Pi Projects

38
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,520
okay this little tiny one is an

39
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,040
accelerometer and it speaks i2c that's

40
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,720
what all of these cables are is a quick

41
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,939
connect for i2c so if you have an

42
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:31,920
Arduino at home and you want to hook it

43
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,360
to an accelerometer you now have an

44
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,520
accelerometer or you want a joystick for

45
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,840
your Arduino projects that you're

46
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,280
working on at home or you just want some

47
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:41,579
Blinky LEDs all of these things are ITC

48
00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:42,659
and they're meant to be worked with

49
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:43,860
they're meant to be played with with

50
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:47,880
other projects or spark fun I don't mean

51
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,560
to sell any particular vendor but

52
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:52,200
SparkFun has a lot of Quick Connect

53
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,720
devices that you can add to this badge

54
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,700
you can just daisy chain them and throw

55
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,560
them in here they have like a keypad

56
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,740
they have like a speaker some eprom they

57
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:03,540
have some other fun things RFID reader

58
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,240
14 segment displays oh yes yes some some

59
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,818
all LEDs a segment displays you can buy

60
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:11,099
them and then incorporate them in the

61
00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:12,300
badges and Paul will talk about how you

62
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,500
can kind of do that

63
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,319
there's also pins for an Sao header in

64
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:18,900
front of this led so if you you go to

65
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:21,000
Defcon and you get all those S8 headers

66
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,280
you can throw one on right there or Sao

67
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,300
pins

68
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:26,220
see how many badges excuse me you can

69
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:27,360
throw it on the front of there as well

70
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,220
so it's really just meant it's to be a

71
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:30,900
hackers badge it's meant to be a toyed

72
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,400
with it's a little different than our

73
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,780
traditional badges we've done here at

74
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:36,180
this conference in the past

75
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:38,819
um the oh yeah here's an example of some

76
00:02:38,819 --> 00:02:42,180
of those SparkFun devices thrown in line

77
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:43,920
just you can just keep daisy chaining

78
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,620
more and more pieces into the badge

79
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:49,500
so this the main processor on this chip

80
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,140
is a Raspberry Pi Pico this image here

81
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:54,840
the one on the right I have to look at

82
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,819
my hand the set the one on the right is

83
00:02:56,819 --> 00:02:59,400
the one broken off of my badge so you

84
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,260
break it apart and the one on the left

85
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:03,360
is a Raspberry Pi Pico Dev board that

86
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,040
you can buy from a shop they're almost

87
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,720
identical I mean they're the same chip

88
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,660
the the one that the badge has has

89
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:12,300
slightly more memory uh flash base and

90
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:15,239
slightly fewer i o pins exposed but it

91
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:17,459
also has that quick connect port on it

92
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:18,840
where the the one from the store doesn't

93
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,640
but yeah if you were just gonna buy

94
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,780
these from the store this is what you

95
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:23,640
would Dev on that's we try to make this

96
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,200
as similar to that like you can Dev on

97
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,819
this board and do whatever you want it's

98
00:03:26,819 --> 00:03:30,000
a very powerful board it's 103 up to 133

99
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,379
megahertz 264 KB of RAM

100
00:03:34,379 --> 00:03:35,700
um I was telling some I was telling some

101
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:37,620
of the young guys this and they're like

102
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:40,739
can it run Unity no no I can't run Unity

103
00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:42,840
but this is more processing power than

104
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,940
my first PC okay so like this is pretty

105
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:47,099
good for a microcontroller

106
00:03:47,099 --> 00:03:49,560
um but uh yeah from my controller this

107
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,360
is a lot a lot of interfaces a lot of

108
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,560
things you can do with and it's really

109
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,720
easy so it's a really fun intro device

110
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,040
if you want to start playing with

111
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,379
embedded

112
00:03:58,379 --> 00:04:00,420
um the badge itself the all the little

113
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:03,120
components on there they are tiny tinier

114
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,799
than I typically like to do on a badge

115
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:07,739
this is how tiny they are when you're

116
00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:09,900
hand soldering them on all the

117
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:13,019
prototypes we hand soldered them

118
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:15,420
um so you it and the picture on the

119
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:17,579
right was an early prototype for this

120
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:19,858
year's badge that we totally scrapped so

121
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:21,600
it doesn't look like these but it used

122
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,400
the same we had a lot of the same

123
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,380
Hardware but like the design theme we

124
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:26,880
totally scrapped I think going with Rick

125
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,820
and Morty was probably the right idea

126
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:30,360
but

127
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,979
um so the process of building the

128
00:04:31,979 --> 00:04:33,240
prototypes this is the stuff I think is

129
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,979
kind of cool right you you've got a

130
00:04:34,979 --> 00:04:36,720
stencil and you put down solder paste

131
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,280
and then you take your tweezers and put

132
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,720
them or if you if you had a pick and

133
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,100
place you'd do that but for one or

134
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,780
twozies you just place the parts on

135
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:44,580
manually by hand on those little places

136
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:46,440
of solder there I show that picture

137
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,360
because that saw that picture is a

138
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,400
really pretty picture like that solder

139
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,800
paste went just where it's supposed to

140
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,139
you can see how fine that is on some of

141
00:04:55,139 --> 00:04:57,240
those pins it usually doesn't work that

142
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,860
well for me so when I got one that

143
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:00,540
worked like the stencil worked without

144
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:02,040
any smudging or mirroring I was like oh

145
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,840
I gotta take a picture of that

146
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,419
and then I do I don't have a Reflow oven

147
00:05:06,419 --> 00:05:08,759
so what I use to melt the solders I use

148
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:10,740
a heat gun and

149
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:13,440
um this to me is still magic every time

150
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,540
I watch it to watch solder paste turn to

151
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:17,400
solder not only when when the solder

152
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,520
paste um turns to solder like you see it

153
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:23,340
connect but it will actually Center some

154
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:25,380
of the pieces as it heats up I don't

155
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:27,060
even know this is Magic to me but you'll

156
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:28,259
watch as I'm going you see how the

157
00:05:28,259 --> 00:05:30,300
pieces move yes that transistor is

158
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:31,500
supposed to be off like that by the way

159
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,560
but um you you'll see these pieces kind

160
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,660
of uh shift a little sorry I'm holding

161
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:38,880
the heat gun and the camera in one hand

162
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,100
in two hands it's hard for me to keep

163
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,840
the camera on but you can just see how

164
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,000
watch these little resistors uh fall

165
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,900
into place as the as it uh Heats them up

166
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:51,479
you see how they straighten up Isn't

167
00:05:51,479 --> 00:05:52,860
that cool

168
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:54,539
like that's the coolest to me I don't

169
00:05:54,539 --> 00:05:56,100
know maybe it's not cool to you guys but

170
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,180
um I thought I'd show you that because I

171
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:58,560
get excited about that kind of stuff to

172
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,020
just watch it all come together nicely

173
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:01,740
um

174
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:03,479
after hours of putting things down there

175
00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:04,919
off tweezers

176
00:06:04,919 --> 00:06:06,900
but yeah that video should end that's

177
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:07,919
good enough

178
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:09,780
um I have to give thanks to all the

179
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:11,520
volunteers that helped us build these uh

180
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,960
I know this same thing earlier we're not

181
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,820
done but I want to just give thanks to

182
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:16,620
the uh the guys that helped assemblies

183
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:18,600
so when we actually ordered the final

184
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,520
pieces most of the parts were on there

185
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,680
except any through-hole parts and the

186
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,960
screen so we saw it on the screens we

187
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,360
glued them on and then they soldered on

188
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,780
the joystick and then the key uh the

189
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:32,819
battery Ace on the back and then they

190
00:06:32,819 --> 00:06:35,880
hooked up all the the wiring and shoved

191
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,800
them all in packages so we had an

192
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,479
assembly line a lot of people helped

193
00:06:39,479 --> 00:06:41,940
volunteer we appreciate their help to um

194
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:43,800
put all those badges together and that's

195
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,960
the hardware side of it and then we get

196
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,000
to the fun stuff well I don't know

197
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,340
personally if you ask me Hardware is

198
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:51,840
like black magic

199
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:55,080
I'm up there we were up in the um in the

200
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,880
hacking lab up there with the soldering

201
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,020
irons and stuff and I'm just looking at

202
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:00,539
like wow that would be cool right and I

203
00:07:00,539 --> 00:07:02,039
I gravitate towards the Quick Connect

204
00:07:02,039 --> 00:07:04,319
because I just plug and play right

205
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:07,199
that's awesome so uh big cheers out to

206
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,419
uh to Whalen for for his great design on

207
00:07:09,419 --> 00:07:11,220
being able to do this

208
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:15,900
um so I have never done microcontroller

209
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,699
programming before this year of course

210
00:07:17,699 --> 00:07:19,020
it's near the end of the year so that

211
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:20,460
does give me like I can say that I've

212
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:22,199
been doing it for 12 months but really

213
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:24,120
it's been more like six or seven months

214
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,160
or something like that

215
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,479
um we first started out with some

216
00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:29,460
micropython that was our previous badge

217
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:31,319
that we were working on for this one we

218
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:34,020
decided to go with circuit Python and I

219
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:36,599
have to say it's very easy to use okay

220
00:07:36,599 --> 00:07:38,639
and these bullet points were taken from

221
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:41,280
circuit Python's web page you can go

222
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,720
there get all the information that you

223
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,580
want about that

224
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:46,620
um the thing that I find very nice about

225
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:49,860
it is that it uh if you if you take your

226
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:51,960
badge and you plug it into a computer it

227
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,759
will show up as a file system right and

228
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,440
then you can just go in there and modify

229
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:59,340
the files the code directly or I was

230
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:01,319
actually had a saved copy of it just in

231
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:03,539
case I did something stupid and then you

232
00:08:03,539 --> 00:08:05,580
can copy it over and the board will

233
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:07,259
automatically reboot with that fresh

234
00:08:07,259 --> 00:08:08,759
code that you just installed there so

235
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:11,639
it's really awesome very very friendly

236
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:13,740
for new new people like me

237
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:16,139
so this slide would have been much

238
00:08:16,139 --> 00:08:18,720
better at say you know like 10 o'clock

239
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,479
this morning or 10 30 whenever the the

240
00:08:21,479 --> 00:08:23,759
first session was as opposed to being

241
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:25,440
the very last one

242
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,879
um you know you put the batteries in it

243
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:30,419
works you can also attach it via USBC

244
00:08:30,419 --> 00:08:33,179
um when it comes when it starts up this

245
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:36,479
is a Rick or Morty sorry I don't watch

246
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:39,539
that but uh we got the eyes looking at

247
00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:40,919
you right and you can control it with

248
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:43,080
the the joystick moves one eye the

249
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,540
accelerometer moves the other eye uh

250
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:47,399
there's if the the joystick button if

251
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:49,019
you push that it'll change the color of

252
00:08:49,019 --> 00:08:50,580
one of his eyes there's a button on the

253
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:52,200
back you can push it'll change the color

254
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,420
of the other eye and

255
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:57,360
that was it right unless you held down

256
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,760
the joystick button you would see all of

257
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,519
the other demo code that we we provided

258
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:04,260
here for you

259
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:08,160
um so what this uh what it goes to is a

260
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,700
menu page that you can use the joystick

261
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,440
to move that little ball around on the

262
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,300
screen and then you can use the the

263
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:18,420
joystick button to to choose which demo

264
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:21,079
you want to run

265
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:24,420
okay and so we did provide four demos

266
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:26,820
there was the eyes demo my favorite was

267
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:28,920
the Minesweeper demo I thought this was

268
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,779
really awesome I enjoyed working on it

269
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:33,720
hopefully you enjoyed playing it

270
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:36,600
um the neat trick with this one is that

271
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:40,860
I used the the LEDs on the board to

272
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:43,320
indicate how many mines you have left

273
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,720
okay so you you move the ball around if

274
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:48,060
you do one click it will reveal what's

275
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:51,300
under that spot there if you do a long

276
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:53,339
click or long press

277
00:09:53,339 --> 00:09:55,980
uh it will it'll put a flag there right

278
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:57,600
and so then you can kind of keep track

279
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,220
of how many flags and as you plant more

280
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:00,959
Flags you'll see each of the LEDs

281
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:03,180
turning off until hopefully you win the

282
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:04,200
game

283
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,120
I know at least one person won it so

284
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:10,260
congratulations for those who did that

285
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:11,399
um okay

286
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:14,279
there were other demonstrations these

287
00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:16,740
ones don't really I guess I could have

288
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:18,360
made a video about them but they don't

289
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:21,300
make good just a single picture so one

290
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:23,839
of them Cycles the the the lights around

291
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:26,760
and you can control the speed by just

292
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:29,940
pushing on the LED or the the joystick

293
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:31,920
button there there's also a Color

294
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,660
Shifter so depending on how the

295
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:36,240
accelerometer is oriented will change

296
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,680
the color and so you can in theory

297
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,240
rotate your badge around to get every

298
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,040
single color that it can represent which

299
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:46,740
I thought was pretty neat

300
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:48,120
um and so those those are just kind of

301
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,519
some ideas of things that we thought

302
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:53,160
were kind of neat and interesting

303
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,500
um but really what this badge is about

304
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:58,800
is it's about you it's about being able

305
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,959
to have you go home show this to your

306
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:02,640
family and say hey look at the cool

307
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,920
things we can do now what else should we

308
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,660
do with it right

309
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:07,560
um

310
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,600
I I understand that there was at least

311
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,339
one person who decided that they were

312
00:11:11,339 --> 00:11:13,740
going to make a slideshow and so they

313
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,420
uploaded additional pictures in that and

314
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:18,000
then they just had it rotate through

315
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,800
um you know as as Wayland mentioned you

316
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,240
can plug and play a bunch of other

317
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:24,600
components in here and then you can

318
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,700
you can make your own code modifications

319
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:29,160
to do what what you want it to do

320
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,660
so

321
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:32,820
when you connect connect it to your

322
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:35,700
computer via USBC it will show up as a

323
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,399
mounted file system

324
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:40,320
and there's the main code file is

325
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,660
code.pi let's see are we doing okay on

326
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:45,240
time yeah we're plenty

327
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,800
um and the badge will automatically

328
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,180
reload the code so you don't have to

329
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:50,459
worry about it hopefully you get your

330
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:52,140
syntax and everything correct if it

331
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:53,579
doesn't it will spit out an error

332
00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:55,200
message for you unfortunately the screen

333
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,740
is so small it doesn't really help so

334
00:11:58,740 --> 00:11:59,640
um

335
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:02,760
if you know if you do run into problems

336
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,800
that you can't resolve and you want to

337
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,120
get back to a fresh State we have

338
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,399
provided the code that we originally

339
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:13,800
flashed on on my GitHub page and as was

340
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,660
previously mentioned there is a contest

341
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:18,360
for best modification so look forward to

342
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,579
seeing uh the winners of that one thing

343
00:12:20,579 --> 00:12:21,839
I'm going to interrupt you one thing I

344
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:24,060
really like about the badge not just the

345
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:25,980
Raspberry Pi Pico and circuit python or

346
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:27,779
micropython on there is like he said it

347
00:12:27,779 --> 00:12:29,640
showed up as a file mounted file system

348
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:33,000
but there's also a Serial terminal that

349
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,579
allows you to have a python interpreter

350
00:12:35,579 --> 00:12:38,040
on the microcontroller so like if you

351
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,899
have putty or you screen and you connect

352
00:12:39,899 --> 00:12:42,060
to the my controller you can get right

353
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:44,040
to a python interpreter right there and

354
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:47,100
you can be like GPO pin 12 on and if

355
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,540
you've got an LED on it it'll turn on

356
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:51,420
like you can directly run python testing

357
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:52,920
right on right off the board like that

358
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,540
you don't have to like write a python

359
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:56,339
page and save it you can test things

360
00:12:56,339 --> 00:12:58,260
natively in the python interpreter which

361
00:12:58,260 --> 00:12:59,519
is really kind of fun now you're telling

362
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,760
me right

363
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:05,339
yes it is pretty awesome and you know so

364
00:13:05,339 --> 00:13:07,620
to be honest you know I don't know all

365
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,579
the ins and outs of these

366
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:10,920
microcontroller programming things and

367
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,839
so you know we can all learn together

368
00:13:12,839 --> 00:13:14,700
you know hopefully Wayland will always

369
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:17,820
be here to help us out when we need it

370
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:20,279
um however I will turn the time back to

371
00:13:20,279 --> 00:13:22,500
to Weyland about his the issues he saw

372
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,420
yeah so I mentioned in there we put the

373
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:26,760
joystick on there and never tested it

374
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:29,760
um turns out I put the ground on the

375
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,680
wrong PIN for the button

376
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:32,760
um it should have been to the one just

377
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,560
to the left of it

378
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,120
um and so we had

379
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,980
um I'm there's this on some of your

380
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:39,860
badges most of your badges probably have

381
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:42,060
this little connector that's underneath

382
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:44,519
the Red X like a little Bridge jump

383
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:45,899
right there

384
00:13:45,899 --> 00:13:47,339
um and that's how we fixed it for the

385
00:13:47,339 --> 00:13:49,200
majority of the badges

386
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,820
um I actually cut off one of the pins of

387
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:52,560
the joystick before we soldered it down

388
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,480
and then made that bridge instead and

389
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,519
that kind of worked however a handful of

390
00:13:56,519 --> 00:13:57,899
the badges

391
00:13:57,899 --> 00:14:00,600
um that the the joystick even even when

392
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,160
I cut off the pin it was still making

393
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,740
contact and so I had to do this other

394
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:06,779
kind of connection where I removed that

395
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:09,240
little bridge that you had make a little

396
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,040
black wire Bridge from the pin of the

397
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,440
the microcontroller and then this Trace

398
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,600
over here where the big red arrow is

399
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,579
pointing I just scraped it and broke it

400
00:14:17,579 --> 00:14:19,500
so I broke that trace and made a

401
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:20,880
different path

402
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,579
um and that's just because like I said I

403
00:14:23,579 --> 00:14:25,139
thought I followed the schematic but

404
00:14:25,139 --> 00:14:26,459
these parts weren't really well

405
00:14:26,459 --> 00:14:28,800
documented and so when they arrived and

406
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,899
I realized that it didn't match up we

407
00:14:30,899 --> 00:14:33,420
had had to do a last minute fix to get

408
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:36,200
the button to work on the joystick

409
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:39,540
also we found some other issues

410
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:41,880
about the badge a lot of them won't turn

411
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:44,420
on after one reboot for some reason

412
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:47,279
compy kid was very kind and he helped me

413
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:49,500
figure out what the problem was it turns

414
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:52,440
out that the the little flash chip that

415
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:55,260
I'm using with this Raspberry Pi was not

416
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:57,180
initially supported luckily somebody

417
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:59,880
else ran into this problem before us and

418
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:02,519
so they have a branch that had a fix and

419
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:06,120
so I just barely recompiled their branch

420
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,760
and um like

421
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,620
right four minutes three minutes before

422
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:12,660
this talk just uploaded it to that same

423
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:15,420
repo that Paul had right here so there's

424
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:18,120
a new file called firmware.u F2 on this

425
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,800
repo

426
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,139
um and what you do is if you'll on the

427
00:15:22,139 --> 00:15:23,820
back of the little

428
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:25,380
if you're having trouble if you're not

429
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:26,459
having trouble don't worry about this

430
00:15:26,459 --> 00:15:27,839
but if you are

431
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:29,220
um there's two buttons on here one

432
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:30,720
that's labeled BTN and one of those

433
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,260
levels rst rst is reset and BTN is just

434
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:36,720
button but you press them both down and

435
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,000
then let go of the reset button and then

436
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,620
and then after a second let go of the

437
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:43,680
other button and oh after you've already

438
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,600
plugged it into your computer if you do

439
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,240
that then it'll reboot into bootloader

440
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,820
mode where you can upload the new python

441
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:52,740
bootloader just copy over that firmware

442
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:54,199
YouTube you have

443
00:15:54,199 --> 00:15:58,500
uf2 file and it will reload the

444
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,060
bootloader with the fix and it shouldn't

445
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:01,320
and it should be resolved at that point

446
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,899
I'm sorry about that issue unfortunately

447
00:16:03,899 --> 00:16:05,940
it was kind of intermittent so I didn't

448
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:08,160
realize it until we started getting here

449
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,839
and people were having trouble and then

450
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:11,459
it took all day to figure out what the

451
00:16:11,459 --> 00:16:12,899
heck's going on and why is it an

452
00:16:12,899 --> 00:16:14,639
intermittent trouble like that yeah and

453
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:17,040
I I had to actually experience that same

454
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,600
issue where sometimes I put the

455
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,040
batteries in and it just like wouldn't

456
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,560
do anything like so I figured well maybe

457
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,420
I just need to take the batteries out

458
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:25,500
and put them in and jiggle them around

459
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:28,560
and eventually it worked right but yeah

460
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,120
it's good to know that it was actually

461
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:32,339
there's a fix for that on a hardware

462
00:16:32,339 --> 00:16:35,880
level the fix is actually just buying

463
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:39,680
that flash a few extra micro seconds

464
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:43,740
before it initializes it like 60 it was

465
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:44,759
like something like 64 extra

466
00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:46,980
microseconds just to give the flash a

467
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:48,180
little bit longer before it started

468
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:50,339
talking to it and it would work and so I

469
00:16:50,339 --> 00:16:51,660
guess some of the badges sometimes

470
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:53,519
they're happy and they're up and ready

471
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:55,139
in the morning and some of your badges

472
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:58,079
are not morning people so uh we had to

473
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:00,899
have to make that modification

474
00:17:00,899 --> 00:17:02,699
um we talked about that I do have some

475
00:17:02,699 --> 00:17:04,020
extra batteries if your batteries are

476
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:05,520
dead I talked about the joystick so if

477
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,140
your joystick's not working

478
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:08,339
um if this talk was earlier I would have

479
00:17:08,339 --> 00:17:09,419
told you to come upstairs to the

480
00:17:09,419 --> 00:17:12,540
circuits assembly room but um they've

481
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:14,280
all closed up now

482
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,839
um and I told you there's no screen

483
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:17,819
information is not correct anymore I

484
00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:19,319
thought just throwing new flashes would

485
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:20,640
fix it because it would make the problem

486
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,919
go away but that's not true so there's a

487
00:17:22,919 --> 00:17:25,439
new Flash on the repo that Paul had here

488
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:28,140
that's public repo b-sides Salt Lake

489
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:30,299
City badge 2022

490
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:32,700
and I think that's it so a few things

491
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:36,600
this is a Google Forum Anonymous for

492
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,520
