1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,159
absolutely loved that so that's going to

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:04,140
be a tough act to follow I did not bring

3
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:06,960
my ukulele I'm really sorry

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,059
um but I'll see what I can do to keep

5
00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:12,000
you guys awake as well I wanted to start

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,980
out with a brief introduction of myself

7
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:16,680
I know this conference tends to attract

8
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:18,240
a lot of students and I know when I was

9
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,160
a student it was very instructive to

10
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,900
know what other people's career paths

11
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:24,480
were what took them where they ended up

12
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,080
going so so I started my career as an

13
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:29,939
intelligence analyst I am a Intel

14
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:32,220
analyst by trade so straight out of

15
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:35,160
undergrad I went into CIA where I was a

16
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,980
analyst looking at Russian space and

17
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:40,500
then cyber threats military space and

18
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:43,860
cyber threats so I was a CIA for 12

19
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:46,980
years which was great and then I hopped

20
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:49,219
over to IBM where I also did

21
00:00:49,219 --> 00:00:52,140
Intelligence analysis for four years and

22
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,120
then for the past year at IBM I've been

23
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,460
working in the X4 cyber range where we

24
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:57,739
put

25
00:00:57,739 --> 00:01:00,660
organizations through cyber crisis

26
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:04,319
simulations and help them test how they

27
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:06,540
would respond to a Cyber attack in the

28
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:09,180
critical moment and if you'll indulge me

29
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:11,900
for just one moment

30
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:14,340
just for a minute and a half I wanted to

31
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,740
let my good friend Allison Ritter give

32
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:19,619
you a quick tour of the Cyber range in

33
00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:21,299
Cambridge Massachusetts this is the IBM

34
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:23,820
security Command Center

35
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:25,500
my name is Allison Ritter and I'm the

36
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,780
command Center's creative director we

37
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:29,460
are an elite team that helped prepare

38
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:31,799
our clients perform at their best even

39
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:34,500
on their worst possible day our Command

40
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,000
Center is a state-of-the-art security

41
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,920
operations center that uses the latest

42
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,960
threat intelligence to simulate cyber

43
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,340
attacks for clients based on their

44
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:43,259
industry and needs computers

45
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:45,240
simulation is an immersive experience

46
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,860
that is built to test their response to

47
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:49,439
a cyber incident Daniel really on the

48
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,119
day of the experience clients come in

49
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:53,640
and are oriented to the command center

50
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,159
almost immediately after the simulated

51
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,000
breach begins

52
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,979
Command Center the goal is to understand

53
00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:04,020
how the entire organization works

54
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:05,280
together

55
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,579
support

56
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:14,580
buffering problems

57
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:15,959
if we don't get all the way through

58
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:18,500
that's okay

59
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:21,180
I think she still gave you a good

60
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:21,780
um

61
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,760
a good taste

62
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,220
so so that's the command center if that

63
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:29,160
looks at all cool to you and interesting

64
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,900
feel free to get in touch with me and

65
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,520
I'm happy to chat about it

66
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,620
um but what I'm really here to talk

67
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:37,140
about today is kind of a side project

68
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:40,260
that I have been working on that looks

69
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,599
at how ransomware groups are rebranding

70
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:44,519
and

71
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:47,459
um in 2021 law enforcement worldwide

72
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:50,340
accelerated its focus on ransomware

73
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:53,099
threat actors so this renewed emphasis

74
00:02:53,099 --> 00:02:55,680
likely spurred by cyber attacks on

75
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,959
critical infrastructure and supply chain

76
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:00,120
providers such as the colonial pipeline

77
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:03,180
ransomware attack in May 2021 and the

78
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:06,720
attack on caseya in September in 2021 so

79
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,599
as a result of this Focus law

80
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:11,659
enforcement teams worldwide

81
00:03:11,659 --> 00:03:14,519
conducted a number of arrests so they

82
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:17,340
arrested six members of the klopp gang

83
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:21,120
in June 2021 two operators connected to

84
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,720
Revel in October 2021 group associated

85
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,239
with Locker Goga and mega cortex in

86
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:30,959
October 21 and then in January 2022 the

87
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:33,420
Russian Federal Security Service itself

88
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:35,940
which is known for going easy on

89
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:38,700
ransomware actors they arrested 14

90
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,940
operators associated with Regal

91
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:43,140
ransomware groups

92
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:46,200
so facing this increased law enforcement

93
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,200
activity ransomware groups have been

94
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,900
rebranding at an accelerated rate

95
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:53,640
rebranding is when a ransomware gang

96
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,860
changes the name of their group The

97
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:58,080
malware they use in ransomware attacks

98
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,599
and sometimes their infrastructure in an

99
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:03,480
attempt to remake themselves and hide

100
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,120
from law enforcement operations

101
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,120
according to the 2022 X-Force threat

102
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,220
intelligence index the current average

103
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:14,040
lifespan of a ransomware group is 17

104
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:17,040
months after which it is likely to shut

105
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,380
down

106
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:21,418
Rebrand itself or potentially shut down

107
00:04:21,418 --> 00:04:22,979
altogether

108
00:04:22,979 --> 00:04:25,620
so of course law enforcement evasion is

109
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:28,020
not the only reason that ransomware

110
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:29,660
groups Rebrand

111
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:32,639
disagreements and factions within groups

112
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,860
can lead to rebranding or splinters

113
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:38,160
advances in malware attack techniques or

114
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,860
public relations strategies might also

115
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:43,860
prompt ransomware groups to Rebrand and

116
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:46,259
recreate their image with improved

117
00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:48,180
capabilities

118
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:50,820
but whatever the reason behind a Rebrand

119
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:54,300
the implications of this trend are clear

120
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:56,820
that the ransomware groups are not going

121
00:04:56,820 --> 00:05:00,060
away and the individuals behind this

122
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:02,639
activity are likely to continue their

123
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:05,699
trade even if under a different name

124
00:05:05,699 --> 00:05:07,860
thus tracking and understanding

125
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:11,520
ransomware rebrands can help us can help

126
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,380
threat researchers can help law

127
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:15,419
enforcement and potential ransomware

128
00:05:15,419 --> 00:05:18,120
victims better understand cyber criminal

129
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:23,039
groups tactics techniques and procedures

130
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:25,199
including procedures that are enduring

131
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,880
or in procedures that are in flux

132
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,400
anticipate Ransom negotiation tactics

133
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,940
and even unravel the rebranding

134
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:34,320
Labyrinth to reveal the individuals

135
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,660
behind it including for law enforcement

136
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:38,520
action

137
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:41,759
because ransomware groups are for the

138
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,340
most part rebranding to evade law

139
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:46,500
enforcement and mask their true identity

140
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:49,280
the rebranding process is by definition

141
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:54,000
opaque unclear and usually debatable

142
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,220
these are not legitimate businesses

143
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:58,740
releasing clear press statements the

144
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:01,080
company a will now be known as Company B

145
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,820
with a new logo

146
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,919
rather these are cyber criminal groups

147
00:06:04,919 --> 00:06:07,820
attempting to stay under the radar

148
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:12,000
and confuse outside observers thus the

149
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,240
art of tracking ransomware rebrands is

150
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,940
tedious and often uncertain and

151
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:19,860
confidence in the reality of a Rebrand

152
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:22,259
varies from group to group

153
00:06:22,259 --> 00:06:25,319
and also tends to vary over time as more

154
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:27,600
information is made available as

155
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,520
analysts collect additional evidence of

156
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,580
a Rebrand between groups over time

157
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:35,759
confidence in that Rebrand may change

158
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:39,660
in addition it is possible that security

159
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:42,919
researchers or the Press could become

160
00:06:42,919 --> 00:06:47,100
unwitting accomplices in rebranding they

161
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:49,979
can contribute to Confusion by publicly

162
00:06:49,979 --> 00:06:52,020
declaring a Rebrand when one has not

163
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:54,120
truly occurred or mistakenly

164
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,340
misattributing a new ransomware group as

165
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:58,440
a Rebrand of one to which it has no

166
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:01,259
strong relation this is a natural side

167
00:07:01,259 --> 00:07:03,780
effect of investigating a necessarily

168
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:07,199
opaque Maze of relationships the more

169
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,120
security researchers are aware of this

170
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,400
tendency the more likely it is that

171
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,280
caution will prevail in researching and

172
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,380
declaring rebrands and relationships

173
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:18,660
here on this slide is a snippet of a

174
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:22,080
press article about a babook Rebrand to

175
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,300
payload bin a Rebrand that never

176
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:27,300
actually happened but which the

177
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:30,180
ransomware group wanted researchers and

178
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:32,759
the public to think had happened so this

179
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:35,699
is one example of how we can be

180
00:07:35,699 --> 00:07:37,560
unwitting accomplices in this and we're

181
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,479
going to talk about more about babook

182
00:07:39,479 --> 00:07:41,099
and payload bin in a minute

183
00:07:41,099 --> 00:07:43,620
so to illustrate the complicated nature

184
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:45,840
of rebranding I'm going to walk you

185
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:49,020
through three case studies of three

186
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:52,440
stories of actual ransomware rebrands

187
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,840
that we're aware of including the messy

188
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:57,539
and the unclear details that reveal how

189
00:07:57,539 --> 00:07:59,699
these rebranding operations unfold and

190
00:07:59,699 --> 00:08:02,099
what they entail for some of these

191
00:08:02,099 --> 00:08:04,440
rebranding sagas the story is not over

192
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:07,220
and we will probably see more to come

193
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:10,380
and their relationship to other groups

194
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:12,660
is likely to evolve over time

195
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:15,539
so one example of this complicated

196
00:08:15,539 --> 00:08:18,780
nature is the relationship between Maize

197
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:22,080
sekmet and egregor the maze ransomware

198
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,639
group began operations in May 2019

199
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:28,259
establishing a strong business model

200
00:08:28,259 --> 00:08:30,720
that other groups would follow by

201
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,580
creating a public name and shame website

202
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:38,159
and Contracting out ransomware in a

203
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:41,719
ransomware as a service model

204
00:08:41,719 --> 00:08:46,080
Contracting out to Affiliates that task

205
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,260
of infiltrating victims Mays realized a

206
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:52,800
precedent setting level of success in

207
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,279
its attacks and then on November 1st

208
00:08:56,279 --> 00:08:59,820
2020 maze announced that it was shut

209
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:03,360
down going to shut down apparently

210
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,060
in its prime

211
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:08,160
abruptly ending their campaign

212
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,279
before Maize even shut down however the

213
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:13,740
Gregor ransomware gang began operations

214
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:16,440
in September 2020 and his security

215
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,540
researchers began to compare the two

216
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:20,580
strains many were coming to the

217
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:23,160
conclusion that McGregor was maze's

218
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,600
follow-on

219
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,180
yet if one looks closely at the code in

220
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:30,240
Maize and a Gregor ran somewhere the

221
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,860
similarities are not as strong as other

222
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:34,440
rebrands and I have here a snippet of my

223
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,540
research that I've done comparing these

224
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:37,700
groups

225
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:40,380
some of the structured research that we

226
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:42,600
that I've been doing so if anything

227
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,240
McGregor appeared to attract many Maze

228
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,279
Affiliates rather than bare resemblance

229
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:50,339
to mazes tactics techniques and their

230
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:53,220
code and their style but a ransomware

231
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:55,560
Serene to which Gregor did bear strong

232
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:58,140
resemblance was SEC bet

233
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:00,600
so segment began operations in March

234
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,600
2020 four months after maze but

235
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,580
maintained a lower profile and lower

236
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:08,760
attack Tempo when compared to Maize well

237
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,260
there are some code similarities between

238
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:12,600
Maze and segment and Mason McGregor the

239
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,000
code similarities between sekmet and a

240
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,899
Gregor are even more uncanny suggesting

241
00:10:18,899 --> 00:10:21,000
that the same developers were behind

242
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,040
both strains

243
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,640
on February 8 2022 the decryption keys

244
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,800
for Maze and Gregor and segment were

245
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,959
released together on a bleeping computer

246
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:33,600
Forum suggesting a strong connection

247
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,720
between all three groups recorded future

248
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,480
analyst Alan Liska has noted that Maze

249
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,519
aggregor and sekmet were always tied

250
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:44,040
together each scene is a successor of

251
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:44,880
the other

252
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:48,060
and then a flurry of arrests in February

253
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:51,060
2021 probably led to the demise of all

254
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:53,220
three groups a Gregor officially

255
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:55,140
announced it was shutting down that same

256
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:56,519
month

257
00:10:56,519 --> 00:10:57,240
um

258
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,820
segment never made an announcement but

259
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:03,779
it has kind of disappeared and then of

260
00:11:03,779 --> 00:11:05,060
course there's the more recent

261
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:08,100
decryption key release in February of

262
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,380
this year which really probably dealt

263
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:12,720
the final blow so some researchers track

264
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,700
a separate Rebrand from mace to segment

265
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:17,220
and from maze to McGregor While others

266
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:19,140
argue that Maize rebranded to segment

267
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:22,079
and segment rebranded Gregor in any case

268
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:24,480
the precise order of the Rebrand is

269
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,120
unclear but a strong connection between

270
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,899
all three groups is fairly apparent

271
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:34,260
so a second example is dark side to

272
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:36,720
black matter to Black Cat so the dark

273
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,940
side ransomware group is probably most

274
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:40,740
famous for its attack on Colonial

275
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:43,560
pipeline in May 2021

276
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:47,040
intense law enforcement interest in this

277
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,720
group following the attack and

278
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,120
ostensibly law enforcement activity

279
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,459
culminating in the seizure of 2.3

280
00:11:53,459 --> 00:11:56,100
million in Bitcoin from a dark side

281
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:59,100
address led to The Disappearance of this

282
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:02,339
group that same month May 2021 after

283
00:12:02,339 --> 00:12:04,980
less than a year in operation

284
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:07,980
two months later a new group named black

285
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:10,800
matter emerged similarities in

286
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,600
encryption algorithms used by both

287
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,880
Darkseid and black matter including a

288
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,519
custom salsa 20 Matrix used by Darkseid

289
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:20,339
LED security researchers early on to

290
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:22,740
conclude the black matter was a Rebrand

291
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:24,240
of Darkseid

292
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,160
in a subsequent interview with the black

293
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,440
matter representative however the

294
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:31,019
representative stated we are familiar

295
00:12:31,019 --> 00:12:32,940
with the dark side team from working

296
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:35,700
together in the past but we are not them

297
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,800
although we are intimate with their

298
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,120
ideas

299
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,160
intelligence analysts confidence level

300
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,139
on a Rebrand from Dark Side to black

301
00:12:43,139 --> 00:12:45,899
matter has evolved over time in light of

302
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:48,899
new and changing information in

303
00:12:48,899 --> 00:12:51,240
um however at this time and I'm showing

304
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,040
some of my research here again it

305
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,779
appears that the similarities between

306
00:12:54,779 --> 00:12:56,639
ransomware code and encryption

307
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:58,860
ransomware notes leaked sites and ttps

308
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:01,380
between the two groups supports a high

309
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:03,000
confidence assessment in a Rebrand

310
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,820
despite denials from the group not not

311
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:07,860
that we can trust everything a cyber

312
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:10,019
criminal says but

313
00:13:10,019 --> 00:13:13,380
um but that data point the evidence goes

314
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:14,579
against it

315
00:13:14,579 --> 00:13:17,160
so black matter was also a short-lived

316
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,260
ransomware group however they shut down

317
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:22,440
in November 2021 again reportedly due to

318
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:25,019
pressure from law enforcement since then

319
00:13:25,019 --> 00:13:27,839
a new ransomware group named Alpha V or

320
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:30,600
black cat appears to be a Rebrand from

321
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,880
black matter based on similarities in

322
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:36,120
ttps between the two groups a forum post

323
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,519
by a ransomware criminal announcing the

324
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:40,440
Rebrand so this might be a case where we

325
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,480
can

326
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:44,459
trust what they might be saying just

327
00:13:44,459 --> 00:13:45,720
because it's backed by other evidence

328
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,579
and a public interview in which a black

329
00:13:47,579 --> 00:13:50,279
cat representative reinforced suspicions

330
00:13:50,279 --> 00:13:52,139
that the group was a Rebrand from black

331
00:13:52,139 --> 00:13:52,940
matter

332
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:55,680
alphabe Black Cat first appeared in

333
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:59,100
November 2021 and fin seven a group that

334
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:01,339
ex-force threat intelligence tracks is

335
00:14:01,339 --> 00:14:04,880
itg-14 appears to be behind all three

336
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,339
organizations based on our research

337
00:14:08,339 --> 00:14:10,139
as well as research of other security

338
00:14:10,139 --> 00:14:12,300
organizations

339
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:13,980
so

340
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:16,800
um so a third example is bit payment and

341
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,959
its rebrands so a bit payment began

342
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:22,920
operations in June 2017. the initiative

343
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:26,700
of itg 19 also known that's how we track

344
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:29,160
it it's known by other groups as ta-505

345
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:32,279
or even more commonly as evil core

346
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:34,139
this is a cyber criminal group that has

347
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:37,680
existed since at least 2017 and in

348
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:40,680
December 2019 the U.S Department of

349
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:43,019
Treasury placed sanctions on this group

350
00:14:43,019 --> 00:14:46,560
making it illegal for any U.S victims to

351
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:49,680
pay a ransom for bit payment ransomware

352
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,899
attacks obviously this created

353
00:14:51,899 --> 00:14:55,079
complications for the group and their

354
00:14:55,079 --> 00:14:57,300
business model and in response they

355
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:59,760
rebranded for this group in particular

356
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,040
though because of the sanctions it is

357
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:04,199
even more imperative that the actors

358
00:15:04,199 --> 00:15:06,300
behind this ransomware activity hide

359
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:08,459
their true identity when compared to

360
00:15:08,459 --> 00:15:11,000
others so that they get paid

361
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,339
thus the groups rebranding his Tempo has

362
00:15:14,339 --> 00:15:16,680
kept a fast pace and has been combined

363
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:19,339
with occasional masquerading as other

364
00:15:19,339 --> 00:15:22,139
non-sanctioned ransomware groups

365
00:15:22,139 --> 00:15:24,600
there are two potential splinters of bit

366
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,519
payment rebranding

367
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:29,040
um once a Doppel payment in June 2019

368
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,100
and went to wasted Locker in May 2020.

369
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:34,500
so bit payment and Doppel payment share

370
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:37,399
significant overlaps in code

371
00:15:37,399 --> 00:15:39,899
and the payment portals between the two

372
00:15:39,899 --> 00:15:42,420
groups also share similarities however

373
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:45,060
it is still not fully clear whether the

374
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:46,980
same threat actor group is behind

375
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:50,519
bitpaymer and doppelgamer as well as its

376
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:53,100
follow-on grief

377
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,320
similarly the research Community is

378
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,899
divided on the wasted Locker line of bit

379
00:15:57,899 --> 00:16:00,540
payment rebranding so code analysis

380
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:02,399
between ransomware strains suggests that

381
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:04,800
wasted Locker which emerged in May 2020

382
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,139
two months after bitpaymer shutdown

383
00:16:07,139 --> 00:16:09,959
evolved from bitpaymer in addition

384
00:16:09,959 --> 00:16:11,820
there's significant code and technique

385
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:14,279
overlap between wasted locker and Hades

386
00:16:14,279 --> 00:16:17,399
which emerged in January 2021 Phoenix

387
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:20,459
Locker which emerged in April 2021

388
00:16:20,459 --> 00:16:23,339
payload bin which emerged in July 2021

389
00:16:23,339 --> 00:16:25,260
in McCall Locker which emerged in

390
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:27,620
October 2021 so obviously this group

391
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:30,660
rebrands quite frequently is the groups

392
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:32,279
Behind These ransomware strains

393
00:16:32,279 --> 00:16:35,880
consistently evolve their ttps and

394
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,680
evasion techniques to circumvent law

395
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,380
enforcement and sanctions however

396
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:42,240
following this Trail can be relatively

397
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,320
difficult

398
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:46,500
add to this the fact that the Cyber

399
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:49,019
criminal group evil Corps has frequently

400
00:16:49,019 --> 00:16:50,820
attempted to masquerade as other types

401
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:53,399
of ransomware in mid-2021 the group

402
00:16:53,399 --> 00:16:55,920
pretended that its new payload bin

403
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,560
ransomware was actually a follow-on to

404
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,639
babuk

405
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:02,040
ransomware confusing researchers and

406
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:04,160
victims as to the

407
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,679
ransomware lineage of payload bin if you

408
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:09,240
remember that press snippet that I had

409
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:11,579
earlier in the presentation and then in

410
00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:13,980
December 2021 the group pretended to be

411
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:17,040
Rebel a notorious and widespread

412
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:19,439
ransomware group and actually the one

413
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:23,040
that exports incident response saw most

414
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:26,099
frequently as we were helping clients

415
00:17:26,099 --> 00:17:29,040
recover from ransomware attacks

416
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,679
and then in its latest plot twist evil

417
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:34,740
core as of mid-2022 began operating as

418
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:36,799
one of many Affiliates Distributing

419
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:40,620
lockbit ransomware attempting to hide in

420
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:42,900
the noise of non-sanctioned activity in

421
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:45,600
order to evade sanctions and also has

422
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,580
been found behind raspberry Robin

423
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:50,400
attacks which act as a precursor for

424
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,620
ransomware it's more research on this

425
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:54,299
group's evasion techniques unfold

426
00:17:54,299 --> 00:17:56,940
confidence levels and understanding of

427
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:59,880
these rebranding relationships is likely

428
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,860
to evolve as well

429
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:04,080
so to wrap this all together I'd like to

430
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,900
address again why this even matters how

431
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:09,120
is knowing this stuff even helpful for

432
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,280
the world from a defense perspective

433
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,679
rebranding knowledge can inform incident

434
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:15,780
response teams

435
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:18,780
can enable more effective efficient

436
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:21,299
response if an organization is affected

437
00:18:21,299 --> 00:18:23,220
by a ransomware attack knowing the past

438
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:26,039
tactics techniques and procedures used

439
00:18:26,039 --> 00:18:28,140
by the same actors provides an edge in

440
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:29,940
defensive operations and in

441
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:33,000
reconstitution at the same time from a

442
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,520
research perspective

443
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,900
rebranding data can help with possible

444
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:39,140
attribution of malicious activity

445
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:41,280
long-term monitoring of ransomware

446
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,440
actors across multiple rebrandings can

447
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,419
give insight into their preferred

448
00:18:45,419 --> 00:18:48,240
targets end goals and operational

449
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,059
objectives this information in turn can

450
00:18:51,059 --> 00:18:52,980
enable more effective defense resource

451
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:55,140
allocation and potential identification

452
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:57,419
of the actors as well

453
00:18:57,419 --> 00:18:59,640
despite engaging in rebranding

454
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,860
ransomware actors maintain certain

455
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:03,960
levels of institutional knowledge and

456
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:06,179
habits which is one reason why actors

457
00:19:06,179 --> 00:19:09,179
can quickly ramp up operations after a

458
00:19:09,179 --> 00:19:12,000
Rebrand however these habits can also be

459
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,419
used by Savvy cyber security researchers

460
00:19:15,419 --> 00:19:17,760
and practitioners to identify and

461
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:21,780
mitigate ransomware activity and data on

462
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:24,059
rebranding enable enables easier

463
00:19:24,059 --> 00:19:27,360
identification of these Trends as well

464
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,520
so unraveling the Labyrinth of

465
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,500
ransomware group rebrands is fraught

466
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:34,200
with difficulties but it does have many

467
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:37,500
credible benefits as well especially if

468
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,539
understanding a Rebrand can help you

469
00:19:39,539 --> 00:19:41,940
identify the individuals behind the

470
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:43,860
activity and lead to actual law

471
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:47,220
enforcement activity that stops the

472
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:49,860
stops the actions of that actor and also

473
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:52,140
sends a message to others that there is

474
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:54,419
increased risk associated with

475
00:19:54,419 --> 00:19:56,340
ransomware activity

476
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:59,460
so if any of this seems interesting to

477
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:02,580
you if you'd like to become involved let

478
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:04,860
me know I definitely see this as

479
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:06,900
something that not one person not one

480
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:10,080
organization can do alone but we as a

481
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,580
security Community need to be working

482
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:14,460
together to track rebrands so if you

483
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:16,740
were a student looking for a Capstone

484
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:18,780
project and this seems interesting to

485
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:21,179
you let me know I'd be happy to you know

486
00:20:21,179 --> 00:20:23,220
share some of what I've done already and

487
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:25,320
you can build on that if you're a

488
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,600
security researcher an intelligence

489
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,179
analyst interested in joining as well

490
00:20:30,179 --> 00:20:32,880
let me know I think it's important that

491
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,799
we work together the ransomware actors

492
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:36,480
are working together we need to work

493
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,240
together as well to combat this threat

494
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,520
so with that I wanted to end there I

495
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,799
think we have about five minutes left if

496
00:20:43,799 --> 00:20:45,539
you have any questions about ransomware

497
00:20:45,539 --> 00:20:47,760
rebrands or anything else that I have

498
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,539
brought up so far

499
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:00,840
so you mentioned the some of the groups

500
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,960
were taking you know credit for you know

501
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,700
tax or trying to pretend to be other

502
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:07,320
groups what would be like the motivation

503
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:09,539
behind that other than law enforcement

504
00:21:09,539 --> 00:21:12,660
um evasion yeah well evil core likes to

505
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:14,520
do that in particular and that's because

506
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,620
they are sanctioned and so if people

507
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:18,480
know that it's evil core behind the

508
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,460
activity they will know it's illegal to

509
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:23,039
pay them a ransom whereas they if they

510
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:26,400
can convincingly portray themselves

511
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,940
um as another threat group like revel

512
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:32,580
revel is not sanctioned many U.S victims

513
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:35,520
have paid the ransom and so they would

514
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,840
probably have confidence that they would

515
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,760
get money for that so it helps their

516
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:41,039
business model to uh

517
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:45,980
to you know stay a step ahead of people

518
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:53,280
so I don't know if you've seen before

519
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,679
the when people do forensics on like

520
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:58,320
black blockchain uh payments they can

521
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,240
like actually track Bitcoin wallets and

522
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,679
like see and correlate those to

523
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:03,120
businesses and other things which have

524
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,799
you ever seen awesome research that

525
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:06,360
needs to continue yeah so I'm wondering

526
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,799
if you've ever seen

527
00:22:07,799 --> 00:22:10,799
um that correlated to uh like this topic

528
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:13,860
where you can like connect uh ransomware

529
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:17,100
actors to themselves and them rebranding

530
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:19,799
by just tracking their Bitcoin activity

531
00:22:19,799 --> 00:22:22,260
yeah so and admittedly I'm not a

532
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:24,120
cryptocurrency Tracker

533
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:27,179
um but I have uh colleagues who work in

534
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:28,980
that area and I know that they

535
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:31,799
definitely attract rebrands very closely

536
00:22:31,799 --> 00:22:34,020
um I mean they want to identify wallets

537
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:36,539
that belong to specific ransomware

538
00:22:36,539 --> 00:22:38,760
actors right ransomware groups and as

539
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,559
those groups change they're going to

540
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:43,080
want to find the new wallets as well the

541
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,640
truth is we don't know every wallet for

542
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,919
every ransomware actor out there and

543
00:22:46,919 --> 00:22:48,480
even if we do that doesn't mean that we

544
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,700
can stop the payments going through but

545
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:52,799
the more we know the better so yeah I

546
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:55,080
know this research is very pertinent to

547
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,520
them as well and they're wanting to keep

548
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,940
up with rebrands and do it accurately

549
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:03,000
also and when you can track money going

550
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,159
to one specific individual that helps as

551
00:23:05,159 --> 00:23:06,539
well and I know law enforcement is

552
00:23:06,539 --> 00:23:08,520
interested in you know one individual

553
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,200
how much money have they specifically

554
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:14,900
stolen because that helps in prosecuting

555
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:19,620
so my question for you is kind of in

556
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:22,500
regard to the MetaBank hack in Australia

557
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,539
when those ransomware actors hit do you

558
00:23:24,539 --> 00:23:26,820
view that um more governments taking

559
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:28,559
offensive action like the Australian

560
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:30,840
government did is the key to solving

561
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:33,000
this ransomware issue

562
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,659
yeah the ransomware problem is tricky

563
00:23:36,659 --> 00:23:38,880
right ransomware actors have been so

564
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,679
successful especially the past two or

565
00:23:40,679 --> 00:23:42,419
three years how how are they taking

566
00:23:42,419 --> 00:23:45,480
advantage of us like this how is this

567
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:48,419
going forward and I really think it you

568
00:23:48,419 --> 00:23:51,299
know we need to combat it on several

569
00:23:51,299 --> 00:23:53,039
different levels my own personal opinion

570
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:54,539
it's when we get on top of

571
00:23:54,539 --> 00:23:56,940
cryptocurrency and can track that and

572
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:59,280
make it transparent where the money's

573
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,720
going that it's going to stop you know

574
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,900
there's a reason that Ransom kidnappers

575
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:06,120
switching suitcases on the street

576
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:08,340
doesn't happen as frequently because it

577
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:10,500
you know you can see who's trading

578
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:12,840
suitcases and it you know when you're

579
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:15,000
dealing with cash it's just harder to

580
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,640
maintain anonymity

581
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:20,340
um so so I think I think that's going to

582
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:22,380
be the kicker if we can get on top of

583
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:23,760
that but

584
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,620
um I think increased law enforcement

585
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:28,140
action is really important you know in

586
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:30,659
the U.S they've raised the ransomware

587
00:24:30,659 --> 00:24:33,659
issue up to the level of terrorism

588
00:24:33,659 --> 00:24:36,419
um the that we did after 9 11. I think

589
00:24:36,419 --> 00:24:39,120
that's great because I I see it as that

590
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:42,360
level of a threat and but security needs

591
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:44,220
to improve as well right we need to

592
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:45,720
increase our defenses we need to

593
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,640
understand the ttps that ransomware

594
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,980
actors are using we need to secure

595
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:53,220
secure domain admin accounts and don't

596
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:55,620
give access more than you need to and

597
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:57,720
and you know it's all about domain admin

598
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:59,280
they're trying to get to the domain

599
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:01,980
admin accounts and so so you know

600
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:04,200
Security on one side greater law

601
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,780
enforcement activity on another

602
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:08,520
cryptocurrency tracking

603
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:10,500
um and if nothing else just sending the

604
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:12,600
message to ransomware actors that this

605
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:15,960
is risky and this is not a good idea and

606
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,940
there's more legitimate ways to earn

607
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:20,640
money and you can be a security

608
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,220
researcher or whatever it is you know I

609
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:26,820
will say hacktivism used to be huge 2015

610
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:29,760
hacktivism Anonymous was huge that is

611
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,799
not the case anymore in law enforcement

612
00:25:31,799 --> 00:25:35,159
activity helped and and just the risk of

613
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:37,380
the activity helped message that and

614
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:39,179
change that whole Trend so hopefully

615
00:25:39,179 --> 00:25:41,279
that will happen with ransomware too

616
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:43,700
we'll see

617
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:48,179
all right I think we're good thank you

618
00:25:48,179 --> 00:25:50,220
so much for your attention and questions

619
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:54,020
and enjoy the rest of the conference
