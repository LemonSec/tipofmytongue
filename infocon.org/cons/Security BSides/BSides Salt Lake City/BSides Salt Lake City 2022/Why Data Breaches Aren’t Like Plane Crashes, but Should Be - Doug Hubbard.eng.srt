1
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:10,080
um helping growing software companies

2
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,580
build their security program so that's

3
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:13,380
kind of what I

4
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:15,780
the flavor that I'm coming from also I

5
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:17,699
was recently impacted by layoffs so if

6
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:19,080
you like what you hear come talk to me

7
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:20,760
afterwards

8
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,859
um so today you're talking about why

9
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:25,080
data breaches aren't like plane crashes

10
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:26,699
but should be so I got a little story to

11
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:28,019
start off

12
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:29,099
um

13
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:31,519
Maybe

14
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,600
oops maybe not

15
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:46,680
all right

16
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:50,820
um on October 29th 2018 a Boeing 737 Max

17
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:53,100
departed from Jakarta on a routine

18
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,379
domestic flight in Indonesia shortly

19
00:00:55,379 --> 00:00:57,539
after takeoff this pilot struggled to

20
00:00:57,539 --> 00:00:59,579
maintain control of the aircraft the

21
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:01,260
nose of the plane started to continually

22
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:04,920
pitch downward after a few minutes the

23
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,080
plane the pilot lost total control and

24
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,520
the plane crashed into the sea

25
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:11,040
unfortunately it killed all 189 people

26
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,920
on board the flight only lasted 13

27
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,960
minutes

28
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:19,320
just a few months later on March 10 2019

29
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:22,680
a second Boeing 737 Max ran into a

30
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,840
similar issue this one was operated by

31
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,540
Ethiopian Airlines and it left Nairobi

32
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:29,939
Kenya the flight immediately had the

33
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:31,439
same issue the pilot started to lose

34
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:33,119
control of the plane the nose started to

35
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:35,700
pitch downward he eventually lost

36
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:38,759
control and it crashed killing all 157

37
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:41,240
people on board within six minutes

38
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:44,220
these two accidents made international

39
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:46,860
news it was very quick people from all

40
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:48,119
over the world combined from

41
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:50,280
International groups civilian law

42
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,899
enforcement Airline manufacturers

43
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:54,000
Airline operators all cooperating

44
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,860
together to figure out what happened the

45
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:58,259
Boeing 737 has been flying in some

46
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:00,479
versions since the 60s how do two

47
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:03,119
airplanes crash on opposite sides of the

48
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:04,320
world with totally different people

49
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,119
involved so they feared mechanical

50
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:08,940
problems as a result within several days

51
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:11,038
of the acts of the second accident the

52
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:13,980
global Fleet of 737 Max's was grounded

53
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:16,020
not a single plane would fly for more

54
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:18,360
than a year and a half Boeing estimated

55
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,160
that the cost of the groundings was

56
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:24,180
around 18 billion dollars

57
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:26,099
so what happened as a result of all of

58
00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:28,319
these different agencies collaborating

59
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,060
together well they discovered that the

60
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:32,640
root cause was a combination of several

61
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,560
things poor training

62
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,640
software errors mechanical failures and

63
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,420
dangerous marketing so the the 737 Max

64
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:46,140
is a newer version of the 737 the

65
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:48,599
biggest difference is that the engine is

66
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:50,760
a little larger that means it's a little

67
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,260
more fuel efficient and it's cheaper to

68
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:54,239
operate Boeing advertised this is

69
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:56,099
basically saying this is the exact same

70
00:02:56,099 --> 00:02:58,200
plane you're used to just cheaper you

71
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,640
don't need to have a lot of new parts

72
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,019
you don't need to have dramatic new

73
00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:02,580
training for your cruise on how to fly

74
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:03,959
it because it's basically the same

75
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:04,800
airplane

76
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,200
that wasn't entirely true

77
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,540
the larger engine caused a change in

78
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:12,120
aerodynamics what they found is that

79
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,980
during takeoff when you're operating at

80
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:16,680
your fastest acceleration sometimes the

81
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,540
nose of the plane would pitch upwards

82
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:21,659
and you'd risk a dangerous stall rather

83
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:22,980
than trying to solve the problem through

84
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:24,959
aerodynamics or training they decided to

85
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:28,140
use software to fix it so they created a

86
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:30,659
software system that would measure the

87
00:03:30,659 --> 00:03:32,580
take a sensor on the front that would

88
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:33,720
measure what they call the angle of

89
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,000
attack or the pitch of the aircraft if

90
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,040
it ever detected that it was pitching up

91
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,500
too high the tail flaps of the plane

92
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,540
would automatically activate and cause

93
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:44,819
the nose to come downward now what's

94
00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:46,860
interesting is that the pilots did not

95
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:48,540
need to take any intervention for this

96
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:51,000
to happen it happened automatically and

97
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,159
in many cases Pilots might not even be

98
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:55,799
aware that this software existed they

99
00:03:55,799 --> 00:03:57,659
found that some pilots who were flying

100
00:03:57,659 --> 00:04:00,360
the 737 Max only had two hours of

101
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,519
training on the max specifically via an

102
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:04,080
iPad

103
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,599
in both of these plane crashes the

104
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:08,879
sensor on the front malfunctioned and it

105
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,680
the plane thought that it was pitching

106
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,200
upwards too high when in actuality it

107
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,900
was already within a safe path so the um

108
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:17,579
the tail flap started to push it

109
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:19,440
downward which eventually caused it to

110
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,899
plummet to the ground in the case of the

111
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:23,400
Ethiopian Airlines the pilot actually

112
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,320
recognized that this was happening and

113
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,120
deactivated the software but by then it

114
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,660
was too late

115
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:33,240
um so as a result of all of this

116
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,100
they had to make a lot of changes so

117
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,320
they applied these fixes so first they

118
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,000
did a update to the software so they did

119
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,759
a hotfix a patch they improved the

120
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:44,160
diagnostic lights in the cockpit or

121
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,740
improved the UI they also increased

122
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:49,680
training on the crew and provided the

123
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,020
ability for Pilots to override this this

124
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:54,360
software very very quickly so in other

125
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,000
words they changed their Technologies

126
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,860
processes and training when operating

127
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:00,479
the aircraft and what's really

128
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:02,040
significant that I want to focus on here

129
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,780
is this wasn't one company that did a

130
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:05,580
postmortem and then figured out how to

131
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:07,440
make these changes this was every

132
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,680
operator of the 737 Max in the world and

133
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,479
that's how the airline airline industry

134
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,820
operates right when a crash happens

135
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:16,740
there's a lot of attention to it you

136
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:17,880
probably remember somewhere in the back

137
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,680
of your mind hearing about these 737

138
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,780
Macs in the news from a few years ago

139
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,759
people look at it there's a tremendous

140
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:25,800
amount of transparency the fact that I

141
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,940
can tell you about all of this even

142
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:28,500
though I'm not in the aircraft industry

143
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,300
and that you can go on to the Wikipedia

144
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:32,100
articles and read down to the second

145
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:34,380
what happened in a plane crash shows how

146
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:36,539
transparent and open they are and then

147
00:05:36,539 --> 00:05:39,000
the entire industry elevates themselves

148
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,539
as a result of each plane crash

149
00:05:42,539 --> 00:05:45,900
so as a result of all of this the

150
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,880
um it's a tragedy that those folks lost

151
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,259
their lives

152
00:05:49,259 --> 00:05:51,660
but all the other flights that are

153
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:53,580
flying the 737 Max and new Airline

154
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:56,039
designers in a very real sense are now

155
00:05:56,039 --> 00:05:59,039
safer because of that loss and over the

156
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:00,720
course of doing this for more than 100

157
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,580
Years of Airline flight the airline

158
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:05,280
industry is incredibly safe the odds of

159
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,900
an American getting into a plane crash

160
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:10,139
in any year is one in 11 million compare

161
00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:11,520
that with the odds of you getting struck

162
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,080
by lightning sometime in your lifetime

163
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,780
is around one in three thousand so it's

164
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:19,739
dramatically less and

165
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:23,340
it's we we have this safety net that's

166
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:24,660
paid for with the blood of the people

167
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:27,120
who came before us now imagine on the

168
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,139
other hand

169
00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:29,940
if the airline industry treated plane

170
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:32,819
crashes like security incidents right so

171
00:06:32,819 --> 00:06:34,680
here's a fictional notification from a

172
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,300
not real plane crash but this is what I

173
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:38,220
imagine it would look like

174
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:39,780
um we regret to inform you that earlier

175
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:41,639
this year between March 10th and 23rd we

176
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:44,819
suffered a safety incident

177
00:06:44,819 --> 00:06:47,160
between 100 and 300 people may have been

178
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,840
impacted

179
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,759
many of those may have suffered minor

180
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:52,440
injuries

181
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:55,580
oops what happened again

182
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:00,780
um an unknown number may have suffered

183
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:03,539
loss of life for limb we've hired expert

184
00:07:03,539 --> 00:07:04,860
Consultants to figure out what went

185
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:07,199
wrong and to prevent future incidents in

186
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,300
coming months those impacted will be

187
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,800
contacted above and beyond what's

188
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,180
required by law and receive credit

189
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:15,000
monitoring and most importantly

190
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,620
your safety is important to us

191
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,000
um

192
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,259
so

193
00:07:22,259 --> 00:07:24,120
so what why am I talking about Airline

194
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,340
Security in a

195
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:27,000
um

196
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,620
in a security conference well even

197
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:30,360
though we're not in the airline industry

198
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,680
I think there's things that we can learn

199
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,039
from it we have it's good to look at

200
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:36,599
other Industries and take and take a

201
00:07:36,599 --> 00:07:39,240
good thought a good hard think about how

202
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,460
we do things compared to them

203
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:43,139
data breaches are happening at what

204
00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:46,500
seems to be an increasing rate and every

205
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,599
data breach that happens is really a

206
00:07:48,599 --> 00:07:51,180
lesson for the rest of the industry in a

207
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:53,400
perfect world every time a data breach

208
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,080
would happen we would know exactly how

209
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,400
it happened and then we could take

210
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,080
corrective action to prevent all of our

211
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,060
companies from having the same fate in

212
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:01,740
that world we would never have the same

213
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:04,319
data breach twice right we would all

214
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:05,580
correct it and we wouldn't have to go

215
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:06,840
through it again now information

216
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:09,360
security is not the same as the airline

217
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,259
industry there's a lot of different

218
00:08:10,259 --> 00:08:11,880
reasons why for when the risk tolerance

219
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,740
of human lives compared to somebody's

220
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:17,099
address is very very different but I

221
00:08:17,099 --> 00:08:18,180
think there's some things that we can

222
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:21,660
take from it so what what can we do

223
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:23,220
specifically

224
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:23,940
um

225
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:25,440
I would propose that we should learn

226
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,479
from from security events security

227
00:08:27,479 --> 00:08:30,479
things that happen uh when I was first

228
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:32,219
starting to learn about security and I

229
00:08:32,219 --> 00:08:33,360
wanted to make a career out if I was a

230
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,979
college student and I only had like one

231
00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:36,479
or two classes on security so I read

232
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:39,000
security news and as that went on

233
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,559
anytime I come across a term I didn't

234
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:43,020
know I would just Google it and you know

235
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:45,540
what's a SQL injection what's a cve what

236
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:47,040
are all these different things and I

237
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,899
found that within about six months I was

238
00:08:48,899 --> 00:08:51,000
generally security literate like I could

239
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,560
have conversations I didn't know a lot

240
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,959
but I could understand things I knew

241
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:56,640
that I really started to make it when I

242
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,320
started to feel that warm blanket of

243
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,959
cynicism wrap around me

244
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:02,580
so what I'm proposing that we do here

245
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:04,740
that you do is to learn from other

246
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:07,380
people's dumb mistakes right let's take

247
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,000
a look at the data breaches that have

248
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,980
happened how do we draw those lessons

249
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:13,440
out and apply them to ourselves and our

250
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,880
company

251
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,740
experience is really the best teacher

252
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:19,260
but having a data breach is really

253
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:21,180
hard-earned experience you don't really

254
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:23,519
want to go through that and we talk a

255
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:25,019
lot about the technical side of things

256
00:09:25,019 --> 00:09:26,640
but one of the other side effects is

257
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,380
when you did when you pick apart how

258
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:30,240
people handle the data breach you also

259
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,100
see all the horrible PR moves that they

260
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,480
had and you can help your companies not

261
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,620
do the same ones because they may have

262
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:37,200
never thought about it before so

263
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,640
um what we're going to do is I'm going

264
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,440
to go over two different stories from

265
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,940
actual data breaches that happened in

266
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:43,500
the last couple of months how they

267
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,940
happen in some lessons that we can take

268
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:46,920
from them now a lot of times you have to

269
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,480
make some guesses based on limited

270
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,279
information so I'm not presenting all

271
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:51,899
this is factual I'm going to make some

272
00:09:51,899 --> 00:09:53,940
educated guesses and that's totally fine

273
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:55,860
right we're not in a trial we're not

274
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:58,320
trying to sue them we're just trying to

275
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,200
learn and I think that's great

276
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,540
so first one we have is Uber you guys

277
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:04,920
all know about the Uber data breach that

278
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:07,320
happened this year there was a lot to

279
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,940
say about that

280
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:11,040
um so on September 15th of this year

281
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,779
Uber suffered a data breach it's

282
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:14,399
believed to be the work of a teenager

283
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,200
located in the United Kingdom who is

284
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,820
associated with the lapsis hacking group

285
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:20,040
lapsis has made the news a lot they are

286
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:22,500
primarily teenagers in the United

287
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,600
Kingdom they started late last year and

288
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,279
have been very successful at breaching a

289
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:27,899
large number of Brands such as Microsoft

290
00:10:27,899 --> 00:10:31,019
Nvidia Verizon but what's interesting

291
00:10:31,019 --> 00:10:33,300
about them is they're teenagers so they

292
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,339
like attention and they talk a lot about

293
00:10:35,339 --> 00:10:37,860
what they do and so this guy also talked

294
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:39,180
a lot about what he did so a lot of what

295
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,380
I'm going to go through is based on

296
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:42,420
comments that he made publicly to

297
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:43,800
journalists

298
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,320
um and and other people I think it tells

299
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,640
a consistent story because you look at

300
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,560
the statements that Uber has made and it

301
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,899
largely lines up some internal folks at

302
00:10:51,899 --> 00:10:53,940
Uber also said some things that probably

303
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:55,560
you know maybe they shouldn't have that

304
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:56,820
corroborate this as well with some

305
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:58,200
screenshots and things like that so I

306
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,420
think that this is largely true from

307
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:01,980
what happened so

308
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:04,320
what what is what is the breakdown so

309
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,300
the attacker first found a contractor

310
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,800
who worked at Uber and sent him a

311
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,019
phishing email just generic phishing

312
00:11:10,019 --> 00:11:11,760
email got username and password for the

313
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,320
company's VPN

314
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,579
but the VPN was protected by

315
00:11:14,579 --> 00:11:16,200
multi-factor authentication fantastic

316
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:19,320
great uh he tried to log in and it

317
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,360
didn't work it sent a little push notice

318
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,459
to the contractor whose credentials that

319
00:11:23,459 --> 00:11:24,899
belonged to this said hey you tried to

320
00:11:24,899 --> 00:11:27,180
log in was this you yes or no well he

321
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:29,279
didn't click yes so the attacker tried

322
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:31,079
it again and again and again and again

323
00:11:31,079 --> 00:11:32,820
and his phone just kept getting spammed

324
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:34,440
with all of these notices

325
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,959
some journalists said that there was

326
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:38,100
just some fatigue and the guy eventually

327
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:39,660
just clicked yes the hacker actually

328
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:41,339
claimed that the contractor never did

329
00:11:41,339 --> 00:11:43,800
that he followed up with the contractor

330
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:47,399
on WhatsApp said I am Uber I.T

331
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:49,019
um we are having some problems with our

332
00:11:49,019 --> 00:11:50,640
messages you may have gotten a bunch of

333
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,440
notices if you just click once yes

334
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:55,800
they'll stop which is true

335
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,660
um

336
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:59,339
so he did click yes and then the

337
00:11:59,339 --> 00:12:00,839
attacker was in he was Off to the Races

338
00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:02,519
he immediately found a network drive

339
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:03,660
that was mapped that contained a

340
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:05,880
Powershell script with hard-coded admin

341
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,500
credentials to their privileged access

342
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,240
management system

343
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,760
right not uh

344
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,200
not that great

345
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,760
um so privilege access management system

346
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,320
that's like a password manager so we had

347
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,240
all the passwords admin passwords might

348
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,740
I add to many of the SAS applications

349
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:21,779
that Uber was working with so what did

350
00:12:21,779 --> 00:12:24,060
he get access to well he got source code

351
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:26,339
he got AWS and gcp admin for at least

352
00:12:26,339 --> 00:12:27,779
some accounts and projects He got G

353
00:12:27,779 --> 00:12:29,820
Suite admin he got domain admin he got

354
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:31,079
vsphere admin he got Financial

355
00:12:31,079 --> 00:12:32,820
dashboards all of which he posted

356
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:35,100
screenshots of online he got access to

357
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:36,420
Sentinel one so you could remote control

358
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:38,820
laptops he got access to their slack

359
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:40,860
admin and started making posts in their

360
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,839
slack taunting Uber he said attention

361
00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:44,519
Uber's been breached and I am the

362
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:47,100
attacker he then put all sorts of

363
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,480
updates on what happened now the people

364
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,760
at Uber were so confused by this that

365
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,139
they started they thought it was a joke

366
00:12:52,139 --> 00:12:54,000
and they started posting SpongeBob

367
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,980
SquarePants memes and all sorts of other

368
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:57,839
things well security did not think it

369
00:12:57,839 --> 00:12:59,399
was a joke and told everybody hey

370
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:01,440
nobody's allowed to log into uberslack

371
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,260
right now not sure what that was trying

372
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:05,579
to do but hey they were trying to come

373
00:13:05,579 --> 00:13:07,320
up with something right um my personal

374
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,700
favorite

375
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,139
so you got into their hacker One account

376
00:13:10,139 --> 00:13:11,940
and made this public post you can see

377
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:14,459
it's coming from Uber so he's disclosing

378
00:13:14,459 --> 00:13:17,040
his own breach on hacker one Uber's been

379
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,200
hacked and this hacker One account has

380
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,579
been hacked also

381
00:13:20,579 --> 00:13:22,380
uh there's a lot of people who've had

382
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:25,200
some hot takes and poked fun at um Uber

383
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,880
this one's my personal favorite I found

384
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,920
Chris Powell Uber's threat intelligence

385
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,540
is amazing they had the attacker on

386
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:31,860
their own slack providing minute by

387
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:34,820
minute attack updates

388
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,500
so you know we like to poke a little fun

389
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,420
at Uber here

390
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:41,519
um you know they had I feel bad for

391
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:42,779
those folks they've got a lot of work to

392
00:13:42,779 --> 00:13:43,620
clean up

393
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:44,820
um they didn't do everything wrong they

394
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:46,200
did some things right but in this case

395
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:49,139
Uber is our teacher so great Uber what

396
00:13:49,139 --> 00:13:50,459
can you teach us so here's four

397
00:13:50,459 --> 00:13:51,660
takeaways that I thought were

398
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:53,160
interesting

399
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:55,079
um they're not you could probably grab a

400
00:13:55,079 --> 00:13:56,220
few others but here's the ones that I

401
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:58,380
like first off hard-coded credentials

402
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:00,300
are dangerous no joke

403
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:01,560
um they would have a totally different

404
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,720
scenario if they didn't had hard-coded

405
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,980
credentials

406
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:06,240
um

407
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,519
and we all here know that you shouldn't

408
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:11,279
put credentials API tokens in GitHub but

409
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:14,040
do your developers know that and if I

410
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,300
did ask one of your developers or

411
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:16,260
engineers

412
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:17,760
and they knew not supposed to put it

413
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,620
there could they answer where it is

414
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:21,240
supposed to go if they can't give you

415
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,740
that answer what's your company policy

416
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:23,880
for where to store Secrets you've got

417
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:26,459
work to do uh limit access to sensitive

418
00:14:26,459 --> 00:14:28,380
information nine times out of ten when

419
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:29,880
there's a data breach somebody didn't

420
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,380
follow the principle of least privilege

421
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:33,300
and that happened here as well let's

422
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:36,000
just say for an instant that that

423
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,279
um the script with the Powershell script

424
00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:39,360
with hard coded credentials was

425
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,639
necessary for whatever reason right how

426
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:43,139
many people should have had access to

427
00:14:43,139 --> 00:14:43,860
that

428
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:47,160
like three maybe four people in the

429
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,420
whole company

430
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:50,459
what are the odds that that was the case

431
00:14:50,459 --> 00:14:52,740
and this teenager just happened to fish

432
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:54,360
a contractor who was one of those four

433
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,339
people I think that's unlikely so I'm

434
00:14:56,339 --> 00:14:57,540
gonna go on and guess and say that that

435
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:59,339
script was broadly available to way too

436
00:14:59,339 --> 00:15:01,019
many people inside Uber so they should

437
00:15:01,019 --> 00:15:03,480
have had limited access to that

438
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,220
um ensure contractors have security

439
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:06,959
training people forget about contractors

440
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:08,699
a lot of time this contractor was

441
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:10,740
socially engineered did he have training

442
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:12,180
about how to prevent social engineering

443
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:14,820
maybe he did maybe he didn't but I'm

444
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,260
sure everybody thinks he should have a

445
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:17,459
little more now

446
00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:18,360
um

447
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,160
who's providing that training is that

448
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,899
you is that the Contracting Company put

449
00:15:21,899 --> 00:15:23,339
it into your contract how is it going to

450
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:24,480
be tracked how is it going to be managed

451
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,620
what happens if they don't do the

452
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:27,959
training all things to think about and

453
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:29,639
last but I think most important today's

454
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:31,019
Frontier is identity and access

455
00:15:31,019 --> 00:15:33,120
management it used to be you know your

456
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,380
firewall was the edge of your network

457
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:35,820
and all of your data was in this

458
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:37,019
database and once you got into the

459
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:38,820
network it was kind of a GUI Center yeah

460
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:40,800
that's that's 20 years ago

461
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,680
nowadays is our data in databases some

462
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,300
of it is but most of it's in SAS

463
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:47,519
applications our customers or data is in

464
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:48,899
all sorts of different SAS applications

465
00:15:48,899 --> 00:15:51,959
our crms our data Marts uh third-party

466
00:15:51,959 --> 00:15:53,940
managed databases all sorts of things

467
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:55,920
like that how do we get access to those

468
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,920
usernames and passwords so our firewalls

469
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,839
today are usernames and passwords so do

470
00:16:00,839 --> 00:16:02,279
you know what SAS applications have your

471
00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:04,019
customers data do you know how those are

472
00:16:04,019 --> 00:16:06,300
protected do they have multi-factor are

473
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,500
people getting off-boarded are people

474
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,060
getting onboarded that's just as

475
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:10,800
important today as writing good firewall

476
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,440
rules so um

477
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,300
Uber had some great things going they

478
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:16,860
did have some management of it but

479
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:18,360
obviously they could do a little bit of

480
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,500
true up with their password management

481
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,420
especially now

482
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:23,639
all right next lesson so this one is

483
00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:24,899
coming from the city of Detroit I like

484
00:16:24,899 --> 00:16:26,279
this one because it's a small one and it

485
00:16:26,279 --> 00:16:27,420
demonstrates that we can learn lessons

486
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:29,940
from small companies as well so this

487
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:33,360
last summer Detroit had a um

488
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,339
they launched a new retirement website

489
00:16:35,339 --> 00:16:37,800
right and any employee of the city of

490
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,120
Detroit could access it so it wasn't

491
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:42,180
publicly on the internet but it also was

492
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:43,019
um

493
00:16:43,019 --> 00:16:45,420
broadly accessible so on the first day

494
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:47,820
that it launched they had a man came in

495
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:49,139
and he started looking around at the

496
00:16:49,139 --> 00:16:50,699
different things and he found on the

497
00:16:50,699 --> 00:16:52,920
home page links to a bunch of different

498
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,300
other pages and one of those pages

499
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:56,220
contained a spreadsheet that had the

500
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:57,899
names birth dates and Social Security

501
00:16:57,899 --> 00:17:00,180
numbers of his co-workers right he

502
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:01,259
looked at that and said well that's not

503
00:17:01,259 --> 00:17:03,660
right he could have contacted his sis

504
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:04,799
admin and just said hey can we clean

505
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:07,020
this up and maybe he did but he also

506
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:08,939
contacted Fox News Fox News Local

507
00:17:08,939 --> 00:17:10,619
affiliate ran an article about it and I

508
00:17:10,619 --> 00:17:11,880
read that article which I thought I know

509
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:14,099
about it and basically uh city of

510
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:15,959
Detroit claimed we we hired experts to

511
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:18,780
come in clean it up wouldn't you know it

512
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:21,240
we did have some data exposed but only

513
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,640
one person read the data that wasn't

514
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,319
supposed to and they read 68 people

515
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:26,699
they're going to get credit monitoring

516
00:17:26,699 --> 00:17:29,340
and we considered the case closed so a

517
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:31,020
couple of things to pick out about this

518
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:32,179
I think

519
00:17:32,179 --> 00:17:35,280
the pr part is interesting

520
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,820
what are the odds that one person uh

521
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:40,020
actually read that when it was available

522
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:42,240
to all employees and it just happened to

523
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,100
be the one person who reported it to the

524
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:45,600
newspaper you kind of have to read

525
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,280
between the lines on these a lot of

526
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,720
times companies will say there's no

527
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,400
evidence that more than one person was

528
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,400
impacted and that may be true but maybe

529
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,140
that's because there's no evidence

530
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:57,179
because they didn't log in

531
00:17:57,179 --> 00:18:00,299
so I think that logging is a that's

532
00:18:00,299 --> 00:18:01,679
security logging is an important thing

533
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:03,240
that's number nine in the OAS top 10

534
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,980
insufficient security logging and

535
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:06,780
monitoring so auditing can really save

536
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:08,460
you in a data breach it can help change

537
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:09,900
the conversation from one person was

538
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,520
impacted to up to a million people were

539
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,039
impacted and we just don't know the

540
00:18:14,039 --> 00:18:15,179
other thing obviously is security

541
00:18:15,179 --> 00:18:17,100
testing any amount of security testing

542
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:20,220
would have caught this right don't put

543
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:23,460
data that's out to people who shouldn't

544
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:25,260
have access to so broken access controls

545
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:27,360
number one in the owas top ten so when

546
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,500
you're writing out your software you

547
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,580
should have security tests that are

548
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:30,960
specifically testing for broken access

549
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,940
controls have a positive person who

550
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:34,440
should access data or perform an API

551
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,240
action have somebody who's authenticated

552
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,280
or maybe even unauthenticated try to

553
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,419
perform the action and make sure that

554
00:18:39,419 --> 00:18:40,980
they can't

555
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:42,960
so those are a couple of lessons

556
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:43,799
um

557
00:18:43,799 --> 00:18:45,780
people often ask me how do you find

558
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:47,400
these stories there's the perception

559
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,660
that companies are tight-lipped and they

560
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,760
won't tell you anything which is true in

561
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,980
a lot of cases but you'd be surprised at

562
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:54,840
how much is publicly available just by

563
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:57,000
reading through the internet here's a

564
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,679
list of places to go through I put them

565
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:00,059
in order the ones that I like the best

566
00:19:00,059 --> 00:19:01,740
uh leave it up here so you can take a

567
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,059
screenshot if you like industry reports

568
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:04,799
are great to start with Verizon and IBM

569
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:06,120
do a report every year where they

570
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,500
aggregate data from thousands of

571
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,179
companies they won't tell you specific

572
00:19:09,179 --> 00:19:10,799
stories but they'll tell you General

573
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:12,960
trends for example do you know how much

574
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,760
a data breach costs for a company in

575
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,440
your industry and your size because you

576
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,840
should because that's how you get budget

577
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,280
um so those are great to read Google

578
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,080
news is my favorite literally just type

579
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,360
in data breach and see what comes up you

580
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:25,559
can put filters saying just show the

581
00:19:25,559 --> 00:19:27,480
last six months or whatever you'd like

582
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,460
you'll learn really quickly that some

583
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:30,660
places just aren't even worth your time

584
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:32,340
to look at so if it's from a healthcare

585
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:33,900
Hospital Finance like they're not going

586
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:34,880
to tell you anything

587
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,760
Twitter is great I

588
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,260
it's kind of weird right now I guess

589
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:41,700
Twitter's a little weird so we'll see if

590
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:43,080
it's still great in a couple of months

591
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,160
but

592
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,740
um a carefully curated Twitter feed

593
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:48,360
with people commenting on security

594
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,919
incidents will tell you about security

595
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:51,600
incidents before they become mainstream

596
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,820
news so how do you get those people

597
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:56,640
search I mean find people you like but

598
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,140
search on Twitter for data breach and

599
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:00,000
see who's making pithy comments follow

600
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,799
them and then look at who they follow

601
00:20:01,799 --> 00:20:03,780
similarly come to a conference like this

602
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:05,760
if you like somebody who's speaking go

603
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,020
ahead and follow them and look at who

604
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:08,820
they follow sometimes it's nice to have

605
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:10,080
two different Twitter accounts one

606
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,460
that's just for consuming security news

607
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:12,780
and one for everything else that way

608
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:14,460
they don't get all jumbled I've messed

609
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:15,480
that up so if you follow me on Twitter

610
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,799
I'll show you my handle at the end I get

611
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:18,000
a bunch of like

612
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,160
NHL stuff in my feed when I'm looking at

613
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,840
security stuff which because I like the

614
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,880
NHL but um

615
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,620
if they're great Krebs on security I

616
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:27,120
love him he's a journalist who does

617
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,260
security things

618
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:29,460
um so he does a lot of investigative

619
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:30,960
reporting so he doesn't do as much

620
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,520
commentary on the engineering side but a

621
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,220
lot of connecting the dots the

622
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:36,179
register.co.uk is a great one too I

623
00:20:36,179 --> 00:20:37,559
don't hear people talk about that one as

624
00:20:37,559 --> 00:20:39,419
much they're based in the UK so they

625
00:20:39,419 --> 00:20:41,280
tend to focus on European Affairs a

626
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,960
little bit more but they're very cheeky

627
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,299
they're also very technical so they

628
00:20:45,299 --> 00:20:47,700
write some clever articles and if you

629
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:49,980
read about a major breach in like CNN or

630
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:51,120
some of these other things they never

631
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,679
tell you how it happened just what

632
00:20:52,679 --> 00:20:53,760
happened because their audience doesn't

633
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,799
care go check over the register they

634
00:20:55,799 --> 00:20:58,080
might have a good write-up and last but

635
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,640
not least the Equifax Congressional

636
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:00,840
report

637
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,059
um that's one data breach but it's

638
00:21:03,059 --> 00:21:04,799
probably the most well-documented data

639
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:06,419
breach in human history go ahead and

640
00:21:06,419 --> 00:21:08,100
read the report it's like 100 pages long

641
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,960
but probably only about 20 of it is what

642
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,039
you guys would care about it's

643
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:13,080
surprisingly accessible but goes into

644
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,700
tremendous detail of all of the

645
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,620
technical and organizational failures so

646
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:18,360
if you've got some mid-level managers

647
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,919
who don't want to patch their servers

648
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:21,780
show them that report and show how the

649
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:22,799
organizational failures there

650
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:25,760
contributed to the breach

651
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:29,220
um so a good security engineer can

652
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:30,960
secure their own company or a good

653
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,400
security professional helps to secure

654
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,559
their own company a great security

655
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:37,320
professional helps teach others to

656
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,900
secure the company and I think that you

657
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:41,280
should spend a lot of your time talking

658
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,440
to the people and evangelizing security

659
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,840
to them so I would say that we can learn

660
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,460
a lot from these security stories but I

661
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:49,020
think others can learn a lot from them

662
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:50,880
as well there's something that's just

663
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,400
built into our DNA about teaching

664
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,020
lessons through stories that's why the

665
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:57,419
fables are so so popular after so many

666
00:21:57,419 --> 00:21:59,460
hundreds of years

667
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:01,200
it's a lot easier to have a conversation

668
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,120
with somebody that says hey we shouldn't

669
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,799
do this because Uber did this last week

670
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:06,179
and they got breached rather than a

671
00:22:06,179 --> 00:22:07,919
whole bunch of theoreticals

672
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:09,720
um so I think that you should use these

673
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,340
stories and reach out one way that I've

674
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:13,020
done this before and this is just my

675
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:14,280
little adaptation to it you can take

676
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:16,380
from it what you want is the last two

677
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:17,640
places I worked for about two years

678
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:20,220
we've had a monthly meeting at the end

679
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:23,220
of every month on a Friday and we just

680
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:24,539
talk about security news we called it

681
00:22:24,539 --> 00:22:26,520
who got hacked and I'll go through and

682
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:27,720
I'll find a list of three to five

683
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,159
stories of somebody who got of people

684
00:22:29,159 --> 00:22:30,600
who got hacked in the last five months

685
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,880
and we just really basic what happened

686
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,340
so this Uber story was one of them uh

687
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:36,840
what what could they have done to

688
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:39,480
prevent it and how do we stack up are we

689
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,460
making the same mistakes or do we have

690
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:42,840
controls in place that would prevent it

691
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:44,580
as well right so you have some real

692
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:46,159
Frank discussions and sometimes

693
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:49,140
Engineers don't know uh that we have

694
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:50,340
controls in place and it's good to

695
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:52,020
educate them on it so this has been very

696
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:53,700
successful for us

697
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:56,220
um you really uh we we've had let's see

698
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:58,020
my last place we had around 150

699
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:00,360
engineers and we typically have between

700
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:02,220
15 and 30 Engineers show up every month

701
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:04,440
is basically an hour of secure developer

702
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,760
training right how hard is it to get

703
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,980
them to sit through one meeting at for

704
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:09,480
one hour a year and we have people

705
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,100
voluntarily coming and discussing it and

706
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:13,080
they loved it but you got to make it

707
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:14,700
interesting right this could get really

708
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:17,159
dry really fast so we did all sorts of

709
00:23:17,159 --> 00:23:18,780
things to make it fun or else people

710
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:20,280
would never come back so we held trivia

711
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:23,700
contests we did security poetry uh

712
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:24,960
companies only ever get hacked for like

713
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:28,140
six reasons so we did bingo with cards

714
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:29,580
at all the reasons they got hacked

715
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:33,240
YouTube videos played video games

716
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,580
um we did a Family Feud day so here's we

717
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,080
did it on Zoom so I took a screenshot I

718
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:39,179
had this fantastic gold sequin suit and

719
00:23:39,179 --> 00:23:40,919
we gave away prizes with our family feud

720
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:44,580
all themed based on the the incidents

721
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:46,860
that we talked about that day one time

722
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:48,960
we talked about Facebook and so I told

723
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,520
them that I interviewed an Insider at

724
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,659
Facebook that had some extra information

725
00:23:51,659 --> 00:23:53,700
to talk about their data breach and this

726
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:55,080
was a video

727
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:57,659
um Mark Zuckerberg had a lot to say

728
00:23:57,659 --> 00:23:59,460
so that was a lot of fun

729
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:00,840
anyway so what are our takeaways we're

730
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,520
wrapping up here uh read up on current

731
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:03,840
security events

732
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,179
learn from every event and use that to

733
00:24:06,179 --> 00:24:07,679
teach others and now I wanted to make

734
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:11,039
sure that I preach what I teach so I got

735
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:13,060
to make sure that I'm not boring as well

736
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:14,280
[Music]

737
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:16,399
um

738
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:19,320
so uh I'm not much of a musician but you

739
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,340
guys weren't expecting anything anyway

740
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:22,620
so your expectations are low so this is

741
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:23,880
this is one of the things that I did in

742
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,320
one of our presentations just a little I

743
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:27,419
guess like security poem that I I read

744
00:24:27,419 --> 00:24:28,919
to them while we were while we were

745
00:24:28,919 --> 00:24:31,740
getting introduced to the idea

746
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:34,740
foreign

747
00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:40,520
[Music]

748
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:43,919
dedicated try hard to defraud steal or

749
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:46,440
bypass our guard to stay safe from the

750
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:49,020
bad guys why not learn from those who

751
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:51,360
are less wise you can read about their

752
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:54,120
stories in the news about the CEOs and

753
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:57,179
managers whose failed policies processes

754
00:24:57,179 --> 00:24:59,340
and tools have led the lawsuit's best

755
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:01,679
practices and rules then we can discuss

756
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:03,840
analyze and use

757
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:07,320
so sit back but stay on track as we talk

758
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:11,600
about who got hacked

759
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:13,330
thank you

760
00:25:13,330 --> 00:25:15,480
