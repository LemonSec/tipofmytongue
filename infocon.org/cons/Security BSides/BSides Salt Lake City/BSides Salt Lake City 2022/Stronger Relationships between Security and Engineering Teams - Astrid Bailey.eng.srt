1
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:25,980
hello oh there we go

2
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:28,080
hi my name is ostrid Bailey and today

3
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:29,820
I'm going to talk to you about how we

4
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:31,380
build stronger relationships between

5
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:35,219
security and our product teams at Adobe

6
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:37,980
first a little bit about me I'm I've had

7
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:39,780
every title from project manager program

8
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:42,960
manager product owner

9
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,059
um and everything in between

10
00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:46,800
um but I've been in a cyber security

11
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,500
kind of off and on for the last 10 years

12
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,719
I also have dabbled in event technology

13
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:54,180
so this is really fun for me to bring my

14
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:56,879
event world and my cyber security worlds

15
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:59,300
back together

16
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,260
so today's learning objectives we're

17
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:02,699
going to talk about how we get things

18
00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:04,440
positioned more strategically in road

19
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,720
maps how we use some Automation and

20
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,840
standardization to make that easier

21
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,280
um how we work with management and

22
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,680
executive teams to make better decisions

23
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,420
and then how to improve the overall

24
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:16,920
relationships between our Security

25
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,260
leaders and then our leaders throughout

26
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:22,280
the rest of the organization

27
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,119
so first of all what is a security

28
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:27,840
partner so at Adobe we created this role

29
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,820
to really indicate that we don't want to

30
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:31,500
you know play whack-a-mole with security

31
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,180
anymore and we don't want to say hey

32
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:35,100
we're security we're so important you're

33
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:36,540
going to do what we say we really want

34
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:37,860
to have that friendship and that

35
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:40,200
relationship with our product teams so

36
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,060
we chose the name partner to really

37
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:45,600
indicate that we don't want to be the

38
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,600
bully anymore we want to be that partner

39
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,140
relationship

40
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:52,560
um so this is kind of the mission

41
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,780
statement for the team that I run so the

42
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:56,159
way to look at it is I'm a program

43
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,259
manager but we have a whole team of

44
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:00,960
security partners and then I just help

45
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,119
with make that process look easier so

46
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:04,619
that we work standard across the

47
00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:07,219
organization

48
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:10,440
Adobe as you might imagine has a pretty

49
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,959
large security organization so here's

50
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:15,360
three of our pillars we actually have a

51
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,520
fourth one which was Tech GRC

52
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,780
um

53
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:20,879
but we're the security Partners we

54
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:23,160
basically the goal is that we're that

55
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,980
one voice and so instead it still

56
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:27,720
happens unfortunately but instead of

57
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,760
security you know reaching out to every

58
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,319
product team so they feel overwhelmed

59
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:33,120
and they're always getting

60
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,800
um barraged by different people we try

61
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,720
to have like a one-to-one relationship

62
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,400
between the security partner and the

63
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,260
security Champion which I'll talk about

64
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,799
in a second

65
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:44,940
um

66
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:47,099
so what do security Partners do so when

67
00:02:47,099 --> 00:02:48,420
you first hear about a security partner

68
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:50,160
you might think oh it's a project

69
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,140
manager it's a program manager and

70
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:53,519
that's really doing a disservice to

71
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:55,200
their skill set and this is coming from

72
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,900
a program manager so I'm not saying that

73
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:00,000
that's not a valid role I'm I'm betting

74
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,440
my career on the fact that that's about

75
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,080
valid role but these are

76
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,480
um more technical people

77
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,700
oftentimes they're an engineer who was

78
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:09,959
like hey I'd like to get into management

79
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:12,120
and this is our path to that so first we

80
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,980
you know we say let's buck up that

81
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:16,800
technical expertise let's give you an

82
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,019
opportunity to act more like a manager

83
00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:21,180
and then if you like it great like you

84
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:23,400
can move on to maybe managing people who

85
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,019
do this and if you don't like it you can

86
00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:28,159
go back to being an engineer

87
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,860
um this is what I would say is kind of

88
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:34,379
our our flow of what we do so the

89
00:03:34,379 --> 00:03:36,019
security partner program

90
00:03:36,019 --> 00:03:38,459
meets with the security Champions who

91
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:40,260
I'll talk about in a second

92
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:42,299
in the industry we have security

93
00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:45,420
Champions and that has such a wide range

94
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:47,700
of definitions but for now let's say

95
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,140
that a security Champion is somebody

96
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:51,120
who's on the product team

97
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,940
who maybe doesn't work in security all

98
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:55,260
the time but they're interested maybe

99
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:56,819
they want a career in security but

100
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:58,920
they're not sure so we have these

101
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:02,099
volunteer or voluntold positions

102
00:04:02,099 --> 00:04:04,680
where they step up and say you know I'll

103
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,180
help with security but I don't have to

104
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:07,860
be fully in security so there are

105
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:09,599
liaison

106
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:12,540
and the um they meet bi-weekly or

107
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:14,879
monthly or ad hoc depending on how big

108
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,440
that team is

109
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:19,260
and we kind of iterate with them with

110
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:21,540
what we call active management

111
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:23,820
so active management the output of this

112
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:25,620
is that we do clear Focus points for

113
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:27,780
Solutions there's transparency in all

114
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:29,160
levels of management so we really help

115
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,259
with reporting and then we integrate

116
00:04:31,259 --> 00:04:34,880
security work into road maps

117
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:37,139
um how so how do we provide those

118
00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:39,479
Services beyond what we've discussed so

119
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:41,340
far here's our three main we call them

120
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:43,020
our pillars so we've got active

121
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:44,759
management prioritization and

122
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:47,340
communication we spend the majority of

123
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:48,680
our time on the active management

124
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:51,419
generally about 60 percent of our time

125
00:04:51,419 --> 00:04:54,840
is focused on really helping our teams

126
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,300
actively not just saying here do the

127
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,160
work but how do we have those

128
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:02,220
conversations how do we take a teaching

129
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:04,560
mentality as well

130
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,740
and then for example like if a say

131
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,300
leadership comes out with this big

132
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:10,800
security initiative it's super important

133
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,600
and you have to do it well we don't want

134
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,220
to take that top-down approach we really

135
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:16,199
want to look at the backlog of all the

136
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:19,259
security things for that team and say

137
00:05:19,259 --> 00:05:21,660
Here's Where the trade-offs are and help

138
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:23,520
have those conversations and then we can

139
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,620
go back to our security leadership and

140
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:27,300
say hey this product team they can't do

141
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,860
this right now they've got these other

142
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:30,120
priorities you've already asked them to

143
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:33,360
do or we can de-prioritize you know

144
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,460
previous work and say actually based on

145
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,919
the industry this is the most important

146
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:40,520
work for today

147
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:48,840
foreign

148
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:53,060
so who do security Partners work with

149
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:56,400
so here's

150
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,900
um the key players that we work with and

151
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,520
I really want to focus on the left side

152
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,500
of the slide so the security partner and

153
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,120
the security champion and when I start

154
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,620
talking really fast sometimes it's hard

155
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:06,660
to distinguish the two roles but

156
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:08,100
essentially we've got the security

157
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:10,440
partner who I've already talked about a

158
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,120
lot and

159
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,620
um who's my team and then the security

160
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:15,539
Champion who's out in the in the field

161
00:06:15,539 --> 00:06:18,120
or in the product teams

162
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,080
um

163
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,419
and we do all kinds of things we try to

164
00:06:21,419 --> 00:06:22,560
be creative too so the security

165
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,000
Champion's kind of that ground level

166
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,520
they're often a manager a senior manager

167
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,020
but we work all the way up through the

168
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:30,000
VPS and so sometimes we have

169
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,979
conversations about

170
00:06:31,979 --> 00:06:33,600
you know why isn't this moving well I

171
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,979
don't have enough resources I'm really

172
00:06:34,979 --> 00:06:37,199
strapped okay well can we get our rvps

173
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:40,259
together can we get our VP or our even

174
00:06:40,259 --> 00:06:41,940
our CSO can we get them to meet with

175
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:43,560
your team and really stress the emphasis

176
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,360
how important this work is or what the

177
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,520
trade-offs are to the business or even

178
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,440
what sales deals are being held up and

179
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,720
then we can have those conversations all

180
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:54,060
the way up and down that chain which has

181
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:57,020
been super useful

182
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,819
um the other thing that we have really

183
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:01,440
noticed about the security Champions is

184
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,759
that they are our friends and they are

185
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:05,340
allies and the more effective that they

186
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:07,080
are the more likely they are to stay and

187
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,120
then the more effective they become and

188
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,940
so we did a survey uh last year and

189
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:13,259
learned that if somebody is a security

190
00:07:13,259 --> 00:07:15,960
Champion for five years they often give

191
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:18,600
us like 16 hours a week or more but the

192
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,580
newbies give us you know two to five but

193
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:22,440
as they grow in their understanding they

194
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,360
become more effective and they often get

195
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,520
more engaged in those conversations

196
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,020
which is

197
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:30,300
really rewarding and then sometimes if

198
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:31,919
we're lucky they actually say we love

199
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:33,720
security so much can you get help me get

200
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,160
a job over here and then we're happy to

201
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,020
hire them because they bring that

202
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:39,859
product perspective

203
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:43,380
this is another way to look at the swirl

204
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,780
that is a large organization and so you

205
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:48,000
see that the security champion and the

206
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,259
security partner are kind of like the

207
00:07:49,259 --> 00:07:50,819
Hub in the middle of all these Spokes

208
00:07:50,819 --> 00:07:53,280
and and another way to think about this

209
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,900
is that

210
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:57,660
we don't have the bandwidth to

211
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:00,000
um maintain all the relationships we

212
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,680
need in the organization to do security

213
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,840
work and so by having the security

214
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,400
partner kind of be Central to the

215
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,840
security organization and having the

216
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,340
security Champion be Central to the

217
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:10,680
product organization as we reorg our

218
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:13,220
teams or as new leaders are hired or as

219
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:15,240
relationships are developed we're able

220
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,099
to just leverage that person so part of

221
00:08:17,099 --> 00:08:18,599
being a security Champion is really

222
00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:21,120
understanding the org and being in deep

223
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,400
with everyone

224
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,440
um the other aspect here is truly just

225
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,900
to call out the collaboration

226
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,340
um between the two this is a really

227
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:31,560
healthy relationship or it can be and

228
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,360
then we also try to give back and so we

229
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,620
offer training

230
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:36,419
um last quarter I introduced what I call

231
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:39,299
the Rockstar Awards so our top security

232
00:08:39,299 --> 00:08:41,700
Champions were honored in a meeting and

233
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:44,520
then um rcso actually emailed them to

234
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,020
thank them and their whole management

235
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:47,760
chain up through VP which was really

236
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,760
rewarding to see um them get impacted

237
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,380
and then their managers emailed us back

238
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:54,000
and said oh my gosh thank you I'm going

239
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,500
to put this as a part of their check-in

240
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,180
and I'm this will be a part of their

241
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:59,339
next promotion and so just really trying

242
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:00,180
to

243
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:02,519
um look for the simple ways to thank our

244
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:04,140
Champions and make it a really rewarding

245
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:07,699
program to be a part of

246
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,940
um so one of the things that we do we um

247
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:14,339
we also do risk assessments so we have

248
00:09:14,339 --> 00:09:17,040
all kinds of inputs of

249
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,660
um different you know we've got

250
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:20,160
different tools that tell us where our

251
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,080
vulnerabilities are we have different

252
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,060
um initiatives that come through and so

253
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:26,339
as you see the the whole point of the

254
00:09:26,339 --> 00:09:27,899
security Partners is to help Wade

255
00:09:27,899 --> 00:09:30,839
through that soup for our teams and then

256
00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:32,519
do some analysis and keep those

257
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:34,080
conversations going

258
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,420
so that we end up with road maps get

259
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:39,060
well plans which I'll talk about later

260
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:40,440
um we help with escalations to

261
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:43,620
leadership and then obviously extensions

262
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:47,399
and approvals

263
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,500
so now that I've set the foundation for

264
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,779
exactly what we do I'll go through our

265
00:09:51,779 --> 00:09:54,000
learning objectives so the first one is

266
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,519
how we get position asks position more

267
00:09:56,519 --> 00:09:59,040
strategically on road maps

268
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,399
so Adobe has probably 200 product teams

269
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:04,740
and services or more I usually just use

270
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:06,120
a general number because it changes all

271
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,399
the time but we have 14 security

272
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:11,279
Partners so we can't do a one-to-one

273
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:12,959
um and so this is one of the ways that

274
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:14,760
we look at the teams who need the most

275
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:15,839
attention

276
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:19,200
would be by visibility and risk so you

277
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,580
know our bigger products that it always

278
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:22,740
known for say Photoshop for example like

279
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:24,860
if that got popped it would really

280
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:27,300
impact our reputation versus our

281
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:28,980
internal teams you know their

282
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:31,980
they may or may not be exploitable at

283
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:33,180
least on

284
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:35,220
on the outside

285
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:37,080
and so we don't need to spend as much

286
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,300
time with them so we rank them based on

287
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,620
this

288
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:41,279
um

289
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:44,220
and then we move them into what we call

290
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:47,040
our our tiers or our support models so

291
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,720
full support these are our big beefy

292
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,519
applications they need a lot of

293
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:52,140
attention they meet with a security

294
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:54,120
partner every two weeks sometimes more

295
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,040
if they're you know trending yellow or

296
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,120
red

297
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,040
and then our lower teams like I

298
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,959
mentioned who don't need that day-to-day

299
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:03,420
hand-holding we can often manage them

300
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:05,279
with slack or just the occasional email

301
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:07,200
or conversation

302
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,300
so then each security partner gets a mix

303
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:11,040
of teams so they get some

304
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,079
some big ones or some problem children

305
00:11:13,079 --> 00:11:15,480
and then they get like some easier ones

306
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,640
so that they they generally have between

307
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:23,339
maybe three and eight teams to manage

308
00:11:23,339 --> 00:11:26,279
and then those teams if there are some

309
00:11:26,279 --> 00:11:28,620
of our acquisition products for example

310
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:30,540
have tons and tons of teams well they

311
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:32,940
may boil up into

312
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:34,620
um they may have a super Champion or

313
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:36,300
they may have multiple Champions feeding

314
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:39,199
into the same meeting

315
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,360
um so this is

316
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,980
How uh

317
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:45,899
this is an example of our roadmap so

318
00:11:45,899 --> 00:11:48,420
that bottom box there instead of showing

319
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:49,680
our security room Maps because we all

320
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,360
know that would be bad

321
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,579
um this is kind of just what they look

322
00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:54,899
like so we

323
00:11:54,899 --> 00:11:57,120
we work through we bucket the work we do

324
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,160
work with other security teams within

325
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:01,860
Adobe so whether it's compliance whether

326
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:03,180
it's something that a red team has found

327
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:06,540
whether it's um like tooling to build

328
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:09,240
out those roadmaps so the prioritization

329
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:12,240
part is a is a collaboration but then we

330
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,800
really try not to be ticket pushers so

331
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,360
they do come out in jira tickets but we

332
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,279
try to be thoughtful and strategic on

333
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:20,600
how we schedule these things out

334
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:23,519
say we have a team that is you know

335
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:25,019
we've given them a road map but that's a

336
00:12:25,019 --> 00:12:26,519
little bit overwhelming they're actually

337
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:29,339
we would categorize them as a at a

338
00:12:29,339 --> 00:12:32,220
yellow risk or even red instead of you

339
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:34,560
know saying well just do the road map we

340
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,420
do what we call a path to yellow or a

341
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:38,700
path to Green so we put their roadmap

342
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,980
aside for a second and we come up with a

343
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:43,079
shorter more strategic road map to

344
00:12:43,079 --> 00:12:44,940
really show them how to get back to that

345
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:47,519
risk rating the more positive risk

346
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:49,500
reading whether it's yellow or green and

347
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:52,019
make it bite-sized and then if it if

348
00:12:52,019 --> 00:12:55,980
they need it we will meet with their VPS

349
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:58,440
once a week or more just to make sure

350
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,820
that they're getting that emphasis and

351
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,560
they're getting those resources so in

352
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,180
the past we've been able to help teams

353
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:04,860
you know up their head count if they

354
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:08,060
just were slipping behind

355
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,200
um

356
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,360
so number two here

357
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,700
Automation and standardization this is

358
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:16,019
what we call the reporting funnel

359
00:13:16,019 --> 00:13:19,260
because as I mentioned before we make

360
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:20,760
sure to have relationships across the

361
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,260
organization so you see the security

362
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:24,360
Champion they get tons of detail they're

363
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,639
up at the top but as you go down the

364
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,560
organization they might get less detail

365
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,820
but they're still getting the same

366
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:31,500
message and we're it's really important

367
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:32,700
to us that they're getting the same

368
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:34,440
message all the way through the

369
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,639
organization

370
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:38,040
previously we you know we'd have great

371
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,540
conversations at the executive team

372
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:41,459
level and we have great conversations at

373
00:13:41,459 --> 00:13:43,680
the security champion level and then

374
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,660
that middle layer was like I don't know

375
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:46,980
what the hell you're talking about and

376
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:49,440
so we really um have introduced and are

377
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,660
working to refine all levels of

378
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:53,399
dashboarding and Reporting so that

379
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:55,740
everybody gets that same message one of

380
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:57,839
the ways that we do that is we we have

381
00:13:57,839 --> 00:13:59,760
dashboards but we email them out once a

382
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,760
month to our teams and we give them a

383
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:05,160
week and then we send their VP report so

384
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,720
we send them here's what you look like

385
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,560
now

386
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,720
work with us let's improve this before

387
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,399
we send out the VP report and that's

388
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:13,139
been really helpful in building our

389
00:14:13,139 --> 00:14:14,760
relationship in that trust because we're

390
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,139
not telling on them we'd rather that

391
00:14:16,139 --> 00:14:19,139
they were doing well but you know if you

392
00:14:19,139 --> 00:14:20,579
don't do what we're asking then we are

393
00:14:20,579 --> 00:14:21,600
going to continue to have that

394
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,839
conversation

395
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,459
this is an example of what our

396
00:14:26,459 --> 00:14:28,860
dashboards look like at least a mock-up

397
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:31,079
version and it and this is what's

398
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:34,339
emailed out as a report

399
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:37,860
um

400
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:40,980
so then you see here that's a typo so

401
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,120
you can ignore the learning objective

402
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,980
one we're not back there

403
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:46,380
um but we we show the risk status we do

404
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:48,420
the dashboards we have actionable plans

405
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:50,160
and focus points

406
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,079
we have other little automations to help

407
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:54,060
put that like slack notifications or

408
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:56,040
emails when critical loans are opened

409
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:58,399
that kind of thing

410
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:02,100
so moving on to learning objective three

411
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:04,380
this is how we help executive teams make

412
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:07,019
better decisions

413
00:15:07,019 --> 00:15:08,880
so as I just discussed getting

414
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,579
leadership buy-in is super important and

415
00:15:11,579 --> 00:15:13,680
another way we do this is through our VP

416
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,360
meetings we're kind of revising what

417
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,240
this looks like Adobe got a new CSO

418
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,920
four or five months ago and so we're

419
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,380
building this out again but we're having

420
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:24,540
VP meetings and then what we've learned

421
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:27,060
with VPS is dashboards are great and

422
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:28,680
they're helpful we have one dashboard

423
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,779
for example we send out that compares

424
00:15:30,779 --> 00:15:32,940
them against their peers so

425
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:35,579
which VPS really don't like to see that

426
00:15:35,579 --> 00:15:36,899
they're not doing as well as their peers

427
00:15:36,899 --> 00:15:38,399
that's been very effective but one of

428
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:40,079
the other ways that we do it is through

429
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:43,199
stories for example one of the teams

430
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:45,480
that's kind of my sister team is our

431
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,860
sales engagement so they answer all

432
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:48,959
those questionnaires for customers

433
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:50,880
and when we're having issues with

434
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,320
certain VPS or we're just meeting with

435
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,300
them in general and maybe they're not

436
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:55,800
doing their pen test findings or they're

437
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,839
not remediating the best thing to come

438
00:15:57,839 --> 00:15:59,940
to them is say like oh well you know if

439
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:01,500
you would do these we could unlock like

440
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,060
10 million dollars or 100 million

441
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:04,680
dollars or you know you're really

442
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,660
holding us up because they really hate

443
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:10,079
being the Cog that's holding up Revenue

444
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:12,360
and then we've also earned a lot of

445
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,740
respect from our security partner

446
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:16,139
program and so unlike more of a

447
00:16:16,139 --> 00:16:18,660
hierarchical situation like our security

448
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:19,980
Partners come to those meetings and

449
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,779
they're able to talk to the VPS directly

450
00:16:21,779 --> 00:16:24,420
which has been a really great

451
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:26,100
relationship building and speaks to the

452
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:27,600
fact that we are learning how to

453
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,279
communicate with VPS and the way that

454
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,920
they most appreciate

455
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,979
um

456
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:40,740
so over and over we found that they

457
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:42,540
get excited about metrics that impact

458
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:44,940
customers and we educate them on how

459
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:46,620
that security hygiene

460
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:47,940
um so instead of just like here's what

461
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,380
the product impact is really shifting

462
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:51,060
that conversation to customer impact

463
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:53,639
whether it's Investments needed

464
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:54,360
um

465
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:57,959
or metrics and then Adobe security

466
00:16:57,959 --> 00:16:59,820
actually now rolls into what we call the

467
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:01,860
trust organization and so we are

468
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:03,899
actually paired up with legal and so we

469
00:17:03,899 --> 00:17:05,339
are also reframing those conversations

470
00:17:05,339 --> 00:17:07,380
to be more about how do we instill trust

471
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:09,359
in our customers so yes security is what

472
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:11,160
we can get behind especially being in

473
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,500
security but you know you go to a

474
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,459
product team and they're like okay

475
00:17:14,459 --> 00:17:16,199
that's great but I have all these other

476
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:17,880
features that are going to make me money

477
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,740
and so how do we bring that back

478
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:21,179
together and say no we're not just

479
00:17:21,179 --> 00:17:22,559
asking you to do security things because

480
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:24,059
we're passionate we're asking you to do

481
00:17:24,059 --> 00:17:26,040
security things because we want to be a

482
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,540
trusted organization and we want to

483
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:29,100
continue to grow the faith that our

484
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:32,059
customers put in US

485
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:37,440
um so I hope you've enjoyed this brief

486
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,660
overview of our program so far but for

487
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:41,400
our final objective I'm going to talk

488
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,660
about how to improve overall

489
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:43,980
relationships between our Security

490
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:47,460
leaders and our product team leaders

491
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:49,380
so we're constantly iterating this

492
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:50,520
program

493
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,860
um it were especially as we've gone

494
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:55,799
through a couple of reorgs at Adobe and

495
00:17:55,799 --> 00:17:57,780
it always brings room for new

496
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:59,580
opportunity as new leaders come to the

497
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:01,440
fold with different opinions

498
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,020
and so will we all we get a lot of

499
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:05,220
questions like are you still going to be

500
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:06,840
a security partner program are you still

501
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,039
going to provide that same level of

502
00:18:08,039 --> 00:18:09,539
service and the answer is yes but it's

503
00:18:09,539 --> 00:18:11,880
also no because we don't want to stay

504
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:14,100
here we want to continue to grow we want

505
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:15,480
to make it a more efficient better

506
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:18,000
program for everyone

507
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,380
so what are the things that's really

508
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:21,840
important to me in particular in my role

509
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:25,320
is that I am really working on how do we

510
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:27,360
add those feedback models how do we do

511
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,860
better surveys

512
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:31,020
I have to take some classes on you know

513
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:32,580
data analysis like how do we get those

514
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:34,200
good insights and how do we make sure

515
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,700
that you know I'm very proud of our

516
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,700
program but I need that product

517
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:40,080
perspective as well like I want them to

518
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,299
come to us and tell us if it is or isn't

519
00:18:42,299 --> 00:18:43,919
working because I'm just

520
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:45,780
you know I'm not close enough to their

521
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:48,660
day-to-day and so we're doing surveys

522
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,400
amongst our leaders we're doing surveys

523
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,900
amongst the internal teams that we work

524
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:54,299
with we're doing surveys amongst even

525
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:56,160
just our team like what's it like to be

526
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,020
on this team because we really want that

527
00:18:58,020 --> 00:18:59,820
feedback and then over time I'm tracking

528
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:01,620
those results too so we can have a great

529
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:04,760
satisfaction score

530
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,140
and so lastly I want to talk about two

531
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:08,820
major efforts

532
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:11,460
that we're undertaking this year to make

533
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:13,559
the product teams lives easier the first

534
00:19:13,559 --> 00:19:15,900
is a bi-weekly initiatives meeting so as

535
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:17,220
I said before we've got like four

536
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:19,440
pillars of Security leaders all trying

537
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,240
to funnel into our program sometimes

538
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,500
around our program we're trying to get

539
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,419
them through our program but that means

540
00:19:24,419 --> 00:19:26,820
that initiatives are changing a lot more

541
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:28,919
frequently and so I lead a bi-weekly

542
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:31,140
meeting where I bring together our two

543
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:32,940
directors and two VPS so basically our

544
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:35,280
csos directs and we go through you know

545
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,720
what work they're asking of the product

546
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,419
teams what's come through what resources

547
00:19:39,419 --> 00:19:41,100
it would need and then hopefully

548
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:43,980
prioritize those and ideally maintain

549
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:45,720
consistency on priority so they're not

550
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,400
changing all the time unless it's really

551
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:51,299
important and making those leaders

552
00:19:51,299 --> 00:19:53,280
um work it out amongst their peers what

553
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,780
exactly their priorities are at the

554
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:55,860
company

555
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:57,720
and the second one which I'm most

556
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:00,120
excited about is what we call our

557
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,980
um our cab or customer Advisory Board

558
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:04,020
not to be confused with a change

559
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:06,059
Advisory Board I spent a very long time

560
00:20:06,059 --> 00:20:07,380
in a meeting with somebody until right

561
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:08,520
at the end they go well you are the

562
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,799
change Advisory board right like I am

563
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:12,960
not I've been telling you forever I am

564
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,580
not your channel but the customer

565
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:16,620
Advisory board so we have our Champions

566
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:18,299
then they do give us feedback

567
00:20:18,299 --> 00:20:21,600
but we reached out to some of our

568
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:25,020
best and brightest Champions or in

569
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:26,520
different areas of the organization said

570
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,320
would you be a part about what of our

571
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,760
customer Advisory board we're going

572
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,260
through a lot of changes in organization

573
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:33,120
and we could go all the way up through

574
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,440
your layers of management all the way

575
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:36,120
down but that'll just waste everybody's

576
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,860
time would you be willing to meet with

577
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:39,539
our Security leaders

578
00:20:39,539 --> 00:20:41,400
every other month for an hour and a half

579
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,320
and the promise to you is that the

580
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,820
things that you bring up the issues that

581
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:47,400
you bring up we will work to resolve and

582
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,620
so what we've done is I've LED I think

583
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:51,539
four or five of them at first it was

584
00:20:51,539 --> 00:20:53,220
just my team picking the brains of our

585
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:55,919
security Champions what once our our two

586
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:58,020
VPS and our two directors got a got wind

587
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:59,460
of what was going on they actually asked

588
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:01,799
to be invited as well so we're we're

589
00:21:01,799 --> 00:21:03,419
iterating on this I don't think it's

590
00:21:03,419 --> 00:21:05,400
quite perfect I need to add a few more

591
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,840
people going forward

592
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:09,000
but I'm really excited about our cab

593
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,220
program because it is breaking down

594
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:14,039
those silos which as you can imagine are

595
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:17,900
quite common in a big company like Adobe

596
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,520
um so in conclusion I wanted to thank

597
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,440
you for spending time with me today

598
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,700
um and I've enjoyed pulling together

599
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,140
Lessons Learned From leading our

600
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:27,840
security partner program

601
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,640
to wrap up we talked about what exactly

602
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,679
a security partner is where we fit in

603
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:33,780
the organization what we do on a daily

604
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:35,940
basis and who we work with I went into

605
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:37,559
further examples and details to

606
00:21:37,559 --> 00:21:39,360
illustrate our learning objectives

607
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,280
for learning objective one how to get

608
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,720
security asks positioned more

609
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,820
strategically on product roadmaps I

610
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:46,200
talked about how we measured visibility

611
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,760
and the risk of product team to

612
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,320
determine how to best support that team

613
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:51,419
as well as our best practices about

614
00:21:51,419 --> 00:21:53,280
around creating quarterly roadmaps

615
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,320
including paths to yellow and paths to

616
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:57,780
Green for learning objective 2 how to

617
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:58,919
make use to Automation and

618
00:21:58,919 --> 00:22:01,020
standardization I emphasize the

619
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:02,940
importance of consistent Communications

620
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:05,400
including our reporting funnel dashboard

621
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,900
mock-up and some of the ways we've

622
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:08,760
addressed the gaps in our technical

623
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,020
constraints

624
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:12,299
for learning objective three

625
00:22:12,299 --> 00:22:13,799
how to ensure that management and

626
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:15,240
executive teams make better security

627
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:17,900
decisions

628
00:22:18,059 --> 00:22:19,919
I talked about how the success we found

629
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:22,260
with our VP meeting so far and how we're

630
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:23,640
trying to communicate that right story

631
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,620
to Executives and help illustrate the

632
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:28,200
impact of completing this work with our

633
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,480
customer relationships and finally I

634
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,799
talked about how to improve

635
00:22:31,799 --> 00:22:33,360
relationships at the highest levels of

636
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:36,059
our organization and how we in the

637
00:22:36,059 --> 00:22:38,220
future of our security partner program

638
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:41,659
does anyone have any questions

639
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:47,340
okay

640
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:54,059
um I'm just curious how you identify

641
00:22:54,059 --> 00:22:55,320
um security Champions within your

642
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:57,419
organization and how you keep them

643
00:22:57,419 --> 00:23:00,419
engaged in these conversations so I know

644
00:23:00,419 --> 00:23:01,500
you mentioned a little bit about that

645
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,299
but sure specifically around how you

646
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:06,179
identify those in these different teams

647
00:23:06,179 --> 00:23:07,620
so I would say

648
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:09,720
um we know who the leaders are in the

649
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,640
product organization so we often go to

650
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,020
them and say hey we need a security

651
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:14,400
Champion is there anyone who's

652
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,679
interested and ideally someone is

653
00:23:16,679 --> 00:23:17,880
interested in the role sometimes

654
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,559
somebody gets volunteered but we look

655
00:23:19,559 --> 00:23:21,840
first for that interest level and then

656
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,120
the ways that we keep them involved to

657
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,980
be honest in covid we kind of had we

658
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:27,600
stalled out on some of like the Live

659
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:28,919
Events and things that we did so I'm

660
00:23:28,919 --> 00:23:30,720
working on bringing that back so I'm

661
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,240
doing like a program wide meeting once

662
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,460
so we've got about 240 Champions so I'm

663
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:36,840
doing a program-wide meeting once a

664
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,880
quarter where we call out the rock stars

665
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,320
and we give them Awards and a lot of

666
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,419
recognition in front of their peers well

667
00:23:42,419 --> 00:23:44,340
we do training events

668
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:47,039
um we in the past every other year they

669
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:48,539
did a security Champion Summit so I'm

670
00:23:48,539 --> 00:23:49,860
going to try to bring that back at least

671
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:50,940
hybrid

672
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:53,400
and then I just sent them all a big

673
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,960
thank you gift so a jacket that says

674
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,000
security Champions on it and I'm looking

675
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,559
for ways to

676
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:00,720
try to make it go both ways and then

677
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:01,919
we've also made it clear to our

678
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:02,880
champions

679
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,559
when you come comes time for your annual

680
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:06,600
review like let us know and we'd be

681
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,820
happy to write your manager a love note

682
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:10,559
that you can include in your review to

683
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:14,360
hopefully get promoted things like that

684
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:17,820
thank you I had the same question but

685
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:19,860
I'll follow it up

686
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:22,380
um how do you describe the role of your

687
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:23,820
security Champions like when you are

688
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:25,679
introducing then offering that or

689
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:27,299
describing as an option how are you

690
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:30,179
describing and then follow up when you

691
00:24:30,179 --> 00:24:32,220
identify the rock stars

692
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:34,799
what do you mean by rockstars sure

693
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:36,780
um so

694
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:38,820
we described the role as like are you

695
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:40,140
interested in security when we start

696
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:41,580
there generally we're looking for

697
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:42,780
somebody who's involved in Sprint

698
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:44,520
planning so that they can help pull in

699
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:46,919
different security asks but we also ask

700
00:24:46,919 --> 00:24:48,600
you know are you interested in

701
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:49,919
leadership because this is a good

702
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:51,360
leadership opportunity because you won't

703
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,100
just be on your team you'll be reaching

704
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:54,480
out to everyone else

705
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:57,240
and then for the Rockstar Awards

706
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,400
because there's 240 Champions and I have

707
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,440
six 15 security Partners I really

708
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,120
couldn't who don't because they work

709
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,039
one-to-one I couldn't have a vote on who

710
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:06,480
you know who's the greatest of all time

711
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:09,419
so I just told each security partner hey

712
00:25:09,419 --> 00:25:11,220
I know you work really hard with these

713
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:13,080
teams pick out somebody you work hard

714
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:14,940
with and like and get send me some

715
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:17,100
bullets on why they're amazing and every

716
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:18,960
single one of them said I can't choose

717
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,940
they're all great and I said great we'll

718
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:22,679
do it every quarter but this quarter

719
00:25:22,679 --> 00:25:25,460

720
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,400
