okay uh just to reiterate you know the

36
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,000
point of the conference is to help build

00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,939
connections and uh you know help us to

38
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:31,320
come together by having you know

meaningful conversations as we build

40
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:35,220
those connections that helps the

community grow that helps us be able to

42
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:40,140
know one another and be able to lift one

43

yeah that'd be great

189
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,220
the first thing I did to my badge was I

190
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:28,440
obviously had to add more LEDs because

191
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,020
you can never have enough LEDs and then

192
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:32,399
I don't know if you can see it probably

193
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:35,339
not but I put a little slideshow of Rick

194
00:08:35,339 --> 00:08:37,020
and Morty so it goes through just a

195
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:38,339
bunch of the different characters over

196
00:08:38,339 --> 00:08:41,039
and over and over so

197
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,760
that's awesome

198
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:46,439
