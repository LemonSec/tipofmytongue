um thank you for coming so this talk is

4
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:17,100

5
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:18,840
pen test report and are you guys able to

6
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:20,100
hear me in the back

7
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:22,140
okay awesome

8
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:24,900
okay so uh my name is Shelby Pettit I

9
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,420
work in application security

10
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:30,060
and at Adobe

11
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:33,480
I haven't really Niche role which is

12
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:34,800
cool that gives me an opportunity to

13
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:35,579
read

14
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:38,700
pen test reports written from pen

15
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:41,940
testers across the globe it's really fun

16
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:43,739
um I've seen them from Big firms small

17
00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:45,079
firms

18
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:49,079
India China us it's been really fun

19
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:51,660
um so that's kind of where I'm drawing

20
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:55,079
from my experience sharing some of my uh

21
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:57,539
my opinions on what makes a pen test

22
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:00,600
report useful or clunky in my opinion or

23
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,640
sparse

24
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,280
um so hopefully that is helpful but I

25
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,960
will say sorry I'm kind of struggling

26
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,299
with the presentations format but I will

27
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:12,299
say I am not a pen tester so I will not

28
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:15,240
have tons of uh really practical tips on

29
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,680
the actual Logistics of writing the pen

30
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,860
test so apologies for that

31
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:21,600
um who's this talk for mostly pen

32
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,740
testers

33
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:24,060
um there's going to be some overlap for

34
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:25,680
red teamers but since their objectives

35
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,479
are a little bit different in the in

36
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:29,360
their uh what they're trying to achieve

37
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,439
there'll be some overlap but that's not

38
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:34,399
the main focus here

39
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:38,939
um so maybe some of you I

40
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:41,280
if I ask people to raise their hands who

41
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,079
went who decided to become a pen tester

42
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:44,880
because they like writing no one's going

43
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,200
to raise their hand

44
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,780
um I get that but here are just a couple

45
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:51,119
quotes that help us realize that the pen

46
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:55,079
test report is important because

47
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:58,740
um the people who are your clients

48
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:01,320
um that's that's their only tangible

49
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,479
deliverable you know out of this whole

50
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:05,219
engagement all they have is the report

51
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:07,619
to show for it so we've got to make sure

52
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:09,720
that that represents the quality of the

53
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,860
work that you're doing on the back end

54
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:14,239
and everything that goes into that

55
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:19,440
so let's get into the planning phase a

56
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,560
bit

57
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:23,879
um first thing we want to talk about is

58
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:26,819
what's the objective why were you hired

59
00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:28,980
to do this job

60
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:30,900
um there there actually might be a

61
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:31,920
couple of reasons the most common is

62
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,220
usually for like compliance sake

63
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:38,640
um so it's it's nice to know this

64
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,400
background because if they hired you for

65
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,980
one purpose and and you kind of focused

66
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:45,360
on the assessment and you don't

67
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,420
understand what their goal is you might

68
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:49,800
miss it because they might have

69
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,879
something different in mind you know

70
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,620
maybe it's for compliance requirements

71
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:54,920
it can help to have some familiarity

72
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:58,319
with those compliance requirements

73
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,300
um I definitely don't want to tell you

74
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:02,099
to claim to be

75
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:05,879
a consultant in in the compliance side

76
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:07,319
if that's not where your expertise is

77
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:09,300
but a little bit of context can help

78
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:12,659
knowing like if it's um if it's in scope

79
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:14,400
for

80
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,300
um what's the like the card payment

81
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:20,700
requirements PCI DSS like maybe with

82
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,260
that knowledge you know that usually the

83
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:23,940
networking aspect needs to be in scope

84
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:26,220
so just a little bit of background can

85
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:28,200
help you out there but

86
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,599
um yeah don't claim to consult in areas

87
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:31,860
where you don't have expertise I'm not

88
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:33,480
trying to say that

89
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,500
um I'm trying to think of other ideas

90
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,300
for why a pen test might happen they

91
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:37,860
might have internal processes things

92
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:39,959
that they're looking for or maybe they

93
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:41,940
have a very specific objective in mind

94
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:44,099
that you would only know by asking so

95
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:45,180
that's that's a question you should ask

96
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:46,319
a person

97
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:47,819
um that hires you as you go to prepare

98
00:03:47,819 --> 00:03:50,480
for the engagement

99
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,400
foreign

100
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:05,940
with my degrees in I.T I can just barely

101
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:08,879
manage a PowerPoint okay so next thing

102
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:11,040
you want to know is who is your audience

103
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,140
once that report leaves your hands and

104
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:15,000
goes to the customer who sees that and

105
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,440
who cares

106
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,959
um usually it's going to be a mix of

107
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,660
technical people and non-technical

108
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,699
people leadership is going to want to

109
00:04:23,699 --> 00:04:25,500
see this oftentimes so you kind of it's

110
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:28,380
the challenge is you have to write to a

111
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:30,180
mixed audience some people are going to

112
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:32,280
read it from different perspectives

113
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,080
um so it's kind of nice to know another

114
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,320
thing I wrote in here is classification

115
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,820
understand the data classification they

116
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,620
might want you to write some a little

117
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:42,180
footer on your report or something the

118
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:44,280
effect of like confidential only or

119
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,720
things like that just make sure that you

120
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:49,800
respect the confidences of your

121
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,360
um of the person who hired you to do

122
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,240
this job that will help instill some

123
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,800
trust make sure that you handle the data

124
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,240
according to a way that they feel

125
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,740
comfortable with

126
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:00,960
next thing is timing

127
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,540
um it's I'm sure it's very challenging

128
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:05,880
as a as a pen tester you've got a

129
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,860
million and one tasks to do in the in

130
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:10,020
the course of this assessment

131
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:11,759
um and just don't forget to leave some

132
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:13,500
time for that report

133
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,360
um so yeah just maybe plan on it taking

134
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,000
a little longer than you think

135
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,979
to make sure it's Polished in time to go

136
00:05:19,979 --> 00:05:21,900
even though we have these tight

137
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:24,600
time-boxed assessments next thing is

138
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,979
format

139
00:05:25,979 --> 00:05:28,020
um I have a lot of opinions on this I've

140
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:30,120
seen pen test reports come in many

141
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,280
different formats most typically it's

142
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,860
like a Word document or a PDF

143
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:37,380
either of those is really fine

144
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:39,960
um my only my my big feeling is I need

145
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,400
to be able to copy paste out of your

146
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,900
report

147
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:47,400
um some some clients might request a CVS

148
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:50,400
um or sorry CSV

149
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,560
um that way they can ingest it into

150
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,180
whatever ticket managing system they're

151
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:56,400
using or Data Tracking so they might

152
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,620
give you specifications to please submit

153
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:01,020
your data in this format

154
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:04,139
separately from a CSV requirement I

155
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:05,820
personally do not like

156
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:08,160
pen test reports in Excel format and

157
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,720
unless if your client requests it right

158
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,000
client is King but

159
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:12,600
um

160
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:15,720
the reason I have this bias against pen

161
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:18,660
test reports in Excel is I don't want to

162
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:20,520
have to carry around a screen this big

163
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,440
with me to read all of the texts in

164
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,940
every little cell that's that's kind of

165
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:26,220
clunky for me not my favorite maybe some

166
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:27,600
people say yeah but I like that I can

167
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,100
tabulate the results quickly in the

168
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,600
cells

169
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,060
that's a point but um actually this is

170
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:35,699
just kind of for kicks and Giggles uh I

171
00:06:35,699 --> 00:06:37,919
have seen visuals like this before in

172
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:39,060
reports I'm like thank you they're

173
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:40,319
really helpful

174
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,000
um it's not a bad idea to include some

175
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,919
visuals in your report

176
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:45,319
I think management

177
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:47,819
their eyes tend to go toward the graphs

178
00:06:47,819 --> 00:06:49,280
and things like that that can be helpful

179
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,139
uh don't use a 3D graph like I threw in

180
00:06:52,139 --> 00:06:54,780
here it's kind of corny but yeah yeah

181
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:58,039
that's what I have to say for format

182
00:06:58,039 --> 00:07:03,120
moving on to the structure so

183
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,000
you you have the Liberty to to structure

184
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,259
the way you want this is my

185
00:07:07,259 --> 00:07:09,240
recommendation what I think is a nice

186
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,380
flow

187
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:11,880
you'll have a cover page and you're

188
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:14,460
going to slap your firm's beautiful logo

189
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:16,919
right on there nice and big and a title

190
00:07:16,919 --> 00:07:20,099
of what was assessed

191
00:07:20,099 --> 00:07:22,380
um on your executive summary

192
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:25,500
so there are a number of things and I

193
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:26,759
don't know where my notes went let me

194
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:28,259
see if I can find my notes

195
00:07:28,259 --> 00:07:30,000
that will help me so in the executive

196
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,340
summary basically

197
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:35,099
we want to keep this to a page or less

198
00:07:35,099 --> 00:07:36,900
this is a summary of what you found you

199
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,940
even though it's showing up early in the

200
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:40,620
report you're going to write this last

201
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:42,000
most likely

202
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,680
and

203
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,020
um

204
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:49,080
you so at a click at a quick glance the

205
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,340
reader should be able to know a couple

206
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:52,259
things right off the off the bat they

207
00:07:52,259 --> 00:07:54,720
should know how many of each findings

208
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,900
were found categorized by severity they

209
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:59,520
should know

210
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,020
um that's not something you want to

211
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:02,639
search for in the report if you have a

212
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:04,620
10 page or a 20 Page report you don't

213
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:05,759
want to search about you they just want

214
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:09,060
that to stand right out next thing is

215
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:10,380
um you can you can show a distribution

216
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:13,979
by category or um

217
00:08:13,979 --> 00:08:17,340
by severity whatever makes sense for you

218
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:19,379
um also a summary if you saw some trends

219
00:08:19,379 --> 00:08:22,319
like maybe there's a particular area of

220
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:24,539
security like um you need more input

221
00:08:24,539 --> 00:08:28,139
sanitation sanitization or

222
00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:30,000
um or more Network segmentation if you

223
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,560
start to see some trends that popped up

224
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,120
this would be a good place to write a

225
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,440
sentence or two like hey here's some

226
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,120
things we saw here's some areas for you

227
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,099
to focus on as you go to improve the

228
00:08:38,099 --> 00:08:40,979
security posture of your organization so

229
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:42,360
that's good to know you can also throw

230
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:45,180
in if there's like a very blaring or

231
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:47,580
severe finding you can mention that here

232
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:50,580
too specifically just quickly

233
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:52,140
um so yeah we'll we'll add a little bit

234
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:53,640
more details to the executive summary

235
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,320
later moving to the table of contents

236
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,899
personally if you can put a bullet point

237
00:08:57,899 --> 00:08:59,519
in the table of contents for each one of

238
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:00,839
the findings so I can click on the link

239
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:02,040
and it takes me to that part of the

240
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,140
report I love that it just makes my

241
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:06,060
heart Happy

242
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:07,680
um the findings are the real meat of the

243
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,380
report that's where the good stuff goes

244
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:13,140
um so you want to list it from most

245
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:15,000
severe to least severe so that's how

246
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,620
you're going to categorize them and

247
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:18,000
we'll go into details for what to

248
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,980
include per finding later

249
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:22,560
is so so far at this method we've gone

250
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,320
from General to more specific we're

251
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,720
going um we're kind of drilling down

252
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:30,959
so starting at summary and down into the

253
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:33,420
Nitty Gritty details

254
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:36,060
um so if if there's something that

255
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:38,880
starts to get really bulky but it's

256
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,980
relevant information you can pull that

257
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,660
out separately and throw it as appendix

258
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:45,060
a or appendix B that's no problem that

259
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:48,420
helps the readability of your report

260
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:49,680
um there's there's some judgment calls

261
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,540
but I'm sure whatever you organize will

262
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:53,580
be nice

263
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:55,740
um one more comment about structure

264
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:58,260
there's one particular style that kind

265
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:00,540
of drives me crazy and that's when your

266
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:03,180
summary is big if you've got three pages

267
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:04,980
of summary that's not a summary and I

268
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:07,140
don't want to see it because all of a

269
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:09,959
sudden half of your findings are half of

270
00:10:09,959 --> 00:10:11,339
the details of a finding are in the

271
00:10:11,339 --> 00:10:13,260
summary and then later on in the report

272
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:15,540
we have the other half of it and that's

273
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:17,580
messy to jump back and forth give me a

274
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:19,800
succinct summary and then I can go find

275
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:22,080
the D all of the details together in the

276
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,060
findings section

277
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:26,100
um so that's just the an opinion I have

278
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,760
about that

279
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,080
moving on to the next part

280
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:41,519
here are a couple more details of things

281
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:43,260
that need to be included in the

282
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:45,360
executive summary

283
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,500
um

284
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,899
and honestly if you want to include

285
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:50,160
these details somewhere else because

286
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,680
that makes sense to you that's fine my

287
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,940
preference is to put in the executive

288
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:56,160
summary except for maybe the definitions

289
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,880
or framework if that starts to get

290
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,680
detailed or Hefty you can toss that into

291
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,560
the appendix no problem

292
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,019
so you definitely need to include the

293
00:11:07,019 --> 00:11:07,800
scope

294
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:11,519
that might be URLs IP ranges things like

295
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:15,060
that or a scope of the the application

296
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:16,740
that you covered a description is fine

297
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:18,839
too whatever works makes sense for the

298
00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:19,980
assessment

299
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:22,440
the objective you know the objective of

300
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,300
the person who hired you did now you

301
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,140
want to make sure that that's

302
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:26,940
communicated clearly to whoever the

303
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:29,339
reader is so they understand that we're

304
00:11:29,339 --> 00:11:31,260
all on the same page here that you met

305
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:33,720
that objective

306
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,500
um

307
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:37,079
you also want to have this the start

308
00:11:37,079 --> 00:11:39,600
state of the test and the end date the

309
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,700
methodology did you use a white box

310
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,860
assessment gray box black box and

311
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:45,360
whatever else those definitions are kind

312
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,060
of nebulous so whatever else is helpful

313
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:50,760
context you can throw that in there too

314
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,680
if you followed a particular pen test

315
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:55,260
framework such as um like the O wasp

316
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:58,860
guide to securing web apps or

317
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:03,060
um like pcis or the CIS benchmarks those

318
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:04,500
those are really helpful to put in there

319
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,760
because that's a reference that people

320
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:10,019
can understand exactly what was tested

321
00:12:10,019 --> 00:12:11,220
um you might also have a set of

322
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:12,600
definitions

323
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:15,120
maybe the way that you define or use

324
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,100
certain terms is specific and you want

325
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:19,200
to get that cleared there that's really

326
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,120
helpful I've seen tables of definitions

327
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,300
included in dependencies and that's fine

328
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:25,860
well that's really helpful can be with

329
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:28,140
severity rankings especially because

330
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:29,640
everyone might have different opinions

331
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,260
about what should be considered a

332
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:33,959
critical or a low or anything in between

333
00:12:33,959 --> 00:12:36,620
so definitions can be helpful there

334
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:39,000
the last thing we have here is

335
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,240
assumptions so um

336
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,399
go back with me a few years to one or

337
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:45,839
many years to when you were in high

338
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:47,459
school physics and your textbook told

339
00:12:47,459 --> 00:12:50,760
you to imagine a world with no air

340
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:53,220
resistance and

341
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:55,680
um and things like that you know no air

342
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,420
resistance gravity is the same as

343
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:59,760
Earth's those are assumptions these

344
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,019
underlying assumptions that we make

345
00:13:01,019 --> 00:13:03,240
going into into this uh the assessment

346
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,860
maybe it doesn't represent the real

347
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:06,839
world entirely but these are assumptions

348
00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:09,660
that you've been told to or have

349
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:11,639
incorporated into your test that's fine

350
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:13,500
those would be appropriate to include in

351
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,019
the test so they understand

352
00:13:15,019 --> 00:13:17,639
your approach

353
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:20,100
so any questions so far

354
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:23,360
keep going awesome

355
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,680
hello

356
00:13:37,139 --> 00:13:40,680
okay so findings

357
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:44,160
um each finding should include a title

358
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,380
this can be simple cross-site scripting

359
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:49,079
stored cross-site scripting or something

360
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:51,600
like that you also want to have a

361
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,200
tracking number

362
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,519
um

363
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:58,139
companies tend to I don't know how it's

364
00:13:58,139 --> 00:14:01,079
used internally to pen test firms but I

365
00:14:01,079 --> 00:14:04,260
have seen a trend of everyone assigning

366
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,660
kind of like this uh tracking number you

367
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:08,579
know five six one two three four five or

368
00:14:08,579 --> 00:14:10,019
something like that to every single

369
00:14:10,019 --> 00:14:11,760
finding they have that way there's

370
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,279
there's no uh mistake about which

371
00:14:14,279 --> 00:14:15,839
finding we're referencing in our

372
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:18,660
discussions and things like that

373
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:19,740
um so they have a tracking number

374
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:21,720
whatever works for you

375
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:25,200
also severity ranking

376
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,200
um

377
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,700
different organizations have different

378
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:32,459
preferences different risk

379
00:14:32,459 --> 00:14:35,100
appetites and approaches so whatever

380
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:38,100
they and you can agree on as a as an

381
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:40,800
appropriate way to assess because you

382
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,779
don't want to give just a report of your

383
00:14:42,779 --> 00:14:45,660
findings without this layer of analysis

384
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:48,120
you need to prioritize for them do that

385
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,040
analysis as a security professional I'm

386
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,139
telling you to focus on this and this

387
00:14:52,139 --> 00:14:53,699
and then if you have time also that that

388
00:14:53,699 --> 00:14:55,800
and that right so you want to help them

389
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,899
prioritize that's the point of the

390
00:14:57,899 --> 00:14:59,639
severity ranking

391
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:00,240
um

392
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,620
if you're taking a risk-based approach

393
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:06,000
cvssb3 is great

394
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,459
um or I've seen scales critical high

395
00:15:08,459 --> 00:15:11,220
medium low and informational that's

396
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:13,620
great too you can Define what those look

397
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:15,959
like from a risk impact perspective in

398
00:15:15,959 --> 00:15:17,760
your appendix

399
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:21,120
um priority one priority two I've seen

400
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,820
Banks use this kind of status they've

401
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:25,680
got those defined on their side and then

402
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,420
they they slap that label on so everyone

403
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:29,639
knows this is how we handle p1s this is

404
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:32,040
how we handle P2 things like that and

405
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:34,860
the slas kind of associated with that

406
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:37,560
um so that's kind of severity oh I guess

407
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:38,880
there's there's another approach there's

408
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,380
also um

409
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:42,480
the adversary based approach so there's

410
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,100
like you can have a risk-based approach

411
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:46,560
or an adversary-based approach

412
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,360
um as long as you're consistent and you

413
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,579
can defend why you put a certain label

414
00:15:50,579 --> 00:15:51,959
on there

415
00:15:51,959 --> 00:15:53,699
um that is just fine

416
00:15:53,699 --> 00:15:55,740
but there can be some some differences

417
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:59,279
in opinions with with severity ranking

418
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:01,380
and it might depend on your organization

419
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:04,100
and that's fine

420
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:11,820
next you're going to need a description

421
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:15,420
of the volume so not everyone who reads

422
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:17,040
your report in fact I would even say the

423
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,660
majority of the people who read your pen

424
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:21,240
test report probably are not Security

425
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:24,600
Professionals some are but you're

426
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,100
probably some at the end of the day

427
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:30,120
assist admin or an Ops person is

428
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,800
engineer is going to get this report and

429
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,380
be told to fix things and so you can't

430
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:36,180
take for granted that if you throw out

431
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:38,579
these terms these jargon that we that we

432
00:16:38,579 --> 00:16:40,139
talk about in the security world that

433
00:16:40,139 --> 00:16:41,040
they're going to know exactly what

434
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,019
you're saying so you just add a sentence

435
00:16:43,019 --> 00:16:45,600
or two that explains this is what this

436
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,540
finding means in just in simple terms

437
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:50,399
because not everyone's going to know

438
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:52,500
that but you can put it in terms that

439
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,060
they understand

440
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:56,759
um just this doesn't have to be huge a

441
00:16:56,759 --> 00:16:58,259
description of the volume can be a

442
00:16:58,259 --> 00:17:00,180
couple sentences maybe a small paragraph

443
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:01,139
or two

444
00:17:01,139 --> 00:17:02,940
and that's I think that's really helpful

445
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:04,980
even even for people that work in this

446
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:06,179
it's nice to have a little refresher

447
00:17:06,179 --> 00:17:07,439
make sure we're just talking about the

448
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:10,679
same thing on the same page

449
00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:13,939
next is

450
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:19,140
explanation of impact so I've explained

451
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:22,799
what you found now so what why should we

452
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:24,540
care about this

453
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:26,699
um you make sure you differentiate what

454
00:17:26,699 --> 00:17:28,439
you're able to prove versus what is

455
00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:30,600
potentially

456
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:33,179
um the impact here as much as you can as

457
00:17:33,179 --> 00:17:36,419
a pen tester it's great to show the

458
00:17:36,419 --> 00:17:38,520
impact actually demonstrated so that it

459
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,559
becomes it comes out of this theoretical

460
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,780
realm and into the look for real we

461
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:44,400
actually did this here's a screenshot

462
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,660
right

463
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:48,120
um so that's what the the explanation of

464
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:50,400
impact if you're not able to show that

465
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,380
full attack chain you can't throw the

466
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:53,760
theoretical stuff in there just make

467
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,679
sure it's stated appropriately so they

468
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:57,660
understand what was done and what was

469
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:00,480
really discovered

470
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,820
steps to reproduce

471
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:03,539
um

472
00:18:03,539 --> 00:18:06,539
I find that this is most often the part

473
00:18:06,539 --> 00:18:10,559
of a pen test that's lacking so

474
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:13,260
this is once once again keeping in mind

475
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:16,500
that an engineer who may not have a

476
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,000
background in security is going to have

477
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,520
to try to reproduce your finding in

478
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:22,860
order to successfully patch against it

479
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:25,440
right so they've got to do what you did

480
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,880
so you have to give them instructions

481
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,380
you've got to give them a recipe you use

482
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:30,900
this tool you navigate to this tab of

483
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:32,700
the tool and click this and type that

484
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,320
and it's going to give you the result

485
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,299
here and and you walk them through it I

486
00:18:36,299 --> 00:18:38,520
think that's so helpful it might feel

487
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:41,160
wordy to you or maybe unnecessary but I

488
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,780
think as someone who consumes the

489
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:45,059
reports and and has this back and forth

490
00:18:45,059 --> 00:18:46,799
with the engineers it's really helpful

491
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:49,140
it helps us understand exactly what you

492
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:49,940
did

493
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:52,559
so that we can not waste too much time

494
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:54,299
trying to rebuild what you've already

495
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:56,780
discovered

496
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:59,280
last thing is evidence

497
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,220
um evidence kind of shows it could be a

498
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:05,640
screenshot or a video share of what you

499
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:08,100
managed to capture what you managed to

500
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:11,400
do evidence is not always complete

501
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,260
without those steps to reproduce I kind

502
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:14,760
of think of the evidence as like the end

503
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:17,400
point and the steps reproduces like the

504
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:20,280
journey how you got there

505
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:23,640
and I we are running low on time so

506
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:26,160
affected location the URL the endpoint

507
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,620
the IP address the file name whatever it

508
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:32,160
was list all of them if if you're if

509
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,840
time if you have time enough in your

510
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,460
assessment to identify every location

511
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:38,340
where it's vulnerable within scope

512
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:40,520
that's way more helpful than just saying

513
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:43,140
it's all over

514
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,460
um if it's a universal setting maybe

515
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:46,320
they can go fix it but sometimes

516
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,840
depending on the remediation that's

517
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,400
required they might have to go and do it

518
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,740
for each location so it's nice to have

519
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:55,140
that all listed out every affected

520
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:57,660
location recommended remediation if

521
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:59,840
you're able to give more than one

522
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,900
remediation that's so helpful because

523
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:05,280
you know we get to the engineering side

524
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,900
and we say here's our recommendation

525
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:08,400
they say we can't do that it's working

526
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,840
as designed we're like okay well here's

527
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,179
our backup recommendation and our Backup

528
00:20:12,179 --> 00:20:13,500
backup recommendation maybe you won't

529
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,179
fix the whole maybe you won't patch the

530
00:20:15,179 --> 00:20:17,520
whole vulnerability with this third

531
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,799
backup but it gives them options you

532
00:20:19,799 --> 00:20:21,179
know this is best better than doing

533
00:20:21,179 --> 00:20:23,940
nothing so I like to tier my

534
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:26,400
recommendations have multiple approaches

535
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,140
for fixing it you have your best

536
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:32,480
practice and then maybe your backups

537
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,460
now that you know I've given you like a

538
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:36,780
whole laundry list of things that you

539
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:38,520
need to be documenting you know ahead of

540
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:41,419
time so you try to document as you go

541
00:20:41,419 --> 00:20:43,860
take notes of your progress of your

542
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:46,860
process capture screenshots as you go so

543
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:48,660
you don't have to try to figure out at

544
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:50,640
the end of the week what you did and I

545
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,440
know some people do set up logging to

546
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:54,660
capture their their traffic that helps

547
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:58,100
them get that information later

548
00:20:58,260 --> 00:20:59,880
so here's just a quick example we're

549
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,679
going to run through I borrowed this

550
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:03,240
from Sans

551
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,980
um you can ignore that red box that's

552
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:06,480
just for the demonstration thing but I

553
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,980
like that they have

554
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:10,980
um here we can see their severity the

555
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:12,900
their Threat Level the vulnerability

556
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:15,360
analysis if if we followed the the

557
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,860
template I gave you I would name

558
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:19,860
analysis maybe like

559
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:21,840
the description and then maybe add

560
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,400
another header here toward the bottom

561
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:27,179
that says like steps to reproduce

562
00:21:27,179 --> 00:21:28,919
um but yeah here we have screenshots

563
00:21:28,919 --> 00:21:30,480
they've labeled their screenshots which

564
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,860
is really nice

565
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:33,780
they labeled this one figure six getting

566
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:36,539
shell access so if you just look at the

567
00:21:36,539 --> 00:21:38,520
screenshot or the the label on the

568
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,320
screenshot it's very helpful it tells

569
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,059
you exactly what they did

570
00:21:42,059 --> 00:21:43,559
um one thing I would add if you want to

571
00:21:43,559 --> 00:21:44,760
just kind of make it a little bit more

572
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:45,780
polished

573
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:48,419
I would highlight after you take the

574
00:21:48,419 --> 00:21:49,980
screenshot put a little red box around

575
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:51,659
the part of the screenshot that's

576
00:21:51,659 --> 00:21:53,700
interesting they don't you know people

577
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:55,260
are going to look at this be like okay

578
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:57,360
that's a lot of text what

579
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,280
so if you put that little red box it

580
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,659
draws their eyes to the right spot

581
00:22:00,659 --> 00:22:03,419
that's really helpful for me

582
00:22:03,419 --> 00:22:05,220
once again I I do appreciate that they

583
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:06,539
highlighted the right row here showing

584
00:22:06,539 --> 00:22:07,679
that they have net cat running that

585
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:09,000
they're able to install that and get it

586
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,120
going

587
00:22:11,159 --> 00:22:13,140
um and then here after the after their

588
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:15,600
walk through they give an impact as well

589
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,480
as a recommendation and they have

590
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,100
external resources hey if you want to go

591
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:22,620
do more reading here's a link

592
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:24,299
very helpful

593
00:22:24,299 --> 00:22:26,700
as you are writing we don't want to use

594
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:28,860
Scare Tactics right

595
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:31,020
um try to try to take as evidence-based

596
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:33,419
approach what does the data say

597
00:22:33,419 --> 00:22:36,600
um and don't go too far from that as you

598
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,280
write reports you're going to find that

599
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:40,799
a lot of it is copy paste so you can

600
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:42,419
feel free to build a template or use

601
00:22:42,419 --> 00:22:44,880
software that will do that for you just

602
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,919
to save yourself some time I find that

603
00:22:46,919 --> 00:22:49,679
just a fun little tip if as you're

604
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:51,120
filling out that template if you find

605
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,220
pieces that you you're like oh I need to

606
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:54,720
come back and fill that in later

607
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:58,080
put special characters there like in the

608
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,460
past when I'm working on big long

609
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:01,559
reports I would highlight it but then

610
00:23:01,559 --> 00:23:03,600
you're trusting your visual check and

611
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,360
that's not foolproof so put like three

612
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:09,299
asterisks in a row or three

613
00:23:09,299 --> 00:23:10,980
um dollar signs in a row and then at

614
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:13,440
before you submit your report do a text

615
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,900
search for those characters uh because

616
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:17,220
it should only come up in those spots

617
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:18,419
where you meant to come back later and

618
00:23:18,419 --> 00:23:19,559
filament just so you don't forget little

619
00:23:19,559 --> 00:23:23,360
things like insert customer name here

620
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,400
in if you do a white box assessment

621
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,799
you'll probably want to collaborate

622
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:31,080
between the rough draft stage and the

623
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:34,320
final report stage so that the engineers

624
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,059
and the system

625
00:23:36,059 --> 00:23:39,720
um like designers on the customer side

626
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:42,480
can have a chance to explain anything

627
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,400
that they might disagree with and then

628
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,080
you can negotiate maybe some finding

629
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,000
severities might need to be adjusted or

630
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,440
things like that based on new evidence

631
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,539
that they that they show

632
00:23:51,539 --> 00:23:54,960
your firm also might have a QA process

633
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,020
lasting letter of attestation

634
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:01,559
um this is very similar to an executive

635
00:24:01,559 --> 00:24:03,000
summary you're going to have a lot of

636
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,360
the same details in there and this is as

637
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:08,039
um this is basically proof that the

638
00:24:08,039 --> 00:24:09,960
assessment happened and kind of a high

639
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,640
level summary of what the findings you

640
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,260
might not release the name of the

641
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:15,059
findings because they're not patched yet

642
00:24:15,059 --> 00:24:18,360
but this letter can be given to for for

643
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:20,159
many use cases to show that the pen test

644
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:21,840
happened maybe I don't know how that

645
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,340
holds up in audits versus the full

646
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:24,960
report but like

647
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,700
um I know I work for a software company

648
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:30,240
and so our customers want to see that

649
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,760
proof that we have been doing our due

650
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,380
diligence and are doing thorough Penta

651
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:36,780
so they they examine our scope and all

652
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:38,100
those things that are included in that

653
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:39,720
Loa that we're able to share with them

654
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:42,600
externally without sharing the details

655
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,580
of all the open volts right so that's

656
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:46,320
really helpful to have that letterhead

657
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:49,679
pretty Loa to share

658
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:51,659
and then last thing there's lots of

659
00:24:51,659 --> 00:24:53,220
software that can help you write good

660
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:54,720
reports but now that you I can't

661
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,100
recommend any because I haven't used

662
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:58,140
them but now that I've given you kind of

663
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:00,600
the basics of the ingredients for a good

664
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,220
report you can go out and search for

665
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:04,020
