1
00:00:00,359 --> 00:00:03,600
hello everybody Welcome to the talk uh

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,580
the topic today is how small businesses

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:08,280
can prepare for big attacks it's a

4
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:10,620
pretty strong pain point I'm sure many

5
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:13,440
of you understand

6
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,360
that uh you know sometimes there's a

7
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,920
smaller budget with the smaller business

8
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,720
and so how do you secure your assets the

9
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,420
same way that the big guys do

10
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:23,760
here's a quick overview of what I'll be

11
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,740
talking about so

12
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:27,420
introduce myself

13
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:29,760
tell you the purpose of the talk

14
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,220
any misconceptions that I commonly hear

15
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:35,120
from small and medium-sized businesses

16
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,899
uh some statistics and data points about

17
00:00:38,899 --> 00:00:42,120
SMB targeted cyber attacks and when I

18
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:44,460
say SMB in this talk I'm talking about

19
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:46,680
small to medium-sized businesses not the

20
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,719
other thing

21
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:50,940
I'll go over some free with an asterisk

22
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:53,340
and Simple Solutions and then of course

23
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:55,860
paid services and how they help you and

24
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:58,980
then the key takeaways afterwards

25
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:01,320
so who am I

26
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,059
uh cyber security professional with

27
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:05,280
about a decade of experience I've

28
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,100
started out in the Air Force I was doing

29
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:10,080
cyber warfare operations for several

30
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,840
years I got my bachelor's degree while I

31
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:13,799
was in

32
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:16,020
I mentored with something called cyber

33
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:18,119
Patriot if any of you are familiar it's

34
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:21,240
essentially where Air Force personnel

35
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:24,479
were kind of encouraged to Mentor High

36
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:26,820
School students and college students in

37
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,040
cyber security

38
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:30,840
we went through labs they had

39
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,240
competitions it was a really fun time I

40
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:36,659
loved it every second of it we had one

41
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:39,000
team one year go to State and that was

42
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,759
awesome for me so I'm definitely proud

43
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:44,400
of that time I've got multiple

44
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,680
disciplines in my experience my bread

45
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,840
and butter is digital forensics and

46
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,700
incident response dfir

47
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,979
I do a lot of threat hunting as well I'm

48
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:54,119
actually building a threat hunting

49
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:55,979
program at my company currently

50
00:01:55,979 --> 00:01:58,079
uh security information event management

51
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:00,360
engineering that's kind of how I started

52
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,579
in the Air Force malware reverse

53
00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:05,640
engineer and a bunch of other stuff

54
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,500
I did spend some time as a senior

55
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,899
analyst over at crowdstrike I learned a

56
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:12,900
ton I've got some some old co-workers

57
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,940
here as well it was a great time I loved

58
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:17,099
every minute of it and now I'm currently

59
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:19,080
the incident response lead over at a

60
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:22,099
company called tanium we do endpoint

61
00:02:22,099 --> 00:02:25,560
Management Solutions for Enterprises but

62
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:28,680
I do their internal instant response

63
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:32,280
and I'm a huge nerd I play tons of video

64
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:36,239
games and I am all about the the nerd

65
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,340
culture as well

66
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:41,340
so why am I here well every organization

67
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:43,319
in the world is a target of a Cyber

68
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:46,379
attack no matter what hands down full

69
00:02:46,379 --> 00:02:48,480
stop every single organization every

70
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,420
single individual is a target

71
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:54,180
no matter how big or small your Target

72
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:56,400
too

73
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,760
so smbs usually don't even know what

74
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,160
they need when it comes to cyber

75
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,680
security usually it's an afterthought

76
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,500
for them right it's only after they get

77
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,540
attacked do they even care about cyber

78
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:11,519
security

79
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:12,780
so I want to clear up some

80
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:15,060
misconceptions around the cyber security

81
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:17,459
industry the products the services that

82
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:19,560
are offered throughout the industry and

83
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,140
to kind of clear up some information

84
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:24,300
that might have been

85
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,459
falsely understood

86
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:27,780
and then I want to help the

87
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:29,819
underprepared organizations secure their

88
00:03:29,819 --> 00:03:32,159
assets because that's what we do right

89
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:35,640
we protect company assets or government

90
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,980
organization assets and information and

91
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:39,900
data we want to make sure that all of

92
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:42,239
that data is protected the proper way

93
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:44,640
that's why we're here

94
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,640
and so in as a result of that we can

95
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:50,819
make the world just a little bit safer

96
00:03:50,819 --> 00:03:52,260
so let's jump right into some

97
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:53,700
misconceptions

98
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:56,519
these are just a handful of quotes that

99
00:03:56,519 --> 00:03:58,920
I've heard from small and medium-sized

100
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:01,920
business owners one of which is the

101
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,840
misconception that recovery of a Cyber

102
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,159
attack happens just like any other

103
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:08,879
disaster right so if your building gets

104
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:11,040
flooded out because of a hurricane well

105
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,319
you have Disaster Recovery processes

106
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:15,120
that you follow in order to bring back

107
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,000
the functionality of that building

108
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,579
and so they just assume that you would

109
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:22,320
do it in a similar way when it's a Cyber

110
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,020
attack and as many of you know that is

111
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:28,620
not true so cyber attacks come with many

112
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:30,780
other costs that are not directly up

113
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:33,540
front with just say a fine from a

114
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:36,419
government organization or

115
00:04:36,419 --> 00:04:37,979
I don't know it could be you know

116
00:04:37,979 --> 00:04:40,080
rebuilding a server that got ransomware

117
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,240
to something like that or say paying a

118
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,979
ransomware payment those are not the

119
00:04:43,979 --> 00:04:46,139
only costs that are associated with it

120
00:04:46,139 --> 00:04:49,919
when you have a major Cyber attack and

121
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:53,100
critical information or data is released

122
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:55,259
to the public or maybe customer data is

123
00:04:55,259 --> 00:04:58,919
sold on the dark web the public Trust on

124
00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:01,500
your brand has gone down significantly

125
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:04,440
and as a result you're probably going to

126
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:08,280
see a significant drop in Revenue

127
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:11,340
because you are now less trusted

128
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:13,080
in the world

129
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,300
so if you don't fix the underlying issue

130
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,520
after the Cyber attack it's just going

131
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,699
to happen again unlike say flooding

132
00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:22,680
where you know you can't really do much

133
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,259
about a hurricane coming in and just

134
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:27,780
flooding out an entire city you can take

135
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:30,000
precautions to help mitigate the risk of

136
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,979
it but you can't stop it completely

137
00:05:31,979 --> 00:05:34,740
however when it's a Cyber attack let's

138
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:38,460
say you accidentally left in Windows XP

139
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:43,139
box with the other SMB open to the

140
00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:44,460
internet

141
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:46,199
you're probably just going to get hacked

142
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:48,060
and then if you recover from that attack

143
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:49,740
and then you don't fix that underlying

144
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:51,660
issue somebody else is just going to use

145
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:54,020
it again

146
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:56,940
I'm too small to be a Target

147
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,259
as I already said in the beginning

148
00:05:58,259 --> 00:06:01,320
that's completely false attackers don't

149
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,840
care about how big or how much revenue

150
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,639
you have they don't care about any of

151
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:07,620
that

152
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:10,680
they target everybody regardless of size

153
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,900
attackers may be going after thousands

154
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:15,300
of organizations just like yours maybe

155
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:17,160
the same size maybe the same industry

156
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,800
but if they only went after the big fish

157
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:24,120
say Walmart Apple Adobe whatever

158
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,039
then they wouldn't really get that big

159
00:06:26,039 --> 00:06:28,139
of a payout because they have a bigger

160
00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:29,759
security budget they have more

161
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,860
infrastructure that and and more

162
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:36,780
investment into cyber security controls

163
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:39,060
but if it's a smaller Target

164
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:41,340
you may get a lower amount of payout but

165
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:43,620
it's going to be more reliable so if I

166
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:46,020
hit a thousand organizations and only 10

167
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:48,539
of them stick I still hit a hundred

168
00:06:48,539 --> 00:06:51,259
organizations

169
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,000
so it's easy money right

170
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,340
um if you have very little to no cyber

171
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:58,380
security protections implemented in your

172
00:06:58,380 --> 00:06:59,520
environments

173
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,199
then it's just an easy button for them

174
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:03,780
and they can get right in

175
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:06,120
a couple more we don't have the budget

176
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,940
for in-depth cyber security well

177
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:11,039
you don't really need that you don't

178
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:13,680
need millions and millions of dollars to

179
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,259
build a proper cyber security

180
00:07:16,259 --> 00:07:19,199
program or strategy even

181
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:21,780
most of the time you can get by with a

182
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:23,819
handful of free or Simple Solutions that

183
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:25,259
you can Implement in your organization

184
00:07:25,259 --> 00:07:28,199
and it will put you far ahead of

185
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:31,139
everybody else in your industry for

186
00:07:31,139 --> 00:07:33,360
their cyber security

187
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,280
well cyber security is too complicated

188
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,979
for my simple little business well again

189
00:07:37,979 --> 00:07:41,039
most of those cheap and free Solutions

190
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:43,020
they're usually pretty easy to implement

191
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:45,419
such as password managers or an

192
00:07:45,419 --> 00:07:46,979
antivirus software

193
00:07:46,979 --> 00:07:48,599
it's pretty easy to just kind of install

194
00:07:48,599 --> 00:07:51,660
on the host and then just let it go

195
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:53,460
they also help to stop the most common

196
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:54,960
attacks

197
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,580
who here knows what the most common

198
00:07:56,580 --> 00:08:00,139
attack is like way entry level sorry

199
00:08:00,139 --> 00:08:02,580
infection Vector that attackers will

200
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:05,280
take to get into an organization

201
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,919
email thank you I heard it uh phishing

202
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:11,099
attacks right so if you had proper

203
00:08:11,099 --> 00:08:15,360
uh email filtering in place then less

204
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,099
phishing emails will even be allowed to

205
00:08:17,099 --> 00:08:19,139
get through for your employees to click

206
00:08:19,139 --> 00:08:20,699
on

207
00:08:20,699 --> 00:08:22,379
and that's just one of the many examples

208
00:08:22,379 --> 00:08:24,060
out there

209
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:26,639
so let's talk about some SMB targeted or

210
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,620
cyber attacks that have happened in the

211
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:29,819
past

212
00:08:29,819 --> 00:08:32,580
so obviously smbs tend to have less

213
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:35,580
security controls in their organization

214
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:37,860
as we discussed earlier lower cyber

215
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:40,020
security budget they probably don't even

216
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,940
have dedicated Personnel that handle

217
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:44,039
cyber security

218
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:46,440
so the security patching might not be

219
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,779
managed very well it could be just like

220
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:51,839
yeah whenever Jeff from it has time

221
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:53,459
he'll go ahead and review the patch

222
00:08:53,459 --> 00:08:55,980
schedule or something

223
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:57,660
most likely no security awareness

224
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:59,640
training or phishing training so

225
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:02,940
phishing awareness is going to be one of

226
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:05,880
the biggest helpers to reduce the risk

227
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,040
for phishing attacks and it's a free

228
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:10,220
solution that you can Implement

229
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:12,120
obviously you want to make sure that

230
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,640
it's good training so it might take a

231
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,080
little bit of time and research in order

232
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,120
to get there

233
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,860
so they're also unaware of their attack

234
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:22,260
surface they don't they may not

235
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:24,180
necessarily have a good asset management

236
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:28,080
system in place and so whenever a

237
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,000
particular server is actually

238
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,339
compromised by an attacker they might

239
00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:34,500
not even know that that system even

240
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,000
existed because somebody else

241
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,560
implemented it and didn't go through the

242
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,720
proper channels in order to get that

243
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:42,240
system put into the asset management

244
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,100
system

245
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:46,320
and then of course like I already said

246
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,540
lower security budget less money means

247
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:52,500
less resources and you are putting it at

248
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:55,500
a lower priority than other parts of the

249
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,580
business

250
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:58,440
and you're just opening yourself up to

251
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,600
risk

252
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,459
so organizations with less than 100

253
00:10:02,459 --> 00:10:04,440
employees are actually targeted more

254
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,480
often than others

255
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,899
so about 60 percent of all cyber attacks

256
00:10:09,899 --> 00:10:12,839
are targeted at smbs

257
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:14,940
and as we already discussed phishing

258
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:16,500
Remains the most common tactic for

259
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,120
initial access

260
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,880
and of course the covid-19 pandemic has

261
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,860
increased cyber crime by over 600

262
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:26,839
percent since it uh started

263
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:29,640
so I'm going to add a little bit more

264
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:32,880
information about some statistics on the

265
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,620
cyber attacks that are targeted at these

266
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:36,320
types of organizations

267
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:41,160
uh according to the DFI or dfir report

268
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:43,920
by Verizon last year earlier this year

269
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,180
excuse me

270
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:48,000
only about 50 percent of smbs had a

271
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
cyber security plan for 2022.

272
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,040
um that's kind of alarming because that

273
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,500
means that when the attack happened they

274
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,300
had no idea what they were going to do

275
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:00,600
right they had no backup plan they

276
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,579
didn't have a strategy for how to handle

277
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:05,820
and how to triage the incident or how to

278
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:08,940
recover from it none of that

279
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:12,000
during the time frame of 2020 to 2021

280
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,079
data breaches at these smbs they grew

281
00:11:15,079 --> 00:11:17,700
152 percent in comparison to the

282
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:20,420
previous two years

283
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,980
of course 27 percent of small businesses

284
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:24,480
with no cyber security protections

285
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,000
collect credit card info so that's good

286
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,480
to know

287
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:32,160
82 percent of ransomware attacks were

288
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,779
against companies with fewer than a

289
00:11:33,779 --> 00:11:35,519
thousand employees

290
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:38,399
so that would be con at anything lower

291
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:39,899
than a thousand employees would be

292
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:41,820
considered a small to medium-sized

293
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:42,839
business

294
00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:45,600
and so the fact that 82 of all

295
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,700
ransomware cases were targeted at those

296
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,019
organizations

297
00:11:49,019 --> 00:11:50,600
should be alarming to most people

298
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,399
because I'm sure many of you here work

299
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:55,200
for organizations that have less than a

300
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,760
thousand people

301
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,440
so that means that that's more work for

302
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,640
you

303
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:00,959
and

304
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:03,420
um it's more lucrative for the attackers

305
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:06,060
in the long run

306
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:08,399
more than half of the respondents to a

307
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:10,860
survey would be less likely to continue

308
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:12,959
doing business after a breach

309
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:15,779
and we see this all the time Cyber

310
00:12:15,779 --> 00:12:17,760
attack happens maybe ransomware gets

311
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:18,839
spread throughout the entire environment

312
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:21,740
and they had no backup plan they had no

313
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:25,680
bcdr plan implemented and then as a

314
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,779
result of that they lost so much money

315
00:12:27,779 --> 00:12:30,839
during the recovery process that they

316
00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:32,640
ended up going bankrupt and they had to

317
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,440
close business

318
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,959
nobody wants that to happen

319
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:40,680
and of course finally over half of smbs

320
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,779
that fall victim to ransomware they pay

321
00:12:42,779 --> 00:12:43,920
the money

322
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,779
and you shouldn't do that

323
00:12:45,779 --> 00:12:48,779
the reason for this is because when you

324
00:12:48,779 --> 00:12:51,420
pay the ransom to the ransomware actor

325
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:53,760
you are reinforcing the fact that that

326
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,800
is now a lucrative business for them to

327
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,139
continue pursuing

328
00:12:58,139 --> 00:13:00,420
and that you also have tipped your hand

329
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:02,220
to other criminals that you're willing

330
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:04,920
to pay the ransom note so not only are

331
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:07,740
you opening up yourself to more cyber

332
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:09,180
attacks you're opening up the entire

333
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:11,700
world to more cyber attacks when you pay

334
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:14,579
the ransom so don't do that

335
00:13:14,579 --> 00:13:17,399
if you can avoid it

336
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:21,120
so free with an asterisk because

337
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,639
it may not have a price associated with

338
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:26,459
it but there is a time commitment that

339
00:13:26,459 --> 00:13:28,260
you will have to put in for these

340
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:30,720
Solutions just like with most things but

341
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,000
there will be no monetary price that you

342
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,160
have to pay to a company for these

343
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:38,360
products or Solutions

344
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:42,120
enable multi-factor authentication on

345
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:45,000
every possible thing

346
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,720
and when I say that I mean your

347
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,459
corporate accounts is what I'm

348
00:13:50,459 --> 00:13:52,440
specifically talking about here

349
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,959
every time that you have the ability to

350
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,000
add multiple multi-factor authentication

351
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,519
you should definitely enable it and if

352
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:00,959
you're the business owner or you're an

353
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,820
executive at the small to medium-sized

354
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:03,899
businesses

355
00:14:03,899 --> 00:14:06,600
you should make that a requirement of

356
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:09,959
every single employee there

357
00:14:09,959 --> 00:14:11,880
using a password manager in the correct

358
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:14,040
way is important

359
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,779
patching and updating as we mentioned

360
00:14:15,779 --> 00:14:17,519
earlier if you don't have a good

361
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:20,279
patching and management system in place

362
00:14:20,279 --> 00:14:22,100
and you have

363
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:24,660
well-documented evidence on how this is

364
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:26,339
all handled and when a new critical

365
00:14:26,339 --> 00:14:29,100
security patch comes out you need to be

366
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:31,079
able to make sure that every vulnerable

367
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:32,820
system has been patched within a timely

368
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:34,200
manner

369
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,820
you can create an in-house phishing

370
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:37,260
awareness training

371
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:39,600
it'll take some time and research if

372
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,339
you're not familiar with performing

373
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:42,660
these types of trainings for your

374
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:45,060
company but it's definitely worth it

375
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:46,860
because as we've said already multiple

376
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:48,720
times phishing is the number one attack

377
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,639
vector

378
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,800
so once you have the phishing awareness

379
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:56,339
training in place you can also do

380
00:14:56,339 --> 00:14:58,440
phishing tests slash you know

381
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:01,560
simulations to help reinforce that

382
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:03,839
training in all of your employees

383
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:05,760
so one thing that I've seen some

384
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,800
companies do is they'll send out a fake

385
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:11,100
phishing email that is clearly not

386
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:13,500
legitimate and the link that is in there

387
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,880
that they're trying to entice you to

388
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,800
click just brings you to the phishing

389
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,420
awareness training itself for your

390
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:19,440
company

391
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,480
and that's a good solution uh it does

392
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:24,000
help it's not perfect nothing is

393
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,459
insecurity but

394
00:15:26,459 --> 00:15:29,399
it definitely reduces the amount of risk

395
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:31,980
exponentially the more people that do

396
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:34,380
this training and understand it and they

397
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:36,060
go through simulations they become more

398
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,860
Vigilant because now they're looking for

399
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:39,899
the simulations which means that they're

400
00:15:39,899 --> 00:15:42,180
looking at the real phishing emails like

401
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:43,800
oh that's probably a simulation I'm not

402
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,540
clicking on that you know I don't want

403
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:47,459
my name to be on that list today

404
00:15:47,459 --> 00:15:50,339
uh so you're helping out uh overall by

405
00:15:50,339 --> 00:15:52,860
doing something like that

406
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:54,839
Implement policies and procedures in

407
00:15:54,839 --> 00:15:57,720
your organization so this again is

408
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,519
targeted more at the executives or

409
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:02,699
management of the the company

410
00:16:02,699 --> 00:16:05,339
but essentially what you can do is you

411
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:07,079
can make all of these cyber security

412
00:16:07,079 --> 00:16:08,880
awareness trainings and everything like

413
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:13,019
that a mandatory task for everybody and

414
00:16:13,019 --> 00:16:16,440
how you implement that kind of varies by

415
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,000
person to person on their opinions on

416
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,680
how it should be implemented

417
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,620
but for basically like a blanket

418
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:24,480
statement you should make sure that

419
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,339
strong security practices and best

420
00:16:26,339 --> 00:16:27,480
practices

421
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,860
are

422
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:31,680
being promoted by the executive

423
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,360
leadership so that way all employees

424
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,639
will follow it overarching reducing the

425
00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:38,160
risk of the company of the cyber attacks

426
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,480
sorry

427
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:42,899
so one such policy or I guess you can

428
00:16:42,899 --> 00:16:45,420
say best practice would be least

429
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:47,519
privilege and this is something that you

430
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:49,339
don't necessarily need money to

431
00:16:49,339 --> 00:16:51,660
implement it and the reason is because

432
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:54,120
you probably already have some type of

433
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,399
mechanism that you

434
00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:00,000
um have a separation of duties for

435
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,759
people right why does somebody in this

436
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:04,439
department need information that's in

437
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:05,520
this other department if they have

438
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,439
nothing to do with it will block that

439
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:10,020
access that's basically the principle of

440
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:11,819
least privilege you want to make sure

441
00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:15,000
that people only have access to what

442
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,859
they need to have access to and nothing

443
00:17:16,859 --> 00:17:17,699
more

444
00:17:17,699 --> 00:17:20,099
if they need the access later they can

445
00:17:20,099 --> 00:17:21,720
request it and they can go through the

446
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:24,839
process that you have set up

447
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:27,419
and I'm an incident response guy so of

448
00:17:27,419 --> 00:17:29,100
course the instant response plan I'm

449
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:31,559
going to be talking about

450
00:17:31,559 --> 00:17:34,140
um too often I have seen it where

451
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:36,660
organizations have no idea what they're

452
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:38,820
going to do in the case of a major

453
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:41,340
breach and that's how you do it right

454
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:43,140
there you do an incident response plan

455
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:47,160
you need to identify the biggest risks

456
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:49,679
to your environment and then you need to

457
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:52,740
set up a plan of if these systems get

458
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:55,380
attacked what are we going to do

459
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:58,080
and this helps for a couple of reasons

460
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,960
and the biggest one is muscle memory

461
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,679
so if you have a small team of I.T

462
00:18:04,679 --> 00:18:07,140
Engineers or something along those lines

463
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:08,820
and you don't have any dedicated

464
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:10,679
security personnel

465
00:18:10,679 --> 00:18:12,900
there's not going to be many people in

466
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:15,120
your organization who already know what

467
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,919
they need to do in the case of a major

468
00:18:16,919 --> 00:18:19,799
breach so what you do is you build an

469
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:21,600
instant response plan and then you test

470
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,320
it

471
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:25,080
so that way every single person in that

472
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:27,539
organization who is responsible to

473
00:18:27,539 --> 00:18:29,820
perform certain actions during the

474
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:31,980
instant response they know exactly what

475
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:33,660
they need to do

476
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:36,900
another big issue that I see with not

477
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:39,299
having an instant response plan is that

478
00:18:39,299 --> 00:18:41,520
you might miss something In the Heat of

479
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,539
the Moment

480
00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:45,120
so if you're getting attacked by I don't

481
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,760
know want to cry for instance and you

482
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,620
don't have an incident response plan and

483
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:51,120
you think you know what you're doing

484
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,500
because you're a cyber security

485
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,600
professional you got this right well

486
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,919
maybe you missed something maybe you

487
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:58,380
forgot to check one log Source maybe you

488
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:00,660
forgot to quarantine one machine

489
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:02,820
something like that and then the

490
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:04,620
ransomware is still active on your

491
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:06,179
network even when you think you're done

492
00:19:06,179 --> 00:19:07,380
with it

493
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:09,600
having an instant response plan is in my

494
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,780
opinion absolutely crucial

495
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:14,940
having playbooks or run books follows

496
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:17,400
along the same lines in this type of

497
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:20,340
scenario what are we going to do so in

498
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:22,140
the case of ransomware it has a

499
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:24,059
step-by-step process or general

500
00:19:24,059 --> 00:19:26,940
guidelines of what needs to happen in

501
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:29,700
order to ensure that the ransomware

502
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:32,640
stops being spread you can contain it

503
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,660
and you can eradicate it

504
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:39,539
going more into multi-factor

505
00:19:39,539 --> 00:19:41,760
Authentication

506
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,220
it's obviously far more secure than just

507
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:47,340
a password alone so instead of only

508
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:49,799
typing in a username and password to log

509
00:19:49,799 --> 00:19:51,720
into any system

510
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,340
you will also have to have that second

511
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:55,799
factor and that could be anything from

512
00:19:55,799 --> 00:19:58,320
an authenticator app on your phone to a

513
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:01,080
text message an email and then of course

514
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:03,480
you also have Biometrics so many of us

515
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,100
have phones that have fingerprint

516
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:08,539
scanners face scanners those types of

517
00:20:08,539 --> 00:20:11,400
solutions those would also be considered

518
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:15,299
a second Factor authentication process

519
00:20:15,299 --> 00:20:17,640
this also means that there's more steps

520
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:20,160
for the attacker so now not only do they

521
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,080
have to somehow get your username and

522
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,120
password but now they also have to

523
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:26,580
figure out how to get that second Factor

524
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:28,559
authentication to be utilized in the

525
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:30,360
authentication process

526
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:34,219
in order to break into your account

527
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,679
so moving on to password managers and

528
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:40,020
how to use them correctly

529
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:42,840
they enforce strong sorry you should

530
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:45,660
enforce a strong master password

531
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:48,960
so your your master password is what

532
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,720
unlocks essentially your Vault of all of

533
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,580
your other passwords that you don't have

534
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:55,320
to remember because they're stored in a

535
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,100
vault

536
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:58,340
so if you have a really really strong

537
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:00,900
master password and multi-factor

538
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:04,380
authentication on your password manager

539
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:06,240
it'll be far less likely that an

540
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,400
attacker can gain access to that account

541
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,320
and since you're using a password

542
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,059
manager you only got to remember the one

543
00:21:12,059 --> 00:21:14,400
right single sign-on is another solution

544
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,679
for this that's a little bit more on the

545
00:21:16,679 --> 00:21:19,080
Enterprise side

546
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:22,200
so after you have a very strong master

547
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,240
password what about all the other

548
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,760
accounts well I want you to just

549
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:29,580
randomly generate 20 plus character long

550
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,440
passwords because you don't even have to

551
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,700
remember them

552
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:34,260
you're just going to store them in the

553
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:36,720
password manager anyways

554
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,600
so add in characters symbols uppercase

555
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,360
lowercase numbers all of that stuff and

556
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:44,760
make it long strong and

557
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:47,100
you're going to feel more safe now

558
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:48,659
because who's going to be able to guess

559
00:21:48,659 --> 00:21:51,260
that kind of password

560
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:54,120
you also have the ability to monitor

561
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:56,100
account access and other critical logs

562
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:58,260
so now I put an asteroid here as well

563
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:01,320
usually it's a paid service add-on for

564
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:04,740
these password manager services

565
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,440
excuse me

566
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:09,780
however there are ways that you can

567
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:12,900
utilize that to your advantage that are

568
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:15,780
well worth the money in my opinion

569
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:18,419
so what does this actually mean what

570
00:22:18,419 --> 00:22:21,360
does it actually do for these smbs

571
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:24,360
well they can now monitor who is

572
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:28,320
accessing what systems at what times and

573
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,419
sometimes you can even get the GPS

574
00:22:30,419 --> 00:22:33,360
location of the individual where they

575
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,340
logged in from

576
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:36,720
so

577
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:39,840
this provides more insight into what is

578
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,220
happening with all of the accounts

579
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:43,880
across the Enterprise

580
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:47,880
so

581
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:51,120
on implementing policy and procedures

582
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,860
establishing security is part of your

583
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:54,900
culture is huge

584
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:57,120
uh anybody ever heard of Google you know

585
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:00,600
small company uh they several years ago

586
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:03,120
they implemented a requirement for all

587
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,640
employees to use Fido tokens which are

588
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,919
physical devices that you have to plug

589
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:09,960
into the computer as your second Factor

590
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,280
Authentication

591
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,799
who here knows how many times Google's

592
00:23:13,799 --> 00:23:16,440
accounts have been like sorry internal

593
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:19,140
accounts have been compromised

594
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:21,720
zero about a single time since they

595
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,460
implemented that

596
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:26,760
uh policy and that that security is part

597
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,440
of their culture have they had any of

598
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,419
their internal accounts

599
00:23:30,419 --> 00:23:33,240
compromise as a result

600
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:36,539
so establishing security is part of this

601
00:23:36,539 --> 00:23:39,900
culture is going to help you reduce risk

602
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:42,360
tenfold

603
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:44,159
and it's because people are the weak

604
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:47,220
link so most attacks

605
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:49,200
such as fishing you know social

606
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,880
engineering

607
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,220
they they don't attack any particular

608
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:54,780
system right they're not really an

609
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:57,240
attack in the traditional sense what

610
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:00,179
they are is they're attacking the person

611
00:24:00,179 --> 00:24:04,140
and their human mind to trick it into

612
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:05,760
clicking something or downloading

613
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,640
something that then drops malware or a

614
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:13,080
reverse shell or whatever else

615
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:15,840
so if you establishing sorry if you

616
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,240
establish the security as part of the

617
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,100
culture in your entire company

618
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:21,299
then you shouldn't have to worry about

619
00:24:21,299 --> 00:24:23,880
that as much still going to be there but

620
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:26,760
the overall risk will be reduced

621
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:28,440
just like I was talking about earlier

622
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:30,780
make sure that you create a plan for how

623
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:32,220
you're going to respond to the most

624
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:34,679
common attacks if ransomware is your

625
00:24:34,679 --> 00:24:36,780
biggest threat then make a playbook for

626
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:38,760
ransomware what are you going to do when

627
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:41,700
it happens because again just because

628
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:43,140
you're a small business or you think

629
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:45,000
that you're not a good Target

630
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,179
think again because you definitely are

631
00:24:48,179 --> 00:24:50,640
I'm including here incident response

632
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:53,640
plan ransomware Playbook stuff like that

633
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,919
require MFA on all critical accounts for

634
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:58,020
all employees I kind of discussed that

635
00:24:58,020 --> 00:24:59,220
earlier

636
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:01,200
and of course encourage Behavior related

637
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,520
to security

638
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:05,280
and what I mean by this is if you see

639
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,200
something say something is usually how

640
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,960
people will put it if you see something

641
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:12,600
or if You observe a practice or a person

642
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,460
in the company performing a certain

643
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:18,020
action that doesn't seem very secure

644
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:20,580
encouraged the behavior of reporting

645
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:21,419
that

646
00:25:21,419 --> 00:25:23,520
and not reprimanding people for

647
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,100
reporting that

648
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:27,419
obviously that will have to be reported

649
00:25:27,419 --> 00:25:29,100
somewhere so if you don't have a process

650
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:31,919
for that you should probably do that

651
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:36,419
and I have seen this catch threats and

652
00:25:36,419 --> 00:25:39,419
active attacks multiple times where

653
00:25:39,419 --> 00:25:41,700
somebody was just like hey my computer

654
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,919
was acting funny and I didn't know what

655
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:46,320
was going on so I you know I'm

656
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:49,080
submitting a ticket to the help desk and

657
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,340
then the help desk picks it up and

658
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:51,900
they're like oh this doesn't look very

659
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:53,580
good and then they send it off to the

660
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:55,320
security operations center to triage

661
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,240
turns out there was malware on that

662
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,799
system

663
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:01,620
so obviously whatever security technical

664
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:03,960
security controls they've implemented on

665
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:06,480
that host did not work

666
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:09,419
and so having the person identify

667
00:26:09,419 --> 00:26:11,760
something is not correct and Reporting

668
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,980
it that's what actually caught it so

669
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:15,900
encouraging that as part of the culture

670
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:17,880
huge

671
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,919
of course reporting phishing attempts is

672
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:22,020
another major example here

673
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:24,900
so whenever a phishing email comes in

674
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:28,380
either suspected or legitimate

675
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:30,659
you want to be able to have a process in

676
00:26:30,659 --> 00:26:33,539
place for employees to report that email

677
00:26:33,539 --> 00:26:35,880
because they might not be the only

678
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,559
person that got it and did not click

679
00:26:37,559 --> 00:26:39,659
right there could be multiple people

680
00:26:39,659 --> 00:26:42,059
that got that same exact email and maybe

681
00:26:42,059 --> 00:26:44,159
none of them reported it except for one

682
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:46,320
person now you can go into your email

683
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,700
software

684
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:49,679
and you can search for all the people

685
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:51,600
who have been given this email

686
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,400
and you can continue your triage from

687
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,580
there

688
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:57,360
identifying security threats and

689
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,039
vulnerabilities then reporting them to

690
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:00,900
the security team kind of already went

691
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:03,659
over that but essentially

692
00:27:03,659 --> 00:27:05,520
if you see

693
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,080
uh you know you're running an old

694
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:09,360
version of PHP on your website and for

695
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,340
some reason nobody has patched it

696
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:13,919
say something bring it up that's going

697
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:16,940
to help you immensely

698
00:27:17,159 --> 00:27:19,320
so now I'm going to be moving on to paid

699
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:21,299
services and how they help you no I'm

700
00:27:21,299 --> 00:27:24,379
not going to be selling you anything

701
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,880
so of course the big one malware

702
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,860
protection and Antivirus right everybody

703
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:31,799
knows this it's been around forever

704
00:27:31,799 --> 00:27:33,360
um you know you've got McAfee you got

705
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,919
Malwarebytes you've got all sorts of

706
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:36,779
stuff you even got the new cool ones

707
00:27:36,779 --> 00:27:38,880
like crowdstrike and Sentinel one and

708
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,140
all that

709
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:43,260
but for the most part that gets a little

710
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:46,440
too complicated for these smbs because

711
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:49,380
now you're starting to get very in-depth

712
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:51,960
into the cyber security field and the

713
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,640
expertise that it requires to understand

714
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,980
how these systems actually work

715
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:57,840
they obviously don't have time for that

716
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,220
so

717
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:01,020
it's not your mama's AV software anymore

718
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:02,940
it's kind of how I like to put it

719
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:04,799
it's a lot more sophisticated than it

720
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:05,820
used to be

721
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:08,400
and it helps way more than the old

722
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,380
school antiviruses that you used to put

723
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:14,460
on your computer from Best Buy in 2005.

724
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:16,799
it's crucial to have but unfortunately

725
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:19,140
it's not enough by itself

726
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:21,600
and we're gonna go over that a little

727
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,820
bit more in a couple slides so I'm going

728
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:26,159
to hold off on that

729
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:28,320
email filtering and phishing protection

730
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,840
we're going over that as well so since

731
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:33,659
fishing is the most common uh initial

732
00:28:33,659 --> 00:28:36,480
issue excuse me

733
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:39,140
infection vector

734
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:41,700
having the ability to filter out

735
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:44,760
potential phishing emails is huge

736
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,980
so it will stop most phishing attempts

737
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:48,960
when configured properly

738
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,419
and it helps so much more than you think

739
00:28:51,419 --> 00:28:54,000
it does because the human element still

740
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,039
plays a big role here

741
00:28:56,039 --> 00:28:59,400
if there are less less emails that get

742
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:02,580
to your employees to click on then just

743
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:05,520
buy statistics stake less emails will be

744
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,559
clicked on

745
00:29:07,559 --> 00:29:10,140
it's crucial to have but again not

746
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:12,980
enough by itself

747
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:16,200
backup Services bcdr right business

748
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:19,200
continuity and disaster recovery I know

749
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,360
it's boring nobody likes to talk about

750
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,279
it but it's important and we need to

751
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:25,980
have it if you get ransomware across all

752
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:27,899
of your DC's

753
00:29:27,899 --> 00:29:29,640
and you don't have any backups or any

754
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:32,039
plan to recover from that attack

755
00:29:32,039 --> 00:29:33,840
then you're kind of just dead in the

756
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:34,799
water

757
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:38,100
so having these backup services that are

758
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:41,880
off-site another critical point there is

759
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,140
making sure that they're off-site could

760
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:45,000
be in the cloud maybe you have your own

761
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,580
data center whatever the case is making

762
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:49,500
sure that those backups are not stored

763
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:52,020
on the same server that you're backing

764
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:55,500
them up from huge

765
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:58,440
and again crucial to have should be

766
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:01,740
required on all critical systems

767
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:05,279
and then another very key Point here you

768
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:07,740
have to test the backups because you

769
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:09,299
can't just point to say oh yeah we got

770
00:30:09,299 --> 00:30:11,880
backups it's fine and then three years

771
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:14,100
later ransomware hits you and then come

772
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:15,720
to find out three years ago somebody

773
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,580
forgot to push a configuration file to

774
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:18,720
make sure that they can actually work

775
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:19,799
properly

776
00:30:19,799 --> 00:30:21,779
so make sure that you test these and you

777
00:30:21,779 --> 00:30:25,159
run through bcdr tests

778
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:27,899
so you can get policy and plan reviews

779
00:30:27,899 --> 00:30:30,240
by the third party services

780
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,460
so this kind of ties in with what I was

781
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:34,320
talking about with the instant response

782
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,299
plans all the playbooks and the Run

783
00:30:36,299 --> 00:30:37,500
books

784
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:40,080
you can actually have cyber security

785
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,840
companies that review these plans for

786
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:45,720
you provide you with

787
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,820
um you know recommendations to make them

788
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:50,039
better or

789
00:30:50,039 --> 00:30:51,840
changes that they think you should

790
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,120
Implement best practices that they

791
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:56,580
notice you didn't have included and they

792
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:59,580
can also work with you to tailor these

793
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:01,880
plans and these

794
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:04,919
policies to your organization because

795
00:31:04,919 --> 00:31:07,500
every organization is unique and you'll

796
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:09,059
have different infrastructure depending

797
00:31:09,059 --> 00:31:12,840
on what industry you're in and all that

798
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,880
in that you can identify the gaps

799
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,500
improve your response and then

800
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:19,620
standardizing your workflow because if

801
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:22,860
you have uh three different people doing

802
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:24,600
three different

803
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:27,179
processes for the same malware or the

804
00:31:27,179 --> 00:31:29,220
same type of attack you're going to get

805
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:31,020
three different results

806
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:33,539
so standardizing that is going to be

807
00:31:33,539 --> 00:31:35,340
immensely helpful when you're trying

808
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:37,980
trying to identify the actual underlying

809
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:40,320
issue

810
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:43,440
security assessments is another major

811
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,399
one

812
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:46,080
all this talk about going to the cloud

813
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:48,360
most of these smbs are moving to the

814
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:50,100
cloud or they're starting out in the

815
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:52,260
cloud and maybe they don't understand it

816
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:54,720
very well or maybe they only kind of

817
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,880
understand how it works and they're like

818
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:59,279
oh my Engineers just handle that

819
00:31:59,279 --> 00:31:59,880
um

820
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:04,279
if you don't get your environment

821
00:32:04,279 --> 00:32:07,140
checked by somebody else like a third

822
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:08,580
party

823
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:10,799
then you might be missing something and

824
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:13,260
it's important to make sure that you're

825
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:15,480
filling in all the gaps as consistently

826
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:16,860
as possible

827
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:19,860
security assessments honestly you can

828
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:21,960
get away with doing them once a year I

829
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:23,279
would recommend probably every six

830
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:25,500
months because your infrastructure is

831
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:27,059
probably changing more often than you

832
00:32:27,059 --> 00:32:30,539
think it is and so verifying that your

833
00:32:30,539 --> 00:32:32,940
configurations are implemented properly

834
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:35,880
or you don't have exposed credentials on

835
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:39,299
some Amazon S3 bucket or whatever

836
00:32:39,299 --> 00:32:40,980
those are probably going to save you

837
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:42,960
from a major breach

838
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:45,600
so you could do on-prem or Cloud focused

839
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,120
maybe both it just depends on your

840
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:50,399
unique environment

841
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:52,020
you can get recommendations on

842
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:53,940
Improvement areas

843
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:56,399
from again cyber Security Professionals

844
00:32:56,399 --> 00:32:59,299
and experts

845
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:01,320
next one is going to be risk assessments

846
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:04,080
around cyber attacks this one will be a

847
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,600
little bit more focused on the

848
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:09,840
overarching strategy of your company

849
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:13,559
and essentially it'll be more focused on

850
00:33:13,559 --> 00:33:15,659
less technical controls and more

851
00:33:15,659 --> 00:33:18,840
managerial or process Focus controls so

852
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:21,360
very much focused on the executives and

853
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:23,640
management of an organization

854
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:25,740
they translate the technical issues into

855
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:27,000
the business terms that they can

856
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,019
understand

857
00:33:28,019 --> 00:33:30,000
most of the time these small businesses

858
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,179
they only have a handful of technical

859
00:33:33,179 --> 00:33:35,279
people maybe you know a couple Engineers

860
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:38,279
or a couple help desk individuals

861
00:33:38,279 --> 00:33:40,620
something along those lines

862
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:42,419
being able to

863
00:33:42,419 --> 00:33:44,240
speak in terms that these business

864
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:47,760
owners understand is going to help them

865
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:50,100
immensely

866
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:53,279
attack surface Management Services these

867
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:56,460
can also help you more than you think

868
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:58,919
they can and the reason is like I was

869
00:33:58,919 --> 00:34:00,720
talking about earlier sometimes you just

870
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,760
don't even know what all systems you

871
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:05,159
have under your organization you could

872
00:34:05,159 --> 00:34:08,040
have 3 000 machines out there but then

873
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:11,099
whatever system you're using to identify

874
00:34:11,099 --> 00:34:13,379
those assets it might say something like

875
00:34:13,379 --> 00:34:16,139
2700. and so in your eyes you're like

876
00:34:16,139 --> 00:34:18,719
wow I have 2700 systems that's a lot but

877
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:21,060
you're still missing 300.

878
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:23,040
so being able to have an attacked

879
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:25,260
surface Management Service

880
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:27,000
usually what they'll have is a

881
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,859
continuous monitoring

882
00:34:28,859 --> 00:34:32,760
of your entire organization and then any

883
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:35,639
new asset that they identify

884
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:37,260
they will immediately put it into an

885
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:40,379
automated report and provide that to you

886
00:34:40,379 --> 00:34:42,960
this could also identify Rogue devices

887
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,418
on your network as well so if you're in

888
00:34:45,418 --> 00:34:47,580
a traditional building with traditional

889
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:49,619
networking and everything like that an

890
00:34:49,619 --> 00:34:51,060
attacker tries to throw in a rogue

891
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:53,580
device to maybe capture some traffic or

892
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:55,859
you know just kind of poke and prod see

893
00:34:55,859 --> 00:34:57,839
what you got out there now that that

894
00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:00,720
device was added to your network and

895
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,640
your tax service management system will

896
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:05,520
identify that for you and then you know

897
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,839
if you have an I.T Department they're

898
00:35:06,839 --> 00:35:08,099
gonna be like I don't know what the

899
00:35:08,099 --> 00:35:09,900
system is does anybody know what it is

900
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:12,359
and when they identify that nobody even

901
00:35:12,359 --> 00:35:14,400
knows what the heck is going on that's

902
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,660
when they know that there's an issue

903
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:18,300
that needs to be investigated

904
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:21,660
and of course public facing as well is

905
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:24,900
very huge because that's going to be

906
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:27,119
what most attackers have automated

907
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:29,220
attacks going after they're just Port

908
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:31,380
scanning constantly and if you

909
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:33,540
accidentally spin up some ec2 instance

910
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:35,760
that has some Service public facing

911
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,859
that's vulnerable to an exploit

912
00:35:37,859 --> 00:35:41,040
it's going to get smacked

913
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,540
and then I'm going to bring this back

914
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:44,280
around to phishing simulations as well

915
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:46,560
you don't have to do them yourself there

916
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,000
are tons of companies out there that

917
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,800
offer those services for you

918
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:54,180
so this is what I wanted to bring up

919
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:55,740
earlier

920
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:57,960
is that a lot of these Security

921
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:03,720
Solutions are great or critical even

922
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:05,579
at the

923
00:36:05,579 --> 00:36:07,980
um for sorry they're very critical for

924
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:11,160
everything every organization out there

925
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:13,140
but not by themselves

926
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:15,480
there's this

927
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,200
um

928
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,880
defense in depth

929
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:21,119
concept saying that you can't just use

930
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:22,980
one security solution you have to use

931
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:26,660
multiple layers kind of like an onion

932
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:30,660
and you want it to be harder and harder

933
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:33,599
for the attacker to get in in between

934
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:36,420
this graphic was just one that I found

935
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:39,119
online I did not make it but it just

936
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:41,940
kind of hits some some major points here

937
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:43,980
about you know timely patching

938
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:46,320
encryption sensitive data excuse me

939
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,839
encrypting sensitive data and of course

940
00:36:48,839 --> 00:36:52,440
your antiviruses and your policies and

941
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:54,900
procedures physical security so if you

942
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:55,859
have

943
00:36:55,859 --> 00:36:58,380
uh traditional old-school servers that

944
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:00,180
you have sitting in your own building

945
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:01,920
then you're going to want to make sure

946
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,700
that you have physical Access Control

947
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:07,800
CCTV coverage all of that is part of the

948
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:10,880
security of your organization as well

949
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:14,160
the defense in-depth strategy is going

950
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:16,920
to change from organization to

951
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:18,140
organization

952
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:21,960
it some of these might not affect your

953
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:23,880
business at all for instance physical

954
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:25,920
security you might not need that you

955
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:28,380
might be a remote only organization so

956
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:29,520
you don't really need any physical

957
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:33,780
security so none of these are you know

958
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:36,180
hard points that you need to have but

959
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:38,640
you want to make sure that the concept

960
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:41,579
of Defense in depth is implemented

961
00:37:41,579 --> 00:37:44,839
within your organization

962
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:48,420
so I ended up talking faster than I

963
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:51,300
thought so here's some key takeaways

964
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:54,119
criminals don't care about you or your

965
00:37:54,119 --> 00:37:55,859
organization they don't care if you're

966
00:37:55,859 --> 00:37:57,839
going through a hard time they don't

967
00:37:57,839 --> 00:37:59,880
care if you just had a baby they don't

968
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:00,960
care if it's three o'clock in the

969
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,880
morning they're going to attack you when

970
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:05,160
they have the opportunity

971
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:06,240
and they don't care about your

972
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:07,700
organization either

973
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:10,140
if they can make a quick Buck off of you

974
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:12,720
that's all they care about

975
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,700
smbs are much bigger targets than you

976
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:16,260
think as we discussed with the

977
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:19,560
statistics from the dfir reports

978
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:21,839
basic security measures go further than

979
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:23,160
you think

980
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:25,560
uh some of them are even free

981
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:27,660
so

982
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:30,359
implementing best practices alone will

983
00:38:30,359 --> 00:38:32,160
probably save you

984
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:35,280
from more cyber attacks than you

985
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:38,660
actually think they would

986
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:40,740
if it's in your budget consider a

987
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:43,380
low-cost third party to assist again I'm

988
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:46,020
not trying to sell you anything here but

989
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:48,119
they are helpful if you're not familiar

990
00:38:48,119 --> 00:38:50,640
with the solutions and the terms that

991
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,260
I'm using here for the cyber security

992
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:54,960
industry it would be highly beneficial

993
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:58,200
to get a low-cost third-party assessment

994
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:00,480
of your environment and then have them

995
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,400
provide you with recommendations or

996
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:06,660
maybe even that that company offers to

997
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:09,599
do the remediations or the changes for

998
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:11,280
you

999
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:13,440
and preparation is the most important

1000
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:14,520
part

1001
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:16,740
so in the incident response life cycle

1002
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:19,380
the first step is preparation

1003
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:22,200
and then you go through everything else

1004
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:24,180
in my opinion preparation is the most

1005
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:26,160
important part it's not containment it's

1006
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:28,500
not eradication it's none of that it's

1007
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:30,180
preparation because if you're not

1008
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:32,579
prepared then none of the other parts of

1009
00:39:32,579 --> 00:39:34,859
the life cycle matter it all crumbles

1010
00:39:34,859 --> 00:39:37,920
because you need to have a plan you need

1011
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:40,440
to understand what the risks are for

1012
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:42,359
your organization and you need to be

1013
00:39:42,359 --> 00:39:44,579
able to respond in a timely manner or

1014
00:39:44,579 --> 00:39:45,839
else the attackers are just going to own

1015
00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:48,200
your company

1016
00:39:48,599 --> 00:39:50,820
thank you for your time uh does anybody

1017
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:53,660
have any questions

1018
00:39:58,079 --> 00:39:59,820
I got my Twitter and my LinkedIn up

1019
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:01,560
there as well if you guys want to

1020
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:03,240
connect

1021
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:05,820
yeah you talk you touched on a lot of

1022
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:09,000
different services that small businesses

1023
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,280
could use but one thing that I noticed

1024
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,560
wasn't in there is talking about mssps

1025
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:15,300
and I was just wondering is that would

1026
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:16,619
that be pretty critical to small

1027
00:40:16,619 --> 00:40:17,940
business

1028
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:21,780
yeah so uh mssps stand for managed

1029
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:24,359
security service provider and

1030
00:40:24,359 --> 00:40:26,820
essentially most of the services that I

1031
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:29,520
discussed here are actually included in

1032
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:31,980
most mssp service offerings

1033
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:35,700
so while an mssp is not one service in

1034
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:38,579
and of itself they could have multiple

1035
00:40:38,579 --> 00:40:41,820
Services they do have one other that I

1036
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:43,560
didn't bring up which would be like a

1037
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:45,420
sock as a service so a security

1038
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:49,079
operations center that this mssp has

1039
00:40:49,079 --> 00:40:52,140
stood up and then you just ship all of

1040
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:53,640
your logs to them and they do the

1041
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:56,040
analysis the triage and all of that so

1042
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:58,740
you're kind of offloading that work to

1043
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:01,020
another organization and then they

1044
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:03,240
provide you with the feedback or some of

1045
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:05,880
them will even do remediations for you

1046
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:08,400
stuff like that

1047
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:11,339
does that answer your question

1048
00:41:11,339 --> 00:41:14,180
anybody else

1049
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:19,940
thank you for your time
