1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:04,240
all right then uh let us get started

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:06,160
um so

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,559
today we are going to be talking about

4
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:12,400
uh insights into smart vehicle security

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,639
uh

6
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:16,880
moving on to our introduction

7
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:20,560
so this is me ranked uh i'm a security

8
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:21,840
researcher

9
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:22,960
having

10
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,960
been working in the

11
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,920
security space for over seven years now

12
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,599
i have

13
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:31,599
given talks at multiple security

14
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:34,880
conferences and i also get involved in

15
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:35,920
a

16
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,200
bunch of

17
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,840
scheme committees and review boards

18
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,360
especially

19
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,480
with ec council which i have been

20
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:45,680
working with

21
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,239
for a couple of years

22
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:52,960
and yeah good to meet you all virtually

23
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,719
uh srini

24
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:57,680
hey hi this is srini here um i'm even a

25
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,280
secret researcher vendetta and myself

26
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,440
both are colleagues i have very good

27
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,480
friends

28
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,559
and um i am

29
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:06,720
like um

30
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,479
much more passionate about automotive

31
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:10,320
and industrial control systems

32
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,560
i've been uh

33
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,400
members into few of the organizations

34
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,200
like cwe in the hardware segments and

35
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,080
even

36
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,159
a couple of standards

37
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,960
uh more often i in a day-to-day job i

38
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,040
look at offensive security

39
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,759
and do a good um good amount of reverse

40
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:29,920
engineering

41
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,240
thanks

42
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,159
right so as we mentioned so we

43
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,680
have uh so our areas of expertise

44
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,759
include uh typical web application

45
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:46,079
mobile application as well as uh network

46
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:49,119
pen tests uh along alongside we also

47
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:50,240
work on

48
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,680
um

49
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,840
so it's called

50
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:56,880
reviews of products developed

51
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,360
using a bunch of i mean

52
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,439
various programming languages uh

53
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,439
including cc plus plus

54
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:06,000
java and go

55
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,880
as well

56
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,800
so we also do a lot of security research

57
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,599
uh

58
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:14,800
in the linux kernel space as well as

59
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,840
custom

60
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,239
kernel drivers that

61
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:22,160
we get to work on and we both are pretty

62
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,760
passionate about

63
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,160
iot connected technology and smart

64
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,480
vehicles and so on and so forth so

65
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,879
uh this topic is pretty close to our

66
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:33,360
hearts and uh yeah this is something

67
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,680
that we have been doing out of our

68
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,000
passion and would love to talk more

69
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,400
about this

70
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,040
and so the agenda

71
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:43,760
for

72
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,480
this talk is for us to understand what a

73
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,440
smart vehicle is uh take a quick look at

74
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,080
the various components that go into a

75
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,920
smart vehicle solution

76
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:54,800
and

77
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,360
also understand the attack surface that

78
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,920
is open

79
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,800
are unique to a smart vehicle solution

80
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,800
and also look at

81
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,319
the various attack

82
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,640
vectors and the attack surface from an

83
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,000
attacker's perspective

84
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:14,239
so a quick disclaimer

85
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:17,680
uh the content uh in these slides are

86
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,840
purely our view and we do not represent

87
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,599
our employer

88
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:25,040
and we also may uh refer to a bunch of

89
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,319
tools and

90
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:28,400
hardware as well as software tools and

91
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,760
utility utilities so we have them here

92
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,120
as a reference

93
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,200
uh for illustrative purposes and we do

94
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,319
not endorse them and

95
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:39,920
we are

96
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,519
moving on to

97
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:44,840
the smartware smart vehicle applications

98
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,959
so this

99
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:50,239
image gives us a quick look at

100
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:52,080
what areas

101
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,280
disconnected technology caters to

102
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,560
especially smart vehicles have been

103
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,480
growing pretty significantly

104
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,760
in the personal vehicle uh space so

105
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,360
there is als also a lot of uh growth in

106
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,400
fleet vehicles or uh robo taxis if you

107
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,439
will and uh going forward we would also

108
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:16,560
see smart vehicle applications and

109
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,399
public transportations uh logistics uh

110
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:23,440
big at large events such as olympics for

111
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,400
instance as well as uh the

112
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,280
feeder service and at airports

113
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,560
so this just gives us a quick idea a

114
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,680
quick look at where uh smart vehicle

115
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,960
solutions is headed in the upcoming

116
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,960
years

117
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,360
these are a bunch of acronyms that

118
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,360
uh i mean

119
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,680
every enthusiast needs to be familiar

120
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,240
familiar with and

121
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,520
this is something that we would be

122
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,639
referring uh going forward uh in our

123
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:58,800
upcoming slides and

124
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,080
i mean you can

125
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,479
refer back to these acronyms to better

126
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:04,080
understand the context

127
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,039
of

128
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:06,320
the

129
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,400
content that is present in the upcoming

130
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,639
slides

131
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:12,800
so this is what a typical smart vehicle

132
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,080
looks like right so smart vehicle does

133
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:16,800
not

134
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,919
essentially be an electric uh vehicle it

135
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:20,880
can be

136
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,199
an ic engine vehicle

137
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:26,240
as well with a certain

138
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,360
certain

139
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,320
components are present in it

140
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,520
so

141
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:35,360
it it can have it can be a radar lidars

142
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,199
or a combination of both radars and

143
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:40,560
lighters uh in association with a bunch

144
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,960
of cameras uh that could be a 360 degree

145
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,280
vision camera which

146
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,240
is

147
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,840
basically

148
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,000
a bunch of cameras

149
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
around the car that

150
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,039
ties the feet together to provide a 360

151
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:59,039
view of

152
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:01,199
the vehicle and its surroundings

153
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,120
and

154
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,240
the

155
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,800
evaluation of smart vehicles is such

156
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,759
that um so this is something that uh has

157
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:13,039
been laid out by uh sae and

158
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,360
there typically are

159
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,400
six levels of autonomous drivings

160
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,560
and uh so we

161
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,759
typically are uh i mean we would be

162
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:24,800
uh

163
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,440
at this point of time uh all the tesla's

164
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,400
and all the adaf systems that we have on

165
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,680
our personal vehicles uh catered towards

166
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,440
i mean tend to be between uh l2 and

167
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,560
most probably in in l2 a little bit uh

168
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,400
pushing towards l3

169
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,840
and uh so today's uh

170
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,880
today's slides would be more uh

171
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:52,240
focused towards

172
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:56,160
personal vehicles and not towards the

173
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,000
other applications that we discussed in

174
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,120
the earlier slides

175
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,680
moving forward this gives us a quick

176
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,479
look at the smart vehicle architecture

177
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:11,759
so um i mean these are the bare minimum

178
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:14,240
components that go into building a smart

179
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,639
vehicle solution so

180
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:17,440
uh

181
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,960
i mean at the

182
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,199
lowest level we have sensors and

183
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:25,280
actuators so these are the uh

184
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,199
devices that are

185
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:30,560
typically present in a smart vehicle so

186
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,759
sensors uh can range between uh range

187
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:34,800
from your

188
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,720
cameras uh data

189
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,080
lighters and ultrasonic sensors and

190
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,280
actuators are basically your

191
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,039
engine control units

192
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:47,759
such as that control your braking

193
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,599
steering and

194
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:52,160
acceleration basically

195
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:55,840
so this data is later

196
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,680
this data is processed within the

197
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,879
vehicle uh on certain on-board computers

198
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:04,160
uh and

199
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,440
so some data also goes back to the uh

200
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,599
backend cloud infrastructure

201
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:11,680
for

202
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,039
more complex

203
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:14,960
computation

204
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,039
i mean considering that

205
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:20,879
the limited compute power on an onboard

206
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:22,879
vehicle computer the complex

207
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:25,120
calculations and computations

208
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,280
tend to happen in the uh

209
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,879
much beefier

210
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:30,720
cloud infrastructure

211
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,919
and that data transfer happens uh over

212
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:35,839
telematic so

213
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:39,039
um so when we move to communication uh

214
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:42,240
there are uh two types of communications

215
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,480
here right so one of your in-vehicle

216
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,959
communication and the other one is uh

217
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:49,360
telematics which include your

218
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,839
cellular and satellite communication

219
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:54,640
that transfers the data back and forth

220
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:59,839
between the vehicle and the back-end

221
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,480
back-end servers so we would be looking

222
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,920
at

223
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:04,880
we'd be

224
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,640
diving deep into these

225
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:10,160
components in the upcoming slide

226
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,320
looking at the components it's very

227
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,600
familiar that

228
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,160
most of the smart vehicles involve all

229
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,560
of these right so

230
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,360
a smart vehicle which has got sensors

231
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,440
which has got communication interfaces

232
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,080
which have inbuilt devices

233
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,120
are

234
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,560
together working and they generate lots

235
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,560
of data

236
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:38,080
so the requires also storage and

237
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,240
they also store lots of

238
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,800
security related data user related data

239
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,720
sensor related data

240
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,640
and sensors which help the automotive

241
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,800
smart are like

242
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,959
lidar cameras

243
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:55,040
and a lot many

244
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,279
sensors which are there within the

245
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:59,760
automotive

246
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:00,880
connected

247
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,399
ecu's right

248
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:03,120
so

249
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,279
um when we look at communication

250
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:08,160
interfaces as banker was just describing

251
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:11,040
there are interfaces that are internally

252
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,440
connected and there are also interfaces

253
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,279
that are externally connected

254
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:18,640
when i say it is internal there are

255
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,399
low range are

256
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:22,000
connected over a bus

257
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,279
right

258
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:25,360
within a short range you can assume that

259
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,079
as bluetooth wi-fi

260
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:30,959
and within the bus internal bus you can

261
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:35,519
look at can lane most and few others

262
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:37,519
when when we exactly look at what are

263
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:39,839
the external interfaces that any of the

264
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:41,600
automotive vehicle would be

265
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,600
connecting to

266
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,560
there are

267
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,279
entertainment units that allow

268
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:48,800
the

269
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,279
nfc's wi-fi

270
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:52,079
and

271
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:54,399
the telematics which exactly plays a

272
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:57,040
very good role in carrying out the data

273
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,040
and controlling the car

274
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,680
over a cellular network and the gps and

275
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,120
the satellites are the one that helps

276
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,240
you to track

277
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,760
right you also have short-range

278
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,040
communications

279
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,360
which which allows you to

280
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,959
look at the disrupted technologies like

281
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:13,600
to v2x

282
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,160
v to v and all that

283
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,800
above all uh all these data

284
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,760
are carried away uh over to the

285
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,959
network to the cloud and uh it's it's

286
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:29,040
also a weapon that is given to a user

287
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,040
using a smartphone who is able to

288
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,240
control

289
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,560
and who is able to monitor and who is

290
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,839
able to

291
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:38,000
diagnose the car right that's over a

292
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,680
smartphone

293
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,519
this this is all about the components

294
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:43,839
that are totally equipped into a

295
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:47,519
single car which enables it to be smart

296
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:50,320
next right please

297
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,399
we just saw each of this component but

298
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:56,320
this particular slide that we are

299
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,800
currently looking at you can look at me

300
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,880
who is there in the left bottom

301
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,959
who is hand holding a

302
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:06,320
mobile phone with an app operating a car

303
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,160
and there are multiple protocols that

304
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,000
are already inside the car which are

305
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,800
actively running exchanging lots of

306
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,519
information right so the bluetooth for

307
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:18,079
example is connected to my mobile phone

308
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:20,880
and i i'll be able to monitor or give

309
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,720
commands to the vehicle

310
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,959
and continuously know what exactly is

311
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,279
happening with my vehicle status

312
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:29,519
apparently there are telematics modules

313
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:31,040
that actually connect to the cellular

314
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:35,040
network and communicate to the cloud

315
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:38,160
infrastructure by pushing out data and

316
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:41,360
giving the status or getting the remote

317
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,240
updates via the cellular network

318
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,639
parallelly there are also other means

319
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:48,320
where it communicates to

320
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,399
vehicle to vehicle or vehicle to

321
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:52,880
pedestrian pedestrian or any

322
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:57,040
infrastructure or the grade or v2x so

323
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,600
there are n number of possible ways that

324
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,880
in today's world the smart car is doing

325
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,959
so it's a live example where you can see

326
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:07,600
lots of sensors lots of data

327
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,560
apparently there is lots of opportunity

328
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,839
to look at

329
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:14,399
in security space right

330
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:17,040
every every uh

331
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,880
data flow that we are currently looking

332
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,880
at here are

333
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,120
spaces where there are insecurities

334
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,360
applicable so there are lots of

335
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,760
improvements lots of security angles

336
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,040
that has to be

337
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,079
posed

338
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:32,800
and has to be validated for each one of

339
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,000
these

340
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,160
channels

341
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,959
next slide please

342
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:44,000
looking at a few current examples or

343
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,440
current news

344
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,560
you can

345
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,360
recently look at the previous month

346
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,839
saying that there are chips that are

347
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:54,079
already vulnerable like 16 different

348
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:55,760
vulnerabilities have been identified in

349
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,959
a chip which are popularly used in

350
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:02,800
automotive industry right and there are

351
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,480
hackers uh in place who actually connect

352
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,839
who has actually connected to the

353
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:10,959
infotainment unit and was able to uh

354
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:13,040
steal some data

355
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,079
right

356
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:16,959
likewise in october there are similar

357
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:18,800
like chip vulnerabilities that have been

358
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,399
identified or

359
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:21,440
the

360
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,839
android one automotive operating system

361
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:25,040
where there are a few critical

362
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,480
vulnerabilities that have been

363
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,680
identified

364
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:28,959
and

365
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:31,600
there is also an source called leakage

366
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,600
that was also identified

367
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,839
by a major

368
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:38,240
german oem guy

369
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,880
likewise there are n number of examples

370
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,079
and

371
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:43,360
which is

372
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,440
to the to the latest we can also say

373
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,160
that there are ev home charger stations

374
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,320
which are counted over a wi-fi have been

375
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,760
also prone to

376
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,399
uh be vulnerable right

377
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:56,720
so likewise we see lots and lots of

378
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,279
vulnerabilities coming up every day

379
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:02,399
every day and it is a new chance for us

380
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,880
to understand different segments of the

381
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,639
communication different segments of the

382
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:09,040
information that we go we can go ahead

383
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:12,399
and validate and see lots of issues so

384
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:15,199
the coming slides will give you

385
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:17,680
what we exactly have observed in the

386
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:18,720
latest

387
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,639
automotive models

388
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:24,079
let us go ahead next strike please

389
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:26,240
coming back to basics this is very

390
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,560
common for any domain that we are

391
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,759
looking at

392
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:32,639
cia are the pillars that you definitely

393
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:33,519
have to

394
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:36,320
consider for each and every uh security

395
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,920
aspects that you are going to design for

396
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,279
your product

397
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:42,240
right so confidentiality it's definitely

398
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,600
you have to keep your information secret

399
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,279
integrity it's

400
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,360
it's very well known

401
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,920
by multiple ways that you have to

402
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,720
maintain integrity ensure none of the

403
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,399
data none of the firmware none of the

404
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:02,240
commands are modified by unauthorized

405
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,160
adversaries

406
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,560
staying and available is also a critical

407
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:10,000
component likewise it keeps

408
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,680
security in space right so ensure it is

409
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,519
available for your customers it's

410
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:18,000
available for the normal users

411
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,880
unlike a user who wants to get into a

412
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,839
car unable to get into get into a car

413
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:26,320
would be a miserable situation so it's

414
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,560
equally important to understand what

415
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:29,839
different ways

416
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:32,480
that you can think of to

417
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:36,480
validate cia across the product and

418
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,360
classify all the attack scenarios and go

419
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,040
ahead and validate those attack

420
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,360
scenarios

421
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,160
next slide please

422
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,120
in general when we look at

423
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,399
attack vectors

424
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:52,560
what different ways an attack

425
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:56,000
can happen right when we look at a

426
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,440
smart automotive vehicle

427
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,279
these

428
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:03,360
these technologies allow you to connect

429
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,480
physically

430
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,359
these

431
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:07,760
technologies allow you to connect as a

432
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,799
local network and the technologies which

433
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:13,119
are part of the automotive also allow

434
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:15,599
you to connect over a remote

435
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,520
right there is lot of information

436
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,359
exchange happening

437
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:21,359
within the vehicle

438
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:22,079
uh

439
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:24,880
or in a short range communications or

440
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:28,640
remote communications so we can clearly

441
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,760
assume

442
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,000
that all these three are the attack

443
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,760
vectors that anyone can leverage and

444
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,400
do nasty things

445
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,039
let us go a little bit deep down to

446
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:43,280
understand what different techniques

447
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,280
can an attacker

448
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,240
used

449
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,480
by

450
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:51,440
things like this like someone who is

451
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,440
trying to

452
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,480
someone who is trying to

453
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:59,360
get access as a local

454
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,120
sorry as a physical

455
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:01,840
he

456
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:02,960
he can

457
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,559
immediately get into your debug

458
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:05,760
interfaces

459
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,400
any hardware that that openly gives

460
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,039
access to debug interfaces

461
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:12,000
boom

462
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,200
the

463
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,160
physical guy who will be able to connect

464
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,840
to the car will be able to control the

465
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,919
car by tampering lots of

466
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:22,480
functionalities will be able to override

467
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,799
the firmware will be able to write

468
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:26,400
unwanted data

469
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,720
right the usb connectors which allow us

470
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,720
to connect lots of um data transfer will

471
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,200
also is also an entry point for any of

472
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,880
the person any of the attacker to push

473
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,480
data right

474
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,200
and um there are numerous serial

475
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,200
interfaces on the hardwares that are

476
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,880
that are lying around the automotive uh

477
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,760
embedded boards and those can also be a

478
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:55,360
pathway to read the rom

479
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,480
memory

480
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,679
or write some data onto the bus

481
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:02,720
right diagnostics yes

482
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,960
every every vehicle that goes to a

483
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,559
workshop

484
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:08,880
undergoes a diagnostic check and those

485
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,039
diagnostic interfaces will allow you to

486
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:12,160
understand

487
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:15,840
um the requirements of the vehicle and

488
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,840
further any of the attacker who

489
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,080
understands the vehicle thoroughly the

490
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,960
ids that are observed via diagnostics

491
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,440
will be able to push lots of data

492
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,480
and can cause miserable damage

493
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,120
right legacy hardware yeah there are

494
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,520
legacy hardwares which are

495
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,600
not

496
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,520
supporting secure boot

497
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,480
not supporting secure memory

498
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:43,200
not supporting any of the encryption

499
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,679
technologies that are currently used

500
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:48,400
so such such things are very easy for

501
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,360
anyone to understand and tap into for

502
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,600
lots of secretive information

503
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,440
supply chain in today's world we see a

504
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,360
lot of supply chain vulnerabilities

505
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,400
coming up

506
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,559
and this is also an important factor

507
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:03,200
that anyone can dig in and get lots of

508
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,880
sensitive data or

509
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,120
damage the reputation

510
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:10,080
likewise we can go ahead for platform

511
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,000
where platform is the

512
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,919
platform is actually the operating

513
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:16,240
system the firmware the remote update

514
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,120
that the

515
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,480
the vehicle

516
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,880
actually requests and gets updated

517
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,880
or the boot cycle

518
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,960
or any process which is running the

519
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,799
number of accounts that the operating

520
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:29,360
system has memory layout

521
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,520
the middleware

522
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:35,200
which actually talks to the actual

523
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,520
user space and the kernel space

524
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:40,000
and virtualization technologies that are

525
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,679
part of the platform

526
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:44,159
most of this uh in today's world are

527
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,080
insecure as you saw

528
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,039
in the

529
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:49,039
recent news list

530
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:51,679
people have targeted this um

531
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:54,240
platform and started impacting the

532
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,840
product

533
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,200
communication

534
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,080
uh this is and wonderful interface

535
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:03,440
that anyone would like to tap in

536
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,200
understanding various technologies like

537
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,799
bluetooth wi-fi radio frequencies zigbee

538
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:10,720
cellular networks

539
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:11,679
and

540
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:15,120
most of the protocols like can lin

541
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,960
and few others

542
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,960
people will be able to

543
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:22,320
simply tap into the network and

544
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:26,240
query enumerate and exploit lots of

545
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,480
services

546
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,640
going back to the software software our

547
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,720
softwares are the

548
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,360
one that enables

549
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,480
lots of

550
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,960
application innovation and lots of

551
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,720
technologies to be embedded onto the

552
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,000
board

553
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,640
so likewise any software that is built

554
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,039
is built with third-party libraries

555
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:49,919
the protocol functionalities

556
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:52,400
and by default on-board

557
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,200
applications are the apis that are being

558
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,880
used which is

559
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,640
supposed to connect to the

560
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:01,120
vehicle and the remote

561
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,720
cloud interface

562
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,559
and the configurations that are part of

563
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:06,000
the software

564
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,240
and cryptographic services and the

565
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,159
functions so

566
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:12,320
there are various vulnerabilities that

567
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,640
are lying around in each one of them

568
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,720
will be very much interested for anyone

569
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:17,840
to

570
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:21,360
attack and take control or cause any of

571
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,480
the

572
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:26,159
vulnerabilities to the automotive space

573
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:28,559
next next slide please

574
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:30,000
right

575
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,600
so yeah

576
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,159
so that really painted a good picture of

577
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:37,840
uh what we have to be looking at from an

578
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:40,880
attacker's point of view

579
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,760
smart vehicle solution so the reason why

580
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,919
uh we need to

581
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:48,159
when we need this talk is to

582
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:48,960
uh

583
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,000
look at

584
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
the various components and various

585
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,440
attack surface and certain attack

586
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:59,919
vectors that have been introduced uh

587
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:02,640
i mean after uh

588
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,559
i mean when we get into the smart

589
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:07,520
vehicle uh kind of a scenario

590
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,640
so

591
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,080
uh the

592
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:13,679
primary the other uh reason is so we at

593
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:17,039
this point of time we do not have uh

594
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:17,919
a

595
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:20,960
lot of standard security standards uh

596
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:24,159
that are at a mature level right which

597
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:27,360
can be adapted by uh

598
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:30,159
the automotive manufacturers as well as

599
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:33,679
the path suppliers so due to the lack of

600
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:36,799
such maturity and since the

601
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:38,640
technology itself is

602
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,760
still at

603
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:40,799
the

604
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:42,559
infancy state

605
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:46,480
i mean we need to be extra cautious and

606
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:49,520
in terms of locking down

607
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,919
when at least the attack surface that we

608
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:53,360
are looking at

609
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:56,799
in this particular slide

610
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:06,400
so as we were discussing about the

611
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,159
device hardware

612
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:11,200
um device hardware is most prominent

613
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,000
area where anyone having physical access

614
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,159
to the vehicle should be able to get

615
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:20,159
into the machine now looking at various

616
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:22,799
common entry points

617
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:26,400
as a attacker anyone would look at few

618
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,559
interfaces that might give access to the

619
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:30,159
complete system

620
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:33,279
now when we say what is complete system

621
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:35,200
interfaces like jtag

622
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,360
serial interfaces like uart

623
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:40,960
or canon interfaces which is canon

624
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,720
obd

625
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:46,320
and usb interfaces which which can

626
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,720
internally convert for any of the

627
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,320
ethernet or

628
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:53,679
any tdy shell that actually gives you

629
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:55,200
access to the board

630
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,320
and these interfaces uh would lead you

631
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,559
to get a console access

632
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:03,440
will help you to disrupt or access the

633
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,880
local memory

634
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,799
and configurations that are part of the

635
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:07,679
board

636
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:09,039
so

637
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:10,960
many vulnerable services

638
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:11,840
and

639
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,840
missing security patches

640
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:16,080
would help you to get into the system

641
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:16,960
and

642
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:19,760
you can do lots of

643
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:23,039
unwanted firmware update and

644
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:25,600
you can disable the security features

645
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:28,880
and tamper the sensor values and whatnot

646
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,799
push your own firmware

647
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:33,039
right so many things that you can like

648
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:35,279
exactly achieve

649
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:37,919
so there are there is one such

650
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:40,000
example that you can look at

651
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,640
where the obd2 interface which is part

652
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,240
of the vehicle

653
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,840
which you can fetch at the bottom of

654
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,840
your feed

655
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,520
you can strictly

656
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:52,159
connect to the obd vehicle and

657
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:55,039
get access to the

658
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,679
machine the car

659
00:25:57,679 --> 00:25:59,200
right so

660
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:02,320
uh what exactly happens if someone uh

661
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,240
gets connected to the root shell

662
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:08,159
right so uart and few other usb

663
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:10,320
interfaces if there is anyone who has

664
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,000
connected to

665
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,520
those interfaces

666
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:16,159
it gives you access to the boot uh boot

667
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:17,039
shell

668
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:18,080
and

669
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,440
that's because

670
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,279
it's it's insecure

671
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:22,159
and

672
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:24,799
if though even though it's secure there

673
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:27,440
are few glitch attacks that that will

674
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,799
allow you to

675
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:30,880
uh get access to the shell

676
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,000
and

677
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,039
get um you can fetch for lots of

678
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:37,039
secrets like the keys

679
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:39,200
or the passwords in the configuration

680
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,640
files by

681
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:44,000
fetching into the nvram or ep rom

682
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,600
from the same uart

683
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,720
interface

684
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,159
and

685
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:50,400
yes you can go ahead and do

686
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,039
many activities there

687
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:56,559
right and telematics is also one such

688
00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:57,840
area that

689
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,600
anyone can begin

690
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:00,640
and

691
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:03,440
simply get access to lots of

692
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:07,600
api calls or the sms services

693
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,080
or the internet connectivity related

694
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,360
information

695
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:14,559
yeah next like please

696
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:19,600
this this has been savior for most of us

697
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,880
there are logic analyzers like here

698
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,960
we can simply attach the probes to the

699
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:28,159
chip and start analyzing the data so

700
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:30,880
what exactly we have done is we

701
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,279
attach this logic analysis to the can

702
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:34,399
interfaces

703
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:36,240
and on to the next slide you can clearly

704
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:39,760
unders look at the can pulses

705
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:42,240
like what data have been exchanged

706
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,679
between issues

707
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:47,279
between the head unit and ecu's and

708
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:49,039
these pulses will give you lots of

709
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:51,120
information the patterns that you can

710
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,720
literally observe

711
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:53,600
and

712
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:57,039
those those can be replayed it can be

713
00:27:57,039 --> 00:27:58,159
tampered

714
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:00,480
and you can literally understand what

715
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:05,039
are the outcomes of such malicious

716
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,480
can can information or can ids and can

717
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,399
data that you can spoof and send back to

718
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:12,640
the vehicle

719
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:16,120
next slide please

720
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:20,320
um more often we we are very much

721
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,640
acquainted to use beaglebone with a can

722
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:25,600
controller and there are a couple of uh

723
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:28,480
linux tools like

724
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:33,520
can bus and a few few other tools

725
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,360
which will allow you to sniff can sniff

726
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,279
and few other tools which will allow you

727
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:38,640
to sniff

728
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:42,399
the exact can data within the in vehicle

729
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:44,720
network and you can literally look at

730
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:48,399
the output where 305 1a4 1aa are the

731
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:50,159
identifiers of

732
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:52,640
each of the

733
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,080
ecu ids

734
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:57,039
and corresponding 8-bit data that is

735
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:02,960
there here like 8035 or 002f or 7fff

736
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,640
these are the hex representation of the

737
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,520
data that's that's been spoken amongst

738
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,039
the ecu's

739
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:10,320
and

740
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,799
these data carry the actual values of

741
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:16,799
the sensors or the attached um

742
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,120
like for example if you wanted to tamper

743
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:22,399
the tachometer uh you can literally hit

744
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:26,080
the i identify the right id like 166 for

745
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,240
example and

746
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,120
give

747
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,799
the value in the

748
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:31,760
data

749
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:34,480
and the data will be pushed over the can

750
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,840
interface and you can see that the

751
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,840
tachometer actually

752
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:38,960
shows the

753
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:41,760
exact value whichever you wanted to show

754
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,760
so you can literally observe though you

755
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,919
are stable you can literally see this

756
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:47,520
there is a change in the tachometer

757
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,440
value

758
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:52,159
next time please

759
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:55,520
so this is one such output that you can

760
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,360
look at for anyone who is converted

761
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,840
connecting to the uart interfaces will

762
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,559
be able to see a console like this

763
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:05,200
and lots of options which will

764
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,679
enable you to monitor

765
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:11,039
push data and all that

766
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,200
looking at the firmware firmware is a

767
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,720
critical component

768
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:21,200
because firmware has got all the ips

769
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,200
part of the automotive system

770
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:26,480
and firmware is one such area anyone who

771
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:29,039
would like to understand the whole

772
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:30,720
behavior of the

773
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:33,600
functionality should be able to

774
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,480
analyze the firmware so how do we get

775
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,640
this firmware and how do we start and

776
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,480
looking at the internal implementation

777
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,320
of the software that is written on this

778
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:43,840
firmware

779
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,600
so we can use

780
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:48,159
many extraction methodologies like bus

781
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:51,760
pirate shikra connect to the

782
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,600
chips that are part of the automotive

783
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:56,480
head units or entertainment units

784
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,000
and

785
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,200
pull down

786
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,039
the firmware extract the firmware from

787
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:03,120
the chip and

788
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,640
the bin file that you would have been

789
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:07,440
extracting can be reverse engineered

790
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:10,240
using bin walk or lot many tools like

791
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,000
many open source tools

792
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,480
that converts the binary file to a

793
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:18,320
readable format with exact

794
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:21,519
file system as in linux and that gives

795
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:23,360
you a

796
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,519
lots of information where you can go

797
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:28,720
ahead and dig deep down to sensitive

798
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,000
information

799
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,679
like passwords

800
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:33,360
keys the

801
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:34,799
ssl keys

802
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:37,679
or the apis that that are helpful for

803
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:39,760
anyone to go ahead and connect to the

804
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:40,799
cloud

805
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:41,760
or

806
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,600
any of the sensitive information like

807
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,720
sms and or not

808
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:49,440
so what exactly you can look in firmware

809
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,760
right you can look at the encryption

810
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,840
technologies that is customly made for

811
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:56,000
this particular device right

812
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,159
and you can also look at lots of

813
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:01,519
hardcore credentials right so

814
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:03,440
in today's world due to lack of the

815
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,840
hardware capability

816
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,440
developers put a lot of hardcore

817
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:08,960
credentials they don't have remote

818
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,559
connectivity for

819
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:12,960
randomly changing or validating the

820
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:16,080
interface credentials so it is preferred

821
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,919
to put a hardcore credentials and that

822
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:19,919
are something that will be very much

823
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:21,360
interested for us

824
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:23,519
right and there are

825
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:25,519
numerous of backdoor that you can

826
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:27,600
observe in the firmware which will help

827
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,720
you to

828
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,880
remotely connect or debug the same

829
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,159
firmware that

830
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:34,320
that will allow you to extract lots and

831
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:37,120
lots of data

832
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:40,399
sensitive information url endpoints

833
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:44,399
or you can you can

834
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:46,559
rebuild the firmware and see if you can

835
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:48,640
downgrade the firmware version

836
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:51,279
and extract any of the security

837
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:53,440
functionalities and

838
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:56,080
push the firmware back to the device and

839
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:58,240
you can start playing with

840
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,519
likewise

841
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:01,840
there is lots of

842
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,679
techniques that we can use and play with

843
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:06,320
the firmware

844
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:08,720
next slide please

845
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:09,679
right

846
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:12,159
so uh building on to what srini just

847
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:15,120
explained uh from firmware right so

848
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,960
um

849
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:19,360
firmware update and software updates

850
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:22,840
play a key role in

851
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:26,080
uh adding new features and

852
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:28,880
also applying security patches in a

853
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,320
smart vehicle

854
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,480
so

855
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:35,519
in a smart vehicle this plays a

856
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:39,279
critical role just because uh the

857
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:42,720
lifetime of the vehicle and the is

858
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:46,080
directly dependent on the uh security

859
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:49,760
patches that we receive right so if the

860
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:53,120
vehicle is no longer supported by the

861
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:53,840
uh

862
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:56,399
manufacturer or if a certain component

863
00:33:56,399 --> 00:33:58,640
that is uh placed

864
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:00,320
within the

865
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:03,120
automotive right is uh not supported

866
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:07,039
anymore uh that leaves the uh

867
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:09,359
vehicle uh highly susceptible to

868
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:12,480
security attacks so

869
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:16,480
since a software update is a major uh

870
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:20,320
attack surface uh in its own in in a

871
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:23,280
smart vehicle solution so this this

872
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,839
provides an attacker a

873
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:29,199
substantial uh surface to uh

874
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:32,000
attempt to perform malicious activities

875
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:32,800
so

876
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,520
how how can an attacker

877
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:40,159
uh compromise the system this way is by

878
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:42,480
first of all looking so

879
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,280
this can be achieved in multiple ways uh

880
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:48,639
one is to try to capture uh the firmware

881
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:51,359
that is being sent uh firmware or

882
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:53,520
software that is being sent over the air

883
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:56,239
to the vehicle so uh if an attacker is

884
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:58,160
able to capture that and if the firmware

885
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,839
is uh

886
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:03,520
transmitted in an unencrypted fashion

887
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:04,640
then

888
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,960
so again we can go back to what screen

889
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:09,599
discussed earlier in terms of uh

890
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:12,640
dissecting the firmware uh extracting uh

891
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,800
the contents of the firmware and looking

892
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:17,520
for uh vulnerabilities and

893
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,359
sensitive information embedded within

894
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:21,839
the firmware the uh other way to get

895
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:25,680
hold of a firmware is uh there are

896
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:26,880
uh still

897
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:29,440
certain uh

898
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,800
certain uh

899
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,200
software manufacturers that push updates

900
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:33,920
to

901
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:37,280
uh components in a way that requires the

902
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:41,040
firmware to be downloaded onto onto a

903
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:43,200
laptop or onto a mobile phone depending

904
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,760
on the component that is in

905
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,280
uh

906
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:49,440
i mean that we are referring to and

907
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:52,320
later the uh firmware is uh flashed onto

908
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,320
the uh

909
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,560
actual embedded device so this could

910
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,160
also be a

911
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,760
firmware being downloaded onto the

912
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:03,200
onboard uh storage um for instance an

913
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:06,400
ivi and which is later then installed

914
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:09,040
onto the embedded device so these are

915
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:11,839
certain areas that

916
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:12,880
can

917
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,800
provide the attacker with

918
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,960
the firmware and

919
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:19,680
in addition to it there are other

920
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:22,400
logical logic issues that could creep up

921
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,079
right

922
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:25,359
most of which

923
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:28,480
so some of which uh be being uh rollback

924
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,920
prevention so

925
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,520
uh

926
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,440
so there are i mean there are there have

927
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:36,800
been cases right where uh

928
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:39,440
an attacker is able to

929
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,839
use a firmware which is

930
00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:44,400
rightly signed and

931
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:47,280
actually originated from the oem

932
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:49,599
but which is known to have a certain

933
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:51,440
vulnerability

934
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:53,680
even though the company has went ahead

935
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,599
and released an update

936
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:58,800
with mitigations properly in place an

937
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,079
attacker

938
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:01,839
could be able to

939
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:04,320
go ahead and roll back the firmware or

940
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,240
the software to a

941
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:09,599
vulnerable version which would uh

942
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:10,560
leave the

943
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,599
vehicle

944
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:12,400
um

945
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,800
vulnerable to attacks and

946
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:18,320
i mean if if the if such a rollback can

947
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:21,119
be performed uh on a fleet of vehicles

948
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:23,359
then that would substantially increase

949
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:24,640
the

950
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,560
risk of

951
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,960
the passengers or the consumers are

952
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:32,240
using the vehicles

953
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:37,359
so a quick example of this is uh the

954
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:41,200
jeep attack right so this is where uh

955
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,200
uh this is where smart will smart

956
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:46,240
vehicle security uh received uh the

957
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:48,400
traction that it required

958
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:52,880
and um so one of the attacks that

959
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:56,400
the initial security researchers uh uh

960
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,440
leveraged in the jeep hack was to update

961
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:02,240
the firmware uh via the head unit uh

962
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,880
leveraging the usb port so

963
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,160
back then the

964
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:08,560
firmware was not

965
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:11,680
signed properly by the manufacturer or

966
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:14,640
the software provider so

967
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:15,520
the

968
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:18,320
researchers were able to

969
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,320
modify the firmware and flash it back to

970
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:21,359
the

971
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:23,280
embedded system

972
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,240
so

973
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,599
by and large

974
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:28,480
this vulnerability has been mitigated

975
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:29,359
and

976
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:31,280
this has been introduced as a best

977
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:33,599
practice and a lot of

978
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:36,240
manufacturers and a lot of developers

979
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:38,320
follow this

980
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:40,640
so follow this recommendation however

981
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,480
there are still

982
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:45,280
certain oems and certain

983
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,040
suppliers who

984
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,359
do not adhere to this

985
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:51,280
recommendation or

986
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:55,920
to this best practice or this could be

987
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:58,800
negligence or

988
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:03,359
or a gap from the uh developer uh

989
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:06,480
site right so

990
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:09,040
as you rightly said as rightly said

991
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:13,200
banker like we we were looking at um

992
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,920
lots of integrity things right now it

993
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:18,160
was not like earlier now there are

994
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:21,040
certificates that are used to ensure the

995
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:23,119
integrated checks are in place

996
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:26,320
and the binaries are properly signed

997
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,800
but to our observation i could uh

998
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,720
literally say say that

999
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:33,680
uh vulnerabilities like toc tou are

1000
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:34,960
prominent

1001
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,000
um

1002
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,119
and those can be easily identified

1003
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:41,359
while there isn't software update mecha

1004
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:43,359
mechanism which is happening

1005
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:44,560
um

1006
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:47,680
within the vehicle right

1007
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,160
yesterday

1008
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:52,480
so yeah

1009
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:54,880
this is something that

1010
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:55,680
the

1011
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:58,640
architects need to uh pay a

1012
00:39:58,640 --> 00:39:59,599
i mean

1013
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:02,000
special attention uh towards the update

1014
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,640
mechanism and not limited uh so

1015
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:08,400
uh not just uh the i mean

1016
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,400
if the firmware is uh signed that

1017
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,599
doesn't uh

1018
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:13,599
mean that there is nothing that can go

1019
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:16,240
wrong there are other a bunch of other

1020
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:18,160
issues that could creep up uh like what

1021
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:20,640
we discussed earlier uh so we need to

1022
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,720
take uh extra care

1023
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:25,200
in this area and moving on to device

1024
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,440
memory and local storage

1025
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:29,040
uh so

1026
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:31,680
uh considering the limited

1027
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:32,400
uh

1028
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:35,680
storage that is available uh on board in

1029
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:38,319
a vehicle uh

1030
00:40:38,319 --> 00:40:40,880
they may be uh multiple components

1031
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,880
depending on a

1032
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,970
single storage uh right and

1033
00:40:44,970 --> 00:40:46,079
[Music]

1034
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:48,480
so the onboard storage uh

1035
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,560
could store a lot of sensitive

1036
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:53,280
information including pii

1037
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:57,839
vehicle information uh and also

1038
00:40:58,319 --> 00:40:59,760
data

1039
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:02,240
i mean sensor data could also be stored

1040
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:05,599
online for a certain period of time

1041
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:06,400
so

1042
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:09,280
the this is something that has to be

1043
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:13,200
taken care of uh in terms of uh

1044
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:15,119
so the data at rest should be properly

1045
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:17,760
adequately uh encrypted and should also

1046
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:22,000
be cleared in a timely fashion so that

1047
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,040
when any malicious actor is not able to

1048
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:27,520
connect to this

1049
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:29,760
vehicle and steal such sensitive

1050
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:32,839
information so an example of such an

1051
00:41:32,839 --> 00:41:35,920
attack as cars blues

1052
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:39,040
so this is an attack that uh this is a

1053
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:40,880
vulnerability that was uh

1054
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:43,280
discovered by privacy for cars back in

1055
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:46,079
2018 and what happens in this particular

1056
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:49,280
scenario is that uh so

1057
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:52,079
when when we connect our mobile phones

1058
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:56,000
uh to the vehicle over bluetooth so uh

1059
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,520
the data gets synced right and uh

1060
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:03,280
apparently the onboard storage

1061
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:06,319
holds this data such as our contacts

1062
00:42:06,319 --> 00:42:09,680
call logs uh and messages as well

1063
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:10,640
uh

1064
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:13,359
in clear text and

1065
00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:16,400
so in a scenario where the car is a

1066
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,880
borrowed or a rented vehicle

1067
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:20,160
once the

1068
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:22,079
user returns the vehicle right so an

1069
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:24,480
attacker could connect back to the

1070
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:25,520
ivi

1071
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:29,440
and extract the personal identifiable

1072
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:31,040
information such as their contacts and

1073
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:33,119
so on and so forth uh

1074
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:36,000
but with uh i mean this does not this

1075
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,720
attack does not require uh

1076
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:40,640
unique skills or

1077
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:42,880
complex hardware and software this could

1078
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:47,280
be easily uh extracted from the

1079
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:51,280
onboard storage with traditional methods

1080
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:53,280
so moving on to operating system and

1081
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:54,400
kernel

1082
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:56,800
uh so this is also

1083
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,560
a

1084
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:00,000
an attack surface

1085
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,640
considering a smart vehicle solution uh

1086
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:05,839
although this is uh traditional uh

1087
00:43:05,839 --> 00:43:07,920
i mean traditionally uh security

1088
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:10,880
researchers do spend a lot of time when

1089
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:11,760
they

1090
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:13,680
looking for vulnerabilities in kernel as

1091
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:16,160
well as the operating systems

1092
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:17,520
uh a special

1093
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:20,079
uh call out is required in such a

1094
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:21,680
scenario uh

1095
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:25,280
because uh i mean considering the uh

1096
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:28,400
limited memory that is available on an

1097
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:30,880
embedded device right that goes into

1098
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:33,200
a smart vehicle uh

1099
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:35,920
oftentimes the operating system or that

1100
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:39,119
runs on such a device

1101
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:42,319
is not does not have uh security

1102
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:44,319
mitigation techniques uh that are

1103
00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:46,079
available in uh

1104
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:48,880
uh more mature operating systems uh such

1105
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:51,520
as your aslr and uh dep

1106
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:54,880
for instance and extra care needs to be

1107
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:58,640
taken to address uh overflow and overrun

1108
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:02,240
conditions uh on on services running on

1109
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:05,599
embedded devices so um so

1110
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:06,800
yeah

1111
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:08,560
because the

1112
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:11,359
this technology is still uh growing and

1113
00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:13,920
not at a mature state uh we need to take

1114
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:15,839
additional care in terms of addressing

1115
00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:19,280
uh uh such issues as well and constantly

1116
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:22,800
perform uh this is called fuzzing on the

1117
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:25,520
kernels that are being used and uh take

1118
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:26,960
extra care to

1119
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:30,000
uh have the appropriate security patches

1120
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:34,119
uh updated as well

1121
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:41,200
actually

1122
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:43,440
yeah as we we have been discussing on

1123
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:44,960
the communications

1124
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:46,720
there are shortage communication

1125
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:48,480
long-range communications

1126
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:51,119
um familiar things are like bluetooth

1127
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:53,599
zigbee and we have been noticing lots of

1128
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:56,000
vulnerabilities and bluetooth space

1129
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,200
wi-fi

1130
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:59,760
and uh upcoming there might lots of

1131
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:01,599
vulnerabilities coming in

1132
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:03,040
the the

1133
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:05,680
short range communications and if you

1134
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:08,480
look at telematics telematics enable

1135
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:10,480
any of the automotive space to connect

1136
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:12,880
it to the external world

1137
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:16,079
and which is built using a cellular

1138
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:18,079
interface

1139
00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:20,079
which communicates with

1140
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:22,960
gps and also satellite

1141
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:25,119
so there are these are very common that

1142
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:26,400
you can look at

1143
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,560
but overall you can see

1144
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:33,440
uh diagnostics uh lots of wi-fi

1145
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:35,520
lots of information that's been flowing

1146
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:37,760
through all these interfaces based on

1147
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:40,319
their requirements based on the hardware

1148
00:45:40,319 --> 00:45:42,079
capability that you can literally

1149
00:45:42,079 --> 00:45:45,200
connect to the ecu's

1150
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:48,720
next next slide please

1151
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:51,920
when we look at uh

1152
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:54,319
hardware communications uh sorry network

1153
00:45:54,319 --> 00:45:56,000
communications

1154
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,960
every communication network

1155
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:02,400
are different and so there are

1156
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:05,119
different hardwares associated to it

1157
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:07,599
for radio frequency communications like

1158
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:08,800
um

1159
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:11,520
rf which is ranging to

1160
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:13,680
like which are ranging like

1161
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:16,240
915 or

1162
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:17,680
many other

1163
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:19,119
443

1164
00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:21,280
and all that megahertz

1165
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:23,760
we use tools like hikarf

1166
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:27,119
which is a very easy tool

1167
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:30,240
that can allow you to

1168
00:46:30,319 --> 00:46:32,480
tap into the radio network and

1169
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:35,440
understand the pattern of the

1170
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:38,319
data that is flowing from one rf device

1171
00:46:38,319 --> 00:46:40,240
to another rf device

1172
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:43,040
and understand and replay back by

1173
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:45,200
modifying the content

1174
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:47,119
like there are examples where we have

1175
00:46:47,119 --> 00:46:50,319
been noticing um like the

1176
00:46:50,319 --> 00:46:52,720
keyless

1177
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:56,240
keyless

1178
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:57,760
key fobs

1179
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:00,079
where without the key fob the attacker

1180
00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:01,760
will be able to send the

1181
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:04,640
command and the vehicle reacts to it

1182
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:05,920
opens the door

1183
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:09,280
right so such scenarios are

1184
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:11,839
easily tappable and replayed using hack

1185
00:47:11,839 --> 00:47:13,040
rf

1186
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:15,520
and ubertooth is a

1187
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:18,240
device which will help you to

1188
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:20,400
listen to bluetooth communications

1189
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:21,839
ranging from

1190
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:25,280
2.0 to 4.0 4.2

1191
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:27,839
and you should be able to understand the

1192
00:47:27,839 --> 00:47:30,559
security mechanisms understand what data

1193
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:31,920
is being flowing

1194
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:33,040
how is the

1195
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:34,640
authentication implemented what

1196
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:36,720
sensitive data is flowing and you should

1197
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:38,640
be able to modify and replay it back as

1198
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:39,599
well

1199
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:41,680
uh likewise

1200
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:43,280
the wi-fi device

1201
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:45,839
um which is within the network local

1202
00:47:45,839 --> 00:47:46,960
network

1203
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:49,040
where you can connect to alpha wireless

1204
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:52,880
card or wi-fi pineapple to

1205
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:55,680
spoof and fool the wi-fi device that is

1206
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:58,480
part of the vehicle which acts as a

1207
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:01,520
client or a master

1208
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:03,200
there are parallel

1209
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:05,280
softwares that you can use

1210
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:07,760
which can tap in to the

1211
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:08,480
uh

1212
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:10,640
which can add up to the hardware and

1213
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:12,800
look into very interesting traffic

1214
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:15,680
like wireshark can dump which can look

1215
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:17,200
into the can traffic

1216
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:20,160
and ethercap are very good ethercap is a

1217
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:22,160
very good tool that you can do a mitm

1218
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:23,520
for bluetooth

1219
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:26,240
and wi-fi both as well gnu radio is

1220
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:29,759
again used by hack rf

1221
00:48:30,079 --> 00:48:32,720
these tools uh actually help you to

1222
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:34,160
reveal

1223
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:36,160
unencrypted traffic

1224
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:38,400
sensitive information like keys

1225
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:40,640
the encryption methodologies

1226
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:42,559
how what is the length of the key what

1227
00:48:42,559 --> 00:48:44,960
is the next sequence of the key

1228
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:48,000
if the key is constantly rotating

1229
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,760
performing a jamming

1230
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:50,880
and

1231
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:53,280
understand the data flow you can also

1232
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:55,680
try and see if you can really go ahead

1233
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:57,280
and hit the functionalities of the

1234
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:59,280
protocol implementation that is part of

1235
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:02,480
the chip by performing protocol fuzzing

1236
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:05,440
and there are many replay attacks um you

1237
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:07,119
you would have seen on the third slide

1238
00:49:07,119 --> 00:49:09,599
the lots of news there are possibilities

1239
00:49:09,599 --> 00:49:12,480
of replay attacks of the traffic and

1240
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:14,480
people steal the car

1241
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:15,359
funny

1242
00:49:15,359 --> 00:49:18,720
right so uh just a replay attack which

1243
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:22,319
which the attacker uses small devices to

1244
00:49:22,319 --> 00:49:24,000
tap into the

1245
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,359
traffic pattern

1246
00:49:25,359 --> 00:49:27,440
and when the owner is not nearby they

1247
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:32,000
just replay and gain lots of um

1248
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:35,040
value by stealing a car

1249
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:36,319
likewise

1250
00:49:36,319 --> 00:49:38,240
yeah yeah yeah

1251
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:40,480
right in in addition to it there have

1252
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:43,359
also been multiple scenarios where uh

1253
00:49:43,359 --> 00:49:44,720
the

1254
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:47,680
onboard hotspot wi-fi connections that

1255
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:49,680
an automotive

1256
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:51,040
vehicle

1257
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:53,839
provides right so they they tend to have

1258
00:49:53,839 --> 00:49:57,200
default uh wi-fi passwords uh typically

1259
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:58,720
ranging i mean typically being one two

1260
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:00,319
three four five six or

1261
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:03,680
there there may be a logic uh business

1262
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:06,480
logic that sets the password to uh

1263
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:08,720
i mean in relation to a certain time

1264
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:12,079
stamp uh so these are some weaknesses

1265
00:50:12,079 --> 00:50:14,960
that can also be exploited uh

1266
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:17,599
by a skilled uh attacker to

1267
00:50:17,599 --> 00:50:19,839
uh connect to the vehicle and once uh

1268
00:50:19,839 --> 00:50:21,440
the attacker is connected to the vehicle

1269
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:22,559
there is

1270
00:50:22,559 --> 00:50:25,680
a lot of disruption that can be uh

1271
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:29,359
performed so that uh also

1272
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:31,760
something that we need to take care

1273
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:33,839
in this attack surface

1274
00:50:33,839 --> 00:50:35,839
right good thing you can literally look

1275
00:50:35,839 --> 00:50:36,880
at is

1276
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:38,400
uh assume you would have got a

1277
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:41,280
vulnerability in one of the model

1278
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:43,119
right this can be

1279
00:50:43,119 --> 00:50:46,319
replicated to n number of units

1280
00:50:46,319 --> 00:50:48,800
so if if a attacker is successfully

1281
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:50,319
stealing a car

1282
00:50:50,319 --> 00:50:52,640
one particular model he can steal the

1283
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:55,119
same model of different different cars

1284
00:50:55,119 --> 00:50:56,559
so

1285
00:50:56,559 --> 00:50:57,599
the

1286
00:50:57,599 --> 00:51:00,559
the updation of hardware is difficult

1287
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:02,800
it requires a call off of the vehicle

1288
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:04,800
that's very costly

1289
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:07,200
and people don't do so and the remote

1290
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:10,079
updates uh are again very

1291
00:51:10,079 --> 00:51:11,040
cost

1292
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:12,640
and

1293
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:15,599
it is not proven so easy so there are

1294
00:51:15,599 --> 00:51:18,400
many challenges and those challenges for

1295
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:21,520
developers are the success successful

1296
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:26,160
methods for the hackers right next slide

1297
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:30,480
so this this image is part of the

1298
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:33,599
gsm traffic that anyone can look at

1299
00:51:33,599 --> 00:51:35,040
we have used

1300
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:39,040
usrp and hacker1 to understand

1301
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:40,720
what is a communication that is

1302
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:42,480
happening from the telematics to the

1303
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:44,880
cloud and what different

1304
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:47,119
information is passing by over a faraday

1305
00:51:47,119 --> 00:51:49,920
cage and this is just a sample that we

1306
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:52,160
have just put up here

1307
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:53,680
next type please

1308
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:56,400
yeah and the packet inspection is uh

1309
00:51:56,400 --> 00:52:00,079
highly required in terms of uh

1310
00:52:00,079 --> 00:52:02,720
preparing for a replay attack or

1311
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:07,040
another thing certain uh

1312
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:09,200
unencrypted traffic right so that is

1313
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:10,800
something that we need to

1314
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:13,200
look at as well

1315
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:14,240
so

1316
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:16,400
yeah moving on to uh

1317
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:18,720
the application side of things so this

1318
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:20,880
is something that uh

1319
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:21,760
i mean

1320
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:24,880
researchers have been working a lot on

1321
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:26,559
web applications and mobile applications

1322
00:52:26,559 --> 00:52:27,920
so

1323
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:30,240
uh they still uh post uh i mean they

1324
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:33,200
still are an attack surface uh even in a

1325
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:35,200
connected technology or in a smart

1326
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:38,960
vehicle solution kind of a scenario uh

1327
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:43,200
because there are still a bunch of uh

1328
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:45,040
services that are opened up or that can

1329
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:47,599
be accessed via a

1330
00:52:47,599 --> 00:52:49,520
web application or a mobile application

1331
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:52,400
equally and still be able to remotely

1332
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:54,640
control uh vehicle

1333
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:56,480
so

1334
00:52:56,480 --> 00:53:00,960
the typical tools that we require uh for

1335
00:53:01,119 --> 00:53:01,920
to

1336
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:05,280
find vulnerabilities in this area are a

1337
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:08,480
bunch of proxies uh proxy software like

1338
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:11,680
burp suite uh vulnerability scanners uh

1339
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:14,400
wrist uh rest our postman client

1340
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:18,559
to interact with the rest apis and uh

1341
00:53:18,559 --> 00:53:21,119
depending on the uh

1342
00:53:21,119 --> 00:53:22,960
application that we have we may also

1343
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:25,119
require a rooted android device or a

1344
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:27,520
jailbroken ios device to

1345
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:30,960
better control the uh

1346
00:53:31,599 --> 00:53:34,400
on onboard storage of the device and

1347
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:36,720
also tamper with the traffic which is

1348
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:38,960
going back and forth

1349
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:39,920
and

1350
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:41,520
the typical

1351
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:44,640
things to look for as uh for different

1352
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:47,040
default credentials uh also look for an

1353
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:50,079
unencrypted communication uh look for

1354
00:53:50,079 --> 00:53:52,240
ways to bypass

1355
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:54,640
business logics so this can be

1356
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:56,880
uh i mean

1357
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:59,119
so once we reverse engineer a mobile

1358
00:53:59,119 --> 00:54:03,040
application there may be uh certain uh

1359
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:07,200
snippets of the business logic uh

1360
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:10,480
which can be reverse engineered to

1361
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:13,280
bypass certain server side logic as well

1362
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:16,319
so we would be looking at

1363
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:19,440
a quick example of one such thing

1364
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:20,880
so this is

1365
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:21,680
uh

1366
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:24,559
my this is a my car mobile application

1367
00:54:24,559 --> 00:54:26,800
uh which uh

1368
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:28,720
i mean by reverse engineering the

1369
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:31,280
android application uh you could easily

1370
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:34,240
find the uh admin credentials right uh

1371
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:39,119
which is present in clear text in the uh

1372
00:54:39,119 --> 00:54:42,079
in in the client side mobile app so this

1373
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:43,760
is something that

1374
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:47,520
is pretty common uh with with

1375
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:49,520
the mobile applications that

1376
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:51,359
still

1377
00:54:51,359 --> 00:54:53,040
is able to control a

1378
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:56,480
major portion of the vehicle

1379
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:57,680
and

1380
00:54:57,680 --> 00:54:59,599
moving on to cloud infrastructure so

1381
00:54:59,599 --> 00:55:03,599
cloud as we discussed earlier

1382
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:07,200
does a lot of uh heavy lifting uh so the

1383
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:10,319
major uh computation and all the complex

1384
00:55:10,319 --> 00:55:12,799
uh computation happens in the back-end

1385
00:55:12,799 --> 00:55:15,200
server uh in addition to it this is

1386
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:16,400
where uh

1387
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:19,359
continuous learning and the

1388
00:55:19,359 --> 00:55:23,040
model enhancement happens so

1389
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:24,079
keeping

1390
00:55:24,079 --> 00:55:24,960
such

1391
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:29,200
infrastructure safe is pivotal and

1392
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:32,319
with with increasing uh players in the

1393
00:55:32,319 --> 00:55:34,720
automotive space and with increasing

1394
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:36,640
suppliers uh

1395
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:39,760
i mean we need to be uh extra careful in

1396
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:41,920
terms of uh waiting the

1397
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:42,880
uh

1398
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:45,599
back-end the service uh back-end servers

1399
00:55:45,599 --> 00:55:48,799
uh to ensure they have been adequately

1400
00:55:48,799 --> 00:55:50,559
uh

1401
00:55:50,559 --> 00:55:52,000
they have been they are adequately

1402
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,760
secured from a physical security

1403
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:56,160
standpoint as well as uh

1404
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:58,720
a cyber security standpoint

1405
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:00,640
um and also

1406
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:04,160
have all the typical uh cloud security

1407
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:09,279
audits uh happening in a timely manner

1408
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:12,960
so moving on to a code review so

1409
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:13,839
uh

1410
00:56:13,839 --> 00:56:16,720
like so historically it has been proven

1411
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:20,160
right the code review is the best way to

1412
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:24,480
uh or the best approach to identify uh

1413
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:28,400
security vulnerabilities uh and uh this

1414
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:32,400
still stays uh true for uh a security uh

1415
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:35,440
for a smart vehicle solution as well and

1416
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:39,359
uh so the primary primary things that

1417
00:56:39,359 --> 00:56:42,799
have to be looked at are

1418
00:56:42,799 --> 00:56:44,559
we need to ensure that there are no

1419
00:56:44,559 --> 00:56:46,880
hard-coded credentials uh in the code

1420
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:48,880
that is being released uh as well as

1421
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:50,799
look for hard-coded cryptographic

1422
00:56:50,799 --> 00:56:54,240
secrets and also look for um

1423
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:57,599
any unofficiated

1424
00:56:57,599 --> 00:56:59,599
code a logic that could

1425
00:56:59,599 --> 00:57:00,480
uh

1426
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:02,720
reveal uh cryptographic uh algorithms

1427
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:04,160
that are being used and so on and so

1428
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:05,280
forth

1429
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:06,799
and uh

1430
00:57:06,799 --> 00:57:08,720
yeah these are something that

1431
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:11,040
needs to be

1432
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:13,680
addressed before releasing a

1433
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:16,240
software

1434
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:23,119
yeah i'll go pretty go pretty much quick

1435
00:57:23,119 --> 00:57:24,960
uh looking at the current standards

1436
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:27,920
standards are evolving dividing and

1437
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:29,920
we can literally see that

1438
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:33,520
the automotive standards like iso 26262

1439
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:34,640
and

1440
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:35,440
the

1441
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:37,200
402 or

1442
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:42,480
octave or tara or ts

1443
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:44,240
tc204

1444
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:46,240
or few other standards

1445
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:49,040
mainly they are lying around

1446
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:50,559
the

1447
00:57:50,559 --> 00:57:53,040
engineering process of the stlc

1448
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:55,920
and respace security and safety

1449
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:58,480
standards that are part of it so they

1450
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:00,720
take care of the process

1451
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:03,040
ensuring that each and every component

1452
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:04,480
or each and every phase of the

1453
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:06,720
development stage

1454
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:09,040
security is in place and it is actively

1455
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:10,720
used so

1456
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:13,040
these standards prominently play a role

1457
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:14,960
of ensuring that security is part of

1458
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:16,000
their

1459
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,520
life cycle

1460
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:18,559
for

1461
00:58:18,559 --> 00:58:20,839
the complete product

1462
00:58:20,839 --> 00:58:22,799
engagements so

1463
00:58:22,799 --> 00:58:23,760
um

1464
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:25,440
understanding that functionality safety

1465
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:26,720
is

1466
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:28,799
very very important

1467
00:58:28,799 --> 00:58:30,799
these standards will allow you to ensure

1468
00:58:30,799 --> 00:58:31,920
there is

1469
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:34,000
to the max functional safety is being

1470
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:35,680
considered

1471
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:36,880
um

1472
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:38,480
yeah

1473
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:39,520
right

1474
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:42,079
so yeah uh

1475
00:58:42,079 --> 00:58:44,480
we would like to conclude this talk uh i

1476
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:46,480
mean emphasizing that security is not a

1477
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:50,160
step uh but it is a process and uh i

1478
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:52,960
mean this uh this is

1479
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:54,559
even more uh

1480
00:58:54,559 --> 00:58:57,839
critical in a smart vehicle uh because

1481
00:58:57,839 --> 00:59:00,400
this uh directly i mean a lack of

1482
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:03,119
security patch patches would directly

1483
00:59:03,119 --> 00:59:05,359
impact the consumer uh driving the

1484
00:59:05,359 --> 00:59:06,400
vehicle

1485
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:08,559
so the lifetime of

1486
00:59:08,559 --> 00:59:11,119
the vehicle is directly dependent on the

1487
00:59:11,119 --> 00:59:14,000
long term uh support of the components

1488
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,559
that go into a smart vehicle solution

1489
00:59:16,559 --> 00:59:19,359
and since we already uh discussed that

1490
00:59:19,359 --> 00:59:21,920
security standards are still uh

1491
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:25,200
not at a mature state for smart vehicles

1492
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:28,880
uh until a point when uh where uh we

1493
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:30,160
have uh

1494
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:31,040
i mean

1495
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:33,040
pretty well-defined security standards

1496
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:36,400
uh we we need to uh keep pushing updates

1497
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:38,319
we need to keep looking for uh

1498
00:59:38,319 --> 00:59:40,559
vulnerabilities and fixing them

1499
00:59:40,559 --> 00:59:43,760
proactively as well as reactively fix

1500
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:46,880
the uh issues that have been reported by

1501
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:47,760
uh

1502
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:51,119
security researchers uh who who disclose

1503
00:59:51,119 --> 00:59:53,280
them uh ethically right

1504
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:57,760
so this is something that we need to

1505
00:59:58,079 --> 01:00:00,960
take extra care

1506
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:04,079
so this is a fun thing after listening

1507
01:00:04,079 --> 01:00:05,760
to the whole

1508
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:08,240
security aspects of automotive

1509
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:09,839
you can see that

1510
01:00:09,839 --> 01:00:12,720
a person who has

1511
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:15,680
lots of sensors put on on his body

1512
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:17,760
rather than clothes

1513
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:19,520
there is a lot of data being exchanged

1514
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:21,839
likewise the automotive is also the same

1515
01:00:21,839 --> 01:00:22,960
has got

1516
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:24,559
numerous sensors

1517
01:00:24,559 --> 01:00:27,200
numerous data points and lots of data

1518
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:29,280
that's been floating around in within

1519
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:32,160
the vehicle and outside so it's equally

1520
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:33,920
important uh

1521
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:36,799
to see how it transforms

1522
01:00:36,799 --> 01:00:39,680
uh now that we are hearing v two y v two

1523
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:42,640
x b two b lots of data is there

1524
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:45,440
in and around so yeah

1525
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:48,400
good thing to discuss such fun topics

1526
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:49,680
thank you

1527
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:50,559
sure

1528
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:54,079
yeah thank you all uh if you have any

1529
01:00:54,079 --> 01:00:56,000
follow-up questions or something you can

1530
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,880
uh feel free to reach us on linkedin so

1531
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:00,960
that we can discuss it further over

1532
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:02,640
there

1533
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:03,760
thank you

1534
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:05,520
thanks

1535
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:07,280
thanks a lot besides for giving us this

1536
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:08,640
opportunity

1537
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:13,520
have a great evening yeah thank you
