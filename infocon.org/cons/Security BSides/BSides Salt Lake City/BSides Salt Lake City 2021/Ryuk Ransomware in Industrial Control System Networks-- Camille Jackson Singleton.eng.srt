1
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,400
all right

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,719
it looks like it's two o'clock so

3
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:13,040
i'm gonna go ahead and get started

4
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,679
my name is camille jackson singleton i

5
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:18,000
am the strategic cyber threat lead for

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,160
ibm security x-force's threat

7
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,760
intelligence team

8
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,720
and i'm very excited to be here today

9
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,240
to speak with you

10
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,119
and i i live right here in utah and

11
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:31,599
north salt lake so especially excited to

12
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:34,000
rub shoulders with others in utah and

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
hear about the security issues you are

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,160
grappling with and how you are

15
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,800
addressing them and even more to do this

16
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,320
in real life right face to face which is

17
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,559
such a treat especially after the

18
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:48,879
pandemic that we've all been enjoying

19
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:50,559
for so long so

20
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:52,239
to be at a conference and actually see

21
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:54,160
people face to face

22
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,920
is so rare and it's very delightful

23
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,559
and some of my colleagues also from ibm

24
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:02,879
security exports are at this conference

25
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:05,199
we listened to them earlier today snow

26
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:06,799
and grifter

27
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:09,119
are on the penetration testing and

28
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:12,400
incident response side of the house and

29
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,720
i'm on the threat intel side of the

30
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,520
house for ibm security export

31
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,159
as force so i'm looking specifically at

32
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,960
threat actors their tactics techniques

33
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,600
and procedures how these ttps are

34
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,600
evolving over time

35
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,799
and what we can do as organizations to

36
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,720
better defend against them and against

37
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,320
these ttps

38
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,560
and one thing that has definitely been

39
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,560
at the top of our list the past couple

40
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,520
years probably for all fret intel teams

41
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,560
is ransomware we see tons and tons of

42
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,759
ransomware

43
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:46,880
every year

44
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,920
this year is no different even as uh

45
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,119
ransomware

46
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:52,960
groups are coming and going and shutting

47
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,520
down and their arrests

48
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,680
their activity and tempo is still very

49
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,320
high and the profits they make are very

50
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,240
high as well which

51
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,320
which makes it very attractive for cyber

52
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,640
criminals so one ransomware group i've

53
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,800
been looking at in particular

54
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,239
is called ryuk and one reason this group

55
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:14,800
is so interesting to me

56
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,680
is because reich is the group that

57
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,040
x-force has seen most commonly get on

58
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,200
industrial control system

59
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,319
networks

60
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:28,399
and ics networks are of course

61
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,959
networks software and hardware that

62
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:33,360
control industrial processes so this is

63
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,800
like huge manufacturing machinery

64
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,560
and energy generation plants and so when

65
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,720
this equipment is affected

66
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,959
the effects can be really significant

67
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:48,840
potentially things

68
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,200
explode there could potentially be loss

69
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,120
of life or at least

70
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,840
operations go down and those critical

71
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,159
processes can't function for

72
00:02:58,159 --> 00:02:59,599
a little bit of time so that's why we

73
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:01,680
care so much about this

74
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,840
so

75
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,840
um so i wanted to look a little about

76
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,959
how ryuk has gotten on to

77
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:12,000
ics networks and

78
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,080
and how that has happened and what the

79
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,840
implications might be

80
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,319
so i wanted to start off by first

81
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:21,280
discussing the ransomware landscape for

82
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,280
industrial control system networks

83
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,400
overall

84
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,080
and exports data shows that so far this

85
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:32,239
year in 2021 32

86
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:34,640
of all attacks we have seen on

87
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,200
industrial control systems have been

88
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,120
from ransomware this is a greater

89
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,680
percentage than any other attack type

90
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,599
it's almost one-third of all of the

91
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:46,000
incidents we remediate so it's pretty

92
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,040
significant and admittedly even when you

93
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:53,200
look at non-ics organizations ransomware

94
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,159
does again emerge as the top attack type

95
00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:00,000
so this isn't necessarily unique to

96
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,640
industrial control systems but

97
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,840
arguably the effect of ransomware on

98
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,080
organizations with industrial control

99
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,159
systems does have

100
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:11,360
a unique

101
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,799
effect

102
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:14,959
and to get into that a little more

103
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:16,079
um

104
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,478
i feel like you know fairly commonly i

105
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:21,279
will hear the argument that yeah well

106
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:23,199
we're seeing a lot of ransomware attacks

107
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:23,919
and

108
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:25,840
yeah a lot of these ransomware attacks

109
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,840
affect organizations that have ics

110
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,919
networks but often the ransomware

111
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:33,199
doesn't actually get onto the ics

112
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:35,759
portion of the network there's the it

113
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:38,479
network that has email and you know all

114
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:40,000
the other

115
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,840
enterprise functions that a normal

116
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,600
organization will have and then you want

117
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,240
to have segmentation and then there's

118
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,960
the ot network right so so it is true

119
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,800
that um

120
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,280
more often than not ransomware doesn't

121
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,280
get on the ics or operational technology

122
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,919
portion of the network but

123
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:01,280
the assumption that there are no

124
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,280
operational effects

125
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,320
i would definitely counter that

126
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,680
so our reach

127
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,400
our research has shown that in cases

128
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,759
where there's a ransomware attack

129
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:13,840
against an organization with ics

130
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:14,880
networks

131
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,639
56

132
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:18,080
of the time

133
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,440
the attack does affect operations

134
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,960
and admittedly

135
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,440
often these effects

136
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,560
happen colonial pipeline style so

137
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,560
perhaps the ransomware doesn't actually

138
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,360
get onto operational portions of the

139
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,600
network but those operational portions

140
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,960
are still shut down as a precaution to

141
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,479
ensure that the ransomware doesn't

142
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,320
migrate over there

143
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,400
that the ransomware doesn't

144
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,919
have the potential to get into those

145
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:48,960
most sensitive most critical portions of

146
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,240
the network

147
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,479
but even with colonial pipeline it was

148
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:55,440
clear you know the attack caused the

149
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,280
company to shut down

150
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,400
uh

151
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,600
delivery of critical gasoline supplies

152
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,960
for days

153
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,160
and

154
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,600
it caused fluctuations in the gasoline

155
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,000
market i was actually in florida on

156
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,199
vacation when this attack hit and we had

157
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:15,280
to go to three different gas stations

158
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,600
before we could actually find gas we and

159
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,039
after that we had to wait in line for

160
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:21,600
about 25 minutes so for the normal

161
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,639
average

162
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:25,280
person this attack definitely had

163
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,560
real world physical effects

164
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,880
so so that's something to keep in mind

165
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:31,919
and

166
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:33,520
and some of you might be thinking well i

167
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,039
thought this talk was going to talk

168
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:37,520
about when ransomware does actually get

169
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,639
onto ics networks and and yes it does

170
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:43,520
but this point about ransomware attacks

171
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,600
they don't get on ics portions of the

172
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,960
network still having operational impact

173
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,360
is important and one i wanted to be sure

174
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,440
to make

175
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,560
so

176
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,639
looking at the ransomware attack

177
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:59,280
landscape overall for a minute this

178
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,199
graph shows

179
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:04,400
most of the ransomware types the x-force

180
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,120
incident response team has remediated

181
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,000
since 2018 and admittedly this includes

182
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,520
both ics and non-ics

183
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,919
companies but i wanted to show this full

184
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:16,880
picture

185
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,400
just because there's some interesting

186
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,240
trends i wanted to pull out

187
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,720
one thing you'll notice is that ryuk

188
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,160
ransomware

189
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,400
is the highest percentage

190
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,080
holds the highest percentage of attacks

191
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,039
we've seen at 15 18

192
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:32,960
of all the ransomware attacks we've seen

193
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,039
since

194
00:07:34,039 --> 00:07:38,319
2018 so more than any other soda no kibi

195
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:40,960
or rival ransomware comes in at a close

196
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,240
second at 15 percent of tax and it's

197
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,759
worth noting that this year in 2021 that

198
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,720
percentage is actually much higher it's

199
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,120
uh it was close to 40. we'll see if it

200
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,360
goes down closer to the end of the year

201
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,720
because

202
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,879
they have gone out of business hopefully

203
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:01,120
for good um

204
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,919
but they are second and then wannacry is

205
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:05,120
13

206
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,520
and we have seen quite a bit of wannacry

207
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,720
ransomware

208
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,840
affect ics portions actually get onto

209
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,759
ics portions of the network and this is

210
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:15,120
in part because

211
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,000
it's inherently difficult to patch ics

212
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
networks and so it's hard to avoid that

213
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,479
eternal blue exploit so whereas the rest

214
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:24,160
of the world has kind of moved on from

215
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,560
wannacry it's kind of a non-issue

216
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,560
everyone has patched against it

217
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:33,120
that's not true for all ics environments

218
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,080
so i wanted to point that out and then

219
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,479
um diving a little more

220
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:39,599
into

221
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:41,599
specifically so

222
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:43,760
the riot ransomware group first appeared

223
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,080
in august 2018

224
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,399
and assuming they have not shut down we

225
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,640
don't have clear indication of that but

226
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,680
i'm i'm pretty sure they haven't

227
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,680
this makes them the longest one of the

228
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,640
longest running ransomware groups

229
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,720
most ransomware groups survive about 18

230
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,399
months before

231
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:04,160
they fear law enforcement activity and

232
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,080
will shut down so they've been around

233
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,880
for a long time and they also operate

234
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,680
under a ransomware as a service model

235
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:15,200
where central contractors or

236
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,600
central administrators contract out to

237
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,399
affiliates the task of gaining initial

238
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,800
access to victims of interest and

239
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,959
actually deploying the ransomware and

240
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:27,040
those central administrators are often

241
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,560
the ones who actually develop the

242
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,399
ransomware code as well

243
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:33,040
they take a portion of the proceeds

244
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,120
so this is how their business operates

245
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,120
and even the affiliates themselves will

246
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,680
sometimes contract out

247
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,160
gaining initial access so it's a huge

248
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,839
business model

249
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:45,920
lots of cyber criminals working together

250
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,320
huge networks of activity

251
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,080
and we're seeing this become fairly

252
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,920
sophisticated and at least one of the

253
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,320
groups x4 successes assesses that at

254
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,399
least one of the groups that has

255
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:59,040
affiliated with ryuk is a group we track

256
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:03,760
as itg08 also known as fin6

257
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:06,240
one of those cyber criminal groups early

258
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,959
campaigns for wright

259
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:11,360
focus very heavily on

260
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,360
using phishing emails deploying trick

261
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,240
bot

262
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,200
and sometimes times emate malware to

263
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,079
gain initial access to targets of

264
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:21,600
interest

265
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,480
and more recently

266
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,720
reik actors have used

267
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,800
again phishing emails but things such as

268
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,440
the boo or loader bizarre loader so

269
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,680
they've kind of moved away from

270
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,640
using trick bot access

271
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,360
there was a role in ryuk activity from

272
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,160
spring to fall 2020 and admittedly we

273
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:45,040
are in another lull right now but it's

274
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:48,000
it's possible that low will end

275
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,040
but

276
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,079
once they started up again in fall 2020

277
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:54,399
their campaigns

278
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:57,200
shifted to cobalt strike bizarre loader

279
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,959
brewer loader

280
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:01,600
and also with post 2020 they are known

281
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,240
to act very swiftly and deploy

282
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,880
ransomware sometimes within hours of

283
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,839
gaining initial access to an environment

284
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:12,160
so that's extremely fast faster than

285
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,880
most other ransomware groups were

286
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,839
aware of and then also

287
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:21,600
earlier this year the french government

288
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,079
released

289
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:26,560
some analysis indicating that newer ryuk

290
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,519
variants have worm-like capabilities and

291
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:31,200
we're going to get into that a little

292
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,519
more in the next few slides and talk

293
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:34,640
about

294
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,720
those implications

295
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,519
in terms of industries reich prefers to

296
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:40,720
go after

297
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,600
this group loves hospitals

298
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,000
and whereas some ransomware groups

299
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,760
especially during the pandemic have kind

300
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,279
of stood down

301
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:51,600
on attacking hospitals and medical

302
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,440
facilities this is definitely not the

303
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,000
case for reik and if anything they seem

304
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,480
to prefer this as a target and in

305
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,839
october 2020 it attacked a u.s hospital

306
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:02,959
chain

307
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:07,440
with 100 more than 250 facilities

308
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,800
and

309
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,200
crippling all of these facilities and

310
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,959
leading to some chaos

311
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:16,320
impeding some care for patients

312
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,399
so so that's something to keep in mind

313
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:20,320
this group doesn't

314
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,959
seem to hold back in this regard and in

315
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:25,279
addition ryuk ransomware attackers have

316
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:28,000
demonstrated a particular affinity for

317
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,959
attacking organized large organizations

318
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:34,399
that rely heavily on ics networks

319
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:36,399
and within x-force we've seen them

320
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:39,079
especially go after manufacturing and

321
00:12:39,079 --> 00:12:42,320
transportation both of which rely on

322
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,120
ics networks and we know they also

323
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,839
affect industrial distribution oil and

324
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:50,480
gas companies we'll talk about some

325
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,200
examples there and energy and utilities

326
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,360
as well

327
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,480
but most importantly about reik as i

328
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,160
stated at the beginning this is the

329
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,120
ransomware strain the x-force has most

330
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,639
commonly seen

331
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:08,480
get onto ics networks and of course not

332
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,760
just on

333
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,240
organizations that have ics networks but

334
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,920
actually on the ics networks themselves

335
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,360
and so um so that's definitely

336
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,760
concerning and it's not clear whether

337
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,519
reich actors are doing this

338
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:25,920
intentionally or whether it has just

339
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,279
happened by

340
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:28,880
happenstance

341
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,600
if they just got lucky on multiple

342
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,480
occasions but what we can say for sure

343
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,920
is that it has

344
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,120
happened

345
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,440
and the fact that ryu tends to target

346
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,480
organizations with ics networks so

347
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,560
heavily might automatically increase

348
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:48,639
their chances for migrating into those

349
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:50,720
more sensitive environments every now

350
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,160
and then

351
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,839
so in one major example of ryuk on ics

352
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:59,120
networks in early 2020 it became public

353
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,199
that ryuk ransomware attackers had

354
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:03,519
targeted at least five

355
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:06,320
oil and gas organizations

356
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,120
and potentially more than this and these

357
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,760
flurries of reich attacks on similar

358
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,839
organizations

359
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:16,160
is fairly common we've seen them do this

360
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,399
against hospitals as well and it's

361
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,560
possible that we'll see a flurry of riot

362
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,920
attacks against

363
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,800
a cluster of similar ics organizations

364
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,639
at some point again in the future as

365
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:28,000
well

366
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,399
comments by some observers close to

367
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:32,639
these victims these oil and gas victims

368
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:35,519
suggest that riot ransomware actually

369
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:39,199
got onto ics portions of the network in

370
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:41,680
multiple of these incidents

371
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:45,360
so at least two maybe all five

372
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,279
the ryuk ransomware

373
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:50,079
did migrate over into the

374
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:52,639
ics portion and one of these incidents

375
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:54,959
was explained in greater detail in a

376
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:59,040
bulletin put out by the us coast guard

377
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,279
the u.s coast guard bulletin detailed

378
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:03,519
that the threat actors first gained

379
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:05,519
initial access to the environment

380
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:07,839
through a phishing email and this makes

381
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:10,959
a lot of sense since we know ryu actors

382
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:15,279
especially in 2018 and 2020 early 2020

383
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:17,040
were relying heavily on trick bot

384
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:20,399
phishing emails to gain initial access

385
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:23,600
and from here based on what x-force has

386
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,839
seen in other incidents extrapolating

387
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:27,760
from what we've seen it's possible that

388
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,320
the ryuk actors deployed a powershell

389
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:34,160
loader and then a cobalt strike beacon

390
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,399
or potentially the empire post

391
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:38,639
exploitation framework to gain an

392
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:42,480
initial foothold in the environment

393
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,759
and then

394
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:46,639
the actors probably used smb

395
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:48,800
or wmi exec

396
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,959
as well as credential harvesting

397
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:53,199
techniques to move laterally throughout

398
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:55,839
the network and eventually gain access

399
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:56,720
to

400
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,519
domain controllers and this point is

401
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:02,399
really important because from what

402
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:04,160
x-force has seen

403
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,800
this domain controller access

404
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,480
is in some cases what has allowed ryuk

405
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,959
to gain access into

406
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:15,600
ics portions of the network

407
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,360
the coast guard bulletin didn't make

408
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,639
clear exactly what they saw in in the

409
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:22,720
case they examined but it's possible

410
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,480
that domain controllers were also the

411
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,920
crossover point

412
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,959
um in in that particular case

413
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:30,959
but the coast guard did indicate the

414
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:33,839
poor segmentation played a role in the

415
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:34,959
attack

416
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:37,360
and x-force has seen the same the poor

417
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,160
segmentation tends to play a role in rio

418
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:43,600
actors getting access to ics networks

419
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,680
in the vast majority of ransomware

420
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,639
attacks today attackers are looking to

421
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:52,160
gain access to domain controllers

422
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:55,839
and from here deploy the ransomware and

423
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:59,040
in some cases it appears they can use

424
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:02,160
domain administrator accounts when used

425
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,880
with nat flat network designs to also

426
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,160
move into

427
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:09,919
ics portions of a network

428
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:12,400
in the case of the attack on the natural

429
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,880
gas compression facility that the us

430
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,760
coast guard bulletin talked about access

431
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,839
to domain administrator

432
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:21,839
um

433
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:24,400
well the attack created a disruption to

434
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,839
the entire

435
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:28,960
it or enterprise portion of the network

436
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,960
and i assume this to mean the attackers

437
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,200
gained sufficient access to domain

438
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,120
administrator accounts

439
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,280
to deploy ransomware on nearly every

440
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:40,480
device on the it network

441
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,280
in addition because the actors did gain

442
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,039
access to

443
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:48,160
to ics portions of the network they were

444
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,520
able to affect

445
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,080
they were able to disrupt physical

446
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,880
access and security cameras they were

447
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,799
also able to

448
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:00,640
encrypt files that were critical to

449
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,600
cargo pro transfer process control so

450
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,600
for this facility that was really really

451
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,640
critical

452
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,760
and a report from cisa further indicated

453
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,280
that the natural gas compression

454
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,840
facility suffered loss of availability

455
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:17,200
to human machine interfaces or hmis as

456
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,679
well as data historians and polling

457
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:22,320
servers and loss of view

458
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,720
because

459
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,039
impacted assets could not receive or

460
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:29,039
aggregate data from some of those lower

461
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:32,160
level operational technology devices

462
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,640
the attack did not affect programmable

463
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,760
logic controllers or plcs so the

464
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,160
facility didn't actually lose

465
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,280
control of operations but they still

466
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,200
decided to shut down

467
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,520
uh conduct a controlled shutdown of

468
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,240
operations and as i said before this is

469
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,480
relatively common you know whether

470
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,559
ransomware gets on the ics network or

471
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:57,360
not we often see this

472
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,720
this avenue

473
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,080
chosen

474
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:00,960
and

475
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,200
simply is a precaution

476
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,960
although in this case it was it was more

477
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,039
than just a precaution so primary

478
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:09,200
facility operations were down for over

479
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,559
30 hours

480
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:12,880
while the attack was investigated and

481
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,240
remediated

482
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,440
and

483
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,440
full remediation especially of the i.t

484
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:20,320
network i'm sure took even longer

485
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,559
so obviously this attack led to some

486
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:25,840
pretty significant physical real world

487
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:30,799
effects for this particular organization

488
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,280
so i mentioned previously that new

489
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:36,000
versions of ryuk ransomware now have

490
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,400
worm-like capabilities and i would like

491
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,440
to return to that idea

492
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,120
because it's possible that this could

493
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,679
have implications for organizations with

494
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:47,440
ics networks

495
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,360
the french government and specifically

496
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,440
the agency on sea

497
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,679
first originally made this discovery of

498
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:55,760
ryuk's worm-like capabilities so it's

499
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,679
really to them

500
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:00,400
to which this credit for this discovery

501
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,720
is due but x-force malware reverse

502
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:05,120
engineers have also taken a look at

503
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,840
recent reich samples

504
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,080
and our analysis has shown that right

505
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,720
extremes tend to use the address

506
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:16,240
resolution protocol or arp cache and

507
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,320
internet control message protocol or

508
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,679
icmp

509
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:22,559
to enumerate network shares and then

510
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:23,520
copy

511
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,799
itself to accessible shares using rpc or

512
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:29,280
remote procedure call and executes

513
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:32,000
remotely using scheduled tasks

514
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,480
so that's the mechanism by which this

515
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,000
worm happens

516
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,280
but even beyond that the fact that ryuk

517
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:42,960
might have worm-like capabilities

518
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,280
is concerning because of the precedent

519
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:48,559
we have for other worms that have gotten

520
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:51,120
onto ics networks

521
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:54,959
so x-force analysis

522
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,840
of rio maliware showed that discovered

523
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,240
samples were packed in loaders that were

524
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,559
similar to those used in emetet and

525
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:05,919
trickbot campaigns and emitteth has been

526
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:08,880
known to worm into ics networks in the

527
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:09,840
past

528
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,400
in some cases forcing manufacturers to

529
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,880
reduce operations for weeks

530
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:18,000
and therefore decreasing

531
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,480
their revenue and really causing quite a

532
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,520
bit of

533
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,120
damage and concern for those

534
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,480
environments

535
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,200
another worm that has made its way onto

536
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,559
ics networks is configure

537
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:32,559
this is an old worm it was first

538
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:34,799
discovered in 2008 but it is still

539
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:38,480
around and x-force just recently has

540
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:41,440
found this worm on ics networks as well

541
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,600
and so so that's a worm that's also

542
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,360
concerning and then the wannacry

543
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:48,640
ransomware worm has also wrecked havoc

544
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,440
in ics environments in some cases

545
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,640
costing corporations more than 170

546
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,960
million dollars in damages

547
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,919
and requiring quite a bit of cleanup and

548
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:01,280
remediation

549
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:04,559
so worms have been bad news for ics

550
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:07,120
environments in the past and this new

551
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,760
development of ryuk ransomware having

552
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,400
worm like capabilities could potentially

553
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,440
give reich a higher likelihood of

554
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,960
worming into

555
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,440
ics environments in the future

556
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,559
especially if that is a goal that the

557
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:25,520
ransomware group members happen to have

558
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:28,000
or something they're aiming to do

559
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,760
so these developments are a little

560
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:30,880
concerning

561
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:34,240
right getting on to ics networks

562
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,159
ransomware adopting worm-like

563
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:37,520
capabilities

564
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:40,000
but delving into these instances and

565
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,559
looking at specific case studies can be

566
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:45,600
powerful because it can provide insight

567
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:49,039
on what organizations can do to decrease

568
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:51,440
the chances that these types of attacks

569
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,400
might happen to them in the future

570
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,320
so this next slide

571
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,240
will delve into just a few risk

572
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,559
mitigation techniques that we see

573
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:03,039
organizations can take

574
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:05,600
to assist with the tax types we've been

575
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,280
discussing today

576
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:11,280
the first is segmentation segmentation

577
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,440
segmentation and i probably can't

578
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:16,000
emphasize that enough in every case

579
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,559
where x-force has observed reich migrate

580
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:21,679
over into ics portions of a network poor

581
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:24,720
segmentation always played a role and

582
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,799
there's a lot of theories about how to

583
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:29,840
most effectively segment ics networks

584
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:33,120
from their counterpart enterprise or it

585
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,559
networks

586
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:36,960
one thing that x-force recommends is

587
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,440
creating an industrial demilitarized

588
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:42,320
zone between the two of them to create a

589
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,600
buffer

590
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:46,080
also if you use domain controllers in

591
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:49,440
your ics network be sure to disable any

592
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,000
kind of internet access to them since of

593
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
course we have seen domain controllers

594
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,400
as that critical access point

595
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,720
and ideally it should be possible to

596
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,919
unplug the ics network from the it

597
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:02,880
network

598
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:06,960
and so that the enterprise i.t

599
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,679
network or the ics network can maintain

600
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:12,799
full operations without one another and

601
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:15,520
that there aren't those dependencies

602
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,679
second when it comes to preventing

603
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:19,840
ransomware attacks

604
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,760
exports has been

605
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,000
working with our clients to really focus

606
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,480
on guarding domain controllers and

607
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:29,039
domain administrator accounts in almost

608
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:31,200
every ransomware attack we see today

609
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,679
ransomware attackers are going after

610
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:35,440
domain controllers and domain

611
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,080
administrator accounts so reducing the

612
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:41,120
number of these accounts in a network to

613
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:43,360
the absolute minimum

614
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,520
and locking domain administrator

615
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:48,320
accounts to domain controllers and so

616
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,400
that they can't be accessed in any other

617
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,360
way

618
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:54,080
disabling

619
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,000
local administrator rights for all

620
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,960
accounts and then closely monitoring and

621
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,600
auditing any domain administrator

622
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,600
accounts that you do have

623
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,080
can help assist in

624
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,000
making it more difficult for ransomware

625
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,480
attackers to gain access to those

626
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,600
networks

627
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:15,200
and third we recommend working

628
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,400
ics networks into your incident response

629
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,120
plan for ransomware so having and

630
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,159
drilling

631
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:24,080
a response plan for ransomware is

632
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,480
imperative because especially these days

633
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:30,559
is often not a question of if but when

634
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:32,960
and and sometimes organizations even if

635
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,960
they have ics networks are not

636
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:38,799
considering the ics ramifications so if

637
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:41,440
ransomware did get onto a ics network or

638
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,360
even if it didn't you know what would be

639
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:46,159
the proper procedures to respond

640
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:49,279
when would an ics network have to be

641
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:50,480
shut down

642
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,080
and should it be shut down even if

643
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:55,600
there's not ransomware on that network

644
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,760
so these are worth thinking through and

645
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,840
cisa has provided guidance that can be

646
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:03,200
helpful in establishing an ics relevant

647
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,960
ransomware plan

648
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,200
and also recommends considering the full

649
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,360
range of impacts to

650
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,760
ics environments that a cyber attack

651
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,919
might have

652
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:15,679
so from there i don't know if we have

653
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:17,919
any time left for questions

654
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:19,919
i'd be happy to take questions or you

655
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:22,240
are welcome to come up to me afterwards

656
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,559
or contact me afterwards and i would be

657
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:25,679
happy to

658
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:29,200
continue the discussion from there

659
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,640
how are we doing on time

660
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,799
four minutes okay do we have a

661
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:39,720
microphone for questions or no

662
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,799
you can

663
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:46,840
yes just be really loud

664
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:22,000
okay yeah so the question was just about

665
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,080
the phishing email to the powershell

666
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:26,240
loader were there any additional steps

667
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:29,679
in there um and i was just saying that

668
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:32,640
yes there there were a couple more steps

669
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,640
that did take place in there and

670
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,640
specifically it was a microsoft office

671
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,399
document

672
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:41,520
that it appears dropped that particular

673
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:44,320
powershell loader

674
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,720
so and i should specify there is even

675
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,960
before the powershell loader

676
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,799
they it dropped trick bot so it would be

677
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:55,520
a trick bot and sometimes emittette and

678
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,919
then a powershell loader so but they're

679
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:00,480
they're using a lot of different tools

680
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:03,200
especially in that um stage where

681
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,520
they're gaining uh persistence on the

682
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,918
network

683
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,279
uh so i was just curious why your slides

684
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:13,279
were labeled top amber just out of

685
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:16,320
curiosity yeah so and that's just

686
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:19,520
because um there is information in here

687
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,760
that comes from x-force incident

688
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:24,399
response from work with our clients

689
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:27,440
um and so i would just ask that you you

690
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,039
know

691
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:31,919
you keep this information here i'm i'm

692
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:33,200
happy to

693
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,720
to share it but

694
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,399
um but we do want to be careful about

695
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:37,919
how we're sharing information about our

696
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:39,600
clients

697
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,760
is ryok one of those ransomwares where

698
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,919
you can actually get your files back if

699
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:45,440
you pay me the money or do they not

700
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,960
implement the decryption part of the

701
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,640
ransomware

702
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,480
so you're asked scheme do reik

703
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,480
decryptors work yes

704
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,279
yes

705
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:55,760
so we have seen the decrypter work so we

706
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:58,000
have seen people pay the ransom and then

707
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,559
they do actually get their files back

708
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:02,880
there's a lot of you know ins and outs

709
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,880
on how that happens

710
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:07,360
some organizations have trouble using

711
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,600
the decrypter even if they pay for it

712
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,600
and get it and even if it does

713
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,840
technically work some you know sometimes

714
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:16,000
it can take a couple tries to figure out

715
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,279
exactly how to make it work correctly

716
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:21,120
and some ransomware groups provide

717
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,840
services to assist organizations through

718
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:26,080
that process we have seen instances

719
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,679
where people buy the decrypter and then

720
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:30,080
the ransomware group disappears and they

721
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:32,000
can't give the decrypter rework so

722
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,520
they've paid the ransom they have the

723
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,720
decrypter

724
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,159
but they're not able to get it to work

725
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:39,200
so um so there's a lot of caveats there

726
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,919
but bottom line yes we have seen

727
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:43,760
ryuk's decrypter work

728
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,919
i will say we have seen other ransomware

729
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:47,679
groups these are usually smaller less

730
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:49,279
sophisticated

731
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:51,840
groups where the decrypter does not work

732
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:55,360
and it's it's broken and there are some

733
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,559
um

734
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:58,399
mistakes that the

735
00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:01,039
malware developers created and so even

736
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:02,880
if you use the decrypter it wouldn't be

737
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,360
able to work but as our malware reverse

738
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,919
engineers have picked apart the

739
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:10,880
ransomware and have

740
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,640
tried to figure out how the decryption

741
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,559
mechanism works we've actually been able

742
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:17,679
to build a decrypter ourselves to

743
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:19,200
decrypt the ransomware that's happened

744
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,640
twice now

745
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,159
so you can go read about those two

746
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:25,679
instances on our blog one is thanos

747
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:27,919
ransomware is the other was just

748
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:30,799
ransomware so um so sometimes that

749
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:33,840
happens but the larger groups like reich

750
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:36,240
their decrypters do tend to work and

751
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,559
their encryption encryption mechanisms

752
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:40,080
do tend to be

753
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:43,120
very sophisticated

754
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:46,240
all right i think that's all the

755
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,840
questions we have time for but thank you

756
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:52,840
very much for your attention

757
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:56,680
[Applause]
