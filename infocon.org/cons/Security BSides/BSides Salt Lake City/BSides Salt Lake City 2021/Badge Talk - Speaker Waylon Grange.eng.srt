1
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:05,359
all right i i'm gonna start just a hair

2
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:07,120
early and i'm gonna try to go fast

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:08,800
because i know i'm the last talk and

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,240
everybody wants to go home before

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:11,679
traffic is too bad

6
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:13,280
so i'll try to go fast thank you guys

7
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,920
for sticking around uh show hands how

8
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,680
many of you have already solved all of

9
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,039
the badge

10
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:21,199
we've got a few we got five six so far

11
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:23,920
okay um i didn't think i was going to

12
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,199
share some hints but i'm probably going

13
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:27,279
to share some hints so i'm going to talk

14
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:29,359
about a little bit about how i came to

15
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:31,039
this badge the troubles i came through

16
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:32,719
to get here and then we'll talk about

17
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:34,320
hints and solving the puzzles at the end

18
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,840
i'll take my mask off that'll probably

19
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,200
help

20
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,160
okay so the badge itself uh this is a 3d

21
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,840
mock-up in kicad

22
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,520
but it uses an 8-bit pick

23
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,719
microcontroller as the main

24
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:46,559
microcontroller which is like a really

25
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:47,600
small

26
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,480
very

27
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,280
s

28
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,360
not advanced chip um

29
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,280
it's this the screen's an old led

30
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,360
display it's got an ir receiver as

31
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,960
you've probably figured out built-in

32
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,719
accelerometer and then obviously if

33
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:00,160
you've got the two potentiometers as

34
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,520
your

35
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,600
major form of input and then like it

36
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,840
says there uh jade can you stand up i'm

37
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,119
gonna make you stand up

38
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:10,159
this is my daughter who drew the snowman

39
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:12,479
the snowman snowboarder that you see on

40
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:13,600
the board and she's also did the

41
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,880
mountains that are on your lanyard so

42
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:15,880
she did the art there

43
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:20,310
[Applause]

44
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,040
yeah i'm not artistic so i pulled her in

45
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,479
for that

46
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:26,400
um but um i designed this around an

47
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,040
8-bit pick mainly because that's all

48
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,560
that was available

49
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,520
um so here for example is the chip that

50
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,159
we used on the 2019 b-sides badge

51
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:38,159
um this is from mouser you can see here

52
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:40,799
the the lead time is 52 weeks so if i

53
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:42,560
ordered some a year from now i would get

54
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,600
some back

55
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,640
um also i could only order at maximum 75

56
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,079
that's all i'll let me have in one year

57
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:50,960
from now that's crazy also the price of

58
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,040
that chip for one is

59
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,880
and thirty six cents when we bought this

60
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,320
in 2019 it was a dollar twenty

61
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,960
so that's how crazy the chip

62
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,360
shortage really is the chip used in the

63
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,799
2021 it's a little bit better its prices

64
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:08,560
up to five dollars it was one dollar

65
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,959
when we bought it but and it is only 46

66
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:15,120
45 weeks so that's only nine months

67
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,680
and then the oh sorry i'm i'm going i

68
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,760
guess i missed a year that was the 2021

69
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,840
the 2021

70
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,000
there is none available and the expected

71
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,319
time is in september of next year when

72
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:28,720
they expect to get 3 000 in which will

73
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,000
i'm sure disappear as soon as they get

74
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,879
them in

75
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:33,920
so it's just crazy to see how hard

76
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,360
no this is my current chip sorry that's

77
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,440
right this is my current chip it's no

78
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,599
longer available um

79
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:40,640
when i

80
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,879
went on their site they had like 500 i

81
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:43,920
was like great i'm going to use that

82
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,280
chip they have some it's not too

83
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,360
expensive it's only a dollar

84
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,400
so i'm going to go with this chip

85
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,760
because that's kind of the budget range

86
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,239
we had it is a whole lot less capable

87
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:54,400
compared to the previous two years chips

88
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,080
but that's the price point we were stuck

89
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,360
at

90
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,920
this meme came up on a badge chat

91
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,200
there's a channel for those people that

92
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,280
make badges and this meme really hit

93
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,599
home last night when it when it come up

94
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:07,519
oh and it's not even on the full screen

95
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:08,959
but um

96
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:11,040
yeah basically oh this one's off look at

97
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,319
that screen

98
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:13,440
okay

99
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,440
but that chip itself like i said is a

100
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,840
low very low power very low capability

101
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,200
chip it has 16k of space that's all it

102
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,640
has 16k words um which is a little bit

103
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,000
bigger than a byte

104
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,840
but it's still

105
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,000
it's almost like 28 bytes but you can't

106
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,159
individually access each byte so that's

107
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:34,080
how much space you have for all of the

108
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,920
the puzzles and everything that does is

109
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,640
16k right like that's not even a like

110
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,560
you know one and a quarter floppy inch

111
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,239
drive like that that has more space than

112
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:45,599
that and then 2k of ram um there's 250

113
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:48,560
56 bytes of eeprom that's nothing big

114
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,120
but it uses very very low power at full

115
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,920
speed it's using

116
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:56,159
1.1 milliamps so that's the nice thing

117
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,159
you can that it should

118
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:00,319
last for days on that one little coin

119
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:01,680
cell and you'll notice like if you if

120
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,599
you don't use your badge it turns off

121
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:04,879
all the lights and it goes to sleep

122
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:06,560
until you bump it or shake it and then

123
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,159
it'll turn the lights back on so it

124
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:09,920
should it should be pretty pretty low

125
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:10,799
power

126
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:13,360
um i ended up buying the automotive

127
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,439
edition because that's all they had left

128
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:17,440
when it came time to buy it

129
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,918
the top version is the prototype like

130
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:20,959
the same chip there's just different

131
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,800
footprints the top one is one that i

132
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,160
plugged in on a breadboard to do my

133
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,160
initial testing and then when i was

134
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,080
finally ordered ready to order i ordered

135
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,199
the bottom ones but the my supplier ran

136
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,040
out of the bottom ones in the two weeks

137
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,040
it took me to do prototype between being

138
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,040
ready and so i was like oh crap where do

139
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,240
i go i started looking at other

140
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,639
suppliers and arrow had them but they

141
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,960
had the automotive edition which really

142
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,080
just makes the badge work the chip work

143
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,759
in higher and lower temperature ranges

144
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,600
but i was like i don't care it's you've

145
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,880
got the chip i need i'm just going to

146
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,400
buy it

147
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,199
so here's my iteration process from

148
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:57,680
design concept to the final badge

149
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,800
the top

150
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,039
left image is my first initial design

151
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:02,800
it's got two little breadboards and i

152
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,080
shouldn't use the black bed board

153
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,440
because you can't even see the chip on

154
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,759
the black breadboard but that main chips

155
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:10,800
on there and you can see the led um my

156
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,960
ir sensors and then my two pots are on

157
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,400
the blue board and i just kind of

158
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,639
breadboarded it out like okay can this

159
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:19,600
chip do what i want to do right like can

160
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,479
i receive ir messages can i

161
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:25,039
send messages can i write to that screen

162
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:26,400
fast enough for the display so it

163
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,560
doesn't look clunky et cetera et cetera

164
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,840
and then once that's done then i

165
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,759
designed a prototype board and then i

166
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:32,880
would solder all the pieces on that

167
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,520
prototype board well i totally messed up

168
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,199
on my prototype board this is my i

169
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,759
usually use in the past i'd used eagle

170
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:41,840
cat to design the board and everybody's

171
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,000
like oh all the boar the the bads the

172
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
pros are like oh we've all gone to kicad

173
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,520
it's so much better it's like okay i'll

174
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,520
use kai-cad and

175
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,960
it kind of bit me because i just didn't

176
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,120
know what i was doing as well i

177
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,880
put the footprint for my chip on the

178
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,880
board but then i had the pin assignment

179
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,199
all wrong so when i want when i went to

180
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:00,960
use it i couldn't use i couldn't put my

181
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,400
chip down there because the pin layout

182
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,039
didn't match so i had to like have all

183
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:06,880
these jumper wires over to that

184
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,199
breadboard where i put the chip there

185
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:10,960
and so that's what that mess is down on

186
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,560
the bottom left is that that's my

187
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,479
prototype but i had to have this

188
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:17,039
existing breadboard to fix my mistake

189
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:19,520
when i designed the prototype

190
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,680
so that meant i needed to do another

191
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,720
prototype because i didn't feel

192
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,960
comfortable like i wanted i didn't feel

193
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,960
comfortable designing 200 of these based

194
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,440
on that mess as my you know like oh this

195
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,800
is close enough i'm just going to go

196
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,560
ahead and make the assumption all work

197
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,440
so that board on the right is my last

198
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,680
prototype that i did i don't show you

199
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,280
the back side but it i think in a

200
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,960
different slide i will it's pretty close

201
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,240
to what you guys had it just doesn't

202
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,680
have the logo because we didn't have the

203
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,240
logo at that time and then you got the

204
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,400
final badge

205
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,240
so um

206
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,240
other issues i ran into

207
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,240
this that chip has the temperature

208
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,919
sensor in it which i wanted to play with

209
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:57,520
and my initial prototype says okay i got

210
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,960
a temperature sensor i can tell the

211
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,400
temperature it works

212
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,080
but if you read this um fine print in

213
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,520
their documentation

214
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,599
it will produce a temperature rain that

215
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:08,000
is within 100 degrees

216
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
of the actual temperature

217
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,039
it's like

218
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:13,039
that's not a temperature sensor that's

219
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:16,720
like a random number generator you know

220
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,360
that's useless so i spent a long time

221
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,520
like putting my device in very cold and

222
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,520
very hot and like trying to like map out

223
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,280
okay how does this adjust to those

224
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,960
temperature ranges and i came up with

225
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,319
this algorithm that worked really weird

226
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:29,919
on my prototype boards and then i

227
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:32,240
started flashing all the boards you have

228
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,319
and found out the boards are all over

229
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:35,759
the place and i'm sure you guys have

230
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:37,520
seen that right like as you look at your

231
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,880
temperature some of them are like oh

232
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,880
it's 20 degrees in here and others it's

233
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,120
like it's 90 degrees in here

234
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,759
those that yeah that's that fine print

235
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:46,960
right there they that's not a

236
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,039
temperature sensor guys i'm sorry

237
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:50,879
i should have uh i guess i missed that

238
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:52,800
and it ended up biting me

239
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,120
so um some of you guys for that chill

240
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,479
the chill puzzle right you're supposed

241
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:58,960
to chill that temperature sensor some of

242
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,400
the boards are going to want a colder

243
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,680
temperature than others because they

244
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,280
think that's a lot hotter in the room

245
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,039
than it is some of you get that puzzle

246
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:06,400
for free because they decided it's

247
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,120
freezing in here

248
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,479
it's one of those bugs that i guess um i

249
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,240
don't know

250
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,759
that's not a temperature sensor that's

251
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:18,160
my that's my claim here

252
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,440
um so

253
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,960
also program the chip i told you it's

254
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,960
only 60 16k

255
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,520
um i am using almost every little bit of

256
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,440
that you see here on that image on the

257
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,960
very right there are 48 bytes free like

258
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,760
that's all there is and that is after i

259
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,200
did optimus like compile time

260
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,279
optimizations for size

261
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:40,559
and i did release build and i went

262
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,640
around and did micro optimization so

263
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,240
down at the bottom you see my on the

264
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,959
left i have a for loop with an int if i

265
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:49,440
change that for loop to use a uint

266
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,360
that was 10 extra bytes for each for

267
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,200
loop i changed so i went through the

268
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,279
whole code base and bought myself 200

269
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:57,279
more bytes so that i could get like one

270
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:58,880
of those last puzzles in

271
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,240
um the

272
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,640
as there was so much there wasn't so

273
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,920
much but there were some things more i

274
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,680
wanted to fix some of you are able to

275
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,959
solve the

276
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:08,720
logic analyzer puzzle by just

277
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,880
haphazardly going through it that's

278
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,640
because the solution to that

279
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,080
is actually

280
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,440
um

281
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,560
how should i want to say this without

282
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,519
ruining it this you it's a key combo

283
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:21,920
that you can accidentally get right i

284
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,839
wanted to make that more difficult but

285
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:25,600
coding that pushed me way over the

286
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,760
boundary line and so there was there was

287
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,360
just corners i had to cut and that was

288
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,399
one of them

289
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:32,480
it really was just as much as i could

290
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,640
push that like i tried squeezing as much

291
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,800
in there i i trade off some things like

292
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,680
oh this can only take this much bites

293
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,760
so for example right like

294
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,240
we got 16k

295
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:48,560
an image of 128 by 64 using one bit per

296
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,600
pixel

297
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,200
is still 1k

298
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,240
and there's what 15 16 screens

299
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,320
just the image for each screen would be

300
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,200
16k bytes right so that's

301
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,279
that's how constrained this little chip

302
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:02,560
made things

303
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,720
and then there was other issues um my

304
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,800
prototype boards i had designed so this

305
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,000
one on the left

306
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,800
that small chip was my led controller

307
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,480
but when it came time for the final

308
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,640
production run they were out

309
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,440
so

310
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,600
without testing it i ordered we just i

311
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,040
changed the design to use that bigger

312
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,000
chip as the led controller and prayed it

313
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,240
would work luckily it did

314
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,839
otherwise we wouldn't have badges uh

315
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:28,560
just crazy crazy things like that

316
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,560
but i have to give a big shout out to

317
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,000
complicated mike is he here he might

318
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,200
went home he had his kids around with

319
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,600
him i don't see complicated might

320
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,720
okay he did so much for us he did the

321
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,120
assembly of these badges um we didn't

322
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,040
have enough time to have china do it so

323
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,959
or the shop in china do it

324
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:46,640
let's see if this will play

325
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,440
no it won't oh it will i just okay

326
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,720
see if i can make this play so here's

327
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,399
his this is his little pick and place

328
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:53,360
machine

329
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,640
and you can see it grabbing each of the

330
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,480
parts puts them over a light to see how

331
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,079
it's holding them and then it places

332
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:01,360
them in the right spot on the board and

333
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,440
it was so kind of cool to see

334
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,200
um what you don't see here is the

335
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,680
painstaking process it takes to feed

336
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,880
each of those

337
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,200
divide like hook it up and then program

338
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,120
it to say with this chip goes right here

339
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,160
right like supposed to be kind of

340
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,920
automated but it's not as automated as

341
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,000
you would think um so he did a lot for

342
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,320
us that's him in the top left putting so

343
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,560
we've got like a stencil you apply the

344
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,279
the solder paste as a stencil and then

345
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:27,519
that machine sets the machine the parts

346
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,279
on that paste and then he's got this

347
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:30,880
like big pizza oven that you just put

348
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,959
the boards in and then it cooks the

349
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:35,279
solder paste into solder and that was it

350
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:36,959
it was really cool to see never want to

351
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:38,880
do it again

352
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,279
and that would only do the small pieces

353
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:42,720
it doesn't do any of the through hole

354
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,320
and it couldn't do the lecd screen

355
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,839
because that screen can't go through an

356
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:48,880
oven so that was all child labor

357
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,519
these are my boys doing the soldering of

358
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:53,680
all of your

359
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,600
rotary controllers and then i soldered

360
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,120
the lcd screens on the back

361
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,760
so like you guys know there are

362
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,720
15 puzzles i try to get a variety of

363
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,639
things and variety of difficulties

364
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:08,160
sometimes they work well sometimes they

365
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,480
don't

366
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:13,040
wow i've ripped through this awesome

367
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,880
um this is kind of where i wanted to

368
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,839
talk puzzles the hints and

369
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:18,959
errata

370
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:21,760
so a few things i'll come back to this

371
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,360
slide a few things i wanted to point out

372
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,200
before but i've made these mention on

373
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,240
the slack

374
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,600
um on the lanyards i made a mistake when

375
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,680
i was designing them that's over there

376
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:32,880
that's what the right thing is supposed

377
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,959
to be but somehow when i was laying them

378
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:37,120
out one of those x's floated down to the

379
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,399
next row

380
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:41,200
which changed the answers which makes it

381
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,120
insolvable so on your lanyards those

382
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,120
first two lines are like crossed out in

383
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,839
purple that's why if you actually had if

384
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:49,600
you tried to solve it using those you

385
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,800
would be inconclusive right unsolvable

386
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,959
that's the the real one you don't need

387
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:56,560
those two and you can actually solve it

388
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,079
with just the bottom

389
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:00,320
how many there are but it's easier if

390
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,519
you have the other two if you're doing

391
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:03,200
it by hand it's easier like this is like

392
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,360
a mastermind game with

393
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,440
insane number of options a little bit

394
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,600
more difficult but still doable right i

395
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,560
kind of like these puzzles because

396
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,200
they're very um procedural

397
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,800
um unfortunately procedural puzzles

398
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,320
computers can do even better the weekend

399
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,120
but

400
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,680
and then the hint on the matrix one is

401
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,600
that i didn't misspell that i know how

402
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,880
to spell bunny hill but um they i needed

403
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,800
to produce a three by three matrix with

404
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,120
a correct determinant and having two

405
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,120
ends there would not produce a

406
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,880
determinant that would decode so that's

407
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,360
kind of a hint on that one

408
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,399
um

409
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:37,360
but yeah

410
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,760
with that that's really all i had i kind

411
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,040
of go i went a little faster than i

412
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,120
expected but i wanted to leave some time

413
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,360
also for questions or

414
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,800
help hints

415
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,959
errata other era i don't even know how

416
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:51,120
to say that sorry i'll quit saying it

417
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,800
anybody have anything they want to ask

418
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,199
oh yes i can't see your hands so just

419
00:13:57,199 --> 00:13:59,359
talk

420
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:03,760
loud ah

421
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04,800
okay

422
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,839
okay i can help on some of them the snow

423
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:09,600
one was a little bit more difficult than

424
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,800
i expected

425
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,199
um anybody who wants the snow one jade

426
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:14,720
will you stand up again

427
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,600
she has a tv remote control that's

428
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,360
really all you need is a power button

429
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,880
from most common tv remotes if it will

430
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,360
detect the tv on off and that's how you

431
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,519
kill the power the the snow one so that

432
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:29,760
one's a freebie um the chill we kind of

433
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,600
talked about a little bit equalizer i'm

434
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,360
not going to give away it has to do with

435
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,279
that mastermind puzzle the social i

436
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:37,360
think you guys know pretty much

437
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,320
pong

438
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,560
um you have to play it and you have to

439
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,399
be pretty good at it

440
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:43,920
that one's about all that one takes the

441
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,680
ski game just have to be pretty good at

442
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,120
the ski lifts you have to do the

443
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,040
soldering on the back

444
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,240
egg hunter

445
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,560
um

446
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,959
okay google google egg hunter you might

447
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:55,839
be able to figure that out pretty

448
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:57,120
straightforward thank you

449
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,079
crunch

450
00:14:58,079 --> 00:14:59,839
i think most people got that one they

451
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:02,639
know they know the hacker trivia

452
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:04,320
tower station

453
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,519
some of you have got that one what's a

454
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:06,880
good hint for tower station without

455
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,240
giving it away

456
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:12,820
[Laughter]

457
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,920
yeah it has to do with the tree puzzle

458
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,240
on the back the two leads that are

459
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,680
slightly higher than the rest those are

460
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,920
the decimal parts so it's like a number

461
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,839
decimal those two leads to higher on the

462
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:30,800
left

463
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,399
um

464
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:34,560
what are we on oh they hit the slopes

465
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,600
that one

466
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,839
is modeled after some of the gchq mind

467
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:39,680
teaser puzzles that's not one of my

468
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,519
strong spots so

469
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:43,519
it's hard for me to gauge like is this

470
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:45,120
too hard too easy

471
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,639
but apparently for those that get it

472
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:48,320
it's like

473
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,519
totally out there and then all of a

474
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:52,800
sudden oh oh yeah that's easy um you can

475
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,160
correct me if you're wrong it's kind of

476
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,440
one of those like once you get it you

477
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,959
just know you got it

478
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:58,800
not really a big fan of those but i kind

479
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,399
of want to do some things that

480
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:02,240
that are not just my area expertise

481
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,519
somebody say something

482
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:05,759
okay

483
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:07,120
yeah wilson was telling me he was like i

484
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,320
was just staring at and all of a sudden

485
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,440
i was like ding

486
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,320
um

487
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,399
let's see where we at matrix matrix is

488
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:15,360
an encryption one it is kind of hard but

489
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,040
once you get the right path

490
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,000
you should get there there's a few

491
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,199
people here who know that ones you can

492
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:20,880
ask around on the slack channel and

493
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,360
people will help logic analyzer that one

494
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,360
turned out to be rougher than i intended

495
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,160
uh those do represent ones and zeros um

496
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,079
but it's like the spacing of each one it

497
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:30,959
could be

498
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:32,880
so like in that image that's like i

499
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,680
would guess here that's like two ones

500
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,199
right next to each other then a zero

501
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:39,519
then a one then a zero then you know

502
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:41,839
some number of ones and then that's just

503
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:43,759
going to be some ascii code the hard

504
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:46,160
part is when there's lots of zeros next

505
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,839
to each other that's just a long you

506
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:50,000
know low time and it's is that four or

507
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,880
five dot you know low periods so

508
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,320
determining the low periods and the high

509
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,839
periods there's how you would solve the

510
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:58,079
logic analyzer balance model off of

511
00:16:58,079 --> 00:16:59,920
actual when you're like doing hardware

512
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,120
attacks

513
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,800
you can put traces on

514
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,400
lines and you can see the voltage go up

515
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,919
and down and you're trying to decode

516
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:07,199
like you know what's this i2c or

517
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:08,640
whatever i didn't want to make you duke

518
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,480
protocol so i tried to do raw ascii

519
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,559
still turned out to be too hard so like

520
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:14,319
liked the idea and thought concept but

521
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:17,359
execution was poor rtfm that one i've

522
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:19,679
seen some trouble with u3 is a reference

523
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:22,000
to the part on the back of your badge

524
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,039
so if you'll look on the back of your

525
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:25,199
badge there's a part labeled u3 it's

526
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:27,039
talking about that part that might help

527
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,960
you and then the etchy sketch a lot of

528
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,559
people got that by

529
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:33,200
um accident

530
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,120
that one is just an it's a sketch if you

531
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,640
know how to use an initial sketch you'll

532
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,520
get that badge that you'll get that one

533
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,280
um do you any does anybody want

534
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,960
additional hints or additional questions

535
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,960
or feedback

536
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,320
i'm open to anything right now yes a

537
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,639
hand up

538
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,640
okay you can't get the equalize the

539
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,720
equalizer is hard to input

540
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,720
but you have to know exactly what to

541
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,880
input which comes from the mastermind

542
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,280
puzzle

543
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,160
um

544
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,400
any other questions feedback did you

545
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,480
like the badge was it worth the time was

546
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,520
it worth it

547
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,760
thank you

548
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,400
um

549
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,360
yeah if you if you don't want to i i'm

550
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,120
really open to criticism and you know be

551
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,559
like if you want to just shoot me over

552
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,160
slack and be like that puzzle really

553
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,360
wasn't good don't do another one like

554
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,480
that or

555
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,320
i kind of think the jump between this

556
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,080
hint and that was too far please let me

557
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,000
know so that i can improve for next year

558
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,240
i might intend just not to frustrate

559
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,559
people

560
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:37,620
um

561
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:40,480
[Laughter]

562
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,720
okay i depends on when next year is

563
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,799
right we already have that concession

564
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:45,919
um

565
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:48,240
okay anything else otherwise i won't

566

you guys thank you
