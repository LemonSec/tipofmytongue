00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,000
title

24
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:44,480
and you know you never started

never start a conference presentation

26
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,200
without a disclaimer so i saw this tweet

27
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,360

28
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,719
yeah

29
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,559
take my advice of the grain of salt by

30
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:56,559
all means i'm not an expert you'll learn

31
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:58,960
that in about one slide so

32
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,440
let's launch into it

33
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,800

93
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,800
yeah

94
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,239
all right going to talk about me a

95
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,480
little bit because they accepted my talk

96
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,840
and put me in front of a microphone so

97
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,959
i'm going to talk about me because i'm

98
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:26,080
selfish anyway a little bit about me

99
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,920
i've been doing security for about 13

100
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,680
ish years and the reason i say ish and

101
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,920
put an asterisk by it is it depends on

102
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,400
when you count start counting

103
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,519
uh this is something i'm going to talk

104
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:37,599
about here in a second but

105
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:38,560
you know

106
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,080
a lot of times in

107
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,760
job postings and stuff they'll actually

108
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,120
say things like

109
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,920
x years of experience or relevant

110
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,599
experience and things like that so i

111
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:49,280
thought okay if i count the number of

112
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,239
years where i had security in my title i

113
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:53,840
have

114
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,159
you know

115
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:57,599
four

116
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:59,599
you know four or five ish years

117
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:00,959
experience

118
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:03,120
but i don't count that because

119
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,720
i kind of don't think you have to have

120
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,319
security in your title to be a security

121
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:10,000
person i i believe that vehemently so

122
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,879
um

123
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:13,120
so i graduated in 2008

124

125
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:18,079
yeah

126
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,120
anyway

127
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,918
um and i got a job at utah state like

129
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,840
person job at utah state and i was a cis

130
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,520
admin and i was i worked at the library

131
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,240
in their systems department and it was

132
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,840
one of those it jobs where you had many

133
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,280
hats where you did everything you

134
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,360
designed a random web page or you

135
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,759
maintained the databases or you did this

136
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:41,840
or someone downloads a virus and you

137
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,639
have to fix it you know so we got to do

138

a little bit of everything and what's

139
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,199
interesting is like i had taken

140
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:51,040
um i did mis

141
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,400
information systems

142
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,000
i remember thinking i want to be a dba

143
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,199
because they'll get paid a lot of money

144
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:57,199
and i like databases and then i took a

145
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:59,440
security class it's like this is so much

146
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,600
cooler than databases this is really

147
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,600
cool i want to do that

148
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,919
so you know i graduated anyway and i

149
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,680
thought i want to get into security but

150
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,520
you know i got the sysadmin job there is

151
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,280
some security components and then i just

152
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,800
started volunteering with my team like

153
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,320

like i'll take it i know that's not the

155
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,680
fun part but that's the most security

156
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,240
related one today i'll do that like if

157
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,000
it's anything security or like the

158
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,400
annual audit hey we need to review our

159
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,440

160
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,560

00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:36,479
like even if it's a mini-hat's job

164
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,400

downloaded patches loaded them on air

170
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:49,520
force systems tested them and wrote a

171
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,639
report

172
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:52,479
it wasn't as glamorous as it sounded we

173
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:54,400
did some other things as well but

174
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,360
you know

175
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,319
uh so i got some actual security in my

176
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:00,400
title experience and then they changed

177
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,240
the contract and everything had a

178
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,160
different thing so i've never announced

179
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,000
this publicly but i was a sharepoint

180
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,680
admin for six weeks

181
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,639
so

182
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,479
and that whole time i applied for jobs

183
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:13,199
and interviewed so i mean we we all have

184
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:14,880
dark times in our past you know we have

185
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,960
little hiccups in our security journey

186
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,759
that was one of mine

187
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:21,360
after that i worked for a finance

188
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,960
company as a senior security analyst

189
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,319
that was really fun and that was great

190
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:27,039
because i had a mentor and he said hey

191
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:28,560
have you ever done an internal pen test

192
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,639
like no he's like cool you're coming

193
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:32,400
with me we're going to do this like hey

194
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,319
there's a server no one remembers the

195
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:35,360
password

196
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,039
so we're gonna dump the passwords and

197
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:38,400
we're gonna i'm gonna teach you how to

198
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,800
use uh john the ripper it was so cool

199
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,000
because i got to do these hands-on

200
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,520
things it's really neat it's my first

201
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,479
introduction to like sims

202
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:47,520
and then

203
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,800
shortly thereafter they laid off the

204
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,880
security team i was one of them

205
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,319
so i got a job

206
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,560
as a monitoring engineer and i had that

207
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,680
year

208
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,360
let's see i did that for about three

209
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,919
years or so it was interesting

210
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,560
um so full-time job and

211
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,160
i didn't just do security monitoring we

212
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,160
also did like application performance

213
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,319
monitoring and basically we would build

214
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:10,160
and maintain the tools that the sock and

215
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,919
the noc would use which was pretty

216
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:14,240
interesting um but it was it was like

217
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,919
general monitoring and one of the things

218
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:17,360
i discovered was like you know i want to

219
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,039
get involved in the security community

220
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,880
especially here in utah like we have

221
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:21,759
great

222
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:24,639
resources here and local cons and stuff

223
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:27,039
and so i'd go to my boss and say hey

224
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:28,800
can you can i go to this like i was a

225
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,160
full-time employee i want to go to this

226
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,280
like

227
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,800
no you're not a security person it's

228
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,680
like

229
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,280
yeah i am i

230
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,960
i did this before i worked here i have

231
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,400
some security search i'm a security

232
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,919
person like no you're a monitoring

233
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:41,840
engineer it won't get approved i was

234
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:42,639
like

235
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:44,400
seriously like

236
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,759
it it's like

237
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:47,280
it's like you know it was st con or

238
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,639
something it's like it's like 300 bucks

239
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:50,240
like well you're not a security person

240
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,560
so we're not going to send you it's like

241
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,879
fine so i would take pto and i'm going

242
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,479
to talk about those later i'd take pto

243
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:58,160
and i go so i get involved with these

244
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,440
and still get security stuff

245
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,440
um eventually i moved over to the

246
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,879
security team within this company and

247
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:06,400
then i got to go to conferences like and

248
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,599
they're like oh you're a security person

249
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:09,360
now yeah you can go it's like

250
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,720
anyway

251
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,280
and then my current job um been there

252
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,400
since

253
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,199
uh 2018 do a lot of you know stuff on

254
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:19,919
the site before so there you go

255
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:22,479
so how do i get a job in infosec by the

256
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:24,000
way not an expert

257
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,720
so spoiler depends um what i have found

258
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,360
in talking with several people is like

259
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,520
if you're just graduating or just

260
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,640
getting out of

261
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,159
you know whatever and you want to get

262
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:36,640
your first full-time job in security

263
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,279
the three easier ways to get in

264
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:42,080
are the following and i'm up for

265
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,839
other suggestions as well but this is

266
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:45,760
what i've had

267
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,320
experience with or people have told me

268
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,640
so first one is if you can get a job as

269
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,560
a sock or a knock analyst like if you're

270
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,920
like finishing up school and you can get

271
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,440
one of these jobs it's great especially

272
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,720
graveyard shift because then you can get

273
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,880
paid to study but anyway

274
00:08:58,880 --> 00:08:59,760
um

275
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,360
these are these are definitely entry

276
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,360
level you get hands-on experience it's

277
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,279
good

278
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,600
so that's one way

279
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,000
another way this is kind of my my way in

280
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,320
was the many hats i.t job you wear many

281
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,360
hats and you're like you're like the

282
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,360
everything person you you do all the

283
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,880
stuff

284
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,279
and then the third way

285
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:23,680
that i've been told is go into

286
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,600
development become a

287
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,720
become a

288
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,800
you know an engineer like a development

289
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,320
engineer of some kind and then you can

290
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,920
like transition into application

291
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,600
security this is also the path that a

292
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,200
lot of pen testers will take you know

293
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,839
kind of stuff

294
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,240
so this isn't an exhaustive list this is

295
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,080
like three

296
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,279
like there's

297
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:46,560
it's easier to get in these i guess

298
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,399
okay rant i kind of already mentioned

299
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:50,000
this you don't need security in your

300
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,720
title to be a security person it it i

301
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,240
think it was that one job that really

302
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,440
got to me where it's like you're not a

303
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,200
security person it's you're a monitoring

304
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,880
engineer it's like no i

305
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,279
swear word no i'm not

306
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:02,640
and then another thing that i like to

307
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,880
rant about is security is everyone's job

308
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,880
security can never scale but if you can

309
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:07,600
like

310
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,440
train with your train your co-workers

311
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,279
and stuff to like look for security

312
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:13,519
concerns or security problems and report

313
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:15,920
it to the security team or whatever like

314
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,600
if you notice something like if you've

315
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,040
if you see something say something kind

316
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,160
of a thing

317
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,720
i really like that so

318
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,120
all right so basics

319
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,839
of info security careers i i saw this i

320
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:30,240
thought it was funny um

321
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,920
don't just go straight into pen testing

322
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,920
because a lot of times i found is they

323
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,279
want to make sure you know basics

324
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:36,880
because

325
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,480
yeah otherwise

326
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,079
they might label you as a script kitty

327
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:41,920
or whatever or you may not land the job

328
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,200
but

329
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,040
a couple of things so foundational

330
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,040
knowledge and technology this is this is

331
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,880
important you can learn it

332
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,880
it covers lots of things

333
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,279
so understand networking and protocols i

334
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:54,560
mean you don't have to be an expert in

335
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,720
any of this but you need to have some

336
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,399
basic understanding there's free

337
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:00,560
resources there's youtube videos there's

338
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,640
books there's all sorts of stuff

339
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,160
um programming

340
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,000
at least basic programming or understand

341
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,680
how programming works

342
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,640
and runs a program sort of stuff

343
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,640
passion this is kind of a bigger thing i

344
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,079
was listening to a webinar just this

345
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:15,680
week from black hills info security

346
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:16,720
talking about

347
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,240
uh getting hired as a threat hunter but

348
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,920
one of the things the guy said is like

349
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,240
it seems interesting like between the

350
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,200
baby boomers gen x it's more like

351
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,040
years experience and stuff but then like

352
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,120
millennials on it's like

353
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,800
what how passionate are you about this

354
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,880
or are you teachable like because we can

355
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,240
teach you this but if you have the drive

356
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,920
and determination it's a lot easier to

357
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,519
work with it was kind of interesting you

358
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:39,200
should look it up

359
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,600
so passion

360
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,040
okay

361
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,800
why do you care about security what what

362
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,560
gets you excited what keeps you up at

363
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,160
night is a question we ask a lot of the

364
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,360
time

365
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,760
and think people do good so it's kind of

366
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,360
a security mindset like

367
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,320
when you look at something do you

368
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,000
immediately start thinking how can i

369
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:56,880
break it

370
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,600
because my kids do but you know

371
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,120
also things like

372
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,880
how could this be a weaponized like oh i

373
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,480
have this new thing like you don't even

374
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,000
have to sign into this website and you

375
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,240
can see our database like

376
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,000
let's think evil about this for a second

377
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,320
how bad of an idea is that like you

378
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,560
don't want to like just throw fud and

379
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,079
everything but you kind of do want to

380
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:18,399
see like you know let's let's think evil

381
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:20,800
how would a hacker use this or how would

382
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,320
they exploit this

383
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,720
kind of a thing

384
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,399
let's see people skills this is

385
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:28,240
important not just for security jobs

386
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,079
this is important for every job but

387
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:33,120
people skills are extremely valuable

388
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,639
i'm not saying i have great people

389
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:37,600
skills but they do help so can you

390
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,480
convey

391
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,040
complex ideas or can you convey

392
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,360
um like an idea or a project or

393
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,760
something to someone regardless of their

394
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,279
background like could you talk to

395
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:48,639
someone who's highly technical saying

396
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:51,040
like here's what we want this pro this

397
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,959
project to do or whatever or can you go

398
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:54,720
to finance and explain this is this

399
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,639
project here's why it's beneficial for

400
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:58,480
you it's going to generate this revenue

401
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,639
or it's going to reduce this you know

402
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:02,880
can you kind of steer it to like know

403
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,959
your audience sort of thing

404
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:06,959
um project management

405
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:09,440
now nowadays it's like everything you do

406
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,680
if you can organize work project manage

407
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,800
it just

408
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,880
helps like even when you're applying for

409
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,560
jobs if you have project management

410
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,839
skills and you're applying for jobs

411
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:19,920
approach it kind of like a project like

412
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,920
okay i'm going to

413
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,480
do resume tweaking at this time and i'm

414
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,240
going to apply for these jobs this week

415
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,160
and kind of plan it out and track it

416
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,680
like you can use these skills not just

417
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,839
for like work but also like finding work

418
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:35,760
so tomato leadership why security is

419
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,279
important this is kind of

420
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:39,120
this is like don't just doom and gloom

421
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,800
and fear because fear doesn't really

422
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,040
help but like this is why it's important

423
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,800
it'll help us in the long run this way

424
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,279
it'll we can land bigger deals if we're

425
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:49,839
in a for-profit company we can you know

426
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:51,040
protect our

427
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,320
students our

428
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,639
you know patients our their data and

429
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:57,279
stuff so

430
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:58,160
um

431
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,240
this is extremely true nowadays this

432
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,760
this wasn't the case when i first got in

433
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,440
but cloud computing

434
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,519
everyone's in the cloud several people

435
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:07,839
you know aws gcp azure

436
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:09,839
seems like the majority is in aws but at

437
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:12,000
least having a basic understanding

438
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,600
knowing how this works you can get free

439
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,040
accounts you can

440
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,639
also get not so free accounts and get

441
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:18,480
scared by the bill really quick you know

442
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,399
that that's called experience

443
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:21,920
so i've been in interviews before i was

444
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,440
like do you have aws experience like

445
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,959
well yeah you know i had a little pet

446
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:26,880
project here and then i also had you

447
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,880
know a 200 build that i wasn't expected

448
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,720
so yeah i'm experienced in aws and then

449
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,760
you get a chuckle out of them and

450
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,320
they're like this person is funny

451
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,399
so cloud computing at least basics learn

452
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:37,760
it um

453
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,519
get familiar with it

454
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:41,600
let's see and python because yeah

455
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,639
security

456
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:45,839
i don't know python but yeah

457
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:46,880
uh

458
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,959
who's seen this before who feels this

459
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:51,440
way i'm looking at jobs

460
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,959
i hate it

461
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:55,519
so big red x boo

462
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:57,279
i wish so i'm not a people leader

463
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,199
unfortunately which i'm actually okay

464
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:02,000
with but i wish more places were like

465
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,519
this it's like hey

466
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:04,800
we want to hire you you'll get your

467
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,399
experience here we're willing to take

468
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:08,399
the chance to like you know take a

469
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:10,399
couple months to get you up to speed or

470
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:12,079
give you projects and things like this

471
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:13,040
like

472
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,720
if i start a company i want to do it

473
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,880
like this but anyway

474
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,399
throwing in memes to keep people awake

475
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:21,279
mostly myself but there you go

476
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:23,680
all right so experience this is this is

477
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,279
interesting especially now because you

478
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:26,800
know back in the day i'm not that old

479
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,800
but back in my day it was like

480
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,360
i saw very few jobs that didn't require

481
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,360
a degree a bachelor's degree in computer

482
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,720
science or

483
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,959
i.t or related field you know the

484
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,720
catch-all related field that they get to

485
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,560
determine sort of thing

486
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,920
and but now

487
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,360
more companies are moving towards

488
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,199
experience like you don't need a

489
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:47,759
four-year degree necessarily do like

490
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:50,079
could we take certificates or boot camps

491
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:51,680
or things like that so i kind of want to

492
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,120
talk about degree versus experience for

493
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,399
a minute i took the degree path you know

494
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:57,519
some jobs

495
00:15:57,519 --> 00:15:59,519
like it could be a mandate it could be a

496
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:01,199
contractual agreement it's like no we

497
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:03,199
have to have degrees it's it's just

498
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:05,040
something written in like

499
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,680
they may not have wiggle room on it

500
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,320
which is you know it is what it is but

501
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,279
you can

502
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:13,360
get degrees like

503
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,920
i'm gonna yeah there it is wgu

504
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,600
i'll talk about that in a sec

505
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,079
um nice thing about degrees is you it

506
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:22,399
covers like the plan

507
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,959
like so information systems for example

508
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:26,399
you learn about web design and stuff

509
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:27,759
like this but you also learn these

510
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:30,000
auxiliary things like project management

511
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,480
or economics or accounting which can be

512
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,800
valuable in the long run like okay it's

513
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,399
not just this narrow focus but they also

514
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:37,600
have some of these other skills that are

515
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,360
a bit more well-rounded

516
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,320
great

517
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,399
and with some graduate programs some

518
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:43,759
degrees you actually

519
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:46,880
graduate with some certifications wgu is

520
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,320
one of those they have

521
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,399
degrees in like cyber security and

522
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:52,880
part of the plan is you graduate and you

523
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:56,320
have x number of ccna degrees or wow

524
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,399
certs wow it's tired

525
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:00,399
i should have slept better

526
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:02,560
so that's nice we'll talk about certs in

527
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,519
a second

528
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:05,919
so versus experience so let's move over

529
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:08,319
there so instead of like graduating and

530
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:09,919
then going into a four-year program it's

531
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:11,359
like hey i want to get right into the

532
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:13,280
job field let's do that so it's a

533
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,359
quicker path to employment because

534
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:17,520
you're not taking a four-year

535
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,280
you know get my degree before i start

536
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,280
working full-time

537
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,280
possibly less debt possibly you won't

538
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,559
have all that student that you would get

539
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:26,880
if you had gone with a degree

540
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,840
and then build build skills more

541
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:33,120
hands-on you know technology or hands-on

542
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,080
learning

543
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,120
than

544
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,880
necessarily like you're in a class and

545
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,280
you're learning about stuff like so book

546
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,600
knowledge book smarts versus hands-on

547
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,360
i've actually done this like oh yeah i

548
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,440
worked for a small company i had to i

549
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,679
was there one it guy and i had to you

550
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:49,919
know set up the firewalls and i did all

551
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:51,840
that stuff and i learned it this way

552
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,400
instead of you know theoretical like

553
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,840
learning about it in books or something

554
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,440
i don't know

555
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,840
just making sense i feel like i'm

556
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:03,440
rambling just mumble rabble rabble okay

557
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,600
okay certifications just get assist

558
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,120
that's all you got to do get assist

559
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,799
you'll get a job

560
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:11,600
if you don't know javid he made this

561
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,280
several years ago it's the it's a

562
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,640
youtube video called the benefits of

563
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,480
being a cyst he talks about how you can

564
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,320
be pretentious and you can get like a

565
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,840
wallet with a clear thing and basically

566
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,120
flash it like a badge and you could just

567
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,200
bust in and be like sisp

568
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,039
and so i had to throw that in because

569
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:27,120
it's a great video

570
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,679
but for real though okay certifications

571
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:32,240
versus not certifications

572
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,120
um

573
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,880
are they good are they bad little it

574
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,039
depends spoiler alert it depends it's

575
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:39,120
gonna be every slide by the way

576
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:42,240
um so when i see an entry-level

577
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,840
resume come across or whatever it's like

578
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,440
hey they're just about to graduate or

579
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,280
whatever but hey they have some

580
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,960
certification they have like security

581
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,559
network plus or something's like hey

582
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:52,320
they have something that that stamp may

583
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,080
helps you stand out from a crowd also if

584
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,520
you're a student you can usually get a

585
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:58,480
student rate at comp tia certs that's

586
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,400
what i did i was like oh yeah it's like

587
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,400
half price i'll totally do that

588
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,200
um

589
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,039
certs are helpful it does depend on the

590
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:07,520
cert you know if you're applying for

591
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,880
you know

592
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,200
oh i don't know like a network degree

593
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,039
or network degree

594
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:14,960
calm down geez

595
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,200
if you plan for a network

596
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,360
admin or a network security job and it's

597
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:22,080
like hey you've got some ccna certs or

598
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,400
you've got you know network plus or

599
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,640
network specific certs that tells me

600
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,640
okay they don't just memorize ports and

601
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,400
protocols but you know they had to pass

602
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,240
a test and actually did this or even the

603
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,840
ones where you you have to build a home

604
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:34,720
lab

605
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,840
or to pass a test that's

606
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,640
helpful um

607
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,240
what kind of security are you interested

608
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,919
in so this is kind of like

609
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:43,520
which cert would be the most bang for my

610
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,120
buck or the most beneficial and which

611
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,480
certs are more like

612
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:49,200
generalist and it's kind of a it's a

613
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,960
kind of a higher bar so they can like

614
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,240
discriminate against people who don't

615
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,440
have it

616
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,799
it's lame

617
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:56,080
and if you're getting searched just so

618
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,520
you can have alphabet soup after your

619
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,000
name on linkedin then maybe you don't

620
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,120
get certs otherwise you look like a

621
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,120
north korean general so anyway there you

622
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,120
go

623
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,640
okay so starting on the top left i

624
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,240
should have animated this but um some

625
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,480
general security certs these are like i

626
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,840
would say these are entry levels you can

627
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,200
get them right now they don't require

628
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,600
like prerequisites that i know of

629
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,480
um comp tia a lot of the star plus ones

630
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,039
you know security plus network plus um

631
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:23,600
that kind of stuff ceh i don't have this

632
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,440
there's been some

633
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,280
rumblings in infosec twitter about that

634
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,960
but i i know people who have it they say

635
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,960
it's good it's more hands-on

636
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,640
it's definitely for ethical hacking so

637
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,880
more of that red team purple team

638
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,480
pentester type track

639
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,360
and ine they have their elearn security

640
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,679
certs which you can sign up for and you

641
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:44,400
can get a couple of those certificate of

642
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,640
completion type things it's kind of

643
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,600
i mean it it's way easy like

644
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,039
low barrier to entry and it's like you

645
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:53,280
can put that on your resume

646
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,640
all right so moving to the right these

647
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,840
are advanced security search so these

648
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,679
are more general or slightly more

649
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:00,320
specialized so cissp you know so you can

650
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,640
you know flash your badge it's a mile

651
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,480
wide and an inch deep it covers the 10

652
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:07,120
security domains it's great like

653
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,799
because it's you know it covers

654
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:09,840
everything and

655
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,760
unfortunately a lot of times recruiters

656
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,720
like oh i know what cissp is so i'm just

657
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:17,039
going to look for that it's like well

658
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:18,960
about that you shouldn't like there's

659
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,200
other things out there so i i said

660
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,799
earlier like know what kind of security

661
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:24,000
you're going into if you want to go into

662
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,919
like auditing or something the cisa

663
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:27,200
would be something more like that it's

664
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,159
like certified info systems or security

665
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:32,159
audits something like that

666
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:33,919
um then there's more specialized like

667
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:35,600
sans puts out a lot through their g-ac

668

670
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,480
um

671
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,320
yeah and then specialized security

672
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,400
search these are more advanced that you

673
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,320
know i'm using pen test an example but

674
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,559
you can get the you know giac

675
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:51,280
penetration tester web app pen tester

676
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,919
pnpt that's the cyber mentor great

677
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:56,799
content i love he has really good stuff

678
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:58,640
osce which is kind of more advanced than

679
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,919
the oscp

680
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:02,640
pen test plus so see where i'm going

681
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:06,080
ramblings they'll call in okay anyway

682
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,799
community involvement this always helps

683
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:10,320
so the very first

684
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,159
security con i ever went to was b-side

685
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:14,320
salt lake city it was in 2015. it was

686
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,480
down at thanksgiving point and i thought

687
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,880
this is cool this is what i want to do

688
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,400
um so

689
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,080
you're already doing it you're here this

690
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,200
is awesome

691
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,360
also there's b sites all over the world

692
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,600
so lots of major cities have a b sites

693
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,919
like b-sides you know

694
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:31,520
las vegas besides you know north

695
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,960
carolina like there's

696
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,120
they have a lot um another local con

697
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,039
which is great is st con i've been going

698
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:38,799
there a few years i really enjoy that

699
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:40,960
defcon it's right in vegas these cost a

700
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,480
little more it's fine and then there's

701
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,559
also non-security or less security

702
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:45,840
oriented

703
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,600
local conferences you could go to i'm

704
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,760
talking utah specific but you know like

705
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,360
open west and big mountain this is a

706
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,720
great place a lot of them were dev

707
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,120
conferences great things to go to

708
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,919
and this one i really i believe in i'm a

709
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:00,000
believer i'm not only a the president of

710
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,200
the client sort of i'm just kidding i'm

711
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,840
not the president but volunteer at cons

712
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,679
like especially community cons it's you

713
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:07,440
know by the people for the people sort

714
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,039
of thing

715
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:10,559
when i was working as a monitoring

716
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:12,799
engineer not a security engineer

717
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:14,640
i would take pto and then i would

718
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,640
volunteer it's great because you get to

719
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,960
work the con you get to meet people and

720
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,480
you usually get in for free a lot of the

721
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,360
times which is definitely beneficial

722
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,760
and if you don't want to work the con

723
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,440
volunteer to speak like submit a

724
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,120
proposal with a better title than this

725
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,840
one submit a proposal so you can present

726
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,760
at the con and then you usually get a

727
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:34,880
free pass but you don't have to work for

728
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,039
part of the con so that's actually what

729
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:38,720
i would do i would volunteer and i would

730
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,880
also you know offer to speak of these

731
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,799
cons that work wouldn't pay for and i'd

732
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:44,320
take pto and then i could get a free

733
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,760
pass and come in and network and

734
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,360
hallwaycon and

735
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,120
i would recommend it

736
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,440

737
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,279

can make a home lab out of raspberry

833
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,720
pi's you could have like older computers

834
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,520
like hey i want to learn linux but i

835
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:04,960
have this old computer let's blow it

836
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,799
away install linux on it and teach

837
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:08,799
myself linux for example it's always

838
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:11,520
helpful to learn linux by the way

839
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,120
there's places where you can get

840
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,559
downloadable

841
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:16,720
capture the flags like vuln hub and ctf

842
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,640
time where you can actually download

843
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,080
them install like virtual machine

844
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,480
environments and then you can actually

845
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,760
some of them will have walkthroughs some

846
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,039
of them you have to stumble through and

847
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:26,960
do the ctf on your own this is great

848
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,559
because it's hands-on skills and like in

849
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:30,799
an interview like have you ever done

850
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:32,559

know learning sql injection how i was

854
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:41,679

dividends and interviews

856
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,279

me three years later at a different

981
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,440
company so

982
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,120
that's that that was the failure story

983
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,880
that wasn't the success story okay this

984
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:41,840
is the success story was hallwaycon

985
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:44,159
so i was going to

986
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:46,799

i applied for the job and then i went on

989
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,440
linkedin and i looked up the people it's

990
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,480
kind of helpful to have a second

linkedin that isn't your true name

992
00:31:56,399 --> 00:31:58,000

993
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,679
team it's like okay so there's this guy

994
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:01,440
and then there's this woman here and

995
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:04,640

warranty attached but anyway um those

1017

1018
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:54,960
it was a good one

1019
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:56,480

1020
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,320
threw it into appendix i didn't know if

1021
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,440
i'd use it but

1022
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,519
those are some of the things um free

1023

resources i took this from that free

1024
