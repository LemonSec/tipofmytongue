city uh thanks for having us welcome to

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,280
our talk this is uh gaining clarity

6
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,519
within the cloud sensor response tactics

7
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:19,440
for the untrained and unequipped

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
how's it going everyone my name is david

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,039
hall i'm a senior cyber security

10
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:27,920
customer engineer at microsoft

11
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,920
in a former life i was a signal warrant

12
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,519
officer um

13
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:33,360
in the united states army

14
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,079
that just means i'm not as cool as nando

15
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:39,600
he was a cyber guy i'm a signal guy

16
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,920
i'm also an automation enthusiast so

17
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,640
that just means i like powershell things

18
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,360
uh arm template type of things bicep if

19
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,039
you don't know what that is

20
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:50,399
ping me and i can

21
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,239
walk you through what uh bicep is

22
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:56,239
yeah hey and i'm fernando tomlinson i'm

23
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:57,920
a principal forensics and incident

24
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,120
response consultant at mandate i too am

25
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,640
a retired

26
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,319
army warrant officer

27
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:06,240
shamelessly now i don't want to say i'm

28
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,720
a cyber warrant officer but nonetheless

29
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,040
focused on cyber i'm an adjunct cyber

30
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,040
security professional or professor as

31
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,600
well and i'm an avid lover of powershell

32
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,240
in the language

33
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:22,960
so we have an aggressive agenda uh here

34
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,960
today

35
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,640
so to kind of get us started off we're

36
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,479
going to talk about kind of level set

37
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:30,320
with what

38
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,360
is the cloud and kind of um

39
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,720
if you talk to

40
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,520
probably six or eight or 12 or 37

41
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,040
different people you may get 37

42
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,320
different answers about what is the

43
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,200
cloud

44
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,640
so we'll kind of give you our

45
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,880
rudimentary definition

46
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,119
uh about what is the cloud

47
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:49,200
we'll talk about some common mistakes

48
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,159
that we see when we see customers move

49
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:53,360
from

50
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:57,280
um on-prem to hybrid to more

51
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,759
cloud-focused assets

52
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,399
uh talk about how we respond to

53
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,960
incidents that occur as of the uh as a

54
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,680
result of those common mistakes

55
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,720
some tools we can use to uh do response

56
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,160
actions

57
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,760
um as a respon as a

58
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,720
result of those common mistakes

59
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,480
and then

60
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,120
kind of what can we do proactively from

61
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,040
an operations perspective so i'm an

62
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,640
operations guy

63
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,920
uh or

64
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,360
cis admin

65
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,120
kind of background whatever you want to

66
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,239
call it

67
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:35,519
so what can we do proactively to not get

68
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:37,360
ourselves in a situation where we need

69
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,239
to

70
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:40,720
to do response actions

71
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,319
and then

72
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:44,000
at the very end we'll talk about some

73
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,879
quick wins and some

74
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:49,680
resources that you can use to

75
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,239
skill up

76
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,160
and there it goes

77
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,040
so

78
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,360
you've all probably seen this meme ooh

79
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,519
the cloud it's the it's the cool thing

80
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:02,640
that

81
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,120
everybody talks about nowadays and

82
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,720
i guess if you're

83
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,680
probably as as old as i am it is kind of

84
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,519
new relatively speaking when you've been

85
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:13,360
doing this for

86
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,560
um

87
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,720
what have i been doing this 25

88
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,840
years or so so it's been a while

89
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,159
the cloud is relatively new in in those

90
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:23,280
terms

91
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,159
um

92
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:25,920
but

93
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,080
the threats are

94
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,840
really a lot of the same when you when

95
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,159
you look at

96
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:33,920
the ingress points

97
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,080
and kind of what we see as threat

98
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,440
vectors

99
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:41,040
for cloud assets versus on-prem

100
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,120
the cloud

101
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,560
really gives you

102
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,480
some different capabilities

103
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,599
um

104
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:51,200
some different um

105
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,720
type of response actions and

106
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,720
capabilities that you can use

107
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,480
so it's important to understand uh that

108
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,640
environment and kind of what it it

109
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,480
brings to bear

110
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,319
so we'll talk about that a little more

111
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:05,280
in depth here in a minute

112
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:08,000
so kind of what our definition

113
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,720
of the cloud is before we get too deep

114
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,159
into the

115
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:14,400
uh security and ir

116
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,920
type of stuff

117
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,279
um

118
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,759
i kind of like to look at it as

119
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,680
global infrastructure

120
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,360
globally connected infrastructure at

121
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,040
your fingertips

122
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,960
so if i need to

123
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,639
spin up a web application

124
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:33,120
that's globally accessible to to users

125
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,240
in australia or china or russia or

126
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,040
anywhere across across the globe i can

127
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,120
easily do that from the comfort of my

128
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,560
home right here in in coastal georgia

129
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,840
you know in

130
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:46,880
less than

131
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,840
seconds or minutes it's just that easy

132
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,919
those are those are things that

133
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:54,240
maybe ten years ago or even three or

134
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,120
four or five years ago with on-prem

135
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,479
assets

136
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:00,560
you just didn't have access to

137
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,759
uh so

138
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:03,919
the cloud gives you access to do that

139
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:06,000
stuff at scale that

140
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,080
you we just couldn't we just didn't

141
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,479
think was capable of you know

142
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:11,919
a few years ago

143
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:14,479
that image there at the top right

144
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:16,560
that's the the largest

145
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,600
uh vm offering that i could find in in

146
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,880
azure so

147
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,400
208 virtual cpus with

148
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,960
a little over 11 000 gigs of ram i don't

149
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,000
know what the heck you would do with

150
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,280
that thing but

151
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,080
uh

152
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,840
that's a pretty beefy machine that you

153
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,440
could play like minecraft or something

154
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,960
on i suppose

155
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,560
i have no idea what that would cost you

156
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,840
but

157
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,919
it's probably out of my price range i

158
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:42,320
would guess

159
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:46,479
the cloud is also scalable so

160
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,960
and very very scalable very very quickly

161
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,240
so if

162
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,160
during the holiday season you're on tick

163
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,800
tock and you make the latest viral

164
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,960
video of whatever selling some kind of

165
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,000
widget

166
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,120
uh on your website you could

167
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,960
create uh

168
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,120
you have your website in the cloud you

169
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,039
can very easily

170
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:09,280
scale those services

171
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,080
to accommodate that 15 minutes of fame

172
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,280
that you

173
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,919
uh you realize during the holiday season

174
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:17,600
that you need to accommodate with all

175
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,600
that traffic that goes to your

176
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,720
your website and then conversely you can

177
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,280
very easily scale it back down so you

178
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,840
don't have to realize all those expenses

179
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,240
you know after january 1st when

180
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,240
nobody's really looking at your

181
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,919
your website anymore because the

182
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:35,520
holidays are over

183
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,800
so it gives you that flexibility

184
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,639
uh from a security perspective

185
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:45,039
again i come at this from uh

186
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:48,960
the operations sysadmin side so

187
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,800
in certain ways

188
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,599
you can eliminate some of the security

189
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:56,560
burden on your administrator so

190
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,319
if i look at this from a software as a

191
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:00,720
service perspective i can spin up

192
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,680
a sql management instance

193
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,880
where

194
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,400
i don't have to have a sql server

195
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,800
running i can just run the sql instance

196
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,240
and i don't have to worry about patching

197
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,360
a vm

198
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,919
or patching a server or worry about any

199
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,919
of that stuff running on i don't have to

200
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:17,599
worry about the hardware period

201
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:20,160
all i have to worry about is the actual

202
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,599
sql

203
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:24,160
piece of it and the application

204
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,800
so that's what the cloud

205
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,720
gives us access to at this point in time

206
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,560
so when we talk about

207
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,400
types of clouds

208
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,160
public cloud is pretty self-explanatory

209
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,440
that's that's what you see at

210
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:42,080
portal.azure.com at aws ibm

211
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,800
oracle that's all the public-facing uh

212
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,240
clouds that really anybody has access to

213
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,560
private cloud here we're talking about

214
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,160
um

215
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,919
when you're

216
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:55,680
essentially creating your own data

217
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,280
center and hosting services uh

218
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,199
privately that are not for public

219
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:03,360
consumption

220
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,680
hybrid services this is where we see a

221
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,280
lot of customers

222
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,360
uh today and are probably gonna be here

223
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:13,199
for a long long time

224
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:15,680
customers have say an active directory

225
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,000
instance on prem

226
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,479
and they are slowly moving web

227
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,319
applications or

228
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:24,160
some piece of that active directory

229
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,800
infrastructure to the cloud

230
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,599
and

231
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:28,720
you know that's probably not going to

232
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,680
change

233
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,039
anytime soon

234
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:32,719
organizations are probably going to live

235
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:34,880
in a higher some sort of hybrid state

236
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,200
for a long time

237
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,799
community cloud you may not have heard

238
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:39,679
of

239
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:42,719
here we're talking about more of

240
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:44,000
say

241
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,880
government specific clouds or health

242
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,360
care specific clouds or financial

243
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,920
specific clouds like azure government

244
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,720
aws has a government specific cloud and

245
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,160
there may be others that are missing

246
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,399
there

247
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:02,080
so you're the typical

248
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,120
uh

249
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,839
cloud platform providers this is in no

250
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:06,839
way an

251
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:09,760
exhaustive uh list of course but these

252
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,880
are

253
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,600
some of the major players um some are

254
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,519
much more mature than others of course

255
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:18,000
amazon has been doing this

256
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,160
really longer than than anybody else on

257
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,000
this list

258
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,600
and some of these

259
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,240
uh providers are

260
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,000
what i would call more full service than

261
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,080
others some of them are more

262
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:33,440
uh software as a service focused than

263
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,560
full

264
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,200
cloud platform providers

265
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,519
you know which is better

266
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:40,480
that's

267
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,880
totally up to an organization to to

268
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,399
figure out

269
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:46,800
i would encourage you to dip your toe in

270
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:47,680
into

271
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,440
a little bit of everything and see what

272
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,880
tool works for you

273
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,240
the best you know

274
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,160
the analogy i make is you go to the

275
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,439
grocery store there's probably

276
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:01,120
37.687 different versions of barbecue

277
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,640
sauce on the shelf

278
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,120
which one's the best yeah i don't know i

279
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,240
mean

280
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,920
one of them may be better than the other

281
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,399
in your opinion but mine may be one i

282
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:12,160
get maybe

283
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,480
better for me so it's just a matter of

284
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,000
which tool is better for you and your

285
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,120
organization

286
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,560
and it may not be the same today

287
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,000
versus tomorrow

288
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,640
i think the takeaway here is

289
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,360
the landscape is changing very quickly

290
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,839
as it does

291
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:30,800
in this

292
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,200
kind of ecosystem

293
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,839
you know amazon launched in i think 2006

294
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:36,800
ish

295
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,959
if my math is correct that's what 15

296
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:40,480
years we've only been doing this thing

297
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,279
doing this thing for about 15 years so

298
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:45,680
this thing is changing very quickly

299
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,279
there are new players coming into the

300
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,440
game all the time

301
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:53,920
so kind of buckle your seatbelt i think

302
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,200
so we've level set

303
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,600
about what the cloud is you know this is

304
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,920
a security conference right what are we

305
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,600
talking about the cloud

306
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,279
what about

307
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:08,160
security how do we

308
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:08,730
um

309
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:10,079
[Music]

310
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:12,000
secure these assets what are some of the

311
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,560
tools to do that

312
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:18,000
so what about security

313
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,399
so i have flat my gums about you know

314
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:22,800
the cloud let's get down to the meat and

315
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,200
potatoes of why you're here

316
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,920
uh if you look at some statistics these

317
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,720
are from our friends over at uh

318
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,680
mandiant nando grab these for me

319
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,839
so if you look at the far left

320
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:39,120
24 percent of organizations have

321
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,000
hosts missing critical patches so what's

322
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,760
significant

323
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,279
to that

324
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:48,880
for me in relation to the cloud

325
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:49,600
and

326
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,760
we see this all the time at microsoft if

327
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,480
you have a bad patching program on

328
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,000
premise

329
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,240
is going to follow you into the cloud

330
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,200
if it causes you problems on premise

331
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,639
it's going to cause you those same

332
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:05,680
problems in the cloud

333
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,200
so

334
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,560
i think that

335
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,880
the takeaway with that is

336
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:11,680
uh

337
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,160
one fix the problem before you start

338
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,839
moving those assets

339
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:19,040
to the cloud so do some inventory there

340
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,240
before

341
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,279
you start lifting shifting assets

342
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:25,040
and moving them to the cloud

343
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:28,639
the cloud is in no way some sort of

344
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:30,639
um

345
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:34,079
magic elixir to fix all of your

346
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:36,240
uh security woes

347
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,560
it's not gonna do that for you

348
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,560
all of that stuff that you needed to do

349
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,399
on on-premises you're going to need to

350
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:45,760
do that in the cloud as well and more so

351
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,680
if you take a look at that second

352
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,639
statistic there 95 of the security

353
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:51,600
failure

354
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,839
failures that customers

355
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:56,800
is the customer's responsibility so

356
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,680
i think that goes to

357
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:03,040
this is not necessarily

358
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,040
fully understanding

359
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,600
what is service providers responsibility

360
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,000
and what is the

361
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,519
uh

362
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:15,279
data owner's responsibility so it's

363
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:18,320
it's incumbent upon the data owner to

364
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:21,600
understand from a securities perspective

365
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,680
what is their responsibility versus what

366
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:27,519
is the cloud provider's responsibility

367
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:30,079
uh if we look at the the third one there

368
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:33,120
84 of organizations say traditional tech

369
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,920
doesn't work in the cloud

370
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,320
again this goes back to

371
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,920
understanding

372
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,240
what you're lifting and shifting or what

373
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,120
you're moving from on-prem

374
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,690
to a hybrid or cloud-only

375
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:49,920
[Music]

376
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,199
model

377
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:53,279
so you may have tools

378
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,760
security tools specifically

379
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:59,040
on-prem that are not going to reach

380
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,720
your assets in the cloud or reach assets

381
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:06,079
that you intend to have in multi-clouds

382
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,040
so

383
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,639
that is a big consideration when you

384
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:12,320
think about

385
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,279
um

386
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:17,440
going from a specifically on prim

387
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,800
model to

388
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,440
potentially hybrid or

389
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,199
totally cloud

390
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:25,600
facing so understand that your tools

391
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,040
need to be able to reach all those

392
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:30,040
assets

393
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,360
cloud is not going anywhere so

394
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,959
that number on the right-hand side

395
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:36,639
eleven percent have a significant cloud

396
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:37,680
component

397
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,279
cloud's not going anywhere out i would

398
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:41,680
expect that number to go up as as time

399
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,160
goes on

400
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,120
the takeaway here is not all tools are

401
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,800
created equal and not all tools are

402
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,000
going to cover

403
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,560
all assets so do your homework before

404
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,079
you lift and shift

405
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:58,439
your assets to the cloud

406
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,120
so some common misconfigurations we see

407
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,720
now these are

408
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,120
azure specific obviously but i would

409
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,560
expect

410
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,000
uh

411
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,240
to see some commonality commonalities

412
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,600
across

413
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,320
cloud providers uh with some of these i

414
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,160
haven't looked specifically but you

415
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,279
trend micro probably has uh

416
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:20,880
some of these same things for other

417
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,760
cloud providers in that link below

418
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:27,839
so storage accounts in

419
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:31,519
in azure we see commonly

420
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:34,120
storage accounts left open with

421

423
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,120
common

00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,399

left enabled

426
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,680
um

427
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,800
v-net access left you know wide open

428
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,639
those kinds of things

429
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:50,910

leaving rdp open

434
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:03,040
um those types of things

00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:06,399
for network security groups specifically

rule set there

439
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,800
it's just like you know kind of any

440
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,120
any firewall rule set or anything that

441
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,519
similar capability you have to pair that

442
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:22,320
rule set down to to make it you know

443

useful

444
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,519
so it's just like anything else you have

445
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:27,120
to do your homework

446
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,399
um

447
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:30,000
and we're going to talk about some tools

448
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,480
that you can use to mitigate some of

449
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,000
these things

450
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,480
uh right off the bat because

451
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,480
a lot of this is you don't know what you

452
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,240
don't know before you get in the cloud

453
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,480
right

454
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,959
so common root cause and i think this is

455
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:49,440
number one right at the top is just lack

456
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,600
of understanding it's it's a don't you

457
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,000
see you don't know what you don't know

458
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,959
um we're all trying to move at the speed

459
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:59,519
of sound because

460
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:02,320
uh your organization is trying to

461
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,760
you know make money or

462
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,319
do whatever they do and we're all trying

463
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,079
to do it fast

464
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:11,839
and efficiently

465
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:12,640
uh

466
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,880
and get it done yesterday

467
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,160
so

468
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,280
a

469
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,720
a move from on-prem to hybrid or to

470
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,520
cloud is in no way different

471
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,400
uh

472
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,119
and having been in you know grown up in

473
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:28,720
the government

474
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:32,080
most of my adult life

475
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,520
being in the commercial world is no

476
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,120
different you're probably undermanned

477
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,360
and understaffed and overworked and

478
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,280
you're probably doing more than you

479
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,799
are paid to do

480
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:42,559
so

481
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:44,320
lack of understanding of an environment

482
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,400
is not uncommon across

483
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,120
all customers that that i see

484
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,880
on a daily basis

485
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,440
everywhere

486
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,120
so what can you do

487
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,880
from your

488
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,559
sphere of influence

489
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:03,280
to mitigate some of that

490
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,039
and i think what we're going to talk

491
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:07,120
about on the next few

492
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,559
slides and

493
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:11,039
what nando's going to talk about

494
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:12,640
you have to

495
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,400
take a step back and automate things you

496
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,720
have to automate what you can

497
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,280
to take control of

498
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,440
the potential sprawl that you can get

499
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,880
from

500
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,799
having to deploy these resources so

501
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:27,200
quickly

502
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,240
you can quickly go from zero to 60

503
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,360
and then

504
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,200
you find yourself in a situation where

505
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,760
you're circling back and trying to put

506
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,960
some guardrails on it all

507
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,240
so you don't want to be in that

508
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,640
situation

509
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,640
so from an operations support

510
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,320
perspective and

511
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,320
i kind of lump

512
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,400
you know your sysadmins

513
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,480
folks

514
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,840
into that kind of mindset what can you

515
00:18:54,840 --> 00:19:00,000
do to assist your cyber teams

516
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,919
your blue teams your red teams your

517
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:03,919
purple teams whatever color you want you

518
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:06,799
want to throw in there

519
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:12,160
what can you do proactively to assist

520
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,480
so we don't have to go through the

521
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,799
incident response drill so maybe we can

522
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:18,240
stop some of this before it actually

523
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,640
happens

524
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:23,600
i think we can change the way we

525
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,000
think we can change our approach

526
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,280
and that will

527
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,600
change the way that we

528
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,640
defend

529
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,400
the infrastructure

530
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,360
if we assume

531
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:38,799
the attacker is in the network assume on

532
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:41,120
a day-to-day basis that everything that

533
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:44,880
we have put in place has failed

534
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,919
you can't uh nowadays

535
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:49,760
think that there is a perimeter defense

536
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,840
there really is no perimeter defense

537
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,840
there's no firewall there's you can't

538
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,160
really put up a firewall or an ips or an

539
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,520
ids

540
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,679
or you know a moat and fill it with

541
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:01,120
alligators

542
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,840
and think that that is going to keep

543
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,520
the threat actor

544
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:08,320
out of the network is just not

545
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,320
possible anymore

546
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:14,080
identity is the perimeter

547
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:17,120
that's the ingress point for

548
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,360
almost all of these

549
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,559
these threats

550
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:22,799
so you're gonna have to think about it

551
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:24,080
in terms of

552
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,280
there is no

553
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,360
wall in between

554
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,919
your infrastructure and

555
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:33,600
the the threat actors the bad guys

556
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,480
it's

557
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:37,360
kind of an imaginary line at this point

558
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:40,080
so if we can assume breach

559
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:40,799
we

560
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:42,960
start thinking about

561
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,200
all those speed bumps that the fence and

562
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,360
depth all of those things the speed

563
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,720
bumps that we can put in front of an

564
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,919
attacker

565
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:52,080
and then at the end of the day it's all

566
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:55,120
about increasing

567
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,440
the attackers

568
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,520
uh or decreasing the the attacker's

569
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,200
return on investment we want to make it

570
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,120
as hard as possible

571
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,960
for an attacker to do what they want to

572
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:05,840
do

573
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,640
we want to make it cost as much as

574
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,600
possible

575
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,600
for them to get in the infrastructure

576
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,240
and do what they want to do

577
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,080
if it's easy for them to walk in the

578
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,679
front door or the back door of the side

579
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:18,640
door

580
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,000
uh

581
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,200
you know then they just kind of have

582
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,880
free reign in to do whatever they want

583
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,240
to do and

584
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,600
odds are you probably won't know it

585
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,400
until it's too late

586
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,480
so we want to assume breach put as many

587
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,720
speed bumps in the way as possible

588
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,400
uh

589
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,000
decrease the attacker's return on

590
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,960
investment increase their cost of attack

591
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,880
and eventually we want to get to a zero

592
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,559
trust model so

593
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:44,559
this is kind of like uh

594
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:46,080
the definition of the cloud you know

595
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,760
what the heck is zero trust well if you

596
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,840
ask 10 people you're going to get

597
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,679
27 different answers

598
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:53,600
well i figured nist was probably a good

599
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,840
source on this so what what is zero

600
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:59,200
trust well if you're

601
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,679
a cop basically a comprehensive strategy

602
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:04,320
to secure your organization or

603
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:07,440
organizations enterprise anywhere

604
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,000
anytime

605
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:13,520
that's essentially zero trust so whether

606
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:16,400
your users are accessing your

607
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,080
corporate infrastructure

608
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:21,919
from home from b-side salt lake city

609
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:24,720
from inside the corporate network

610
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,120
via a mobile device

611
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,000
uh

612
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
via

613
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,360
a corporate

614
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:35,200
owned device via a work from home device

615
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,200
whatever it is

616
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:41,120
we want to have all the zero trust

617
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,600
guardrails and conditional access and

618
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,840
all those things in place

619
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,679
to be able to protect the network and

620
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:49,360
infrastructure

621
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,760
to head off attacks before we get to

622
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:54,559
instant response

623
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:55,840
so what are some

624
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,000
uh mechanisms we can use cloud

625
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,440
specifically

626
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,799
to

627
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:02,400
to do some analysis to do some

628
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,080
administration those kinds of things now

629
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,360
these are in

630
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:08,640
kind of my order of effectiveness

631
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,440
your mileage may vary here

632
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:14,080
this is azure specific obviously but i

633
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:14,880
think

634
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:18,240
you know aws has some

635
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:21,120
cloud shell equivalent azure cloud shell

636
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,840
is essentially powershell built into the

637
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,840
azure web interface

638
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,159
i like it because it's os agnostic you

639
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:31,120
don't have to if you're using it from uh

640
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:35,120
linux or mac you know no big deal

641
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,360
second uh

642
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:40,720
kind of in the list there is powershell

643
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,919
because it's

644
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:43,200
command line

645
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:43,919
uh

646
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:45,600
interface

647
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,000
it is cross-platform

648
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,720
to a degree the the uh

649
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,960
the engine is cross-platform

650
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,400
some of the tools that that you're

651
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,600
trying to use the modules may or may not

652
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,640
be so your mileage may vary there there

653
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,559
are version there is some versioning and

654
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:04,559
no less considerations

655
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:07,039
uh there with what kind of what versions

656
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:09,440
of powershell you're using

657
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,279
the web

658
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:14,400
ui is good to get started

659
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,400
in my opinion it's not sustainable you

660
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,440
can't

661
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,960
uh efficiently manage

662
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:23,039
cloud infrastructure

663
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:25,760
doing it in the in the web ui you you

664
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:28,159
just can't you don't have access to

665
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:31,200
to do that stuff efficiently

666
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,120
you're going to quickly be overwhelmed

667
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,400
and

668
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,559
it's just not sustainable

669
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:38,080
so

670
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,640
take away there get out of the web gui

671
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,760
get into the command line

672
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:48,000
so in that kind of same being

673
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,360
this is one of the things that you can

674
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,080
do

675
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:53,360
from an operations perspective

676
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:56,400
is utilize infrastructure as code

677
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,279
methodologies to deploy and maintain

678
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:00,960
your resources

679
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,600
so what do i mean by infrastructure as

680
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,039
code

681
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:07,360
i want to put all of my i'm going to

682
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,679
deploy my vms i'm going to deploy my web

683
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:10,640
apps

684
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,240
as code

685
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,760
i know this is what

686
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:16,400
kind of the the infrastructure as code

687
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,080
an example looks like on the bottom

688
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,200
right there

689
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,240
that is actually bicep code if any of

690
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,000
you are familiar with

691
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,240
uh arm templates azure resource

692
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:30,480
management templates based on json

693
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:33,279
this is kind of the next generation

694
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:34,960
uh

695
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:37,919
language of arm

696
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:40,320
it's a transformation language on top of

697
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,440
arm so

698
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,679
if you're familiar with json

699
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:45,279
to me it kind of makes your eyes bleed

700
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:48,880
with all the punch light punctuation

701
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,200
this is bicep meant to make the barrier

702
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:56,080
to entry for arm templates much less um

703
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:59,120
it's so easy i did this you know i'm not

704
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,360
nando can attest i'm not a very smart

705
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,240
guy

706
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,520
i actually put one of these things

707
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,960
together so

708
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,480
you know if i can do it anyway i can do

709
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,679
it

710
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:09,120
um

711
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,960
anyway infrastructure is code what we're

712
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,120
trying to get to is

713
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:16,559
deployment efficiency recoverability

714
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:18,159
so if

715
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:20,480
a ransomware attack happens

716
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:23,039
we can quickly recover

717
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:25,039
all we need to do is pull our resources

718
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:26,559
out of code

719
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:28,559
uh now obviously there's a lot of

720
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:30,799
intricacies and nuance there but you get

721
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:32,320
the idea

722
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,559
it enables us to do automated scanning

723
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:37,120
avoid configuration drift

724
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,760
we can um

725
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,840
dynamic provision so

726
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:45,520
if i have a lab i need to move from my

727
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,320
dev test environment over to production

728
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,640
i can do that all i need to do is flip a

729
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,799
switch into code it

730
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:55,840
takes 20 seconds

731
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,600
i can automate documentation i don't

732
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,760
have to spend a bunch of time

733
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,760
writing word documents i can do it all

734
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:05,279
in markdown as a part of deployment with

735
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:08,240
infrastructure code methodologies

736
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,840
so those are kind of some of the things

737
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,840
that you can unblock

738
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:14,559
as you're moving from on-prem

739
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:15,440
to

740
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,240
uh

741
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,000
in the cloud so

742
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,440
think about those kinds of things and

743
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,600
i'll pass it over to nando to

744
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,559
take us a little further

745
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:27,360
yeah absolutely so you know

746
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:30,000
everything dave is talking about is is

747
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,279
truly spot on in things that um you know

748
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:35,200
we kind of deal with on a daily basis if

749
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:38,000
you will so you know due to those things

750
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,159
well the need for incident response is

751
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:42,640
certainly vital it isn't truly a matter

752
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:45,679
of if it's really a matter of when so

753
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:47,520
like this pitcher it's understood that

754
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,679
some things just happen right and

755
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:51,919
sometimes we can see it coming

756
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:54,000
and at that point we become reactive in

757
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,039
nature and where we don't like to become

758
00:27:57,039 --> 00:27:59,760
reactive in nature if you will or try to

759
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:02,880
to limit that well in that case we we

760
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,279
try to put together a plan and sometimes

761
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:08,399
that plan doesn't go as desired

762
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:11,200
and we still just have to react in

763
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:14,159
either situation or really case it truly

764
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:15,679
highlights and really strengthens the

765
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:18,159
need for incident response this is more

766
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:19,919
true of the digital environment

767
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:22,000
especially when we think about how we do

768
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,480
it on-prem and even more so as we look

769
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:27,039
at the significant shift to

770
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:29,600
cloud infrastructure so what is this

771
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,679
whole incident response

772
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:34,000
well when i look at the

773
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,399
how when i look at how three well-known

774
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:39,440
organizations define incident response

775
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,919
they all are truly saying something

776
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:44,720
different in terms of words specifically

777
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:45,919
on the screen

778
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:48,480
but they're all truly saying the same

779
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,880
thing at the core right one would call

780
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,520
incident response the act of maybe

781
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,919
responding to something to be able to

782
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:59,120
contain a threat if you will

783
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,440
minimize an impact and certainly bring

784
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,880
an organization

785
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:03,840
back to

786
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,200
steady state

787
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,600
and the way we get after that is truly

788
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:10,720
we have some type of framework or a

789
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,480
subset of phases

790
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,080
and generally when we think about

791
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,559
incident response phases well

792
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:18,480
what comes to mind is nist right

793
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,919
national institute of standard

794
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:21,760
technology or

795
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,240
sans right sysadmin audit network

796
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,840
security most people don't think about

797
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:28,240
it from that perspective but

798
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,600
while it looks like they're two

799
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:32,080
different things and they truly are or

800
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:34,480
really that the phases are different um

801
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,960
they're largely the same right so the

802
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:39,919
nist one obviously is four steps where

803
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:43,279
sans is is six steps but from the

804
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:46,559
perspective of where they they nest

805
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:49,760
together uh we kind of see it like like

806
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:52,240
that right so from a prep perspective

807
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,480
we're thinking about training and

808
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:57,600
exercises and playbooks and you know how

809
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,240
are we going to communicate with people

810
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:03,200
in band and out of band if you will from

811
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,760
from an identification standpoint um you

812
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,919
know we're thinking about being able to

813
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:10,720
identify malicious activity or really

814
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,880
anomalies and being able to look for

815
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:16,240
indicators or maybe behavior based of

816
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:19,279
things we're looking at our perimeter

817
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:21,919
and inside the perimeter or in the case

818
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:24,480
of cloud we're looking at identities and

819
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,919
how they typically

820
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:27,279
um

821
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:28,640
flow or

822
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,360
or

823
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,440
authenticate within the network and what

824
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:34,159
they're truly used for

825
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:36,000
now when we get to the point of actually

826
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,840
identifying that something has actually

827
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,600
happened well then we certainly need to

828
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:42,320
be able to contain it limit its ability

829
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,559
to really go further beyond what it's

830
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:47,600
already uh done and gone in some cases

831
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:51,520
that's you know affecting acls or nsg

832
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:54,320
within our cloud environment being able

833
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,200
to

834
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:58,640
really uh prevent an attacker and actor

835
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,240
from being able to leverage what they've

836
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:02,720
been leveraging thus far

837
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,880
then you kind of want to look to to

838
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,559
eradicate them right right so

839
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:09,360
essentially phase out uh the attacker

840
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:12,399
activities and their ability to

841
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:13,360
certainly

842
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:14,720
come back

843
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,799
this could be

844
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:20,000
maybe applying some different firewalls

845
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
fixing the misconfigurations that that

846
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
dave has highlighted that are generally

847
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
set within our cloud environment and

848
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,840
it's substantial of other things the

849
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,600
recovery aspect well kind of

850
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,120
straightforward there we're trying to

851
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:33,760
bring uh our systems um certainly back

852
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:36,720
online monitor them for a period of time

853
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,760
uh in a phased approach uh to make sure

854
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:43,360
we've truly uh rid the adversary of uh

855
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,960
of their actions and really what they've

856
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:47,039
done within our network and the lessons

857
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:48,399
learned aspect this is where some of

858
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:50,320
that infrastructure is code that dave

859
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,880
talked about um can help us in a sense

860
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,640
of hey let's incorporate that in our

861
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,799
playbook but certainly from the

862
00:31:56,799 --> 00:31:59,440
perspective of of recovery we'd be able

863
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,039
to utilize some of that infrastructure

864
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:04,159
as code now that's a lot right

865
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:06,159
but from this perspective we really want

866
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:08,640
to focus on kind of three things as far

867
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:11,120
as what would be a benefit to you that's

868
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:13,120
the identification aspect containment

869
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,760
eradication right detection analysis if

870
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,120
you will if you're looking from this

871
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:20,559
perspective at large the methodology of

872
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:24,000
how to do it on prem um in the cloud in

873
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,799
some respect is laid out right what what

874
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:29,120
should be done kind of at each step or

875
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:32,080
what the focus area should be is is

876
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:34,559
somewhat fleshed out historically though

877
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:37,279
uh when we look at incident response on

878
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:40,399
premises like on-prem systems um

879
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:42,399
naturally people understood that better

880
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:45,120
because we've had years an essential and

881
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:47,279
substantial amount of time to really

882
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:50,320
perfect that the cloud aspect is where

883
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,799
it really gets a little gray for people

884
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:55,440
right as dave talked about having that

885
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,600
that firewall that mode right people

886
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,200
tend to cut themselves off from the

887
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:02,240
internet if you will um at some point to

888
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,320
then remediate it that's a little bit

889
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,240
different when we think about um doing

890
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:08,720
this from a cloud perspective

891
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:11,200
so as we look at some of these tools and

892
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,200
capabilities and things to really help

893
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,360
you uh this is a good opportun

894
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:18,080
opportunity for us to really share our

895
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,799
disclaimer right so for some people this

896
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:23,120
will be tldr

897
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:25,200
i.e too long

898
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:29,440
didn't read or it might be tscr which is

899
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:32,000
too small couldn't read so let me give

900
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,840
you kind of the cliff notes if you will

901
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,440
associated with this

902
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,120
we're not saying that the tools that

903
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:38,720
we'll talk about are the only

904
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:41,440
capabilities that are available for

905
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:44,640
cloud analysis detection response but

906
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:47,120
we're certainly highlighting a couple of

907
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:50,000
things that could be of use to you

908
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,600
if you're a manager or really a an

909
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:56,799
engineer a responsible entity

910
00:33:56,799 --> 00:33:59,919
security guy responsible person for a

911
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:03,559
cloud environment

912
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:07,919
all right so i'm sorry about that i was

913
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:11,040
having a fight with the mute button

914
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,560
all right so one of these tools we'll

915
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,320
talk about is

916
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:17,280
azure specific but it can reach across

917
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,040
different clouds so if you have assets

918
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:21,918
in well even on-prem if you have assets

919
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:23,040
on-prem

920
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:25,599
in azure other clouds

921
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:29,040
uh defender for cloud is a security

922
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:31,119
posture management threat protection

923
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:32,800
product

924
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,679
that you can use to maintain

925
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:37,679
a high level of security once you have

926
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:38,960
assets

927
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,800
kind of all over the place

928
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,440
so defender for cloud will

929
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:46,320
use azure security benchmarks to

930
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,639
look at a subset of assets

931
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:51,199
uh and give you

932
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:53,280
secure score

933
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,040
and it'll also give you remediation

934
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:57,280
activities that you can take on

935
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,839
uh assets to improve your secure score

936
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:02,320
so as an example

937
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,560
we talked about storage accounts are

938
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:07,680
commonly misconfigured in in azure

939
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,680
defender for cloud may look at your

940
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,280
storage account and see that public

941
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,800
access

942
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,480
is still enabled for your storage

943
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,440
account

944
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:16,400
it'll

945
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,960
surface that in defender for cloud

946
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:22,240
and give you the remediation activities

947
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,320
to quickly remedy that

948
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,920
so just one of the tools that you can

949
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,599
use

950
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:29,040
in azure to

951
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,640
to get at some of this stuff before it

952
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:34,640
becomes a huge problem down the road

953
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:41,200
yeah so you know that's very interesting

954
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,040
specifically when we look at some of the

955
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,880
other things that we can do

956
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,160
and one of those other things that we

957
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:48,560
can do are honey tokens right so from an

958
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,880
identification standpoint the use of

959
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:53,440
them is certainly great when we think of

960
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:55,119
honey tokens

961
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:57,520
it's really referred to as canary token

962
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:59,200
if you will because they are like a

963
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,119
canary in a coal mine but really in

964
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:02,640
reverse

965
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,400
but this can be a piece of information

966
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:07,119
that allows you to implant a trap in a

967
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:08,000
system

968
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,280
this could be a file could be a fake

969
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,760
system itself could be a fake user

970
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:16,160
service account right it's really just

971
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:19,040
something that certainly is enticing so

972
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:21,760
that being said we want to make sure

973
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:22,720
that

974
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:25,599
it is enticing to an attacker because if

975
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:27,520
not then well it's not going to really

976
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:30,160
be of use to you we want the attacker to

977
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:31,119
find it

978
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:33,359
certainly worthwhile we want them to not

979
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:35,599
only find it but trigger the use of

980
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:38,000
accessing uh that token

981
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,320
whatever it is it should be certainly

982
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,640
highly uh monitored to be able to

983
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:45,520
illuminate potential adversary activity

984
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:48,880
if the use of the token goes unnoticed

985
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:51,760
well then it certainly starts to defeat

986
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:54,960
uh the purpose right and if these tokens

987
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:58,240
um have some form of value and they get

988
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,680
compromised and we're not able to

989
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:01,599
illuminate that well then it could

990
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:04,160
certainly be a bad day

991
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,760
for us

992
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,599
now when we look at different

993
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:10,320
capabilities right we'll talk about four

994
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,240
specifically uh that's going to be

995
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:15,760
mandiant's eight azure ad investigator

996
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:20,320
uh invoke az explorer hawk and sparrow

997
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,119
so

998
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:23,520
what are these things well the mandiant

999
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:26,960
tool capability is really uh used to

1000
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:30,480
detect possible unk 2452 activity and if

1001
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:33,040
you're not familiar with punk 2452

1002
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:35,520
that's a a cluster of activity that from

1003
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:39,599
many a perspective we have linked to um

1004
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:42,880
russian actors if you will um and namely

1005
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,800
this kind of came about when we looked

1006
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:45,520
at

1007
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:48,079
solar winds right so that was solarwinds

1008
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:49,440
moving on to

1009
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,880
cloud infrastructure and that's where

1010
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:53,119
really where they came about so there's

1011
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:55,599
a lot of indicators that are in there a

1012
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:57,520
lot of which are a high fidelity meaning

1013
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:58,960
when you see

1014
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:01,040
them being triggered um there's some

1015
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:03,760
high likelihood that it is associated uh

1016
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,680
likely with this group there are also

1017
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,440
some indicators that are in there that

1018
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:10,000
are dual use in nature so from that

1019
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,200
perspective

1020
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,520
if you see them being used it could be

1021
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:16,079
adversary activity but it also could be

1022
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:18,560
related to legitimate functionality from

1023
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:21,599
an admin or some user right so those

1024
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:23,760
don't give you such a high fidelity but

1025
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:27,119
certainly or worthwhile looking into

1026
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:30,000
every capability that's inherent in this

1027
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,960
tool does a best effort job if you will

1028
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,839
at identifying indicators of compromise

1029
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:37,839
that will certainly require further

1030
00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:40,560
verification and analysis now

1031
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,880
with that what it will not do is

1032
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:46,240
certainly identify 100 of the time um

1033
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,920
you know malicious activity in your

1034
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,040
environment

1035
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:51,200
nor will it always tell you if an

1036
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:54,400
artifact is legitimate admin activity or

1037
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,640
a threat act or activity so it does

1038
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:59,200
require some human interaction some

1039
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:01,200
analysis from your perspective but it

1040
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,599
will do a good job of highlighting some

1041
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:05,280
of the things that it brings to light

1042
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,760
for you well signing certificates with

1043
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:11,359
an unusual validity period specifically

1044
00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:14,640
if the certificate has a time frame

1045
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:17,200
associated with it longer than a year

1046
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:19,200
that may be certainly worth

1047
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,560
looking into

1048
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:23,119
signing certificate mismatches right so

1049
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:25,040
when we think about federated domains

1050
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,960
where the issuer the subject of the

1051
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,960
signing certificate does not match that

1052
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,800
may be certainly worth looking into as

1053
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:34,400
well uh azure ad backdoors right

1054
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,760
thinking about it from a federated

1055
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:39,040
domain perspective as well um a list of

1056
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:41,599
federated domains maybe you're not fully

1057
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:42,800
aware of

1058
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,480
domains that are federated within your

1059
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:47,280
environment or that have a communication

1060
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:50,079
with such and then unverified domains

1061
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:51,839
right so all of these things are

1062
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:54,000
certainly worthwhile for for you to

1063
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,160
consider and look at and really this

1064
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,240
tool helps to

1065
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:00,400
bring the focus area to a number of

1066
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,720
things that are a time well spent should

1067
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:03,440
you

1068
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,880
look at

1069
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:07,040
invoke a z explorer well this is a

1070
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,880
capability that i ended up writing

1071
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:11,040
during the whole time of solo wins as

1072
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:13,440
well so this is going to retrieve vital

1073
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:16,000
information that would be useful to you

1074
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,160
during an intrusion it's written

1075
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:21,520
specifically for azure and o365

1076
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:23,200
environments and some of the information

1077
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:25,760
that it retrieves for you are things

1078
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:29,440
about the domain the users the groups

1079
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:32,319
saml tokens applications and the

1080
00:40:32,319 --> 00:40:34,160
permissions associated with those

1081
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:37,359
applications like the previous tool it's

1082
00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:40,240
not going to fully give you 100 saying

1083
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:43,599
this is bad but it will

1084
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:46,240
provide you with a subset of data that

1085
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:48,000
is certainly worth your time to do

1086
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,640
analysis on that could very well be

1087
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:53,760
interesting in nature

1088
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,599
the next tool hawk

1089
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:58,319
it provides limited analysis on

1090
00:40:58,319 --> 00:41:00,319
gathered data

1091
00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:01,920
it's really there to help you get all

1092
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:04,720
the data in a single place it is by no

1093
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:06,880
way form a fashion designed to make any

1094
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:09,280
significant conclusions about the data

1095
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:11,520
that it gets for you

1096
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,839
from their perspective it's impossible

1097
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:15,359
to know everything about your

1098
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:17,119
environment to know what you should be

1099
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:19,359
concerned with or not be concerned with

1100
00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:21,359
to then further on make a legitimate

1101
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:24,079
analysis or best guess about the data

1102
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:26,400
that seems to be a common theme here is

1103
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,880
as we move forward right uh hawke's goal

1104
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:30,319
is certainly to

1105
00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:32,240
quickly get you the data that you need

1106
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,640
to be able to to draw your conclusion

1107
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:37,359
and not make the conclusion for you so

1108
00:41:37,359 --> 00:41:38,319
again

1109
00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:40,160
everybody's environment is certainly

1110
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:41,760
different but

1111
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:44,079
being able to get the relevant data in

1112
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:47,280
one place in a good pane of glass that

1113
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:49,920
you an analyst or somebody can make

1114
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:53,200
sense of very quickly is key and that's

1115
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:56,240
what this tool like other two um do for

1116
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:57,599
you

1117
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:00,000
sparrow well it's yet another powershell

1118
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,920
script that looks for anomalies and

1119
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:05,040
unusual activity by verifying unified

1120
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:08,640
azure and 365 audit logs looking for a

1121
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:11,040
known list of indicators of compromise

1122
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:14,079
it lists azure ad domains and checks

1123
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:16,400
azure service principles and their

1124
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:19,440
microsoft graph api permissions why

1125
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:21,520
because this has been something that has

1126
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:24,000
um certainly been of interest to

1127
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,079
malicious actors in the past and

1128
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:28,240
certainly tactics techniques that they

1129
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:29,920
look to abuse

1130
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:32,319
even today as they have done in the past

1131
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:33,920
and likely will continue to do it in the

1132
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:36,400
future as well this tool is intended for

1133
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:39,839
use by incident responders and was truly

1134
00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:42,319
built by the cloud forensics team at

1135
00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:44,800
sizza their focus is really to help

1136
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:47,280
narrow the scope of user and application

1137
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:50,400
activity as it uh pertains to identity

1138
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,960
and authentication based attacks that

1139
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:55,440
has been recently uh seen in multiple

1140
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:57,920
sectors so yet another tool

1141
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:00,400
that was derived based upon first-hand

1142
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:02,720
accounts uh in the field and what

1143
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:04,880
they're seeing it's not made to be a

1144
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:07,520
comprehensive or exhaustive list of

1145
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:10,319
available data right because again going

1146
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:12,319
back to every environment is different

1147
00:43:12,319 --> 00:43:14,640
but it is certainly intended to narrow a

1148
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:18,319
larger set of data sets um to help you

1149
00:43:18,319 --> 00:43:20,960
in your investigation and your analysis

1150
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:24,079
and really help with the um scalability

1151
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:25,839
and really i'm sorry not really

1152
00:43:25,839 --> 00:43:28,480
scalability up but narrowing of the

1153
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:30,640
telemetry associated with what's

1154
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:34,160
happening in your environment

1155
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:37,599
so you know when we look at an analysis

1156
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:41,520
process right at a very very high level

1157
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:44,480
um if you're in your environment and you

1158
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:46,960
know you may not fully understand what

1159
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:49,520
license you have and and what that

1160
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:51,920
enables and affords you to have access

1161
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:55,200
to well you can utilize the azure cli as

1162
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:59,119
dave mentioned earlier and you can um

1163
00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:01,040
you know well actually powershell in

1164
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:04,000
this case apologies and actually do get

1165
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:04,960
a z

1166
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:07,680
resource and that'll tell you everything

1167
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:09,359
from a resource perspective that's

1168
00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:11,359
available to you within uh your

1169
00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:13,440
subscription if you're looking at some

1170
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:15,760
hunting queries or reconnaissance

1171
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:18,400
queries there's a good list that are

1172
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:21,359
already made and developed for azure

1173
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:24,000
and then there's some for m365 certainly

1174
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,680
appreciate microsoft's uh help with the

1175
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:29,280
m365 perspective is it an

1176
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:31,599
all-incompetent list probably probably

1177
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:33,520
not right depends on your environment

1178
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:36,079
but it is certainly a good starting

1179
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:39,680
point for you to look at common things

1180
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:43,200
that could be abused or accessed by

1181
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:45,920
attackers and then build upon them based

1182
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:48,319
upon your network and the way things are

1183
00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:49,520
set up

1184
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:52,160
if you're already comfortable with doing

1185
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:55,200
analysis from an on-prem perspective in

1186
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:58,560
terms of dead box analysis well you

1187
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:02,160
could be able um to export uh you know

1188
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:05,200
the disc or the vm associated with

1189
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:08,400
whatever you have in the cloud so

1190
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:11,040
within our our infrastructure we'd be

1191
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:14,319
able to go all services compute disk

1192
00:45:14,319 --> 00:45:15,119
disk

1193
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:17,280
export if we want to be able to export a

1194
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:19,359
disk we'd select which one we're

1195
00:45:19,359 --> 00:45:20,880
concerned with and if we're talking

1196
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:23,839
about virtual machines we can do nearly

1197
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:25,839
the same thing in that aspect and then

1198
00:45:25,839 --> 00:45:28,640
once we have that we can utilize things

1199
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:30,960
that maybe we're comfortable with maybe

1200
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:34,560
ftk or in case or autopsy right or

1201
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:37,200
x-waves or something like that but that

1202
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:40,000
leads you to leads you back to a a

1203
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,160
familiar state if you're used to doing

1204
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:45,520
it from an on-prem perspective

1205
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:48,720
okay so looking at a a scenario of sorts

1206
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:50,400
let's say you want to look at

1207
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:53,599
investigating specific activity uh

1208
00:45:53,599 --> 00:45:56,800
within azure right so in this case the

1209
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:58,880
main source would be

1210
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:01,760
activity logs and we would utilize the

1211
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:05,119
azure cli from that perspective we would

1212
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:07,680
list uh any uh

1213
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:09,760
events that would be available to us to

1214
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:12,319
actually query right and i've listed the

1215
00:46:12,319 --> 00:46:13,839
command that we could use so that way

1216
00:46:13,839 --> 00:46:15,839
you walk away with something

1217
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:19,520
and then if we have an idea as to what

1218
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:22,160
user it was we could then utilize a

1219
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:24,640
query to look at events associated with

1220
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:26,720
the particular user

1221
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:29,520
from there we might say hey well this ip

1222
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:31,680
address is interesting

1223
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:33,760
where else does it appear in here where

1224
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:35,839
are the events that are

1225
00:46:35,839 --> 00:46:37,920
incorporate that ip address well we

1226
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:39,760
would then be able to query specifically

1227
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:42,720
for that if we're interested about the

1228
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:46,720
last 500 10 events five whatever number

1229
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:49,040
of events within the last hour well we

1230
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:51,440
could query and return that as well and

1231
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:53,119
if we're worried about events that

1232
00:46:53,119 --> 00:46:56,000
happen last week the week before or on a

1233
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
particular date so long as the retention

1234
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,319
period has not passed uh well we could

1235
00:47:00,319 --> 00:47:02,480
do that as well so from this perspective

1236
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:04,480
i'm looking at events that took place on

1237
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:06,000
november 12th

1238
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
and subsequently the

1239
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,839
three days that followed that so

1240
00:47:09,839 --> 00:47:13,520
november 12th to uh november 15th but

1241
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:17,280
again not all incompetent but certainly

1242
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:20,400
uh an available capability at a raw

1243
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:23,119
perspective to be able to get the data

1244
00:47:23,119 --> 00:47:24,960
that you need right the way that you

1245
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:26,559
would look at this and frame it from an

1246
00:47:26,559 --> 00:47:28,880
on-prem perspective you're still focused

1247
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:30,720
on a user in this case we're focused on

1248
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:32,960
an identity we're still focused on a

1249
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:34,400
time frame when we're looking at stuff

1250
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:36,640
on prem well this is how we can look to

1251
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:40,720
do that from a cloud perspective

1252
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:42,960
all right so

1253
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:44,720
you know there's not enough time for us

1254
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:48,319
to talk about cloud you know

1255
00:47:48,319 --> 00:47:51,280
at large in a uh one hour talk if you

1256
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:53,760
will but here's some easy reading some

1257
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:55,520
tangibles that you can take away with

1258
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:57,839
you aside from the the couple of tools

1259
00:47:57,839 --> 00:47:59,680
that we just mentioned in capabilities

1260
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:02,800
some easy reading if you will so maybe

1261
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:04,720
it produces the white paper will do it

1262
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:08,720
pretty periodically in terms of um

1263
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:11,200
in a technical nature really more of a

1264
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:13,520
tactical guide talking about remediation

1265
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:16,160
and hardening strategies for m365

1266
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:18,319
specifically how do you defend against

1267
00:48:18,319 --> 00:48:21,599
uh that 2452 that i talked about earlier

1268
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:25,200
who again is still very active uh today

1269
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:26,800
this is talking about

1270
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:29,440
some attack techniques right to be able

1271
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:32,160
to then help you understand what they're

1272
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:34,160
leveraging but then some things that you

1273
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:35,359
could do

1274
00:48:35,359 --> 00:48:37,920
to kind of deflect that to mitigate that

1275
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:39,040
if you will

1276
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:41,359
our friends at microsoft well be it that

1277
00:48:41,359 --> 00:48:43,200
it's their technology that we're talking

1278
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:46,079
about today they also produce a very

1279
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:49,200
robust report that is certainly easy on

1280
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:51,760
the eyes and brain to read

1281
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:54,240
talking about cyber crime at large in

1282
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:56,000
their tech

1283
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,640
and focusing on and talking about cloud

1284
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:01,280
and how it's being abused in that manner

1285
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:04,160
that also is done periodically as well

1286
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:06,960
and certainly worth the read so you have

1287
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:09,680
an entity that builds the tech and is

1288
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:10,720
certainly

1289
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:12,400
stepped up to the plate in terms of

1290
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:14,480
defending it and then you have something

1291
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:17,280
from an organization that certainly is

1292
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:20,319
also on the front lines of uh defending

1293
00:49:20,319 --> 00:49:21,520
illuminating

1294
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:23,680
doing analysis against this tech on a

1295
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:25,040
daily basis

1296
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:26,160
so

1297
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:28,000
great assets and great things to walk

1298
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:31,240
away with

1299
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:33,440
so what can you do

1300
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:36,240
today to to put some uh

1301
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:37,599
those speed bumps we talked about

1302
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:38,880
earlier

1303
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:41,599
in place so maybe we can

1304
00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:43,520
mitigate some of this before we get to

1305
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:45,680
the incident response phase

1306
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:47,119
now these are things that we talk about

1307
00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:49,839
the customers on a regular basis all day

1308
00:49:49,839 --> 00:49:51,040
every day

1309
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:52,000
uh

1310
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,079
first one there now these are not in any

1311
00:49:54,079 --> 00:49:56,240
kind of certain order

1312
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:58,079
obviously each organization would have

1313
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:00,640
to prioritize these based on

1314
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:03,440
a myriad of things time money knowledge

1315
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:04,640
base of

1316
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:06,240
you know the people that work there all

1317
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:07,680
those things

1318
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:09,280
uh

1319
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:10,800
but use of a privileged access

1320
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:12,240
workstation if you don't know what that

1321
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:12,960
is

1322
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:15,599
there are free documents out there

1323
00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:17,040
that will basically walk you through how

1324
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:19,280
to stand one up but essentially

1325
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:22,000
if your administrators are doing any

1326
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:25,440
type of privilege access on

1327
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:28,240
on-prem assets or cloud assets

1328
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:30,160
doesn't really matter

1329
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:31,520
they need to be doing it from a clean

1330
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:34,800
keyboard to prevent uh cash credentials

1331
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:35,760
and

1332
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:38,000
uh

1333
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:39,599
credential theft and those kinds of

1334
00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:41,520
things

1335
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:44,160
next one multi-factor authentication

1336
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:46,559
uh you've all probably heard of that

1337
00:50:46,559 --> 00:50:48,240
it's just one of those things you need

1338
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:49,040
to

1339
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:51,680
enable at the very very least on your

1340
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:54,400
administrator accounts but

1341
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:58,160
if at all possible on all accounts

1342
00:50:58,160 --> 00:50:59,680
exclude that break glass account

1343
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:01,040
otherwise

1344
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:02,800
you won't get into

1345
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:05,599
your cloud assets if mfa is

1346
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:08,160
not functioning properly

1347
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:09,760
conditional access this is one of those

1348
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:11,760
things that cloud

1349
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:15,119
gives you the capability to do so

1350
00:51:15,119 --> 00:51:17,599
use it to the fullest

1351
00:51:17,599 --> 00:51:19,760
capability you can

1352
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:21,040
gives you the

1353
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:24,559
the possibilities of restricting

1354
00:51:24,559 --> 00:51:27,520
uh logins from

1355
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:30,079
you know certain versions of android or

1356
00:51:30,079 --> 00:51:31,920
if they come from

1357
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:34,000
certain regions of the world

1358
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,520
all those kinds of things there's so

1359
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:36,720
many things that you can do with

1360
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:38,160
conditional access

1361
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:40,240
take advantage of it

1362
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:42,480
just in time access

1363
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:45,040
you want to eliminate as many

1364
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:46,480
standing

1365
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:50,079
privilege accounts in domain admins and

1366
00:51:50,079 --> 00:51:51,839
global admins and

1367
00:51:51,839 --> 00:51:53,680
and all those privileged groups that you

1368
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:55,359
can use

1369
00:51:55,359 --> 00:51:57,599
uh privilege identity management or some

1370
00:51:57,599 --> 00:51:59,200
other tool there are plenty of tools out

1371
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:01,359
there that do this

1372
00:52:01,359 --> 00:52:02,400
that will

1373
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:04,880
allow you to do just-in-time privilege

1374
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:06,160
access

1375
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:08,480
in your organization

1376
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:10,800
be careful if you have a hybrid

1377
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:12,640
environment again a lot of organizations

1378
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:14,400
are going to be in some form some type

1379
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:16,000
of hybrid

1380
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,720
mode for probably a long long time

1381
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:21,119
careful what you're syncing from

1382
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:23,200
any type of on-prem

1383
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:25,920
directory to the cloud

1384
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:27,520
you don't want to sync any type of

1385
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:29,200
privileged user from

1386
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:31,440
the on-prem to

1387
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:34,480
uh the cloud that just opens up pivot

1388
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:35,520
points for

1389
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:38,640
uh thread actors

1390
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:40,960
some more

1391
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:44,400
kind of o365 or m365

1392
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:46,559
uh specific

1393
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:49,119
if someone is doing a content search

1394
00:52:49,119 --> 00:52:52,240
outside of administrators it's probably

1395
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:54,880
uh someone that is

1396
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:56,800
not wishing you

1397
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:58,960
well so let's

1398
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:01,760
configure some type of alert activity on

1399
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:02,880
that

1400
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:04,960
that's number one there

1401
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:06,720
again we talked about

1402
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:08,880
the ingress points

1403
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:10,319
identity

1404
00:53:10,319 --> 00:53:11,200
uh

1405
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:13,359
is essentially your perimeter

1406
00:53:13,359 --> 00:53:15,520
today

1407
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:18,880
who has the identities that's your users

1408
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:20,400
what is their primary means of

1409
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:23,359
communication today email

1410
00:53:23,359 --> 00:53:24,240
so

1411
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:27,359
turn on all the end of malware spam

1412
00:53:27,359 --> 00:53:28,960
transport controls

1413
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:30,880
all that stuff that you can do to to

1414
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:32,000
mitigate

1415
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,200
all the

1416
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:34,319
the normal

1417
00:53:34,319 --> 00:53:37,359
email you know ingress points

1418
00:53:37,359 --> 00:53:38,559
um

1419
00:53:38,559 --> 00:53:40,480
disable

1420
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:42,079
any kind of storage provider you don't

1421
00:53:42,079 --> 00:53:43,280
need for

1422
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:45,680
owa so if you don't need anything

1423
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:48,400
additional onedrive or box or

1424
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:50,720
dropbox or whatever disable the rest of

1425
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:52,240
them

1426
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:55,119
auditing i think it goes without saying

1427
00:53:55,119 --> 00:53:57,119
enable all the auditing you can

1428
00:53:57,119 --> 00:53:58,400
obviously

1429
00:53:58,400 --> 00:53:59,359
um

1430
00:53:59,359 --> 00:54:01,280
auditing is no good unless you can

1431
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:03,280
synthesize it and make sense of it and

1432
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:04,240
actually

1433
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:05,839
action it when

1434
00:54:05,839 --> 00:54:07,200
you know something pops up in the

1435
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:09,680
auditing so it doesn't really do a whole

1436
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:11,359
lot of good if you're enabling it and

1437
00:54:11,359 --> 00:54:14,480
nobody's you know making sense of it

1438
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:16,319
but generally speaking

1439
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:17,680
more auditing

1440
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:20,558
equals more better

1441
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:23,280
so some of the things that you can uh

1442
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:25,359
some resources here that you can use to

1443
00:54:25,359 --> 00:54:27,319
uh skill up

1444
00:54:27,319 --> 00:54:29,119
learn.microsoft.com has all kinds of

1445
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:31,359
free resources that you can

1446
00:54:31,359 --> 00:54:35,599
use to train up on really any of our

1447
00:54:35,599 --> 00:54:36,880
technology

1448
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:38,799
a lot of it that requires it gives you

1449
00:54:38,799 --> 00:54:41,040
access to free sandbox tennis so there's

1450
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:43,680
really no barrier entry as far as

1451
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:45,680
any kind of

1452
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:47,839
microsoft technology goes

1453
00:54:47,839 --> 00:54:49,599
uh if you're not familiar with john

1454
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:51,599
savile he does

1455
00:54:51,599 --> 00:54:54,559
hours and hours and hours of free

1456
00:54:54,559 --> 00:54:56,960
content on youtube related to

1457
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:59,760
automation and powershell and security

1458
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:04,319
and azure and all kinds of other things

1459
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:06,559
a cloud guru is a

1460
00:55:06,559 --> 00:55:08,240
uh online training

1461
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:10,799
platform similar to like uh pluralsight

1462
00:55:10,799 --> 00:55:13,200
or others and there are plenty of others

1463
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:14,400
but there are

1464
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:16,720
a multitude of resources out there

1465
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:19,200
uh and if you can't find one you know

1466
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:20,960
our slide with all of our contact

1467
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:23,119
information is coming up feel free to

1468
00:55:23,119 --> 00:55:26,000
to reach out to myself or hernando and

1469
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,400
we'll do what we can to to hook you up

1470
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:31,760
with some sort of resource

1471
00:55:32,839 --> 00:55:36,160
so kind of synthesizing everything we we

1472
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:37,839
talked about here

1473
00:55:37,839 --> 00:55:38,720
um

1474
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:39,760
again

1475
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:41,520
the cloud is no

1476
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:43,280
silver bullet to

1477
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:45,280
securing your assets

1478
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:47,680
uh it's no magic elixir

1479
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:50,160
anything that you're doing on-prem from

1480
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:53,200
a security perspective you should

1481
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:56,480
definitely carry that forward

1482
00:55:56,640 --> 00:56:00,839
as far as policies and procedures go

1483
00:56:00,839 --> 00:56:04,079
um some defense tactics on-prem are

1484
00:56:04,079 --> 00:56:07,040
gonna just differ in the cloud because

1485
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:08,880
the the threat landscape is a little

1486
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:10,160
different

1487
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:11,760
uh and we talked about some of that

1488
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:13,760
stuff

1489
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:15,920
i just talked about logging enable all

1490
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:18,160
of that stuff through all

1491
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:20,720
your cloud assets um

1492
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:22,640
obviously if you can't synthesize it it

1493
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:23,920
doesn't really make a whole lot of sense

1494
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:26,400
but you have to take into account all of

1495
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:28,559
those cloud assets uh in addition to

1496
00:56:28,559 --> 00:56:30,559
your on-prem stuff

1497
00:56:30,559 --> 00:56:32,720
restrict those privilege accounts

1498
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:34,240
include

1499
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:36,480
all of those privileged accounts that

1500
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:37,520
are in

1501
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:38,720
your

1502
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:41,760
cloud directory as well

1503
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:44,160
global admins and security admins and

1504
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:45,599
all those

1505
00:56:45,599 --> 00:56:47,680
and utilize all those tools honey tokens

1506
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:48,480
and

1507
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:51,040
and all of those

1508
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:52,880
those tools that we talked about

1509
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:54,640
everything at your disposal

1510
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:56,640
and utilize what you can

1511
00:56:56,640 --> 00:56:59,119
because it's not going to get any easier

1512
00:56:59,119 --> 00:57:00,559
um

1513
00:57:00,559 --> 00:57:02,960
and utilize your network like things

1514
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:05,040
like this today

1515
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:07,280
you can use to grow your network and and

1516
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:09,520
feel free to reach out to

1517
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:12,000
to your peers and people like me you

1518
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,440
know reach out to me if you have

1519
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:15,760
questions that maybe i can answer

1520
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:17,760
you know like i alluded to earlier i'm

1521
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:19,680
not the smartest guy but i know people

1522
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:21,359

00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:54,720
an array of languages and it does us no

1539
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:56,400
good to keep them all bottled up to

1540
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:58,720
ourselves so where we can

1541
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:00,720
get them outside of our employer we like

1542
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:02,720

the buffer inside our head is also small

1546
00:58:08,799 --> 00:58:10,880
so we need to be able to write stuff

1547
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:13,520
down that being said we each have a blog

1548
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:15,839
and that's where we like to put our our

1549
00:58:15,839 --> 00:58:17,520
thoughts to paper if you will things

1550
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:19,680
that we can't contain inside

1551
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:21,920
