1
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,200

2
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:10,559
okay

3
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:12,559
so here's another talk but we're going

4
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:14,400
to talk about privacy not so much

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,000
security and we're going to explain the

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,400
relationship between that and

7
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,080
yeah so

8
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,320
buckle up hopefully it's fun

9
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,279
um

10
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:24,320
kind of the

11
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,359
very loosely held together agenda but

12
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,160
going to talk about privacy kind of some

13
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,079
concerns current state things like that

14
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:33,680
state of affairs and talk about the

15
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,600
privacy scale something i made up and

16
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,440
it's not patent pending so go ahead and

17
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,160
steal it or you know maybe you can do an

18
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,280
ntf of it i don't care whatever

19
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,399
and other stuff

20
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,320
so a little bit about me

21
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,719
um i reused this slide i was being super

22
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:50,640
private when i first gave this but

23
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,440
colin jackson i go by didymus

24

security engineer i have hobbies i i've

25
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,199
also

26
00:00:57,199 --> 00:00:58,640
wanted to get

27
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,520
more privacy enthusiast type

28
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,440
i'm not there yet maybe someday but i'm

29
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,280
giving a talk without a mask on so i get

30
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,760
what i get anyway

31
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:08,880
cool

32
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:09,760
all right

33
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,840
um a lot of the material i took to put

34
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,200
this slide together a lot of it was

35
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,920
based on u.s laws we're all in this room

36
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,280
currently in the u.s

37
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,479
but so it's going to be kind of geared

38
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:20,960
towards that but you can apply it to

39
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,960
wherever you may be also i'm not a

40
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,600
lawyer i don't pretend to be one much

41
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,439
and i'm not an expert so these are my

42
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:29,600
opinions blah blah blah you get what you

43
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,360
paid for actually don't you get less

44
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,799
than that

45
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:34,320
and if you're looking for legal advice

46
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,840
you know blah blah disclaiming

47
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,240
disclaimer phase blah blah blah

48
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,799
okay here are some of my favorites

49
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:41,840

privacy centric and also keeps up to

67
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:23,440

it's good

69
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,840
all right so why privacy how many of you

70
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,000
had this question before like i've got

71
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,599
you know why should i care about privacy

72
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:33,120
i've got nothing to hide just just by

73
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,800
show of hands have you have you ever

74
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,239
thought that or do you have friends or

75
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,800
family who say that i got nothing to

76
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,360
yeah there you go friends or family

77
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,080
definitely a lot more hands um

78
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,120
this is a link to a

79
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,440
academic like paper explaining why i've

80
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,800
got nothing to hide is a horrible

81
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,640
argument i'm not going to click it

82
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,400
but it's by

83
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,440
daniel

84
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,360
solovey i think

85
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,800
yeah

86
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,080
but it's like you know i've got nothing

87
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,080
to hide i'm okay my life's an open book

88
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,159
i share stuff because i want to feel

89
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:06,720
connected and especially like 2020 where

90
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,319
everyone's at home a lot of it and it's

91
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:10,480
like i feel even less connected it's

92
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,200
like

93
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,120
so i want to post pictures of this or

94
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,640
you know different things like that and

95
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,560
it's like who would care about my

96
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,959
information my you know my life is

97
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:20,640
boring anyway you know

98
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,000
why why would you want to see pictures

99
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,519
of my kids you know on their first day

100
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:24,799
of kindergarten you know holding up

101
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:27,840
pictures and why would you want that so

102
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,440
some things to think about

103
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,680
okay and then privacy and security

104
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,959
they're different things some people say

105
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:34,640
they're the same they're not they're

106
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,319
definitely really good roommates and

107
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:37,519
when you have both of them you have

108
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:39,760
trust it's really great when you have

109
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:40,799
one of them

110
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:43,280
it's you know better than nothing but

111
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,080
it's important especially in workforce

112
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,599
you know securing our organizations and

113
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:49,120
stuff it's important to have both

114
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,239
because when you have privacy and

115
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:52,159
security you have trust

116
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:53,120
um

117
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,239
so yeah

118
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:56,080
so quick poll we're gonna kind of do

119
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,760
just a live poll or whatever

120
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,439
i'm just by raising your hands because

121
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,280
i'm not technical

122
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,080
so

123
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,080
who is concerned about tailored

124
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,519
advertising

125
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:07,360
all sudden you you know you google

126
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,720
search something and all sudden you

127
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,480
start getting ads for that something

128
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,840
it's like i didn't want that

129
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,439
data collection don't worry don't worry

130
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:17,279
we collect your data but we anonymize it

131
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,600
we replace your name with a guide

132
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,839
anyone concerned about that

133
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:24,080
you should be

134
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,320
cameras and microphones i mean

135
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,240
every laptop pretty much has a camera

136
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,960
and a microphone i'm staring at a camera

137
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,880
our phones have microphones on it and

138
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,960
cameras for forward and back face the

139
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,479
concerns right

140
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,000
you can rabble and stuff this is pretty

141
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,680
informal

142
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,400
facial recognition who loves this

143
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,919
especially like developments they're

144
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:46,080
making it yeah nice throwing the mask on

145
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,680
i love it

146
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,880
you know especially where they're like

147
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,320
trying to make facial recognition work

148
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,160
from just the bridge of the nose up

149
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,639
because everyone's wearing masks now

150
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:56,479
so these are things that concern me too

151
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:58,240
you know cell phone tracking and

152
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,000
location enabled apps

153
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,560
got this new calculator app it needs low

154
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,680
access to my location

155
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,639
why would anyway

156
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:10,080
exif data first of all who knows what

157
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,600
exif data is

158
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,120
who doesn't know what exif data is i

159
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,639
won't judge

160
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,880
okay exif data for those that don't know

161
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,639
it's data that's embedded within a

162
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:21,840
digital file often like photos videos

163
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,919
that it basically shows meta data you

164
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:25,360
know especially with photos you can

165
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,320
glean like you know exposure type f-stop

166
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,320
if they have geo if they have location

167
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,000
gps tracking when they took the picture

168
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,680
and you automatically do that it'll say

169
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,680
this picture was taken at this location

170
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,360
at this time

171
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,800
kind of glean that information so

172
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,680
imagine

173
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,280
i don't know next time you're bored go

174
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,800
go to a website or something and like

175
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,080
download the

176
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,600
download the picture and then throw it

177
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,039
into exif tool and just see what

178
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:48,320
information is there this is one of the

179
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,280
way that

180
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,880
you know criminal investigators as well

181
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,720
as nefarious people will try to track

182
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,400
people down by things they post and like

183
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,840
oh let's see where this picture was

184
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,840
taken oh they were here and

185
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,680
creepy right

186
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,880
my goal at the end of this is to make

187
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,199
you all more privacy and conscious and

188
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:05,360
paranoia is a good thing i guess we'll

189
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,960
see

190
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,880
third-party data sharing don't you love

191
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,160
it like when you get that terms and

192
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,240
conditions have been updated and we're

193
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,680
now going to share your party with

194
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,440
authorized third parties or your data

195
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,880
with third parties

196
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,479
i'm concerned about this third-party

197
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:20,560
data sharing

198
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,560
what about second party

199
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,160
what's that can anyone explain second

200
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,560
party

201
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,639
i i thought about this i was thinking

202
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:30,639
like okay first party that's obviously

203
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:33,039
me third-party data is like you know

204
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:35,039
professional like business relationship

205
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:36,880
or co-created agreement or something

206
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,360
like that but what second party and like

207
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,720
i was trying to explain this the other

208
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,759
day i was like

209
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:44,080
what if you have a partnership or a

210
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,319
sister company or something like that

211
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:48,800
and you can share data for example

212
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,160
don't quote me on this don't sue me or

213
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,919
anything but you know originally there

214
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:53,360
was just facebook and then facebook

215
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,680
acquired instagram and before they were

216
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,599
kind of siloed but then

217
00:06:57,599 --> 00:06:58,800
changed the terms and conditions now

218
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,680
it's like facebook community of whatever

219
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,280
and now they've got whatsapp and they've

220
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,960
got these others and now there's meta

221
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,199
and everything within meta is you know

222
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,280
they can freely share data across it

223
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,759
they change the terms and conditions

224
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:13,039
don't quote me on that i'm not a lawyer

225
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:15,120
see slide number one anyway

226
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,720
second party data sharing interesting

227
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,880
so what data is out there this is good

228
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,720
this is a good thing to do for yourself

229
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,960
just to find out what of my data is out

230
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,440
there that's freely available or you

231
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,039
know as an authorized user i have the

232
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:30,400
accounts i can go to

233
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,560
so you can actually go and request

234
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,560
your amazon data like especially with

235
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,039
gdpr you know the lovely thing where all

236
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:38,800
of a sudden you get like the gdpr

237
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,319
notification on every website and the

238
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,240
cookies notification on every website

239
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,599
some of the good things that came out

240
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:45,520
with that two-bladed sword was you can

241
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,280
request your data you can request that

242
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,840
their date your data be deleted if you

243
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,360
fall under the certain criteria like

244
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,120
you're in the

245
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,599
european union or like ccpa you're in

246
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:57,199
california or you do business in

247
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:59,120
california or something

248
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,360
so these are privacy

249
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,039
laws that have been passed

250
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:04,800
that kind of gives some of the rights

251
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,400
back to you so you can download your

252
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,879
facebook data google activity

253
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:10,720
go to people search websites and look

254
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,160
yourself up look up your family and

255
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,280
loved ones like if you're privacy

256
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,879
conscious and have deleted yourself off

257
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:17,199
these people search websites have you

258
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:19,039
deleted your significant other or

259
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:20,160
someone who's associated with your

260
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,280
address

261
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,720
spouse roommate children for example

262
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,280
some things to link about to think about

263
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:30,560
wow words are hard in front of people

264
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,320
so here's an example i used to have

265
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,360
facebook

266
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,919
like over a year ago i got deleted it

267
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,679
but i downloaded

268
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:40,000
all my facebook data it's a big zip file

269
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,919
and basically they give it to you and so

270
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:44,080
i had all this so that first column

271
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,560
there is all the folders and everything

272
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,560
on facebook that i've done which is kind

273
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,320
of interesting you can see all that

274
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,240
information and then the next one over

275
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,000
is that was my amazon for one of my

276
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
amazon accounts i just downloaded it

277
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,560
just to see anything i'd ever so you

278
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,959
have you know prime video watch history

279
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:03,120
search data you know

280
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,279
image click data all this stuff that

281
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,760
they're collecting like this is this is

282
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,399
analytics that they can then use to and

283
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,240
mine and find out more stuff you can get

284
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,720
your own data it's sort of about you

285
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,800
it's not necessarily your data but it's

286
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,360
data about you and you can request this

287
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,839
is anyone freaking out

288
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:23,760
yet i'll try harder okay

289
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,560
so john jarvis back at b-sides 2017. he

290
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,640
gave this presentation he also did a

291
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,000
workshop but he gave a presentation on

292
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,760
surveillance capital capitalism and

293
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,800
stuff and

294
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,720
kind of all the stuff that's been going

295
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,440
on

296
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,880
very privacy

297
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,560
uh focus he actually presented this also

298
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,360
at defcon at the crypto privacy village

299
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,160
opened my eyes like this is cool and

300
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,000
terrifying at the same time and

301
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,680
you know really good talk you should go

302
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,399
look it up watch it it is well worth it

303
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:53,120
it talks about how privacy equates to

304
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,080
secrecy and also privacy versus privacy

305
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,519
equates to control so i'm going to try

306
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:59,519
to talk about that in an educated

307
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:01,440
fashion no guarantees

308
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,120
so privacy is about control it's it's

309
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,680
not so much about like you know no one's

310
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,600
allowed to know anything about me but i

311
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,760
want to be the one in control of what

312
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,240
gets shared out about me like yeah you

313
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,079
you can know about my professional

314
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:16,079
whatever i have a linkedin and you know

315
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:17,519
i work for this company or i work in

316
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:19,440
this industry i don't want you to know

317
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,640
where my kids go to school because

318
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,320
that's creepy why would you need to know

319
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,680
it so

320
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,440
privacy is about controlling what

321
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,040
information you're okay sharing kind of

322
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,480
a thing

323
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,079
there's a quote by bruce schneier you

324
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:31,839
know privacy failure is a control

325
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:33,040
failure you know

326
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,800
stuff like that

327
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,680
um

328
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,640
yeah

329
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,959
more about how being able to control our

330
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:41,040
privacy is important

331
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,240
privacy

332
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,920
is the right to consent

333
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,560
of your information privacy should be a

334
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,800
human right and privacy is constantly

335
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,800
evolving um

336
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,000
yeah

337
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,079
if you follow the news at all you know

338
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:56,160
there's always stuff and if it's

339
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,279
interesting there's a lot of data

340
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:59,040
breaches it's like what information can

341
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,640
we get and what customer data is

342
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,000
valuable to us

343
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,320
us hackers or you know nefarious people

344
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,640
not saying i'm one of them

345
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:10,240
uh data is everything so-called big data

346
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,600
is where

347
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,680
i kind of kind of imagine us like

348
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,399
machines and all and the exhaust is data

349
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:18,079
and they're trying to take all of our

350
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:19,680
data exhaust and see what they can get

351
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,440
out of it and reverse engineer what

352
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,360
we're interested into and what political

353
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,160
views we lean towards and what what

354
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,200
marketing like you get where i'm going

355
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,640
i'm beating i'm beating the dead horse

356
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,680
okay

357
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,360
so this is a quote

358
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,920
from cosmo you know he's a futurist

359
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,839
innovator crypt analyst you know it's

360
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:40,079
all about it it's all about information

361
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:42,160
there's a war going on out there you

362
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:42,880
know

363
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,320
it's not about bullets or guns or

364
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,760
anything like that it's about who has

365
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,920
the most information

366
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,519
by the way this from the movie sneakers

367
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:52,399
this isn't actually a real person but

368
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:54,560
it's actually ben's ben kingsley by the

369
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,800
way that's my favorite hacker movie

370
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,880
it's just so good and it's aged really

371
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,200
well everyone should watch it

372
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,399
um

373
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:04,480
the economy basis of the internet is

374
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,160
surveillance

375
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,680
think of all the marketing analytics

376
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,760
that um your companies put on their web

377
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,160
page for example or things that

378
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,040
you know what what are people tracking

379
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,880
how many people got an email from every

380
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,240
single website they ever bought

381
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,639
something from on black friday

382
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:22,800
yeah that was me it's like ah

383
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,560
i guess it's black friday aka

384
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,800
unsubscribe day again we're going to

385
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,120
talk about some tactics to avoid this

386
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,320
so

387
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,839
there is a great

388
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:33,839
show documentary on netflix called the

389
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:35,760
great hack and this is just kind of a

390
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,279
it's looping through too fast but it's

391
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:39,600
talking about how like all this data is

392
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,760
being collected and it's got some really

393
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,519
cool visuals and stuff

394
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:45,519
another similar uh one that i really

395
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:46,959
enjoyed was the social dilemma talked

396
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:48,560
about the dangers of

397
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,880
social media mental health kind of the

398
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,680
cambridge analytica stuff it was yeah it

399
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,600
was it's interesting stuff

400
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,360
check them out they're worth it

401
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,279
this is an old old pitcher but if

402
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,440
zuckerberg puts tape on on his camera

403
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,760
and microphone maybe you should too i

404
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,839
don't know this this is very old but

405
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:07,279
there you go kind of interesting makes

406
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:08,720
you think

407
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,320
so where do i fit in so this is where

408
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,880
you come to the unpatented privacy scale

409
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,120
that i made up one time in a notebook

410
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,839
and i wrote it down so

411
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:19,839
t take it for what you want but whatever

412
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:21,680
so more on the left side

413
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,920
you have like the i have nothing to hide

414
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,680
my life's not that interesting or i like

415
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,519
sharing i like being an open book and

416
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:29,680
then moving more towards the right more

417
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,000
along the more privacy like i'm aware of

418
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,480
privacy like when people ask like hey

419
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,399
can enable all these cookies and it's

420
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,000
like i don't want to enable all those

421
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,399
cookies just the necessary cookies or i

422
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:42,720
have a ad blocker kind of thing

423
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,720
moving more towards a privacy enthusiast

424
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,440
you know what active things can i do

425
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,920
active steps to help better wrangle in

426
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,160
my data that gets stolen and then off

427
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,079
the grid extreme private this this would

428
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:55,199
be like

429
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:57,680
law enforcement um people who work for

430
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,680
government who you know undercover

431
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,240
people as well as victims of you know

432
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,399
domestic abuse or different things like

433
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:05,920
that who need to get away from people

434
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,399
and like reset their life that so that's

435
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:10,000
extreme private

436
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,240
so privacy scale anyone following it i

437
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,440
kind of made it up so it doesn't make

438
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,519
sense it's because i made it up

439
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:17,279
um yeah so we're going to kind of talk

440
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:18,880
about some of that

441
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,199
so areas of privacy so online presence

442
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:22,959
we're going to cover that a little bit

443
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:24,480
our phones because everyone carries a

444
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,760
phone now

445
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,519
things we can do for email

446
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:29,440
as well as social media safe social

447
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,199
media whatever you want to call it and

448
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:33,839
then overall lifestyle

449
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:34,639
so

450
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:35,839
open source intelligence we've talked

451
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:37,600
about it we call it ocent this is

452
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,199
publicly available information or

453
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:41,360
information that anyone can get

454
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,680
to look up information about people

455
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,079
a lot of this is passive like you don't

456
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:48,160
let the third you don't let the person

457
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,760
know or the target some people like to

458
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,199
call you don't let the target know that

459
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:52,800
you're creeping on them this is just

460
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,880
public information that's out there so

461
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,480
your facebook linkedin instagram

462
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,240
stalking whatever also going through

463
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,880
public records uh county records things

464
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:01,920
like that

465
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:05,199
people search websites 100 legal still

466
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:06,240
creepy

467
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,279
so

468
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:09,680
oh ocean it's a cool skill to have to be

469
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,360
able to do that because i'm going to

470
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,040
challenge everyone to like go hack

471
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,360
yourself go look up your information and

472
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,600
see what you can like request and clean

473
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,560
up like am i okay with them having that

474
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,399
stuff on their website i never agreed to

475
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:23,600
it but it was sold to you as a third

476
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,440
party anyway rant

477
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,040
this whole thing's gonna be a rant by

478
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,880
the way

479
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,440
um so let's talk about internet browsers

480
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,320
um

481
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,759
avoid chrome and there's a lot of

482
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:36,399
browsers that are based on chromium um

483
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:39,040
so i'm a bit of a hypocrite big surprise

484
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,040
but i do use brave which is a chromium

485
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,279
build but it has a lot of analytics

486
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:46,160
stuff removed and privacy focused things

487
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,680
baked into it it is an open source

488
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,680
project that uses chromium but then they

489
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,199
try to lock it down more

490
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:52,959
firefox is great

491
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:54,880
firefox is getting better they're doing

492
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:58,160
dns over http they're doing um is it

493
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,079
containerized tabs i think that's what

494
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:02,079
they call it something like that where

495
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:03,680
tabs can't talk to each other you can

496
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,279
have like a business tab or you can like

497
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:07,040
have personal or shopping or banking or

498
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,880
something like that

499
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,360
um search engines use dark dot go when i

500
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,720
wrote this they didn't have billboards

501
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,240
all over the interstate now they have

502
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,839
billboards and it's like i love this

503
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:17,680
this this is cool honey look at this

504
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,360
like that's great no no this is really

505
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,440
cool and as we learned from

506
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,240
a recent uh security conference here you

507
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,680
know instead of saying i googled it we

508
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:26,959
started saying i ducked it so we're

509
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:28,000
going to try to make that a thing it's

510
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,440
like oh yeah i ducked that the other day

511
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,880
and i saw i read up on that it was

512
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,440
interesting so duckduckgo i ducked it

513
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,440
instead of you know i googled it or i

514
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,519
binged it i know there's one or two who

515
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:39,199
still bing

516
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:42,000
um plugins so oh this is out of date

517
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,839
https everywhere has actually gone away

518
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:45,519
it's no longer supported the eff

519
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:47,199
electronic frontier foundation makes

520
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:48,560
several plugins

521
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,279
and different things to kind of

522
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:53,920
take you know have this privacy ability

523
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,920
in the end user

524
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,399
now browsers are offering https

525
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:00,079
everywhere so i can actually get rid of

526
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:01,199
that slide

527
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:02,000
um

528
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,360
privacy badger that's interesting

529
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,720
because you can see the trackers and the

530
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,799
different things that are going on same

531
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:08,959
with ublock origin ghostry no script

532
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:10,480
block every js

533
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,000
javascript or other script things from

534
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,679
running so these are things that you can

535
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:14,959
put in your browser and you can start

536
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:16,959
tweaking it and adjusting it there's

537
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:18,640
other stuff this isn't an exhaustive

538
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,079
list this is just to kind of get you

539
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:21,520
thinking like i want to try that out

540
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,760
kind of stuff

541
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,359
phone okay

542
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:27,280
so most of us have a smartphone some of

543
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,400
us have a dumb phone some of us have

544
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,919
burner phones it's fine

545
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:31,919
um so some of the things that we can do

546
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:33,120
with our phones

547
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:36,960
uh one try to have an alternative number

548
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:37,919
like

549
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:39,440
if you're trying to

550
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,679
go away from google then don't go get a

551
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:43,039
google voice you can get third party

552
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:45,840
like mysudo is a great one i use so i

553
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:46,799
have like

554
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,640
a couple my sudo email addresses and

555
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,640
phone numbers so it's like this is my

556
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,039
i give out to vendors when they ask so

557
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:55,120
you know only vendors get this number or

558
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,559
when i shop and it needs a phone number

559
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:57,840
i do this or

560
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,880
you know google voice i use this um

561
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,960
another thing mint mobile you can buy a

562
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,280
mint mobile sim card on amazon for five

563
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,240
bucks

564
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,919
and it's like a really cheap plan and

565
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:09,440
it's an actual sim card because there's

566
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,960
some places where you go and you put in

567
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,640
a phone number it's like uh you gotta

568
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,000
put in a real phone number that's a voip

569
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,840
number it's like they know

570
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,919
buy a mint mobile card and you get an

571
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:20,160
actual physical sim card with a physical

572
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,000
number that isn't a voip number

573
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,520
switch your stuff over to that number

574
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,440
and then either do like forwarding to my

575
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,679
sudo or like google voice there's stuff

576
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:28,799
out there on the internet you should

577
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:30,559
duck it and find it

578
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:32,240
see what i did there

579
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,280
ah

580
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,080
okay um smartphone apps versus

581
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,400
progressive web apps pwas so these are

582
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,760
things where

583
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,480
you know you can download the

584
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,559
the link linkedin app let's say that you

585
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:46,080
can download the linkedin app and it

586
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,200
will have access to your phone and you

587
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,200
can see what permissions it has access

588
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,640
it has access to the contacts on your

589
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,840
phone well maybe i don't want to share

590
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,760
that or it can have all this they want

591
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,840
you to use the app but what if you just

592
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,400
use the browser and go that way and you

593
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,480
can you know go to linkedin on the

594
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,400
browser so progressive web apps you go

595
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,600
to a website and i'll show some

596
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,840
screenshots later where you can go and

597
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,240
you can download sorry go to the website

598
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,760
log in on the mobile browser and then

599
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:13,200
say save to desktop or save to like home

600
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,640
or something like that and it gives a

601
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,720
little shortcut icon to that so instead

602
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,160
of using the app you can use the

603
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,760
progressive web app and it's still

604
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,520
contained in within

605
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,440
that mobile browser try it i'm going to

606
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,039
show some pictures later

607
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:27,039
um you can set a private dns you can

608
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:28,320
make sure your phone's encrypted

609
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,840
password protect it you can put

610
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,200
biometrics on your phone if you take

611
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,799
that

612
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:33,600
you

613
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,080
i there's some stuff i think the eff

614
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,480
wrote about it or maybe the i can't

615
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,480
remember citizen lab

616
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,559
but they say don't use biometrics to

617
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:44,320
unlock your phone because law

618
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,000
enforcement doesn't need a warrant to

619
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
unlock your phone with biometrics

620
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,720
so use it for like apps or two-factor

621
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,559
but don't use it to unlock your phone

622
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:53,679
kind of interesting you can read more

623
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:55,120
about it

624
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,880
you can duck it

625
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,640
okay privacy focused android operating

626
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,320
system so there's two big ones out there

627
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,559
there's graphene os um and there's

628
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:04,080
lineage os

629
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,240
open source no googled services even

630
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,919
though they're android based

631
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:09,039
um

632
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:10,640
graphene os

633
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,559
goes on pixel devices so i have a pixel

634
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:15,280
device and as soon as there's an update

635
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,960
it's like graphene os has an update for

636
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,039
it but so they only go on pixel devices

637
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:20,240
which is interesting because it's made

638
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,000
by google but you completely blow it

639
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,159
away and put graphing os

640
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:25,520
and then there's alternative stores

641
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:26,960
other than google play stores like f

642
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,520
droid and aurora where you can download

643
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,520
you know open source versions of those

644
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,200
apps where they've gone through the apk

645
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,039
and like remove some of the things that

646
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:37,039
the telemetry and tracking

647
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:40,480
lineage os competitor i guess

648
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,039
similar used to be cyanogenmod i believe

649
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:44,559
i could be wrong i'm not a lawyer slide

650
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:46,480
one anyway

651
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,760
supports a lot more different phone

652
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,360
models so

653
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,760
something you could look at

654
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:54,799
okay phone apps uh i use bouncer this is

655
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:56,559
an app that i

656
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:58,080
put on android and basically as soon as

657
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,320
i install an app or it's like hey i'm

658
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,919
going to take a picture of this and as

659
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:03,600
soon as you do it's like hey you just

660
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,960
granted access to your camera to this

661
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,159
app do you want to keep it do you want

662
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:07,600
to remove it or do you want to schedule

663
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,200
me to remove it in five minutes five

664
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,600
seconds whatever it's really nice

665
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,960
because as soon as you grant access it's

666
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,960
like hey did you mean to grant access to

667
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,679
your contacts to the calculator app

668
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:20,480
we may it's kind of nice

669
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,320
netguard lockdown those are two similar

670
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:25,280
things like a phone-based firewall

671
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,640
kind of thing there's some screenshots

672
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,480
of it but you can block things at the

673
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,919
phone level and some of them don't

674
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:32,640
require a rooted device so if you don't

675
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,159
want to root your device that's good to

676
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:35,280
know

677
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,520
run a vpn client on your phone tor

678
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:40,159
browser messaging secure messaging so

679
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:41,840
their signal

680
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,320
sudo which is my suru that's another

681
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,120
another messaging wire wicker key base

682
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,080
these are

683
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:51,280
more privacy centric and doing encrypted

684
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,039
they all work a little different but

685
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:54,320
they work

686
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,000
email i'm sure a lot of people have

687
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,360
heard about protonmail but if you

688
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,760
haven't it's

689
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,360
encrypted mail service they don't have

690
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,720
access to it it's really interesting to

691
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,760
go there and actually read their

692
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,000
requests like by law enforcement like

693
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,440
hey we want to know what this person did

694
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,559
he's like cool

695
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:12,480
we can tell you when they got our email

696
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,760
we can't tell you the contents because

697
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,280
we don't have the keys it's true end to

698
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:18,240
end zero trust which is nice

699
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,640
uh browsers so these are mobile browsers

700
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,480
you can use on phones um so there's a

701
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,000
duckduckgo browser they don't make one

702
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,280
for desktop but they do make one for

703
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,760
phone brave has a browser as well as

704
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,120
firefox

705
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,480
camera and microphone so this is a

706
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,080
picture i really like silent pocket

707
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,280
these are little stickers that you can

708
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,720
put on your phone

709
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,760
and basically you can cover up

710
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,840
you know your stuff you can cover up the

711
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,840
cameras and it's nice because they're

712
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,600
they're not really sticky but they cling

713
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,039
pretty well and you can put them on your

714
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:47,679
webcam whatever and this one is called a

715
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:49,600
mic lock so you can actually if you have

716
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,520
a headphone jack in your phone you can

717
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,200
actually plug it in and

718
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,480
your phone will think oh that's the

719
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,760
microphone

720
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,200
so those of you who are paranoid that

721
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,400
your phone's always listening you plug

722
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,320
that in you can't listen

723
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,840
mic block is also making one that works

724
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,400
with iphones and the iphone

725
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,640
single connect thing whatever

726
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,640
online storage so protonmail also makes

727
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,960
proton drive encrypted storage so i

728
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,720
think like dropbox or google drive type

729
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:13,840
thing but

730
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:16,720
you know spider-out proton yeah how am i

731
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:19,600
doing on time oh geez

732
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,919
okay um i'm gonna post some of these in

733
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:23,679
the slack channel so just some of these

734
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:24,799
sites but

735
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:26,240
um there's an email comparison site

736
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,400
where you can check different things um

737
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,640
you can use pgp it's a

738
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,080
you can take a little bit of a learning

739
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,320
curve email forwarding throwaways you

740
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,400
can do the plus whatever that some

741
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,960
people catch on to that and strip it out

742
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,799
okay social media i'm not saying you

743
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:42,480
don't have social media but i'm saying

744
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,400
if you do do social media have it for a

745
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,480
specific purpose don't have it be your

746
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,559
everything don't authenticate to sites

747
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:50,240
with your social media if you can avoid

748
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,320
it you know like hey logged in log in

749
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,840

750
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,120
that isn't associated with facebook but

751
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,720
you can log in with your facebook thing

752
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:57,760
and then we have a data sharing

753
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:58,960
agreement we get to see your facebook

754
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,320
pro

755
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,919
just use email

756
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:02,880
um

757
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,799
so for example linkedin lock it down

758
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:06,320
this is a picture of my linkedin one of

759
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,320
my linkedin profiles that's from uh this

760
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,159
person does not exist.com it

761
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:12,240
auto-generates people's faces every time

762
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,320
you refresh the page so

763
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,240
that's on one of my linkedin things

764
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,559
that's not a real person so

765
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:19,600
fun stuff

766
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,080
lifestyle i'm i'm not a paid sponsor of

767
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,000
this sweatshirt by the way

768
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:24,960
um

769
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,120
home network so you know

770
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,799
think about your home network but is

771
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:29,919
there stuff that you can block from

772
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:31,279
coming in or telemetry you can block

773
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:32,559
from going out

774
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:33,440
um

775
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,520
dedicated cell phones so we talked about

776
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,200
mint mobile or like having specific

777
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,960
phone numbers for specific things like

778
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,640
one you give out to family one you give

779
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,000
out like you throw away that you know is

780
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,080
gonna get spammed by telemarketers

781
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,520
stuff like that

782
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,600
faraday bags this i don't really have

783
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,600
time to go into this but um silent

784
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,279
pocket mission darkness they make these

785
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:52,559
faraday bags where you can drop your

786
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:54,720
phone in it and it stops

787
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:58,000
all all signals rfid all that stuff it's

788
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,200
interesting because

789
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,120
some of the argument now is like even

790
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,880
when you power off your phone

791
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,720
it's powered off yeah but

792
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,880
your battery is still connected and on

793
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,080
newer phones you can't take out

794
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,240
batteries they do that like they have

795
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,600
little capacitors and batteries and it's

796
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,360
like it can still send little heartbeats

797
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,279
or something this is this is your

798
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:17,279
tinfoil hat people you know you'd have

799
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:18,640
to take your phone apart to be for sure

800
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:21,760
but fair day bags just peace of mind

801
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:24,159
privacy.com christmas is coming up so

802
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:25,279
this is a cool site where you can

803
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:26,320
generate

804
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,480
a one-time use credit cards or like

805
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,159
specific use credit records so instead

806
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:31,360
of using your one credit card for

807
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,400
everything and then there's a credit

808
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,640
card breach and has access to all that

809
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,720
privacy.com so like when i'm buying

810
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,559
gifts from my wife or children since we

811
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:41,039
have a shared bank account with 2fa

812
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:42,799
it's like hey i'm going to be buying

813
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:44,159

814
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:45,760

815
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:46,640

816
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,400
christmas gift in room christmas so

817
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,640
privacy.com helps christmas

818
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,720
that's not their slogan

819
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,320
um disinformation campaign i don't

820
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,600
really want to talk about that too much

821
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:56,720
but that's like getting magazine

822
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,400
subscriptions or sending packages to

823
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,240
your house under a different name it can

824
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,679
cause problems when the name doesn't

825
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:02,799
match

826
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:05,760
the postal record or things like that or

827
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:06,960
you know

828
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,240
like sign up for a magazine you'll

829
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,600
actually read under a different name and

830
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,200
then they're like oh bob

831
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,120
bob billyson lives here it's like

832
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,200
there's no bob billy's in here sorry i

833
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,159
don't know

834
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:18,320
adversarial clothing so this is this is

835
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,240
an example of this this is designed to

836
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,919
like throw garbage data in automatic

837
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:24,000
license plate readers so my brother

838
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,440
actually has one of these

839
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,559
and

840
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:28,080
a license plate reader and i went in

841
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,360
front of his house and i like walked in

842
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:30,320
front of it without telling him he was

843
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,919
like hey are you messing around by my

844
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:33,279
house like

845
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:35,039
maybe like just had a bunch of cars

846
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:37,600
drove by it's like no it's this

847
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:40,080
adversarial fashion it's kind of fun

848
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,840
and then i like the concept of gray man

849
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,200
gray woman

850
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,720
this is like hiding in plain sight you

851
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,240
know when you're out and about and you

852
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,840
don't want to be easily recognized

853
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,279
nondescript clothing you think jason

854
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:51,200
bourne you know didn't have logos didn't

855
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,400
have things like this you know kind of

856
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,000
like

857
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,919
rather than being in camouflage in like

858
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:57,840
a white snowy field it's more like you

859
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,520
blend in with your surrounding people

860
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:02,159
like you're non-memorable

861
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:03,840
rant

862
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,200
um

863
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,559
home network so there's things you can

864
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:08,480
do at home you can uh

865
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,080
you know pf sense is free it's open

866
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,520
source you can put this on your home

867
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,559
network

868
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:14,480
firewall things if you have a raspberry

869
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,080
pi you can do like a pie hole which is

870
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,840
really fun block a lot of stuff as well

871
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,840
as falcon gate does similar stuff too

872
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,440
you can set up your own vpn so all your

873
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,279
connections go through your home isp i

874
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:24,720
don't know

875
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,640
the hated one has some great youtube

876
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,679
videos on this talking about the

877
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:29,279
difference between differences between

878
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:31,679
privacy versus anonymity

879
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:33,679
kind of stuff

880
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:35,760
and true anonymity is very very very

881
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,520
difficult like

882
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,520
there's some data like unless you have a

883
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,760
dedicated machine you only shop online

884
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,279
shop on that machine and you have a

885
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:45,120
different machine for this kind of stuff

886
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,720
so

887
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,240
all right demo i'm not really going to

888
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,919
show demos but i took screenshots in

889
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:51,279
case demo failed so we're going to use

890
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:52,559
that instead

891
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:55,360
uh you can buy vpns there black friday

892
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:56,799
would have been the best time but i use

893
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:58,399
hma i'm probably going to switch but

894
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:00,399
there's things like private internet

895
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:03,200
access and proton vpn and

896
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,240
different things like this and you can

897
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,919
install them on your phone so all of

898
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:07,840
your data goes through a vpn and your

899
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:08,960
cell phone provider doesn't know what

900
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,039
sites you're going to or you can change

901
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:13,520
like i went to europe this summer and

902
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:14,960
when i went to a different country i'd

903
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,559
switch to that country so it's like okay

904
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:17,760
they're coming out of here or i had to

905
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,440
call my credit card company here i

906
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,960
switched to a u.s one and then i did a

907
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,480
voip call home so it didn't look

908
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,880
suspicious or things like that i'm

909
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,559
taking control of what i'm allowing to

910
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:28,880
share out so vpns they're good they're

911
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:31,360
affordable and i have a link to a vpn

912
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,200
comparison chart that i can post in the

913
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,480
slack channel

914
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,559
so here's here's an example of some pwas

915
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:37,600
i got rid of

916
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,039
these things but like i don't have

917
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:41,039
twitter on my phone i use twitter but i

918
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:42,399
go through this thing and it blocks all

919
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:43,760
these ads and

920
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,600
i do watch youtube videos but i watch it

921
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,760
through the brave browser pwa and i

922
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,679
don't ever get ads on my mobile device

923
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:51,360
it's great i love it

924
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,039
so basically you

925
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:54,559
go to a website and you just say like

926
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:55,919
hey add to home and then it's like cool

927
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:57,200
you want to add to your home screen okay

928
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,640
let me know where it goes

929
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,880
pwas way better than putting a bunch of

930
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,320
apps that have

931
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,480
access to your phone

932
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,720
uh setting up private dns on your phone

933
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,320
so this is basically route your stuff

934
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:11,200
through private dns server so

935
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,480
added measure privacy i'm not going to

936
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,919
go into that i don't really have time

937
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:14,720
but

938
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,080
something you can look at you can set

939
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,840
this up on your phones now

940
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:20,240
so this is lockdown this is that

941
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,679
ios

942
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:23,760
firewall sort of app

943
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,520
and basically you can go through and you

944
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:28,240
like turn it on like hey i want to block

945
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,159
facebook and crypto mining and different

946
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:32,240
things like i want to say you know my

947
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,080
phone can't send that home they can't

948
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,679
send that telemetry home

949
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:37,440
and here over on the right is bouncer

950
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,799
where basically i can go hey what

951
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:39,919
permission let's look at the camera

952
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:41,840
permission what are all the apps that

953
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,600
have access to my camera right now and

954
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,440
it's a bit better than like the native

955
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,520
one because as soon as you add it it'll

956
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,799
bounce and say hey did you want to do

957
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:49,840
that

958
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,840
there you go so

959
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,919
so now what what do we do from here

960
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:56,080
what's my call to action so my call to

961
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:57,919
action figure out where you're currently

962
00:29:57,919 --> 00:29:59,840
at on the privacy scale and it's not

963
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,520
like a one two three four it's a scale

964
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,520
it slides you know whatever

965
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,120
you know where are you at right now go

966
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:07,360
to people search websites go request

967
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,799
your data and see what they have on you

968
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:10,799
from amazon or facebook go go do these

969
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:12,080
data requests it's kind of you know if

970
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,760
you're watching tv at night like you

971
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,039
know pull up your laptop and pull your

972
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:16,640
data while you're watching tv sort of a

973
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,520
thing

974
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,760
so find out where you're currently at

975
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,520
and then decide where you want to be do

976
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,200
i want to like request some of my data

977
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,559
do i want to delete my social media

978
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:26,240
accounts i don't use anymore but my

979
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,840
data's still out there do where do you

980
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,679
want to go and then make the steps to

981
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:31,840
move that direction i have resources and

982
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:32,960
stuff in this slide that i'm going to

983
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,880
post in slack

984
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:37,039
with links and stuff you know there's

985
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:38,640
this thing called the data detox this 10

986
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,799
day data detox i think it's put out by

987
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:43,360
mozilla that you can you can duck it and

988
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:44,559
find it

989
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:46,399
opt out requests evaluate accounts you

990
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:47,840
need close the accounts you don't kind

991
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,200
of stuff

992
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:52,159
so that's more or less it does anyone

993
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:55,679
have any questions i'm not an expert

00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,080
request links uh data request links from

1002
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,679
various things

1003
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:15,039
um

1004
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:16,880
vpn and email comparison charts so they

1005
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:19,360
take all these different vpn and email

1006
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,559
providers and compare the different

1007
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:22,559
things that they can do do they log do

1008
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:24,559
they do the stuff it's really nice

1009
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:26,159
warrant canaries we didn't cover this

1010
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:27,360
but several websites have a warrant

1011
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:28,640
canary so like if they get served a

1012
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:29,840
warrant it's like you're not allowed to

1013
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,840
disclose this it's like well we have a

1014
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:34,000
warrant canary page so it's like have we

1015
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,679
ever received a warrant yes we can say

1016
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:37,840
yes we received one so you can go to

1017
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,360
websites and look for warrant canary

1018
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,720
it's kind of interesting because there's

1019
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,480
they'll say we can't say who requested

1020
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,399
it or what it was but we can tell you if

1021
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:45,279
we've been

1022
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:46,640
warranted before

1023
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,480

1024
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,600
