00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,439

00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,680

52
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,439
story yeah that's what they want to hear

53
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:54,960

54
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,880
want to hear the sketchy

55
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,759
there's a podcast for that

56
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:01,600
i'm not signing up

57

58
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:06,799
uh so first uh yeah

59
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:09,360
what's the last 21 months been like for

60
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,599
you guys

61
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,440
let's go who's going for all right i'll

62
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,560
go first um

63
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,280
it's been sad

64
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,599
i think that's the easiest way to put it

65
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,520
i'm a people person i like traveling i

66
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,599
like being around co-workers and and

67
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:28,879
things like that so being stuck at home

68
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:30,319
um is

69
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:33,440
it's it's changed a lot right so i'm so

70
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,360
excited to be here today that things are

71
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,000
opening back up a lot to look forward to

72
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,160
but i think in general it's it's sucked

73
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,440
right i don't

74
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,800
i don't know how to spin it in a good

75
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,879
way honestly

76
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:47,040
but yeah that's my take

77
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,480
i think uh yeah for me it was the same

78
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,519
thing so i also i'm a road warrior pro

79
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:54,480
traveler or whatever right in 2019 i

80
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,800
flew over a quarter million miles and

81
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,680
then in 2020 clearly everything stopped

82
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,159
right so it was really weird

83
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:05,680
one for my family to see me and be like

84
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,360
shouldn't you go

85
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,280
like somewhere don't you have a plane to

86
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,280
get on um so yeah it's been really

87
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,280
interesting um but like you said things

88
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,280
are opening back up in the last two

89
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,959
months um

90
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:19,040
i've spoken at four conferences saintcon

91
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,000
just right here um black hat in london

92
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,040
and then uh i just got back from riyadh

93
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,319
for at hack um last night so i'm really

94
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:31,680
tired what time are you on right now i

95
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,840
yes whatever time yes exactly and i now

96
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,040
play 30.

97
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,480
so things are open and back up which is

98
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,640
nice so it's good to see people and and

99
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,159
reconnect

100
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:41,680
yeah the same thing it's it's been

101
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,680
interesting to to realize how much we

102
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,239
took for granted our interactions and

103
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:48,560
conferences most of us go to conferences

104
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,400
multiple times a year see a lot of

105
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,239
people interact in the community and

106
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:54,400
when that stopped initially it was nice

107
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,480
because it's like oh hey my family i get

108
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,400
to see them again or get to actually do

109
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,840
home projects but then it slowly started

110
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,200
to kind of

111
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,680
break down where i wasn't progressing as

112
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,680
much as i had previously because most of

113
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,879
my career progression has been

114
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,640
networking and community and

115
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,040
connections and so i started stagnating

116
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,120
and realizing like oh man i'm i need to

117
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,959
get out and talk to people again i feel

118
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,959
like i'm losing my my mind and my

119
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,279
education and so being able to even just

120
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:23,680
sink on this year has been such an a

121
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,600
relief to be like oh yeah i feel

122
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,600
that knowledge just absorption again is

123
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,360
really nice because the way i've always

124
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,639
seen it is just surround myself with

125
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,320
people who are really really smart and i

126
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,840
might be able to grab like five percent

127
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,600
of that that's how i've kind of grown my

128
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,440
career so yeah i totally agree because

129
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,639
that's the that's the thing is like

130
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,720
getting out i i feel like that's how you

131
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,479
level up right is you find yourself

132
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:43,840
around people who know more than you

133
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,680
which is what i've done essentially my

134
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,440
entire career and i highly highly

135
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,560
recommend that

136
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,520
for all of you as well um if you are the

137
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,360
smartest person in the room that's the

138
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,320
wrong room right find the next room with

139
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,560
smarter people because they will lift

140
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,240
you up whether you realize it or not

141
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,600
just from the conversations that you're

142
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,360
having you'll

143
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,360
hear somebody say something and so

144
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,360
you're like wait what was that what is

145
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,280
that thing and not having those

146
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,039
interactions has been incredibly

147
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,800
difficult and i think yeah a little bit

148
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,759
maybe

149
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:16,720
mentally stunting

150
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,360
so

151
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,360
i can tell you from my own experience in

152
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,759
the last uh uh

153
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:25,199
two years

154
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,479
that

155
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:28,400
as a security professional

156
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,960
our job is to talk to people and when

157
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,479
you're not in the room

158
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:34,080
those conversations take on a very

159
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:38,120
different tone how did you guys

160
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,520
that i mean

161
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,840
especially somebody who travels

162
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,360
you know professionally as much as you

163
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,840
do i wouldn't say so um so with my role

164
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,400
i would go out to organizations so um i

165
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,919
just do threat hunting i'm a threat

166
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:52,800
hunter right and so i would go on site

167
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,400
to organizations and i would sit down

168
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,080
with their security team in a room and

169
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,919
say okay let's talk about

170
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:00,000
one how the network is set up or like

171
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,680
how what what do you have deployed those

172
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,199
types of things and we'd have those

173
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:05,600
conversations face to face right so

174
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,840
you're sitting there looking at somebody

175
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,360
and you're discussing what their

176
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,800
security posture is they're telling you

177
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,000
about the different technologies that

178
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,080
they have all of those things are

179
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,479
happening in a room

180
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:18,319
the problem with zoom and things like

181
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:20,400
that is one not everybody turns

182
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,400
on their camera so you don't see body

183
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,319
language that kind of stuff all the time

184
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:27,600
either but also at least i have found

185
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,160
and i realized how valuable it actually

186
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:34,400
was to be on location is that

187
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,120
you'll hear somebody say

188
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,199
oh yeah we do that

189
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,199
and then like someone two seats over

190
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:43,360
starts getting real uncomfortable like

191
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,280
in their seat right and over zoom you

192
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:49,440
don't notice that as much or you will

193
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,120
take that like oh okay we're going to

194
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,280
take 10 minutes for a bio break

195
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,840
during your conversation and everybody

196
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,360
runs off and pees and then you're

197
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,800
standing around in the hallway or you

198
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,160
get back to the conference room before

199
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,960
things kick off and someone says

200
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,960
in reality

201
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,199
it's more like this

202
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:10,160
those are invaluable bits of information

203
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,160
that don't happen when you're not

204
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,639
sitting in a room together and so not

205
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:18,240
having that that's yeah i didn't realize

206
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,160
how important that was until it wasn't

207
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,720
there and and so

208
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,880
face to face still

209
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,039
does matter because there's an a

210
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:28,400
significant amount and especially

211
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,080
someone i mean you're a professional

212
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,599
social engineer so you know body

213
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:33,840
language like reading body language and

214
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,520
micro expressions in people's face like

215
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,560
you'd see

216
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,440
this like really fleeting like

217
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,120
this cringe when somebody said something

218
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,400
that just

219
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,560
wasn't true you know like from other

220
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,400
people in the room and you don't have

221
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,960
that over zoom yeah i don't think you

222
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,280
can replace that even if everyone had

223
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,960
their camera on there's there's just

224
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:56,160
that that aspect that you can't replace

225
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,840
so that's been a struggle and then from

226
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,240
a testing or consulting point of view um

227
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,840
not being able to actually do physical

228
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,800
assessments has been um not fun

229
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,879
because you can't go in that's like the

230
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:09,520
best part of your job it is it is the

231
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,520
most like tangible right like actually

232
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,759
stealing things but yeah i can't do that

233
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:15,599
right now you can't do a data center

234
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:17,039
social engineer over

235
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:19,039
no i like i like how much that tells us

236
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:20,800
about you is that you're like the thing

237
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,840
i missed the most was stealing

238
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,840
pretend stealing have you guys seen

239
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,800
community where they have um the robots

240
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,800
the show community um they had the

241
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,640
robots in the screen they had like

242
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,200
remote um students i don't know you gave

243
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,919
me an idea do you have a idea a shelf of

244
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:40,320
trophies for your from your engagements

245
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,039
no unofficial trophies okay my mom asked

246
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:44,480
me that once she's like what do you take

247
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,000
i'm like i don't take anything i mean i

248
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,200
don't really talk of their hair

249
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,200
i'm not a serial killer i take a little

250
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,680
bit of the siso's hair

251
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,680
well and i guess that uh

252
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,880
when you do get those physical

253
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,399
engagements and you don't have anybody

254
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:00,640
working on site you don't have anybody

255
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,800
to piggyback or steal their creds it

256
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,000
makes things difficult for sure yeah

257
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,959
you know

258
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:08,880
lean and i were actually working on a

259
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,760
project together professionally

260
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,600
at the very beginning of this

261
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,959
and it certainly went off the rails when

262
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:18,160
we weren't

263
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,440
meeting together and we weren't doing

264
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,360
things so it definitely affected us the

265
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,720
hardest part was not being able to just

266
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,000
whiteboard like

267
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,240
digital whiteboards don't work

268
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,839
um and even when you get into a room of

269
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:29,760
you know five six people there's

270
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,279
multiple conversations going on at the

271
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:32,720
same time and so

272
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,320
uh the interesting thing at the start

273
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,080
was everyone was like oh i get to have

274
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,440
more meetings because i go back to back

275
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,600
without drive time or you know any of

276
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,160
that but that quickly turned into

277
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,640
quite the psychological trauma where you

278
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,160
didn't even have five minutes between

279
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,800
meetings for to go grab water

280
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,839
and so uh while most of our

281
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:53,440
management thought we were being more

282
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,640
efficient

283
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,240
it was actually more psychologically

284
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,320
draining and burnout happened faster for

285
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,320
a lot of people

286
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,399
now with all that said uh there has to

287
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:05,040
be some wins in the last two years

288
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,880
yeah i think that people started

289
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,399
realizing the

290
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:11,200
the uses of technologies could be um

291
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,399
there were many different uses that

292
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:14,320
weren't being utilized

293
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,000
i do like

294
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,399
being able to communicate with

295
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:20,320
teams in other states that would not

296
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,000
talk to me previously and they had no

297
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,720
choice um and also

298
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,720
when you start not being able to go on

299
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,320
on site you start coming up with

300
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,920
creative ways to stay connected so

301
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,320
virtual lunches just to sit and talk we

302
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,000
have more of those than if i were to go

303
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,680
on site and talk to

304
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,440
different customers

305
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,720
because i work in the consultant side of

306
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,040
the house and so being able to just

307
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,200
connect with more people

308
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,680
across the country faster without having

309
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,519
to hop on a plane as much as i love

310
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:49,839
traveling was really nice and so really

311
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:52,560
creative uses of technology yeah i echo

312
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,399
that for sure definitely

313
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:56,000
team members that i normally don't get

314
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,839
to talk to as much we do a lot more

315
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:00,079
happy hours and things like that so it's

316
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:01,519
it's been a beneficial from a team

317
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:03,680
building perspective um especially for

318
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,240
remote people so um that has been a win

319
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,120
i think

320
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,360
yeah same thing i think it's just the uh

321
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,120
the overall getting more comfortable

322
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,440
with things like like people seeing into

323
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,399
your

324
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,720
office or whatever at home like i have a

325
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,959
home you don't blur that out no i don't

326
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:20,560
i let people see it you actually

327
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,480
presented very yeah like i have what is

328
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,040
essentially a shrine to adhd behind me

329
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,880
like i have shelves of like all the

330
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,279
random crap that i have collected over

331
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:31,200
years and like i collect these mini

332
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,959
arcade machines and those are on and

333
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:35,360
flashing and there's all kinds and i

334
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,880
love harry potter stuff because i'm a

335
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,600
giant child and there's all this stuff

336
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,560
like movie props and i but the favorite

337
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,640
is i have a working a functioning pay

338
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,480
phone like in my office and people are

339
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,120
like is that a pay phone like and i'm

340
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,760
like you bet your ass it's a pay phone

341
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,760
you just got to find that work i'm like

342
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,079
yes it works what would be the point

343
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:57,360
find the number column when he's on his

344
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,639
next

345
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:00,480
the hard part is if you're on the other

346
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,480
end of that where you're

347
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,040
talking to grifter and you can only see

348
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,800
the things in the background

349
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,120
the 80d on my side yeah is fun you're

350
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,959
like what people are always what is that

351
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:12,880
what's that thing over there i was like

352
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,040
i'll do like a cribs of my office at

353
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,639
some point you need to because what ends

354
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:18,160
up happening is it's 15 minutes of

355
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,079
actual conversation and then 45 minutes

356
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:22,320
of cribs yeah it's like

357
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,440
it's like talking to pope like he's

358
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,639
hiding behind the camera there but when

359
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:26,240
you're on with pope he's got like

360
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,079
dinosaur teeth and like whatever it's

361
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:29,680
like looking into like a museum you're

362
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,519
like what is that did you get a new

363
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:34,399
tooth like you know

364
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,279
i do i like that i don't know i'm creepy

365
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:38,160
i like it

366
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,519
like that i guess it's like oh look at

367
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:42,880
how nice your living room's decorated

368
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,279
or you love the pottery barn can your

369
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:46,800
kid hear us because this is a pretty

370
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,880
heated conversation no they're fine

371
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,040
go back to peppa pig actually that is a

372
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,560
nice thing i know you're saying that

373
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,360
like as a joke but also um that like

374
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,880
life happens around you while you're

375
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,120
working as well right and so things like

376
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,120
like my office happens to be below the

377
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,440
kitchen so sometimes it's it's the worst

378
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,279
place for an office but it's what i got

379
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:06,639
and so sometimes it'll just be like

380
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:09,040
crash you know like in all of the pots

381
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,560
have fallen out of a cabinet or

382
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,920
something above my head while i'm on a

383
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,440
meeting and i'm just like

384
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,880
sure what happens is you're you're

385
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,800
mid-sentencing and you pause and

386
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,040
everyone on the call knows why

387
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,360
and it's do you hear any crying

388
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,399
nope all right we can continue our

389
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:23,760
meeting right so it's kind of cool it

390
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,240
like humanized like your co-workers and

391
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,600
everything like it's like oh that we all

392
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,360
do have lives outside of this we're just

393
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,279
dogs barking and stuff like that i love

394
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:33,120
seeing animals like just on screen like

395
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,240
behind people like i don't know what

396
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,120
you're saying anymore i'm looking at

397
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,880
your animals is that a bird yeah it's a

398
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,560
bird yeah just let them fly around

399
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,040
full-on parrots yeah and it's it's fun

400
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,480
because you get to see some of the more

401
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,000
personal sides of

402
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
of people's lives and that maybe their

403
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,480
choices and 3d printers might not be the

404
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,160
best and so you get to

405
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:54,000
talk smack about that i feel seen

406
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,519
i blur my camera

407
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:56,639
for that reason

408
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:58,240
but it's it's very interesting to see

409
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,880
you know that side of the the coin but

410
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,160
one thing that it did do uh because

411
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,920
it was just an expectation that you know

412
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,000
you're remote and you're on on virtual

413
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,160
meetings it opened up the job market in

414
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,320
a way we've never seen before

415
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,600
for better and worse so you're able to

416
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,440
expand outside of the the place that you

417
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,880
live so people that were living in

418
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,560
remote areas were able to get different

419
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,480
jobs because now companies are saying

420
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,399
well we have no choice but to go remote

421
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:26,240
so we might as well try and and poach

422
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,279
from the best um that also comes at the

423
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:31,680
downside of you're losing candidates to

424
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,730
out-of-market

425
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:34,000
[Music]

426
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,760
opportunities you know i'll actually

427
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,839
i'll comment on that really quickly if

428
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:40,959
if i may um yes thank you

429
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:41,680
so

430
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,560
so that i changed jobs just recently

431
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,800
only a few months ago and for the first

432
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:47,680
time in

433
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:48,959
the company i was with i was with for

434
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:50,800
for nine years um so which is an

435
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:54,480
eternity right in our industry um but

436
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,480
during the like it was like oh they were

437
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,079
like oh we want to send you an offer and

438
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:00,000
all this stuff and they talking about

439
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
salaries and things like that

440
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
they i said well here's what i want and

441
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
they said well based on your region this

442
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,480
is what we do and where and i had to

443
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,160
like and i'm talking to the recruiter

444
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,000
and i said

445
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,920
it's 2021

446
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:17,120
like does it does it matter where i live

447
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,240
like

448
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,160
i don't like it's not

449
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,480
that's not relevant anymore right is the

450
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,240
data that is in my head that you're

451
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,399
interested in paying me to get

452
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:27,839
worth less

453
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:30,320
because of the region that i'm living in

454
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,399
versus if i lived in san francisco or

455
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:33,680
whatever

456
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,040
they're like well cost of living and

457
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,800
blah blah blah blah and i'm like

458
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:37,680
that

459
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,199
doesn't matter

460
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:41,360
i'm still on the same meetings talking

461
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,600
to the same customers i will be on the

462
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,680
same zoom regardless of whether i'm in

463
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:50,720
la new york oklahoma or salt lake city

464
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,720
and they were like

465
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:56,240
fair play right but it took having that

466
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,920
conversation and that's a conversation

467
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,399
that's easier to have now so when you

468
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:02,880
are looking at new jobs and things and

469
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,959
they come at you and say

470
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:05,839
well

471
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:07,759
you're in utah and so the cost of living

472
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:09,360
and i'm like one you don't realize how

473
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,360
much the cost of living has gone up in

474
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,959
utah in the last several years thanks

475
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:14,320
california

476
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:17,279
for all moving here during the pandemic

477
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:19,839
but also again

478
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:21,519
companies are interested in what you

479
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:22,720
know

480
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,160
it should have nothing to do with where

481
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,720
you live so negotiate

482
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,800
you know with that in mind

483
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,560
that changes monthly too

484
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,160
cost of living in in salt lake

485
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,360
specifically is

486
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,199
going up monthly and i don't think that

487
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:36,959
recruiters and hr teams are even able to

488
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:40,000
keep up with that data and so um

489
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,279
the biggest

490
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:43,839
aha for me during the pandemic was what

491
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:45,199
are you really worth

492
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:46,880
i don't think anybody knows what they're

493
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,399
really worth until you start having

494
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:50,079
these conversations it's not a

495
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:52,480
comparison of you versus the engineering

496
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,160
your peer and your organization who

497
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,360
knows more

498
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,120
or even where you're located it's what

499
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,959
are you providing to the organization

500
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:01,040
and if they don't value that someone

501
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,959
else will and i'm not encouraging

502
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:05,119
everyone to go jump ship and why not but

503
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:06,880
understand

504
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,439
go only

505
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:11,599
like for if you have talent like right

506
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:14,880
now like seriously the skills gap is so

507
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,359
immense that like if you have

508
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:20,240
marketable skills like you can just you

509
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,640
can go where if you're unhappy and you

510
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,319
have marketable skills you don't need to

511
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:26,480
be unhappy go somewhere else like you

512
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,079
can get a job

513
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:29,919
that brings up something that i did want

514
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:32,320
to talk about which is you know there

515
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,480
very much is a skills gap in

516
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:38,799
our industry and you three each are

517
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:42,160
in kind of unique positions that aren't

518
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,520
the standard

519
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:47,600
this is an infosec person job

520
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,000
what are the resources what are the ways

521
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,400
that you would encourage people to

522
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,400
get a starter skill up if that's where

523
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,039
they want to pivot

524
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,559
i can

525
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:01,919
do you want me you you had your

526
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:04,160
microphone up before i did i have a lot

527
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,080
of thoughts so

528
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,880
you're going to need to inject

529
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,720
we're at a different

530
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,360
stage

531
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,480
of our careers where what worked for me

532
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,720
is not going to work for anybody else

533
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,280
the industry has changed i was very

534
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,720
fortunate to be in a very unique

535
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,840
position

536
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,520
and that honestly is what propelled my

537
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:28,480
career that doesn't work today

538
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,400
um

539
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,039
the skills gap is creating such an

540
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:34,400
employee

541
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,520
market that you have any specialty any

542
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,640
skill set

543
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:42,160
you should be able to find a job um it

544
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,799
since there's such a shortage of

545
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:46,400
infosec

546
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,600
skills even general i.t skills that

547
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,520
it wouldn't take long for you to focus

548
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,440
on a particular skill get very good at

549
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:56,640
it and find an opportunity

550
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,200
that wasn't the case 10 15 years ago you

551
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,720
had to prove your worth you had to come

552
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,520
up and be the junior and then learn all

553
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,919
of the fundamentals i also think that's

554
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:07,440
creating a whole different problem that

555
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,520
we'll get into in a little while but

556
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,600
um

557
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,200
the thing i always say is if someone

558
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,520
says well is it too late to switch to

559
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,919
security no just pick the next

560
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:19,520
technology that's coming out that no one

561
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,720
else knows

562
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,080
brain dump the heck out of that and

563
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,080
you'll have a job because no one else is

564
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,919
able to keep up with the pace of change

565
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:28,720
that is happening in our industry and so

566
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,320
whether you feel like you might not have

567
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,840
the fundamentals or the education or the

568
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,080
experience to get a job

569
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,919
there is enough out there you can if you

570
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:37,679
want to stay local find all of the

571
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:39,120
opportunities that are local find what

572
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,039
they're looking for and there's likely a

573
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:42,400
shortage in that position and you should

574
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,679
be able to go

575
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:45,600
find a ton of free resources whether

576
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,919
it's you know github awesome lists or

577
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:50,160
youtube or even pay for

578
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,160
for things like pluralsight or cloud

579
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,440
guru or any of those if you want to go

580
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,919
to the cloud just it's not too expensive

581
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:57,280
you don't need to go through a four-year

582
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:00,000
degree to just get in not saying that

583
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,559
that's not valuable because it is but

584
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:03,919
you can break into the market very

585
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:05,440
quickly because what happens is once

586
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,400
you're in

587
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,320
if you are job hopping every few years

588
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,919
not that that's recommended you will

589
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:11,760
constantly be going up every time you

590
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,960
switch positions um whether it's

591
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,799
your experience is growing or your skill

592
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:18,880
sets growing and you are now no longer

593
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,400
providing value to your company or you

594
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,840
feel overqualified you can go find

595
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,840
another opportunity i wouldn't recommend

596
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,360
chasing the money because at the end of

597
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,799
the day you're going to end up in a

598
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:28,559
position where you have just gaps

599
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:30,320
everywhere and you're not going to have

600
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,559
a well-rounded skill set

601
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:33,840
but for the first few years to break

602
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,400
into it it's find the next greatest

603
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,559
technology that someone is is coming out

604
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:40,240
with and just brain dump it that's

605
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,840
probably the fastest way to get into it

606
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,760
yeah i think that's that's a great point

607
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,440
something you mentioned is right now you

608
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,360
shouldn't have a hard time finding a job

609
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,600
right they're they're everywhere they're

610
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,600
it's easier to get but folks that i talk

611
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,559
to that tend to have issues getting jobs

612
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:55,919
i think they're getting in the way

613
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:57,520
themselves they're looking at job

614
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,760
requirements which colin talked about uh

615
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,200
the

616
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,760
sorry the presentation before this

617
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,000
i haven't qualified 100 for any role

618
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,919
that i've had but that doesn't stop me

619
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:10,640
from applying or from talking to hr so

620
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,559
that's one of the things i wanted to

621
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:13,760
make sure you all think about is if

622
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,679
you're looking at jobs

623
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:17,679
don't let the requirements stop you

624
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:19,039
still apply

625
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:20,799
because i think people get in the way

626
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:23,600
themselves unfortunately way too often

627
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,760
yeah i think actually pope offers a

628
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:28,400
service called the old bald white man

629
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,720
service where it's what would an old

630
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,480
bald white dude do

631
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,960
and uh they would just be like

632
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,039
yeah i can do that yeah this is how much

633
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:39,440
i want like with that old bald white

634
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,880
dude confidence

635
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,520
that only comes from being that right so

636
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,520
if you're not an old bald white dude

637
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,960
reach out to pope

638
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,600
he will give you advice on how to to go

639
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,760
forward in your career with that that

640
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,520
level of bravado

641
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,559
um

642
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:56,559
there is something to say about

643
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:58,000
and this is going to sound really bad

644
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,480
the fake it till you make it does apply

645
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,520
but i don't like that it leads to

646
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,960
the the imposter syndrome problem that

647
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,440
we have don't fake it till you make it

648
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,360
and then cause problems and pretend that

649
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,440
you know more than you do be humble and

650
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,120
be honest about it but just you do need

651
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,799
to have a level of confidence of you

652
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:16,880
know no i don't know i'm gonna go figure

653
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,200
that out but yes you kind of need to

654
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,880
lead it on as yeah i can i can solve

655
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,720
that problem i don't know the answer but

656
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,039
i can solve that problem and pope

657
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:26,720
actually gives quite a lot of good

658
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,799
information because a decade ago i don't

659
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:30,720
know how long i've known you um he

660
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,200
looked at me and he was like you know if

661
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,880
i want to go look for a job i just you

662
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,799
could search a certification and how

663
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:38,480
many results pop up on indeed and we had

664
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,559
this conversation the cissp and this is

665
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:41,840
when we were talking about what certs

666
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,280
are relevant he says it doesn't matter

667
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,799
if the start is actually good it's just

668
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:46,559
matter who's looking for those certs

669
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:48,159
because that means that you are a better

670
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:50,400
candidate for those positions so it's a

671
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,679
very interesting perspective that i got

672
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:53,280
so i started doing that i'm like you

673
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,720
know a lot of the search that i didn't

674
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,039
really think i valued there were there

675
00:22:57,039 --> 00:22:59,360
was high demand for and whether i valued

676
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,799
it or not that means that there are

677
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:02,240
people out there looking and seeking for

678
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,240
these these roles whether they

679
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,760
understand the certs or not is a whole

680
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,360
different problem but at least they're

681
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,880
out there and so if you do have a

682
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,200
challenge getting into a position maybe

683
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,000
it's start with some of the

684
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,440
certifications that people are asking

685
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,360
for and just go get those whether you

686
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,880
think you're going to use them or not

687
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:19,039
break into the organization because what

688
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:20,799
will happen more than often than not is

689
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:22,480
once you're in people realize how good

690
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,720
you are at just solving problems and

691
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,080
then it doesn't matter what the search

692
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,120
you have they're just going to ask you

693
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,799
to go do these things and you'll likely

694
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:30,400
be pushed into other positions just

695
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,240
because you're able to solve complex

696
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,280
problems not because you have the

697
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:36,400
certification that says you can uh you

698
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,799
said break in and snow was like yeah

699
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:40,960
break let's go where we going

700
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,960
once you're in they can't make you leave

701
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:43,760
like

702
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,600
unless they push the uh

703
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,039
epo button and

704
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:48,400
fire suppression system comes is that

705
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,200
how they get that you out of the

706
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,480
building how do they get you out she's

707
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,919
in the data center well just sorry i

708
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:54,159
know i know mars is moderating but yeah

709
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:55,760
how do they get you out once you're in

710
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:56,670
i'll leave on my own terms

711
00:23:56,670 --> 00:23:58,960
[Laughter]

712
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:03,039
can we get a definition of my own terms

713
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,039
so yes

714
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:07,600
lunch uh that that

715
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,600
brings up um

716
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,320
a couple of things for me because

717
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,480
a lot of this resonates with how

718
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,840
i've gotten roles

719
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:20,880
though i've tried to move into when i

720
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,559
when i'm looking at a new role what do i

721
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:23,760
get out of it

722
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,120
and

723
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,960
the role that i recently took

724
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,520
i learned more about

725
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,840
routing in linux just to pass the

726
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,520
interview

727
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,880
than

728
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,760
i ever thought i would need like what's

729
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:41,919
the most left-field way that you've

730
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:43,919
learned something new relevant to your

731
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:45,360
job

732
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,120
recently it's

733
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,880
i i think that's a very valid point

734
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,720
really quick to touch on that what are

735
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:53,520
you going to get out of the job um a lot

736
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:54,799
of people don't ask themselves that most

737
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:57,039
of its people say oh i need a job so i

738
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:59,200
can get money and i'm chasing that that

739
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,559
figure in my head and that's how i want

740
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:03,120
to grow my career i've been a big fan of

741
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,400
if you feel

742
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,559
stagnant or that you're not growing in a

743
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:08,720
position it's time to move on

744
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:09,679
whether you're benefiting the

745
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:11,200
organization or not that's great if

746
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,960
unless they're compensating you heavily

747
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,000
for it you should be always growing your

748
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,400
career your skills um even into

749
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,520
retirement

750
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,799
listening to a podcast this morning

751
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:22,720
where someone says you know the average

752
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,880
retirement age 60s but our life

753
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,200
expectancy is in the 80s what happens

754
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,120
people still want to provide value in

755
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,799
their 50s and 60s so it's never too late

756
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:32,960
to continuously grow and if you're

757
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,400
stagnant and you don't feel like you're

758
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,480
growing in a position it's likely time

759
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,960
to move on the flip side of that is if

760
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:42,080
you're new to the industry finding

761
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,840
career opportunities that are going to

762
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:46,240
propel you exponentially

763
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:49,520
whether they come at a lower salary or

764
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:52,240
entry cost keep that in mind don't just

765
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,240
go in saying i need x number of dollars

766
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,559
to pay the bills think about the the

767
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:58,320
other variables that that might apply

768
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,400
where this position gives me opportunity

769
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,120
to learn so many different things

770
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,400
and that's worth

771
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,400
twenty thirty thousand dollars of

772
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,679
schooling right

773
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:09,279
that's a variable that needs to be

774
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:11,760
applied to your calculation that that i

775
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,279
can sit here for two years and the

776
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:15,679
exposure i get in this organization is

777
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:18,159
going to net me a 2x on my salary jump

778
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:19,600
in the next position

779
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,840
yeah i think also like that's an

780
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,840
important point is to find something

781
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:26,400
that challenges you you could go out and

782
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,799
find something that is just easy to do

783
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:31,840
and pays well or whatever but at the end

784
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,279
of the day you will find yourself

785
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:35,520
unfulfilled i

786
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,679
i highly recommend and what's cool about

787
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:40,400
where security has come in in the last

788
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,000
you know 20 years or whatever it's like

789
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,760
when when i started out

790
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,840
um you were just a generalist right you

791
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:48,159
had to do all of the things there wasn't

792
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:50,960
siloed as much as it is today the fact

793
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:53,679
that we have those those specializations

794
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:55,200
is fantastic because there were parts of

795
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,400
security that i just hated right um and

796
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,720
now you can say okay here's the thing i

797
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,159
want to do because that's the thing that

798
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:04,080
challenges me that's what makes me want

799
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,240
to do this job and so you gain

800
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:09,360
satisfaction from that if you are

801
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,960
if you're just doing something that's

802
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,080
easy

803
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,919
you can only do it for so long before

804
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:15,279
you're like

805
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:16,960
okay well now i'm getting up and i'm

806
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,039
just pushing the button like over and

807
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:22,000
over every day and that um

808
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:22,799
it

809
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:24,880
kind of crushes your spirit after a

810
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,799
while like regardless of whether even if

811
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:28,080
it pays well

812
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,320
if you don't have anything out of it

813
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:33,200
yeah so i don't know for me

814
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,200
find the thing that you're excited about

815
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,679
that challenges you and then and do that

816
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:40,080
and it's one of those like you get paid

817
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,720
not i feel like i get paid to to do what

818
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,799
i love anyway so yeah and i think one of

819
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:46,640
the ways to avoid even getting in that

820
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,640
situation is when you're looking at a

821
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,320
new company and you're interviewing with

822
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,440
them

823
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,520
don't let them interview you you

824
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:56,000
interview them that's such a big part of

825
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,200
it i think a lot of people might be

826
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:00,080
missing is you need to make sure that

827
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,760
you know it lives up to your standards

828
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,600
you're going to be challenged you know

829
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,520
what progression career progression

830
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,919
looks like so i think you could actually

831
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:09,919
go into a career

832
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:12,080
with avoiding some of these issues um

833
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:14,480
just by kind of setting things up front

834
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,720
um so everyone's on the same level yes

835
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,440
please do that like understand that i

836
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,799
because i literally i had this

837
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:23,679
experience before um before i came into

838
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:25,600

844
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,640
discussions and at one point they said

845
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:39,279
to me um and this might be the like old

846
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:41,520
balding white dude like confidence or

847

company

861
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,080
like

862
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,320
this is not like i'm not just going to

863
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,000
do something because you're telling me

864
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,159
it's part of the interview process i'm

865
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:18,880
trying to decide whether i see value in

866
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,240
working for you

867
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,720
um again i don't i don't know if that's

868
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,640
some of that pope confidence or whatever

869
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,720
but um but

870
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:30,080
i i had to i had to draw that line i was

871
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:32,320
like you're coming to me and asking me

872
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,799
to come and give you a significant

873
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:37,039
amount of my time and what is really

874
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:40,000
just your waking hours in your life

875
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,919
i want to make sure that this is a

876
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:44,159
beneficial thing for for both of us and

877
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:45,520
so so

878
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,279
don't go into interviews being like oh

879
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:49,120
no i really i think i got to get this

880
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,600
they go no they've got to get you and go

881
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:54,320
in there with that attitude and and

882
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:55,360
hopefully you'll find the thing that

883
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,960
works for you this is what happens when

884
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,320
you're in an employee's market right i

885
00:29:58,320 --> 00:29:59,679

but but i mean would you agree like

919
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:02,799
finding an organization that

920
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:04,799
yeah get them to pay for it even if

921
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:06,000
that's going to come at a cost of you

922
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,279
having to sit there for a year or two

923
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:08,720
right some of them say you know for

924
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,399
every 2 500 that we're going to

925
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:11,840
contribute to your education you need to

926
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,600
give us one year back that's fine

927
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,679
because now you have in your in your

928
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:17,679
head i am getting this out this this is

929
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:19,039
the value i'm getting back for

930
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:20,720
contributing to this organization for

931
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,240
two years and i've done that as well

932
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,679
i've had to go two years for sanserts

933
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:24,799
etc

934
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:26,240
and and that's

935
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,919
that's another variable of if you're

936
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:29,360
going up against a couple of companies

937
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,200
that are all looking to hire you you

938
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,480
could say well this one's going to offer

939
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,159
it that i have to stick around for two

940
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:35,440
years maybe you could do it for a little

941
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,880
less you can play those games a little

942
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:39,200
bit but definitely make sure that you're

943
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,960
interviewing them you're asking for what

944
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,720
certifications are going to cover if

945
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,640
there's other opportunity to

946
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,159
move laterally within the organization

947
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:47,840
if you're uncomfortable you know if it's

948
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:50,080
a i come in i don't like this job

949
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,840
don't necessarily just leave just see if

950
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,919
they have the appetite to move to a

951
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:55,760
different position also very valuable

952
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,039
because that's how

953
00:31:57,039 --> 00:31:58,640
you you want to build that relationship

954
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,880
with your employer that you're going to

955
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,240
give them

956
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,000
as much effort as possible if they're

957
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,519
going to take care of you as you grow

958
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:07,200
your career and often you'll find

959
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,559
they'll help you grow

960
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:10,320
as much as you want even paying for for

961
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,799
full degrees

962
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:14,240
all right that didn't actually answer

963
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,840
your original question yeah i think so i

964
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,120
feel like this is like i feel like this

965
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,640
is like the hacker job fair what else

966
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:21,200
what do you got for us what do you got

967
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,240
what do you got outside a bunch of

968
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,600
questions that actually

969
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,039
gave me

970
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:26,720
i was just joking on some of those but

971
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,799
let's go for the worst ones

972
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:30,799
uh starting with snow

973
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:33,120
uh i'm just kidding

974
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,799
no the one that

975
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:37,360
i liked uh is he didn't like the rest

976
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:40,840
why i don't want to be an ex

977
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:42,399
like um

978
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:44,559
why why wouldn't you

979
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:46,880
want to be a pen tester or

980
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:49,200
a consultant or a threat hunter like

981
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:52,159
let's hear the the dirty the

982
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:54,559
to to qualify or to provide some

983
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:57,120
backstory here we all work in different

984
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:00,240
areas of the industry so

985
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,480
i i have very uh

986
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,919
uh

987
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:06,640
my perspective of your side of the house

988
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,240
is very different than your perspective

989
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,159
of mine so this will be fun why i don't

990
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:11,519
want to be a pen tester why i don't want

991
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:12,960
to be a sock analyst that's kind of

992
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,000
where i was going with the intent of

993
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,440
that question because

994
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,880
i feel that what we've

995
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,559
run into now is

996
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:21,440
a lot of people entering into the market

997
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:24,320
jump into the i'm gonna hack i'm gonna

998
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:27,039
be a red teamer why have you thought

999
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:28,480
that through do you understand the

1000
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,720
complexities of that okay fine i wanna

1001
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,880
be a sock analyst are you aware that's

1002
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:35,039
not a tier one position like that's not

1003
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:36,880
an entry-level position

1004
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,240
there's a lot of these things that the

1005
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:40,880
industry as a whole we can't agree on

1006
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,320
and so

1007
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,679
i was hoping to

1008
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:46,240
have a dialogue on um why wouldn't we

1009
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,559
want to do a specific

1010
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:50,640
job over another as we're growing our

1011
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:53,120
careers or getting into the space

1012
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,240
okay so i'm going to take that but i'm

1013
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,279
going to take it a little bit of a

1014
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:56,880
different approach so i'm going to look

1015
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,399
at it more from a consulting versus

1016
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:01,840
working in an internal organization

1017
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:04,559
kind of pros and cons of both now i have

1018
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:07,600
seen people that start off with internal

1019
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,119
working internal whether it's red or

1020
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:10,719
blue side and then they move to

1021
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:13,199
consulting and it is a game changer

1022
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:15,280
right it's not the pace is completely

1023
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,960
different you have one client you

1024
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,800
normally have a couple weeks months

1025
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,320
whatever it is you have to pump out a

1026
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,760
report and next you're going and if

1027
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,119
you're a consultant right now it's key

1028
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:25,520
for like thoughts and prayers i'm so

1029
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:26,879
sorry for you you shouldn't be in this

1030
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:28,800
room yeah you should be working yeah i'm

1031
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,480
not like they're not emails right now

1032
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,399
yeah um but

1033
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:33,839
i think that there's definitely pros and

1034
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:36,239
cons i think entering into the field i

1035
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:38,560
honestly think consulting because it's

1036
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:39,918
in my opinion a little bit more

1037
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:42,320
stressful um would be a good way to

1038
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,480
start right you're kind of getting in

1039
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,480
there and you're you're being put to the

1040
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,879
test and then moving more towards an

1041
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:50,320
internal role that's that's just my

1042
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,918
thoughts i can see both sides honestly

1043
00:34:51,918 --> 00:34:53,520
but that's kind of

1044
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,599
yeah i think i think like as an example

1045
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:56,960
to

1046
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,200
that is like being an incident response

1047
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,640
right so i'm on the blue team side of

1048
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:01,920
the house now

1049
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,920
i come from a red team background well

1050
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:06,640
to be fair my intro to the industry is

1051
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,560
that i just committed crimes for a

1052
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:11,359
decade um and then uh and then it turned

1053
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:14,320
into a career that was more savory

1054
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,440
but

1055
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,920
like but the um let's say your incident

1056
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,680
response if your internal incident

1057
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:22,720
response then your task with making sure

1058
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:23,920
that all the mitigations that your

1059
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,359
organization has put into place are

1060
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:27,680
effective in keeping

1061
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:30,800
um the bad guys or threat actors out

1062
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,040
right that's incredibly stressful when

1063
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,960
you think about like okay

1064
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,800
um

1065
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:39,040
did we do everything right today did

1066
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:41,040
anybody get in today

1067
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,960
did all of the alerts fire that should

1068
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,800
have that kind of stuff

1069
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:47,280
where if you're doing consulting as

1070
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:49,280
incident response you get a phone call

1071
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,839
that says such and such organization has

1072
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:54,640
been breached friday at 4 pm yes of

1073
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,800
course always but such and such

1074
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,400
organization that has been bri uh

1075
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:01,200
breached we need you to come in

1076
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,599
and like either like supplement that

1077
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:05,760
organization or you are the incident

1078
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,760
responders now and you have to come in

1079
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:10,160
and figure out more investigatory like

1080
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:12,320
what happened and how do we get back to

1081
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:15,200
normal now you weren't responsible for

1082
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,359
that breach or part of the responsible

1083
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:19,599
party for that breach so your level of

1084
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:20,880
stress

1085
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,720
is a little bit different right because

1086
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,960
it's not your organization so somebody's

1087
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,800
not like oh you work for xyz

1088
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,960
organization oh you guys got popped now

1089
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,880
you're saying like oh no i was on the

1090
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,800
team who helped them get right so you

1091
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:35,040
can be in incident response but the

1092
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:37,920
roles or whether you're in consulting or

1093
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,440
sitting behind the keyboard in that

1094
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:42,079
organization become totally different

1095
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:44,800
now as a consultant though you go into

1096
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:47,280
an organization after a breach

1097
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:49,839
and this is where for for me oh by the

1098
00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:52,400
way hi i'm grifter i am the global lead

1099
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,720
for active threat assessments for ibm x4

1100
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,720
so that means essentially our threat

1101
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:59,760
hunting for for companies um going in

1102
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,520
and seeing if an attacker exists within

1103
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:04,240
an environment without evidence already

1104
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:06,079
that they're there right so we go in and

1105
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:07,440
do threat hunting we're going to check

1106
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:09,359
to see if if somebody's in that

1107
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:10,640
environment

1108
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,640
having the responsibility at the end of

1109
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:15,599
that engagement to say

1110
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:17,440
there are no attackers currently

1111
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:20,079
persisting within your environment

1112
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:22,880
is incredibly stressful because what

1113
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:25,119
you're doing is putting your name down

1114
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:26,160
and saying

1115
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,920
we have done everything and we have used

1116
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:30,160
our resources and skills to determine

1117
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:31,839
that there is not an attacker within

1118
00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:34,560
this environment or after a breach

1119
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,640
the attacker is no longer within the

1120
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,400
environment and we have shored up your

1121
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:41,440
defenses so that they will remain out um

1122
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:42,240
for

1123
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:44,079
nebulous time periods i'm like sweating

1124
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:45,359
listening to you right exactly

1125
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:47,359
nerve-wracking so it is stressful in

1126
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:50,720
different ways um that i think that

1127
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,560
piece of it is why

1128
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,640
if i was like playing devil's advocate

1129
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,320
and being like don't go into incident

1130
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,000
response or don't go into like threat

1131
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,400
hunting or whatever

1132
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,880
unless you can say i can handle the

1133
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,640
stress of going

1134
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:08,160
this house is clear right like that

1135
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,560
that man that's heavy that's heavy when

1136
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,560
you do that and you tell a customer yeah

1137
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:14,240
you're good why i don't want to be x

1138
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:15,440
just turned into why i don't want to be

1139
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,640
grifter

1140
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:17,440
yeah

1141
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,960
you even though my bio says otherwise if

1142
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,480
you read it

1143
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:21,760
that's exactly right though it's on the

1144
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:24,320
consultant side of the house is

1145
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,680
not the backup you gave me an

1146
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:28,240
interesting perspective i came from

1147
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:29,920
the customer side i should say the the

1148
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:32,640
institution side and grew up in 15 years

1149
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:33,839
in that space and i'm now on the

1150
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:36,079
consultancy side and i don't know if i'd

1151
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:37,280
want to go the other direction that

1152
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,280
scares the heck out of me but to your

1153
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,960
point

1154
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,800
that stress or that expectation when you

1155
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,400
come in as a consultant you are expected

1156
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:47,680
to be the expert that's very stressful

1157
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:49,119
i wouldn't necessarily want to do that

1158
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:50,720
out of the gate

1159
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,800
but that also means that you're pushed

1160
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:55,680
every single day to learn so the whole

1161
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:58,079
it's a whole other level of growth on

1162
00:38:58,079 --> 00:38:59,839
the consultant side where you usually

1163
00:38:59,839 --> 00:39:01,359
get access to resources to learn and

1164
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:03,119
grow because you are expected to be the

1165
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:06,240
expert and to say your house is clear

1166
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,000
and in order to do that you have to have

1167
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,079
a constant state of development in your

1168
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:12,079
own personal skill sets and so

1169
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:13,599
it's a very interesting and exciting

1170
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:15,200
side to be in

1171
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,800
but why i don't want to do that would be

1172
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,000
the stress

1173
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
um because you at the end of the day

1174
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,599
have to be the one that puts on paper

1175
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:23,920
with your name whatever

1176
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:26,560
the report that you're delivering says

1177
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:28,000
and if that's not accurate they come

1178
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,680
back in six months and says

1179
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:31,440
actually uh plot twist they were in our

1180
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:32,720
environment for another eight months

1181
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:34,560
after that like whoops you know that's

1182
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,800
on you so

1183
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:39,280
and that that's not just with ir really

1184
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,880
any engagement you do in the consultant

1185
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,240
side of the house if you don't deliver

1186
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,440
it right

1187
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:45,200
can lead to problems later on because

1188
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,640
they are expecting that whatever you put

1189
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:50,160
in the report is exactly what happened

1190
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:52,720
or is in place or is architected or is

1191
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:55,200
configured so be aware of that we also

1192
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,040
get into a scope issue right you're

1193
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:59,359
doing a pen test and

1194
00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:01,280
half of their ips are out of scope and

1195
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,720
you say they're good to go you know you

1196
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:04,319
don't find that many vulnerabilities

1197
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:05,680
they think they're good they don't

1198
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:07,680
remember that they have that outscope or

1199
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,440
you have a certain amount of hours to

1200
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:12,720
test in right attackers don't

1201
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,640
so yeah you have that working against

1202
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:16,319
you like there's a lot you only have

1203
00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:18,000
like a 40 to 80 hour engagement and

1204
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,599
you're like yeah you're clean for the 80

1205
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:21,200
hours that i tested you no one puts that

1206
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:22,720
in the report or tells that to

1207
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:24,000
leadership they just said we had a pen

1208
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,839
test we're clean even though you might

1209
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:27,200
actually have evidence that the out of

1210
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,920
scope and ips have information that is

1211
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,680
easily accessible

1212
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:32,880
but you just can't touch it because of

1213
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:35,200
the scope so scope is always fun there

1214
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,839
is never any

1215
00:40:36,839 --> 00:40:39,119
scope again probably didn't answer your

1216
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:41,839
question yeah that's fine this is a

1217
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:43,440
entertaining

1218
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:44,800
it usually is we're just gonna give this

1219
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,319
thing now we all stressed ourselves out

1220
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:47,760
now i'm just like completely stressed

1221
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,280
out now grifter's gonna beatbox all

1222
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,800
right so

1223
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:53,359
let's pivot a little bit um

1224
00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:56,078
what is

1225
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:00,319
what is the uh the way that you

1226
00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:03,760
make your jobs have fun like

1227
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:06,880
we all need something that

1228
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:09,359
keeps us involved that is

1229
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:11,920
you know not exactly what we do for our

1230
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:14,160
day job isn't it snow breaks into

1231
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:16,079
companies for a living what's not fun

1232
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:17,599
about that

1233
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:18,720
these two found jobs that i actually

1234
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:20,640
really enjoy no matter what because at

1235
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,720
the end of the day they could say

1236
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:25,839
uh yeah you're vulnerable or here is

1237
00:41:25,839 --> 00:41:28,400
your data center badge or yes we we

1238
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,880
found this have a nice day

1239
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,319
and at the end of the day after you've

1240
00:41:32,319 --> 00:41:33,920
done your job in the consultant world

1241
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:35,680
you kind of move on to the next problem

1242
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:37,359
you don't have to drag that out and so

1243
00:41:37,359 --> 00:41:38,800
that's fun it's fun that you don't have

1244
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:41,440
to think about it for six months yeah i

1245
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:42,960
yeah i agree

1246
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:45,359
another way that i make my job more

1247
00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:48,160
enjoyable is i love training so we have

1248
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:51,040
interns apprenticeships co-ops

1249
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,480
externships

1250
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:55,200
a lot of ships um but i love being

1251
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:56,800
involved and training new people it's

1252
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,400
like one of my passions so that's

1253
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,160
definitely a way where i'm able to

1254
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:02,480
knowledge share and then see people grow

1255
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:03,920
so that's one of the ways i absolutely

1256
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:04,880
love

1257
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:05,680
it's a good way to put it like

1258
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:07,520
mentorship as you're progressing your

1259
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:08,800
career

1260
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:11,520
find a mentor and and be a mentor is

1261
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:13,440
really critical because you can be both

1262
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:15,359
at the same time what i really enjoy

1263
00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:18,400
about my job is or how i keep my job fun

1264
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:20,400
is when i find an area that i don't want

1265
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,640
to work in i can hopefully try and bring

1266
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,319
someone else into that that is really

1267
00:42:24,319 --> 00:42:26,400
excited about it so i one of my skill

1268
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,160
sets is finding

1269
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:30,000
people finding opportunities and

1270
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,680
connecting them i don't need to do the

1271
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:33,680
work and so i that's what i feel i'm

1272
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:35,839
really good at and as a result i get to

1273
00:42:35,839 --> 00:42:37,359
work on things that are enjoyable from

1274
00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:38,480
like a high level architecture

1275
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:40,480
perspective but i know that there is an

1276
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:42,000
engineer that really wants to get into

1277
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,920
the details and i can say there you go

1278
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:45,440
and i get to move on and back to the

1279
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:47,839
next happy job or net project so that's

1280
00:42:47,839 --> 00:42:50,960
how i enjoy my job and keep it fun

1281
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:54,319
i just i just really like finding

1282
00:42:54,319 --> 00:42:55,839
attackers who

1283
00:42:55,839 --> 00:42:58,560
are hiding really well right and then

1284
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:00,079
when you have that

1285
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:02,000
that kind of like aha moment when you

1286
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,480
see something and you're like i got you

1287
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:05,599
sucka

1288
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:07,599
right like i don't know like i i really

1289
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:10,839
enjoy that like there is that

1290
00:43:10,839 --> 00:43:13,680
um i don't know like you you feel you're

1291
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:15,760
an investigator right like and i mean in

1292
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,839
the nerdiest way possible but you're an

1293
00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:19,920
investigator so i get that like sherlock

1294
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:22,480
holmes moment where it's like you see

1295
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:24,720
that that breadcrumb that you start to

1296
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:27,119
follow and and it leads you to an

1297
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:29,599
attacker hanging out in an environment

1298
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:31,040
um

1299
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:33,280
i i just i get a rush from that what

1300
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:35,359
about probably always will bad attackers

1301
00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:37,680
with like i mean bad upset like really

1302
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:38,720
obvious

1303
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:41,040
oh yeah well that's that's fun too like

1304
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:42,400
i mean finding stuff where you're just

1305
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:43,599
like how

1306
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:45,680
like

1307
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:48,480
where you go how did no one see this

1308
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:50,319
right like they're literally just

1309
00:43:50,319 --> 00:43:53,680
stomping all over the place um

1310
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:54,960
you know i'm just waiting for a grifter

1311
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:56,640
takedown video where he joins the fbi on

1312
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:57,520
a raid

1313
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:58,880
i found you and i'm going to knock on

1314
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:01,040
the door so i mean uh

1315
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:03,839
pope and i were hunters together at rsa

1316
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:05,440
before we've gone on to to different

1317
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:07,040
places but um

1318
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:09,119
but one of

1319
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:11,920
the most like kind of moments where you

1320
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:15,680
just go like that just happened um is

1321
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:17,440
when you're and i know you've had this

1322
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:18,640
experience just in the last couple of

1323
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:21,119
weeks because we talked about it but

1324
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:23,119
where you go to demonstrate what you're

1325
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:24,560
about to do like you're trying to

1326
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:26,160
explain to somebody like what a threat

1327
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:28,640
hunt is right and and what the actions

1328
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:29,599
are that you're going to take to

1329
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:31,359
hopefully find whether or not an

1330
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:33,200
attacker is within the environment and

1331
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:36,480
so you give them an example of something

1332
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:38,319
really simple where you just go like

1333
00:44:38,319 --> 00:44:40,480
let's look at this and there and you're

1334
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:42,880
like okay and then you go

1335
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:44,560
well that's weird

1336
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:46,560
and then you start to go and you find an

1337
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:48,960
attacker within moments of arriving on

1338
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:51,599
site like there's so so that happened

1339
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:54,000
pumping those roi numbers right yeah so

1340
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,920
so like so there are times where it's

1341
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:59,119
like blindingly obvious um and i'll just

1342
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:01,040
i'll story time with grifter for like

1343
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:01,920
you know

1344
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:03,920
um you know no you know i won't let's

1345
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:05,680
we'll save story time for the let's do

1346
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:07,680
hallway con yeah the the common theme

1347
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:09,680
there though is the best dopamine hits

1348
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:11,200
come from a lot of stress

1349
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:12,960
so to keep your job exciting and

1350
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,240
interesting

1351
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:16,480
it may be counter-intuitive to say this

1352
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:17,599
really sucks i'm going to keep pushing

1353
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:19,839
through but once you get that aha moment

1354
00:45:19,839 --> 00:45:22,319
or you get over that hump that's the

1355
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:23,920
best endorphin

1356
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:26,240
it's yeah and it just keeps you going so

1357
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:27,040
don't

1358
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:30,720
avoid the stressful or the the difficult

1359
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:33,520
just because it's boring or monotonous

1360
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:35,599
or not fun because it will get you to

1361
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:37,280
that next level of oh man that was

1362
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:40,640
amazing where's the next one

1363
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:43,839
well we we've got about uh probably five

1364
00:45:43,839 --> 00:45:44,839
more

1365
00:45:44,839 --> 00:45:47,119
minutes what's that that's a time check

1366
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:49,200
because we'll keep going

1367
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:50,800
um

1368
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:52,800
we've got three great storytellers up

1369
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:54,640
here does anybody have questions for

1370
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:56,480
these people

1371
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:57,839
i was like don't raise your hand pope

1372
00:45:57,839 --> 00:46:01,839
because there's a mic right behind pope

1373
00:46:04,319 --> 00:46:06,079
so this is a question for all of you but

1374
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:08,480
particularly for snow

1375
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:11,040
what is the most absolutely wack you

1376
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:12,720
didn't think it was going to work thing

1377
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:15,200
that you tried that ended up working

1378
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:17,119
okay so this was actually the last

1379
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:19,920
physical pen test that i did um right

1380
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:22,079
before covet hit it was the first week

1381
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:25,359
of march in new york city i was in the

1382
00:46:25,359 --> 00:46:26,800
county i was in

1383
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:28,640
it was like during the

1384
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:30,560
when everything their first case broke

1385
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:32,800
out so everyone was freaking out but the

1386
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:34,240
thing that i did i didn't think was

1387
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:35,520
going to work

1388
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:38,720
so i was breaking into this building and

1389
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:42,160
i found online they had a form to print

1390
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:43,680
out and fill out information to get a

1391
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:45,280
guest badge you didn't even have to go

1392
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:46,400
through

1393
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:49,839
um any any like logins or anything it

1394
00:46:49,839 --> 00:46:51,920
was just online so i printed it out i

1395
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:53,440
filled out my information and i show up

1396
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:54,880
to the security guard to see if you give

1397
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:56,800
me a guest badge and he did i was really

1398
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:58,640
excited so i kind of thought that might

1399
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:00,800
work and it worked but this is the cool

1400
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:03,359
part the next day what i did is the pass

1401
00:47:03,359 --> 00:47:05,440
was it was just a paper um so i did the

1402
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:07,200
next days i just cut out a piece of

1403
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:08,960
paper from my hotel room like the little

1404
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:10,880
cards and i was like i'm gonna see if

1405
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:12,560
this works if i just flash this to him

1406
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:14,000
nothing is on it and see if he'll still

1407
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,599
let me in i'm like okay he's gonna catch

1408
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:17,920
that and he didn't so i still got to go

1409
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:19,359
in so that was that was a pretty

1410
00:47:19,359 --> 00:47:21,440
exciting one like psychic paper like you

1411
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:22,800
were a doctor yeah the doctor who

1412
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:25,839
tricked yeah yeah

1413
00:47:25,839 --> 00:47:26,640
um

1414
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:29,359
yeah i guess so so mine also comes from

1415
00:47:29,359 --> 00:47:31,760
um so i still do consulting like red

1416
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:34,400
team stuff because it's just fun um so

1417
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:35,839
while i live on the blue team side of

1418
00:47:35,839 --> 00:47:37,599
the house most of the time i still like

1419
00:47:37,599 --> 00:47:39,359
to break into places

1420
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:42,079
and in this one particular engagement we

1421
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:45,200
had um essentially access to not only

1422
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:46,960
their surveillance system but also all

1423
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:49,440
of the electronic locks and we thought

1424
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:51,520
that we thought maybe we could trigger

1425
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:53,520
this remotely and open a door and in

1426
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:55,359
this situation we were in a satellite

1427
00:47:55,359 --> 00:47:57,920
location where we had like it was very

1428
00:47:57,920 --> 00:47:59,920
it was very um

1429
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:01,680
hollywood-y right like we were like we

1430
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:03,119
had to jump over a barbed wire fence and

1431
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:04,720
do all whatever moving the security

1432
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:06,400
cameras all this stuff and when we got

1433
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:09,520
to the door we called back uh you know

1434
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:12,079
on radio to to overwatch and we were

1435
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:14,800
like okay we're we're at the door and

1436
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:16,960
like the the guy sitting back behind the

1437
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:19,119
keyboard you know goes all right opening

1438
00:48:19,119 --> 00:48:20,640
the door

1439
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:23,839
and it went beep and it went green and

1440
00:48:23,839 --> 00:48:25,200
we just kind of looked at each other and

1441
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:26,319
we were like

1442
00:48:26,319 --> 00:48:27,680
no way

1443
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:29,200
no one got this on

1444
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:30,240
like

1445
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:32,400
that just happened like i mean it was

1446
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:35,280
the most like hollywood nonsense that

1447
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:37,440
that we'd ever done and um

1448
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:39,599
it just it was really really satisfying

1449
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:41,440
to be like somebody three miles away

1450
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:43,440
just triggered this door and it let us

1451
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:45,839
in and so yeah we were just like i can't

1452
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:47,280
believe that actually worked and we had

1453
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:49,760
cloned badges so we were ready to go in

1454
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:51,680
anyway right but

1455
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:54,640
just standing there going open the door

1456
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:57,599
and then boop we're like no

1457
00:48:57,599 --> 00:48:58,640
i told you we should have bought the

1458
00:48:58,640 --> 00:48:59,839
gopros

1459
00:48:59,839 --> 00:49:01,280
yeah totally

1460
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:02,960
somewhat insulted i thought you were

1461
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:04,800
gonna go for the fingerprints you know i

1462
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:05,920
thought about that right after i said

1463
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:07,520
that story because that's my story not

1464
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:10,319
the fingerprint one because it wasn't me

1465
00:49:10,319 --> 00:49:13,040
so um

1466
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:14,960
i can't provide too much backstory

1467
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:15,839
because that'll take more than five

1468
00:49:15,839 --> 00:49:19,280
minutes or two minutes now if that um

1469
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:20,720
at st con there's a contest called the

1470
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:23,839
vault in the first year that it was run

1471
00:49:23,839 --> 00:49:25,359
by nate and chunk

1472
00:49:25,359 --> 00:49:27,839
you had to break in and you

1473
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:29,520
got into this box and you got a tamper

1474
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:30,960
evident bag out of it you didn't know

1475
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:33,839
what was in it so then the idea was to

1476
00:49:33,839 --> 00:49:35,520
try and open up the tamper evident bag

1477
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:37,280
without someone noticing and you had to

1478
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:38,880
return it and inside the tamper event

1479
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:41,599
bag was a usb stick and the usb stick

1480
00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:42,720
contained

1481
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:44,720
i think it was a dump of etsy shadow or

1482
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:46,720
something like that and you had to grab

1483
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:48,880
that crack it and provide the password

1484
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:50,160
to win

1485
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:51,680
well we didn't want to open the bag

1486
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:53,040
because we weren't very good at tamper

1487
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:54,559
evident and so we said well why don't we

1488
00:49:54,559 --> 00:49:57,599
just tap the usb stick through the bag

1489
00:49:57,599 --> 00:50:00,079
like is that possible i remember that we

1490
00:50:00,079 --> 00:50:01,359
didn't know if it was possible so we're

1491
00:50:01,359 --> 00:50:03,040
like what would it need well probably

1492
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:04,319
some like lancing needles where can we

1493
00:50:04,319 --> 00:50:06,480
get those walmart okay we got a strip

1494
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:08,800
apart a usb cable and what wires do we

1495
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:10,480
even use we should have read the usb

1496
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:12,640
spec prior to doing this by the way

1497
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:14,480
um so we're able to do it we had to

1498
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:16,319
create a jig to like get through the

1499
00:50:16,319 --> 00:50:18,880
tamper evident bag and find out how to

1500
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:20,240
like tap

1501
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:22,640
the the contacts and without you have to

1502
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:24,000
find a spot in the bag that wasn't gonna

1503
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,040
be noticeable because it was probably to

1504
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:26,400
burn the bag

1505
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:28,480
and when we're hooking it up we're able

1506
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:30,640
we're getting usb connectivity

1507
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:31,680
and

1508
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:33,839
we didn't know how long we had or or how

1509
00:50:33,839 --> 00:50:35,520
much we had to stay on the contact so

1510
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:36,960
i'm trying to refresh it and trying to

1511
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:39,200
copy down the data off the usb stick and

1512
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:41,359
and henry who was with us he was holding

1513
00:50:41,359 --> 00:50:42,880
the needles and and of course dark

1514
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:45,280
matter was was involved as he usually is

1515
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:47,839
and he's over there um

1516
00:50:47,839 --> 00:50:49,760
screaming at all of us actually well

1517
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:53,119
what we didn't realize was usb has um

1518
00:50:53,119 --> 00:50:55,920
a gauge of wire requirement spec i think

1519
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:57,200
it's like 26 gauge or whatever and the

1520
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:58,960
lancing needles were not that so as

1521
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:00,640
we're communicating with the usb stick

1522
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:02,720
trying to pull this data off the lancing

1523
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:04,880
needles are burning hot and burning is

1524
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:06,960
henry's fingers and so he's still

1525
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:08,880
holding them trying to maintain contact

1526
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:12,000
i refresh it it pops up as a usb device

1527
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:15,040
i mount it and extract it and we get the

1528
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:17,040
the password file off the usb through

1529
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:19,680
the tamper evident bag before we burn

1530
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:21,520
the cable and we and dark matter was

1531
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:23,520
able to crack it in like five seconds so

1532
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:26,000
that's probably the gangster yeah

1533
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,319
for a contest for a contest but the

1534
00:51:28,319 --> 00:51:30,079
point of that being that aha moment we

1535
00:51:30,079 --> 00:51:32,240
had no idea we everyone

1536
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:34,240
just you just pushed yourselves to just

1537
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:35,440
what can we do

1538
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:36,800
and that's where you get the biggest aha

1539
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:39,520
moments i can't believe that worked try

1540
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:41,119
things you don't think are possible and

1541
00:51:41,119 --> 00:51:43,359
you'll get that

1542
00:51:43,359 --> 00:51:46,558
anybody else have any questions

1543
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:48,559
