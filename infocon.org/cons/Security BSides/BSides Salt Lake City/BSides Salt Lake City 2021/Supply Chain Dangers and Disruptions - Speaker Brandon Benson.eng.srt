1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:03,280
get started

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:05,359
so

3
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:07,040
glad to be here good to see everybody

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:07,919
here

5
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:10,000
it's good to see lots of faces from st

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,519
con and other conferences we've seen

7
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:12,719
this year

8
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:14,080
all right i typically start off my

9
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,200
meetings

10
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,600
at work with some type of joke so

11
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:18,880
here you go

12
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,720
what did one dna sequence say to the

13
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,519
other dna of sequence

14
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:27,278
do these genes make me look fat

15
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:29,279
so if you got nothing else from today at

16
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:30,720
least you can take something home to get

17
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,800
a smile out of it

18
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,600
so who am i my name is brandon benson

19
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,399
i've been a cispy for a really long time

20
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:40,000
i currently run a sock for one of the

21
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,160
silicon slip

22
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,360
companies

23
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,360
i've been in cyber security longer than

24
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,600
i care to admit so

25
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,559
um i definitely am a curious learner

26
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:52,399
i think this is a great field to be in

27
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:56,079
if we want to continue to do to do that

28
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:58,399
so what have i done over the last 15

29
00:00:58,399 --> 00:00:59,840
plus years i've worked with lots of

30
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,399
companies to secure sensitive data

31
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:05,360
either encrypting it or auditing it or

32
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,280
working with them to make sure their

33
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,040
information is secure

34
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,799
i've investigated breaches from both

35
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,119
internal and external sources

36
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:15,200
i've broken a lot of stuff

37
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,360
a lot of stuff and i've fixed a few

38
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,000
things too

39
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,680
so why this presentation so a lot of our

40
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,759
jobs still in the cyber security space

41
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:29,520
it's the cyber footprint for all of our

42
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,799
employers

43
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,360
i think in a good many cases as i work

44
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,960
with as i've worked with different

45
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,280
companies in the world i've noticed that

46
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,079
we do a really good job of implementing

47
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:42,159
and coveraging covering risk and

48
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:44,079
mitigating risk for our internal

49
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:45,119
networks

50
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:47,759
we do a fairly good job in most cases of

51
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:49,840
segmenting if you've got to do any type

52
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,159
of compliance you do a pretty good job

53
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:54,960
of making sure that patches are somewhat

54
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,200
in place you've got a risk management

55
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,240
program

56
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,640
you've got some of the basics covered

57
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,600
you get

58
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,840
robust access controls in place you have

59
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,360
your active directories and stuff like

60
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,439
that

61
00:02:06,439 --> 00:02:08,239
unfortunately

62
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:10,479
attacks continue to evolve

63
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:11,920
and we've seen that i think over the

64
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,120
last year

65
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,120
and attackers continue to evolve with

66
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,760
those attacks to develop new techniques

67
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,599
or maybe old techniques we'll talk a

68
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:21,280
little bit about that

69
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,400
and so i don't think it'll ever end for

70
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,920
blue teamers and i don't think it'll

71
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,000
ever end for defenders

72
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,560
so this year probably last year

73
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,400
last december i think was the biggest

74
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,400
one we've seen where you start seeing

75
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,720
supply chain attacks in the cyber space

76
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,560
not just in the physical space

77
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,560
for me a lot of supply chain seemed

78
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,879
theoretical until i saw it kind of hit

79
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:45,760
home

80
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,840
so supply chain attacks when i thought

81
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,360
about it if you'd asked me three years

82
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,160
ago i'd say yeah i've done audits on

83
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,480
systems or in companies where they take

84
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,360
sensitive hardware and i go through with

85
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,239
the company i walk through from when the

86
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:02,080
company receives the hardware into the

87
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,200
warehouse

88
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,440
how they send it to a secure cage to

89
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,280
flash it with the

90
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,519
encryption keys and stuff like that how

91
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:11,280
they track it from the secure cage out

92
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,360
to the loading dock track it from the

93
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,519
loading dock to the end user at which

94
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:17,440
point it's implemented and that could be

95
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,879
an hsm it could be a pos device and i

96
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:22,400
would watch all of that and try and

97
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,640
determine where people could break in

98
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,840
and add code or add their own firmware

99
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,040
or

100
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,120
hijack a truck to steal it so they could

101
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,599
replace it with other things other types

102
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,040
of supply chains

103
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,640
i've looked at would be

104
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,159
things like okay

105
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,879
i'm going to hijack a semi-truck i'm

106
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:42,239
going to

107
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:44,879
put in a bunch of like fake gucci purses

108
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:46,560
so they get the retail stores and get

109
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,120
sold for a whole lot of money

110
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,480
things like that

111
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,000
but i don't think supply chains in the

112
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,760
cyberspace is new

113
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,360
a few years ago like in the early 2000s

114
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,840
western digital which is a hard drive

115
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,920
manufacturer ended up with a problem

116
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,760
with a whole batch of their hard drives

117
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,000
that came out of asia

118
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,159
what happened was somebody actually took

119
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:10,640
the hard drive and before as a hard

120
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,319
drive was flashed in the bootloader

121
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:15,280
section so the part that doesn't get

122
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,759
re-imaged when you re-image a drive they

123
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:19,839
put in a piece of malware that would end

124
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,839
up stealing data

125
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,520
western digital found out about that

126
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,240
that ended up happening in their factory

127
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,080
and they had to recall a whole batch of

128
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,600
hard drives and then fix the issue

129
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,199
other things i've seen

130
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:36,000
kind of in my career is pos pos devices

131
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,880
swap

132
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,040
so credit card fraud has been a big deal

133
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,960
for a really long time

134
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,720
and so we see stores

135
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,280
that you'll walk into a store or a 711

136
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,520
and you'll see people put cameras on pos

137
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,240
devices or you'll see them swap out pos

138
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,080
devices with compromised devices that

139
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,320
look the same or you'll see them put

140
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,080
little skimmers inside the devices so

141
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,240
they can steal your credit card data

142
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,160
and so that type of supply chain attack

143
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,320
has not been anything new the pci

144
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,400
council came out and put guidance around

145
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,800
merchants to say check your devices if

146
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,080
they seem like they've been tampered

147
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,000
with you should probably get them

148
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,479
replaced

149
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,320
so shipping industry

150
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,960
mercantile none of that should be new as

151
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,280
far as supply chain

152
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,000
one of the intriguing ones was a few

153
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,759
years ago at defcon a security

154
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:25,520
conference somebody actually placed

155
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,600
malware inside the cd and one of the

156
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,639
programs so when people got home and

157
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:32,720
opened the cd they actually ended up

158
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,320
infecting their computers with malware

159
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,440
however there's a few that are probably

160
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,199
worth talking about that we've seen

161
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:42,639
emerge over

162
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:44,800
recently and we'll go through

163
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,520
two or three key studies to see

164
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,520
if we can learn something or see if we

165
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,800
can implement controls or

166
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,880
recommendations to make our

167
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,000
environments a little bit more secure

168
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,919
uh before we start though like it's

169
00:05:57,919 --> 00:05:59,680
beneficial to understand a typical

170
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,479
attacker methodology so most attacks

171
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:04,960
follow four general steps there's

172
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,720
typically some type of reconnaissance

173
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,639
well let's see if this video will play

174
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,400
so

175
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,319
it's some type of thieving of data and

176
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:13,680
you should say some type of crazy

177
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,639
thieving of data so this is an office

178
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:18,240
i work for

179
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,639
on occasion to sideline that person who

180
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,479
just walked out had walked into the

181
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:23,440
office

182
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,160
um it's a therapy office so the

183
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,160
therapist was there they left their

184
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,919
office for a minute that person walked

185
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:33,520
in what they had under their um coat or

186
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,120
their sweater if you'll notice is a

187
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:35,919
little

188
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:37,680
bricky looking right

189
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,600
because they just took the therapist

190
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,000
laptop and her purse and her little

191
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,080
booklet and stuff like that

192
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,000
i got called in as soon as we found out

193
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,199
we identified it on the camera

194
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,759
and then we went ahead and contacted law

195
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:54,319
enforcement so this is here in utah

196
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:56,319
then we were able to track they lost

197
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:58,240
their phone as well so then we were able

198
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,759
to use some of the tools on the phone

199
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:01,199
and the laptop to find out where this

200
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:03,520
particular individual was

201
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,520
met the police officers down at a local

202
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,280
mall as they were trying to spend as

203
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,639
much money as they could on the person's

204
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:10,560
credit card and ended up actually

205
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,599
getting that person arrested so

206
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,280
that's the type of supply chain attack

207
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,199
we talk about

208
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:20,240
it was fun it's a little exciting to be

209
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,000
able to be part of that

210
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,800
but in many cases what attackers do

211
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,199
in the cyber world is they'll do

212
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:30,000
reconnaissance just like anybody else

213
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,520
you see strange people driving in your

214
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,639
neighborhood

215
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:34,560
you see attackers probing your system

216
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,360
trying to identify what software what

217
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,039
applications you're running they'll look

218
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:40,800
at your website to see what vendors or

219
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,720
suppliers you use

220
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,319
once they figure that out then they'll

221
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:46,240
try and figure out how to execute or get

222
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,039
access to your system in some way

223
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:51,280
once attackers gain access they'll

224
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,360
deliver a payload to try and steal as

225
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,360
much data as they can as in as little

226
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,599
time as possible without being caught of

227
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:59,360
course

228
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,360
they'll use vulnerabilities to use

229
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,759
social engineering they'll use suppliers

230
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:05,440
they'll use vendors they'll use a whole

231
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,800
bunch of things and then they'll go

232
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,599
ahead and steal that data and exploit it

233
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:11,759
and then elevate privileges install

234
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:13,199
persistence

235
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:15,599
and then they'll take whatever they can

236
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:17,280
typically as a last resort if there's

237
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,440
nothing interesting on

238
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,680
that system it's not uncommon to see

239
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,919
people place crypto miners

240
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:26,879
it's also not uncommon and this is why

241
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,440
we kind of talk and harp to like our

242
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,360
friends and relatives don't download

243
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,039
unlicensed software and stuff like that

244
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:35,599
it's not it's not uncommon to see

245
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:37,679
malware placed in those programs as well

246
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:39,839
that either place crypto miners or

247
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:42,080
credential stealing

248
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,200
programs or anything like that in place

249
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,959
let's talk about a few

250
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:49,040
different types of attack vectors i

251
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,680
think are worth mentioning

252
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,760
third party software vulnerabilities so

253
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,640
a year ago a huge one came out

254
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,560
and i vowed not to use it because it's

255
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,000
been talked about a lot so i used a

256
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,120
different one

257
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,880
so

258
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,080
in the last 12 months there was a

259
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,600
ticketing system

260
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,040
that's used

261
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,800
both on internal ticketing systems for

262
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,200
companies as well as for companies to

263
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,120
use for customers their customers to

264
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,200
issue tickets when there's a problem

265
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,720
that tickety system came out with the

266
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,880
vulnerab critical vulnerability that

267
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,760
allowed an attacker to bypass system

268
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,680
authentication through remote code

269
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,440
execution vulnerability

270
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,600
so the ticketing systems many of those

271
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,920
were actually publicly exposed

272
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,160
and within a few days and this is one of

273
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,720
the points that i'll bring up within a

274
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,720
few days of that that vulnerability

275
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,120
being released attackers had developed a

276
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,560
proof of concept code so they could

277
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,640
actually take an attack and exploit that

278
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,240
vulnerability

279
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,120
much or very much within or

280
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,959
very much before the 30 days that you

281
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:51,440
typically see compliance

282
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,560
[Music]

283
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,120
groups actually say you need to patch

284
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,959
right so i was driving to work one

285
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:59,200
morning i heard about this in one of our

286
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,720
news feeds i subscribed to

287
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,760
and then

288
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:06,240
based on that as i got into work i

289
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,680
worked with my team and said we need to

290
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,120
go find every

291
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,480
system that is this product that is

292
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,320
vulnerable and then we need to make sure

293
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,920
that one we haven't been attacked and

294
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,600
two we make sure it's patched or

295
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,440
mitigated in some way

296
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,959
right

297
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:22,720
in our case we had sawed several

298
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,120
different probes as we looked at it it

299
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,320
was

300
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,480
if we looked at the timeline of when the

301
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,959
exploit was made publicly available it

302
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:32,560
was probably within two hours that we

303
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,720
saw probes against our systems

304
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,880
or our environments and then from there

305
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,160
we ended up

306
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,079
tearing down a couple of those servers

307
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:42,160
rebuilding them and then for the others

308
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,519
that had not

309
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:45,120
been accessed we were able to get

310
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,640
mitigations in place to prevent the

311
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,240
attack

312
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,320
and so i think

313
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,320
it's very much the third party software

314
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,480
vulnerabilities are all over the place

315
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,120
earlier this year apache came out with a

316
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,959
remote code execution vulnerability as

317
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:00,480
well

318
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,640
last december there was a huge one that

319
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,160
came out

320
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,320
so that's definitely something as far as

321
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,120
that goes but how do we

322
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,279
how do we prevent this well many times

323
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:13,760
we can't we rely on these third-party

324
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,360
software vulnerabilities or these

325
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,839
third-party softwares we need them to be

326
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:19,200
able to get our systems and our

327
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,760
environments and our applications to run

328
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,360
but there are some recommendations that

329
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,440
we can implement that will actually make

330
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,360
us do a little bit better

331
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,959
one is know your publicly exposed

332
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:31,040
services i don't know how many companies

333
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,640
i've worked with or audited where i'm

334
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,079
like did you know this is public they're

335
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:35,120
like no

336
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,399
i'm like did you know this other

337
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:37,839
application was public they're like it's

338
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:39,760
not public i'm like well here it is from

339
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,360
the internet

340
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,360
so understand your publicly exposed

341
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,480
services

342
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,720
understand the software that is behind

343
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,279
those publicly exposed services and then

344
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:50,720
limit

345
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,720
lock those down as far as configurations

346
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,279
go and limit those exposed services to

347
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:57,360
only what's necessary if you can put

348
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,639
them in behind some type of

349
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:01,519
authentication great if you can't then

350
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:03,680
make sure you're up to date subscribe to

351
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,680
the newsfeeds of those vendors so that

352
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,680
as critical patches or as critical

353
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,920
vulnerabilities are released you can go

354
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,519
through and make sure you're aware of

355
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:13,519
those and then work with the teams to

356
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:16,000
make sure those are patched

357
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,480
mitigate and patch as soon as possible

358
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,480
sometimes you can't patch

359
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,160
because there's no patch for it but you

360
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,880
can mitigate you can block ports you can

361
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,560
block services you can restrict to

362
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,880
certain ip ranges and stuff like that

363
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:32,320
30 30 days these days is way too long

364
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,560
i know pci and suk2 and some of these

365
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,000
others say yeah patch your critical

366
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,560
vulnerabilities within 30 days

367
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,399
if you wait 30 days and there's a proof

368
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:42,480
of concept code that's out in the wild

369
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,760
you're too late

370
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:44,959
so

371
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:47,040
we've seen that anywhere from three

372
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,959
hours to two days

373
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:50,720
attacks start happening on the internet

374
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,720
so that we see people trying to probe

375
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,160
and find vulnerabilities so that they

376
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:57,040
can exploit them

377
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,040
yeah case one

378
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:02,000
case two third-party access vendors it's

379
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,320
not uncommon for companies to hire out

380
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,760
for vendors

381
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,399
to

382
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:09,360
take a look at their their systems to

383
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,880
provide support or other types of access

384
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,320
and it's not uncommon for vendor

385
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,560
contractors to have system access or

386
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,240
support there to support other

387
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,839
activities

388
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:23,279
way back in 2014 if anyone followed the

389
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:24,959
target breach that's kind of what

390
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:27,519
happened right

391
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:30,560
the hvac vendor had access to target

392
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,240
systems and

393
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,320
a hacker compromised through a fishing i

394
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,560
believe it was phishing the hvac vendor

395
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,839
from there they were able to grab the

396
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:39,120
credentials

397
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,320
of

398
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,240
that the vendor used to log into target

399
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,760
and then from there they compromised all

400
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,560
of target systems which was an awesome

401
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,160
hack for a bunch of credit cards to be

402
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,000
stolen

403
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,360
we continue to see this right

404
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,839
i investigated one recently well there's

405
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:58,399
two actually for vendors so i'll talk

406
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,839
about both cases

407
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:03,440
um outside of the target one the other

408
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,480
one i've seen is um there are times that

409
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,240
vendors will use third-party companies

410
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,160
to provide certain types of support for

411
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,079
their environments as well

412
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:14,720
it could be a call center it could be an

413
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,199
e-commerce or e-support desk or anything

414
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:19,360
like that

415
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,760
so the first one i talked about is

416
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,839
if you have a vendor contractor and they

417
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:26,639
get compromised then those conditions

418
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:27,920
credentials can be used to then

419
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,760
compromise your systems i've

420
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,160
investigated probably five or six in the

421
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,480
last 10 years or that's actually been

422
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,600
the case

423
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,600
the other one that i've seen

424
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,680
that's kind of interesting as well and

425
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,360
we start to see it here and there on the

426
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,040
news but not a lot but it's a real

427
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:46,000
threat is when vendors are

428
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,480
become insider threats right that's

429
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,320
where you see a vendor that's been hired

430
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,399
to do certain services for you it could

431
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:54,720
be call center e

432
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,240
system support

433
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,639
monitoring troubleshooting and you give

434
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:01,360
them unfair to access to those systems

435
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:05,600
that vendor gets bribed or otherwise

436
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,639
contacted by an adversary saying hey if

437
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:10,959
you will i'll pay you x y z number of

438
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:12,240
dollars if you'll give me some

439
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,920
credentials or if you'll start to pull

440
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,079
some data out for me and depending on

441
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:18,160
where those third-party vendors are that

442
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,240
could be really tempting i did an

443
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,839
investigation a couple years ago where

444
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:25,360
that happened where i was working

445
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,880
there was a company that was providing

446
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,440
support for a cell phone provider and

447
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,680
one of the two or three of the employees

448
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,160
that that company had been bribed

449
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:37,199
externally and they were able to take

450
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:38,160
and

451
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,399
kind of make cell phones disappear off

452
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:43,040
the system so they became ghost phones

453
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,399
and they were paid every time they

454
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:45,920
provided that to

455
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,000
the attacker they were paid like two or

456
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,600
three thousand bucks it was a third

457
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,680
world country that's pretty good money

458
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:52,959
right for them

459
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:55,199
and so make sure you keep track of your

460
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:57,199
vendors and also monitor their activity

461
00:15:57,199 --> 00:15:59,839
as as far as that goes

462
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:01,920
other things that we've seen

463
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,399
as i talk and work with vendors to make

464
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:05,920
sure that they've got good security

465
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,279
practices

466
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:09,279
one of the questions i've started to ask

467
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:10,240
is

468
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,480
do you use the same access keys and

469
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,680
credentials

470
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,720
to access our system as you do for other

471
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,720
customers and if the answer to that

472
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,079
question is yes

473
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:22,160
which sixty percent of the time so far

474
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,800
it's been about uh yes then we require

475
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,320
them as part of our contract to use

476
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,720
unique credentials to access our system

477
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,920
so they're not using the same

478
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,839
credentials to access a whole bunch of

479
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:33,600
their other customers

480
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,000
um other things if you can get away with

481
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,240
it is each of those vendor workers

482
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,000
should be able to access your system

483
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,839
with unique credentials so you can

484
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:44,560
attribute what they're doing to an

485
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,160
actual person instead of the vendor

486
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,880
itself it's not uncommon for vendors

487
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,560
when they access your system to use some

488
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,120
type especially if it's a support desk

489
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,240
scenario to use shared credentials so

490
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,079
you may have six or seven

491
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:00,240
of people at the vendor company that

492
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,839
will actually use the same credential to

493
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:04,000
access your system the problem with that

494
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,119
becomes

495
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:07,599
when there's an event or an incident and

496
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:09,039
now now you have to go and try and

497
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:10,959
attribute and figure out who did the

498
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:13,039
malicious activity and you go back to

499
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:14,480
the vendor and say we need to understand

500
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,559
who did the malicious activity and they

501
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:18,319
can't tell you the reason why is because

502
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:19,839
they're using share credentials among

503
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:21,119
themselves

504
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:21,919
so

505
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:24,160
recommendations there

506
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:27,359
and i need to add one here but implement

507
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:29,360
good credential management for your

508
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,679
vendors make sure if at all possible

509
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:33,360
each of the vendor people who are going

510
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,679
to contact or connect to your system

511
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:37,120
actually have their own unique

512
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,960
credentials to log in

513
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,559
implement key management requirements

514
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,480
for vendors and i'll give you another

515
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,400
story in just a second

516
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,039
implement mfa for ssh access don't use

517
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:48,480
passwords

518
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,799
and implement key rotation requirements

519
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:52,160
and that's where the other story comes

520
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:52,960
in

521
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,160
we're doing

522
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,679
some research on

523
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:59,120
one where we were investigating an issue

524
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,039
and will come to find out that there was

525
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:02,640
an employee of a vendor who had left

526
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,960
like a year and a half earlier but they

527
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,120
hadn't gone through and done good kind

528
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,960
of off-boarding of their employee and

529
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,919
that employee ended up having access to

530
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:13,840
a system of one of the other companies i

531
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,080
worked with and so as we were consulting

532
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,799
we walked in to do this response

533
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:21,360
we tracked it down to this actual person

534
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,720
and the employee we reached out to the

535
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,000
vendor and said okay this is the

536
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,760
employee and this is the ssh key that

537
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,679
was used to access the system

538
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:29,200
and then they turned around and said

539
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,799
yeah but that person hasn't been with us

540
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:32,000
for a year

541
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,880
and i said why wasn't it cleaned up

542
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,640
now we have a new process to make sure

543
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,880
that we do audit of all vendor accounts

544
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,000
to make sure that stuff like that

545
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,520
doesn't happen

546
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,120
and don't allow vendors if at all

547
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,480
possible to use the same key for

548
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,919
multiple customers i think it talked

549
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:46,960
about that

550
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,160
the other thing is if there's a

551
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,600
sensitive system or a sensitive process

552
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:55,600
and you need just periodic help support

553
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,080
tag one of your internal people to be on

554
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,720
the line or set up whatever

555
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,120
web sharing session is there and don't

556
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,880
leave them alone monitor them while

557
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,720
they're in your system and then revoke

558
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,799
access as soon as they're out

559
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:11,760
that's um it's a little more

560
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,760
resource intensive as far as you as a

561
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,000
company but it does save you from some

562
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,600
of these other things happening

563
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,760
third scenario

564
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,520
popular software library it was talked

565
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:27,520
about or mentioned just briefly earlier

566
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,600
a lot of our developers are using get

567
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,440
they'll use software libraries that are

568
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,679
open source or third party

569
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:34,960
a lot of those open source or

570
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,520
third-party softwares

571
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,280
sometimes remain teamed well sometimes

572
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,520
there's a lot of contributors and this

573
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,520
particular case that happened earlier

574
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,480
this year

575
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,880
it was the node.js library

576
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,520
hackers identified that node.js

577
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,679
had millions of downloads a week

578
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:54,480
the attacker actually was able to

579
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,960
hijack the account that was used to

580
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,720
deploy the malicious and deploy to

581
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,880
malicious version of the library

582
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,400
for node.js

583
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,320
since there's millions of downloads a

584
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,559
week that's pretty good for an attacker

585
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:08,640
to have a nice single point of entry as

586
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,480
that was deployed the libraries were

587
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,320
installed and it wasn't just crypto

588
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,000
mining software so i'm going to use your

589
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,760
resources on your system to mine

590
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,159
cryptocurrency but there's also password

591
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:20,240
stealing trojans that were attempted to

592
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,480
be installed in systems as well so i'm

593
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,320
going to take your credentials and i'm

594
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,559
going to mine cryptocurrency and you get

595
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:28,320
to pay the power bill and i'm super

596
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,720
happy to have your credits right there

597
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,960
are a lot of companies that this was

598
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,080
reported there were actually three

599
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,559
different versions of the node.js that

600
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:38,640
actually ended up being deployed

601
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,240
for three different versions of the

602
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,320
libraries that were there

603
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,159
this goes back into other

604
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,840
recommendations as well

605
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,360
you have to be able to monitor for

606
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,840
critical vulnerabilities

607
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,080
and disclosures to even software or

608
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,919
libraries of software that you're using

609
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:56,559
to secure your environment

610
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:58,320
implement good monitoring systems in

611
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,919
your systems to look for unknown or

612
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:02,480
common indicators of compromise this

613
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,240
particular

614
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,240
issue was caught because

615
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,159
some of the ed or software and some of

616
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:10,159
the other software noticed that there

617
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:12,480
were strange connections out to command

618
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,840
and control servers that were known to

619
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,360
be malicious

620
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,679
that was identified and then

621
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:20,480
reported back up to the author of the

622
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,400
library and from the author library they

623
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,240
published an article that was then

624
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,679
picked up by the industry so that

625
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:27,600
everybody could look for that

626
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,440
mitigate and patch as soon as possible

627
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,480
of course

628
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,559
and then if you find vulnerable

629
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:34,880
versions of software in your

630
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,640
environment make sure that you don't

631
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,640
have repositories of those so that in

632
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,640
six weeks or a year when kind of the

633
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,799
dust is settled you don't accidentally

634
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:45,840
deploy those again

635
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:50,159
so take away these takeaways

636
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:51,679
uh

637
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:53,120
cyber securities

638
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,559
will always keep us

639
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:56,320
pretty pretty active

640
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,640
right so every investigation that i've

641
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,720
done over the last 15 years

642
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,760
uh i've learned new attack techniques um

643
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,840
i've used it to kind of improve what i

644
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:06,559
know

645
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:08,400
and how i use it and i think that's kind

646
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,000
of what we can do here

647
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,600
just take the information we have be

648
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,840
able to apply it to a broader spectrum

649
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,360
and then from that be able to better

650
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,600
secure the environments or the servers

651
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,880
of the companies we work with so

652
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:25,080
stop there for any questions

653
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,690
okay thank you very much for your time

654
00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:34,940
[Applause]
