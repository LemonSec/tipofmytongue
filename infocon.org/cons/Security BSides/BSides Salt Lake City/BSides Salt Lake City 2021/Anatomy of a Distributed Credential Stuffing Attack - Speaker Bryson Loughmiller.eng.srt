1
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:05,120
okay hello everybody uh my name is

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:07,440
bryson lofmiller and

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,920
uh this is anatomy of a distributed

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:12,000
credential stuffing attack or

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,160
uh botnets cred stuffing and password

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,880
dumps a podium story um

7
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:20,160
so my name is bryson i work as a manager

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,920
of security engineering at podium which

9
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,000
is a tech company over in lehigh we do

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,599
interaction management

11
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:28,320
for local businesses and for four years

12
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,519
before that i was at adobe doing various

13
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:32,719
things

14
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:35,440
and i do i have a number of

15
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:38,640
different hobbies at which i am

16
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,120
mediocre so

17
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,120
i've got a ton of information that we're

18
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,559
going to go through here

19
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:46,399
and not a lot of time to do it so this

20
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:49,440
is going to be a speed run talk

21
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,559
and with many tangents so uh off to the

22
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:55,280
races so to start off um i'm just going

23
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,160
to go through some basic terminology uh

24
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,719
brute force attack hear this a lot brute

25
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:02,480
force attack is when you have a single

26
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,080
username and you are trying multiple

27
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,479
passwords against it trying to find the

28
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:08,000
correct password

29
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,400
like shown here in a credential stuffing

30
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,560
attack though you have multiple

31
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,000
different usernames usually with a

32
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,159
single password usually from a password

33
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:17,439
dump or

34
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:19,040
a data breach of some sort and you're

35
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,040
just trying each individual username and

36
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,439
password combination hoping that you get

37
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:26,560
something some success along the way

38
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,720
uh botnet you've probably heard this

39
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,680
term a lot generally a botnet is a group

40
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,560
of compromised devices all controlled by

41
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,040
a commanding control server of some sort

42
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,720
uh or multiple command and control

43
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,880
servers depending on how it's set up uh

44
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,320
usually each one of those bots is

45
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,640
compromised via some sort of malware

46
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,520
that is making a call home and whenever

47
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,560
the command and control sends out a

48
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,799
signal the bots do

49
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:54,720
what they what the command control wants

50
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:55,759
them to do

51
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:59,520
uh so first tangent uh the mirai botnet

52
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,119
so some of you may have heard of the

53
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:03,759
mirai botnet this was one that was

54
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:08,318
uh at its at its heyday in in 2016.

55
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:11,520
this particular botnet was an iot botnet

56
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,280
and was

57
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,400
mostly comprised of

58
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,200
iot devices like cameras

59
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,879
you know

60
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:24,400
any any iot type device fridges

61
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,480
uh toasters anything that's on the

62
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,800
internet nowadays which is uh pretty

63
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,959
much everything uh and so in this

64
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:32,080
particular

65
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,239
instance you've got your your camera

66
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:36,400
that somehow gets weaponized

67
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,239
and you've got

68
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:40,160
potentially tens of thousands of them

69
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,640
out on the internet uh all

70
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,200
combined with the other iot things and

71
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,040
they're attacking some sort of service

72
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:47,920
so

73
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,360
uh in in

74
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,200
then you'd laugh at the minecraft but

75
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,200
the mirai botnet was actually originally

76
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,040
created for the purpose of taking out

77
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,959
competitor minecraft servers so the

78
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:00,319
original owner uh ran a ddos protection

79
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:01,440
service

80
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:05,440
and attacked his very own clients uh and

81
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,440
hired out the botnet to take out

82
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,200
minecraft servers so

83
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,840
uh that was its original purpose uh in

84
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,959
october october 21st of 2016 uh they

85
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:17,120
attacked dine dns

86
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,959
which was a major you know dns uh hub

87
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:22,400
for uh

88
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,560
for many many many different services

89
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:29,599
and uh took it out for 600 000 devices

90
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:31,440
took out all of these different services

91
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,680
twitter amazon netflix cnn all the

92
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,480
things uh for five hours mostly on the

93
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,760
east coast but uh caused significant

94
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,000
amounts of panic uh

95
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,120
and

96
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,599
uh you know sparked lots of inquiry into

97
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:46,400
this

98
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,599
which led

99
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:49,680
some of you may know who brian krebs is

100
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,799
he's a

101
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:53,599
security uh journalist writes a lot of

102
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:55,040
really interesting stories about

103
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,720
different

104
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,560
security topics does really good

105
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,720
investigative journalism

106
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,120
on september 22nd

107
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,480
he was hit with a 620 gigabit per second

108
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,159
attack not him personally but his

109
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:10,720
website uh and the whole website was

110
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,720
forced offline for four days

111
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,320
uh and sometime later ovh which is a

112
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,320
french hosting company was hit with a

113
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,120
one terabit per second attack from this

114
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,440
same botnet all from

115
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,160
iot things which i think is

116
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,960
crazy but uh

117
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,400
so

118
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,160
uh krebs after his site was attacked uh

119
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,960
decided to go out and do a significant

120
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,800
amount of research and if you've never

121
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,600
read this particular article on on krebs

122
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,160
website this is a very interesting dive

123
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,639
but he dives into who this individual

124
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:48,400
was and that's how we found out that he

125
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,400
was running this this ddos protection

126
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,960
service and at the same time running one

127
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,000
of the biggest iot botnets in in history

128
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,919
uh and eventually due to some of the

129
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:00,479
stuff that he put out uh

130
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:02,960
the two two of the people uh pled guilty

131
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,240
and i don't think they actually went to

132
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,520
jail i think that was a recent

133
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,520
development but uh

134
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,160
but yeah they they were caught so all

135
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,720
right tangent over uh

136
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,520
so

137
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,960
we talked about cred stuffing we talked

138
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,680
about botnets what did podium see and

139
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,520
that's kind of the idea behind this is

140
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:23,600
back in december 2020 a podium saw a

141
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,280
large-scale

142
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,680
botnet-driven credential stuffing attack

143
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,080
uh over the course of the month so

144
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:34,400
uh to give an idea of what is normal for

145
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,120
a podium at least at that time usually

146
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,720
we would see around

147
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,520
uh

148
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,479
1500 unique ips hitting us on on any

149
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:43,919
given day

150
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:46,160
around 3 500 unique usernames in our

151
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,320
authentication logs and then in the

152
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,160
entire month of november

153
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,080
around 44 000 unique ips and 61 000

154
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,600
unique usernames

155
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,160
uh throughout the course of the month

156
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,720
this is a gra our chart of our of our

157
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,960
authentications you can see we've got

158
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,000
major spike or a decent spike right here

159
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,479
another decent spike here and then the

160
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:10,560
mother of all spikes right there

161
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,680
um

162
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,720
so

163
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,960
on each of those days uh

164
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,120
we had 41

165
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,560
500 attempts in one hour 190 000

166
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,560
attempts in one day on december 22nd and

167
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,039
then uh between december 24th and

168
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:30,479
december 26th we saw 1.2 million

169
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:34,960
uh there were yeah around 26 700 unique

170
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,039
malicious ips i'll talk about this a

171
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:39,440
little bit more later but actually

172
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,680
classifying an ip as malicious was

173
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,639
tricky

174
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:46,479
uh and they attempted yeah around 2. 2.2

175
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:48,400
million usernames

176
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,919
um

177
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:52,720
the reason this was interesting uh

178
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,919
was that we saw this this initial

179
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:59,759
attempt on december 2nd almost like a

180
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:00,560
a

181
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,960
poc of their of their attack uh and then

182
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,680
that that second attempt on the 23rd

183
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,160
like a second preparatory attempt and

184
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,599
then the massive spike on christmas day

185
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:16,400
uh over the course of christmas eve to

186
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,479
the the day following christmas which i

187
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,479
think is really interesting because

188
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:22,000
whoever was doing this i believe that

189
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,639
was very intentional as they assumed

190
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:26,240
that most of the individuals who were

191
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,479
watching these sites were probably

192
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:29,919
off on vacation and probably weren't

193
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:31,440
watching as much so

194
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,800
uh i think

195
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,840
and actually anecdotally just last week

196
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,599
over the thanksgiving break we saw more

197
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:39,199
credential stuffing attacks during the

198
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:41,120
thanksgiving break so i think

199
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,919
that uh holidays and vacation times are

200
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:45,919
prime targets for

201
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,639
uh attackers to go after uh especially

202
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:51,840
u.s companies us-based companies because

203
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,360
they know we're out on vacation maybe

204
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,639
not watching as closely so

205
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:00,639
um okay so quick analysis of some of the

206
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:04,160
ip addresses that we saw uh they were

207
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,400
all over the world um

208
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,199
the the attempts were coming from

209
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:12,560
basically every every continent um

210
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,680
and uh mostly out of the united states

211
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,440
or and then the united kingdom whole

212
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,599
bunch out of russia china germany india

213
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:22,160
netherlands canada just everywhere so

214
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,360
um

215
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,879
i think like i said before we had seen

216
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:29,199
those 23 000 or yeah 23 000 ips

217
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:31,759
uh what were the asn's the different

218
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:33,599
organizations owners of these ip

219
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:36,599
addresses again that also ranged we had

220
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:40,479
425 different potential uh asn's

221
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,479
different groups that were owning these

222
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:44,000
different ip addresses that were coming

223
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,200
after us so a broad variety of um

224
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,480
of ownership across these ips

225
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,519
which

226
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:55,279
leads me to believe even further that it

227
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:58,160
was some form of of botnet

228
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,279
um

229
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:00,880
we

230
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,560
plugged some of this information into a

231
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,720
service called ipqualityscore that

232
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,560
service allows you to throw it an ip

233
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,240
address and they have different fraud

234
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,440
scores

235
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,160
classify whether it's a vpn a proxy

236
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,760
multiple different things based on some

237
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,480
of their information that they have

238
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,399
and when i threw all of the ip addresses

239
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:20,320
that we had at it

240
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,680
it classified 96 of them as proxies 91

241
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,839
as vpns but

242
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:27,600
a lot of that is

243
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,959
um

244
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:31,200
classified based on just the the

245
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,320
information that they've seen in the

246
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,760
past and

247
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,600
uh

248
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,399
also

249
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,160
from the the traffic that they see on

250
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,959
their uh their honeypot devices

251
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:42,880
uh so okay so diving into a couple of

252
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,760
these colo crossing was the number one

253
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,839
organization on this one

254
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:51,040
uh this is a united states-based

255
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,959
co-location provider

256
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:55,200
scamalytics classifies this as a

257
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,000
potential fraud risk and and when i

258
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,320
googled colo crossing one of the first

259
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,320
things that came up was colo crossing

260
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,800
abuse so i think they're relatively well

261
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,720
known for stuff getting

262
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,160
compromised unfortunately um

263
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,519
i

264
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:13,279
uh blocked out a few of the ip addresses

265
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,959
here just because i didn't want to

266
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:17,519
actually list potentially compromisable

267
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:20,240
sites on here but um

268
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,000
a couple of the ip addresses most of the

269
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
ones that i went to go look at from the

270
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,920
the ips that we saw so like for example

271
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,399
this was one of the ips where we saw

272
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:31,519
almost 6 000 requests 6 000

273
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:34,000
uh authentication attempts come at us

274
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,760
uh

275
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,200
it's just some random website uh and

276
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,079
that was kind of the case across most of

277
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:43,839
these ips that i went to check out it

278
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,440
looked like there were

279
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:49,200
just different varying services run

280
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,040
when i jumped on showden you could see

281
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,519
lots of different ports exposed so i

282
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,440
think that these are just multiple

283
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,440
different types of devices across a

284
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,040
broad spectrum that have been

285
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,040
compromised and put on whatever this

286
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,800
potential botnet was

287
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,320
so this one was

288
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,519
uh

289
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:08,240
a service that hit us with 5000 requests

290
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,880
again running some different

291
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,640
service

292
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,680
out of china um

293
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,360
this and and there was a there was a

294
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,320
broad range as well we saw some services

295
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,880
hitting us some of these ips hit us with

296
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,839
6 000 usernames up to 6 000 usernames

297
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:28,720
some of them hit us with only five

298
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,880
and so there is quite the the range as

299
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,040
well and so with this one for example

300
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,959
they only had they only hit us with six

301
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:37,360
usernames and

302
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,120
it was just some

303
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,680
other type of service running on this so

304
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,839
going across all of them it was just

305
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:45,839
pretty pretty clear that there was a

306
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:47,360
broad range

307
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,000
of different types of devices uh that

308
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,800
were hitting us uh that just further

309
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:56,720
indicated that it was likely a botnet so

310
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:01,279
was this a targeted attack on podium

311
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:02,560
itself

312
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,519
i mean i i really doubt it um

313
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:06,399
we

314
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:07,200
are

315
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,120
out of the 102

316
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,320
sorry out of the 2.1 million usernames

317
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,880
that were attempted only 102 of those

318
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,720
were even

319
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,839
podium

320
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:19,839
users

321
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:23,040
and out of that there were 92 failures

322
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,360
10 successes luckily we identified those

323
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,519
quickly worked with the customers got

324
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:30,399
those passwords reset and we reached out

325
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:32,079
and notified those individuals through

326
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:34,880
our processes

327
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,720
i i think that i mean obviously this was

328
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,200
a large-scale botnet with

329
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,839
the the tens of thousands of ips that

330
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:45,920
were hitting us um

331
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,839
and with each ip

332
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:49,839
not hitting us with a

333
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:53,279
predetermined amount of uh

334
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:55,519
of attempts it wasn't just like you had

335
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:57,680
one hitting us with 500 and all of them

336
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,000
hitting us with 500 i think that this

337
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,240
was likely

338
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,160
a more distributed attack across

339
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,760
multiple different services so somebody

340
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,800
grabbed

341
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:07,760
a

342
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,839
a bunch of credential dumps and threw

343
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:12,000
them at multiple surfaces so i'm

344
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,240
actually curious if

345
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,680
anyone else

346
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,760
saw something similar at this time frame

347
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,839
because my guess would be

348
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:22,720
that a ton of other groups were hit with

349
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,839
this

350
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,600
we're not the biggest company in the

351
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,120
world and so

352
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,120
i i can't imagine that there weren't

353
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,200
several other organizations that in your

354
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,279
authentication logs you could go back to

355
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:35,920
december of this time frame and see

356
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,760
something like this and if anybody else

357
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,120
saw that and would like to talk to me

358
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,560
about it i would love to hear about it

359
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,399
because i think this was super

360
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:43,519
interesting

361
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:46,880
um okay so those were the ip addresses

362
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,199
where'd the credentials come from uh

363
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:51,360
there's a ton of different potentials

364
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,519
obviously there's password dumps all

365
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:55,120
over the place one that i think is

366
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,040
particularly interesting is called

367
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,199
collection number one

368
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:02,639
this was a 770 million record collection

369
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:04,560
that was released

370
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,120
back in january of 2019

371
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,839
uh 1.1 billion different email and

372
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:14,839
password combinations 87 gigs of data 45

373
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:17,120
which it's kind of a steal

374
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,240
um

375
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,760
the the history behind this one's

376
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,839
actually kind of interesting there's a

377
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:22,639
uh

378
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:24,160
i don't know you'd call i guess a hacker

379
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,399
named sanix and

380
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:28,639
they were the ones that kind of curated

381
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:30,800
this whole collection they released a

382
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:31,920
series of different collections

383
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,600
collection number one collections two

384
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,600
through five number one was more

385
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,360
credentials two through five was a lot

386
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,519
of uh pii

387
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:42,079
uh 25 billion records total a whopping

388
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:45,360
840 gig of just straight data about

389
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,320
people

390
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,760
um

391
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,240
and a fun little drama that went down

392
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:54,800
here was sanex had a rival data broker

393
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,720
named azatej

394
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:00,639
and as it has just bought it and leaked

395
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:02,480
the whole thing for free so

396
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,839
uh

397
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:05,600
they yeah

398
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,279
there's apparently drama between your

399
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:09,519
data brokers out there which is

400
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:11,600
interesting and i think both of them

401
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,880
were eventually

402
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,800
yes yeah both were eventually uh

403
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,040
arrested in may 2020 so

404
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,440
uh crime doesn't pay kids

405
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,600
uh okay so

406
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:25,440
are are you am i or is anyone in one of

407
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,120
those collections

408
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,839
i mean most likely just from a from a

409
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:32,560
sheer statistical uh

410
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,199
aspect and also just being on the

411
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:38,160
internet you are almost assuredly in one

412
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,639
of these data breaches unless you are

413
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:43,120
completely off the grid uh

414
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,959
so a very useful resource if you've

415
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:47,440
never used it before havibinpone.com

416
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,360
allows you to go in throw your email

417
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,120
address in and it will show you whether

418
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,320
or not you have been in a one of these

419
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,759
particular breaches

420
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:56,560
uh

421
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,320
so what i did was i took all of the

422
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,600
usernames

423
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,040
from the

424
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,959
that we saw attempted on us i took a

425
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:04,639
sample of ten thousand and i hit the

426
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:06,560
have i been pwned api

427
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,880
uh and ran it through to see what

428
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,839
information i was able to find and 87

429
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:14,399
uh of those emails

430
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:17,279
have i been pwned was able to say

431
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:19,440
yeah they they they were in some sort of

432
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,160
a data breach and the api gives you the

433
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,839
different data breaches breaches that

434
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:25,759
each one of them were involved in and

435
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:27,199
you can kind of see collection number

436
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:30,000
one was a very common uh collection

437
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,279
number one was also referred to as

438
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:34,399
anti-public but uh collection number one

439
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:38,720
is a common commonality amongst the the

440
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,480
sample that i went through

441
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,079
um

442
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:44,079
the interesting thing was that there

443
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:45,199
were

444
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:47,759
yeah around thirteen hundred that were

445
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:50,320
not in the havon pwned database which i

446
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,920
think is interesting because that means

447
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:55,759
that there's a decent chunk you know 13

448
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:58,079
of those which obviously are breached

449
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:01,120
credentials of some sort that uh have a

450
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,440
binp doesn't have which um there's

451
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,319
probably a good chunk on the on the dark

452
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:08,400
on the dark web that haven't been picked

453
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,400
up by the the guy who runs that site yet

454
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,280
but

455
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,559
um

456
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:15,039
just just goes to show that it's not a

457
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:16,000
perfect

458
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,439
means of protection um okay so

459
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:21,839
jumping into some

460
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:24,160
uh recommendations

461
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,400
have it been pwned actually has a

462
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,240
service a free service called the the

463
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,640
domain monitoring the domain search so

464
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,200
if you work for a company uh like

465
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,480
like we work for podium and you have

466
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,000
some sort of a domain

467
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,760
if you can prove ownership of that

468
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,480
domain you can submit that to have i

469
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,640
been pwned and anytime

470
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,679
uh one of your

471
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:48,720
emails or anything to do with your

472
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,600
domain pops up in a new data breach uh

473
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,679
they will send you an email and let you

474
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:54,640
know

475
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,640
send you an alert about it so this i

476
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,840
would highly recommend if you have any

477
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,120
organizations to go and sign up for this

478
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,679
uh you'll get notifications when

479
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:06,559
any of your users may pop up there

480
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:08,080
um

481
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,360
okay so

482
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,919
obviously the biggest problem here is

483
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:15,039
password reuse which uh just

484
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:17,760
needs needs to stop if if everyone is

485
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,400
not aware of why password reuse is a

486
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,280
problem this is exactly why right your

487
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,000
your password is leaked in any given

488
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,679
number of

489
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:29,520
data breaches and it's

490
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,520
nigh and too impossible to prevent that

491
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,720
from happening

492
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,200
and so if you use the same password

493
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,559
across all your different sites your

494
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:38,320
other sites will be compromised in these

495
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:41,520
types of cred stuffing attacks uh so i

496
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,880
would recommend

497
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,640
get a password manager lastpass and one

498
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,200
password are two good ones um

499
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,280
they also offer dark web monitoring on

500
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,120
both of those services where

501
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:56,000
if one of your credentials pops up in a

502
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,840
data breach somewhere they will alert

503
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,919
you about it and

504
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:02,160
let you know that you need to

505
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,000
rotate that password so

506
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,720
good services um

507
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:10,160
brief discussion about detection so uh

508
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,400
how are we detecting this kind of thing

509
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,160
because it's easy for this to slip

510
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,360
through the cracks in terms of the the

511
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:20,480
just large amounts of data mountains of

512
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,440
data that you might see in

513
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,080
authentication logs

514
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,640
one thing that's particularly easy or

515
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,320
not easy but a good way to look for it

516
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,480
is to look for the

517
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:34,559
high numbers of failed authentications

518
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:37,039
with unique usernames so if an ip

519
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:40,080
address has failed authentications on a

520
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,039
high number of unique user names then

521
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:45,520
that is very indicative that that iep is

522
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,360
attempting a credential stuffing attack

523
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,840
of some sort

524
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,679
and then also just focusing on

525
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:54,000
successful attempts because honestly

526
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,600
these types of cred stuffing attacks are

527
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,799
going to happen

528
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:58,480
all the time right it's just it's just

529
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,640
the nature of the space there are lots

530
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,320
of things we can do to protect against

531
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,240
them and defend with captchas and rate

532
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,880
limiting and and whatnot but

533
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,960
uh they're gonna happen so it's not

534
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,720
necessarily especially if you have

535
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,799
limited resources in your security team

536
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:14,880
it's not necessarily prudent to go and

537
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,480
chase the rabbit on every single time

538
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,240
somebody launches one of these but you

539
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,600
do want to know if there's ever a

540
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,480
success

541
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,960
and so if you can identify a malicious

542
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,080
ip

543
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,720
based on a high number of unique

544
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,120
usernames like that and then correlate

545
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,360
it across to any potential successful

546
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:34,159
authentications from that ip address uh

547
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:38,240
you can set up an alert and and

548
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,120
uh protect your your users so and then

549
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,960
just overall anomaly alerts of course if

550
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,880
you see large spikes like that then

551
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,559
there's something worth looking into

552
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:47,520
often

553
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:51,120
uh okay so in summary implement password

554
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,320
managers

555
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,799
use your authlogs look for anomalies

556
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:55,679
kind of where we were talking about

557
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:58,320
detection uh utilize services like have

558
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,760
i been pwned have it been pwned isn't

559
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:02,799
the only one but it's a good one

560
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:05,360
implement rate limiting captchas on your

561
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,240
authentication flows and be careful over

562
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:11,120
your holiday breaks because uh i think

563
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,760
it's a prime time for attackers to come

564
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,320
after us so

565
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:20,080
that's it any questions

566
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:28,520
okay thank you

567
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,559
you
