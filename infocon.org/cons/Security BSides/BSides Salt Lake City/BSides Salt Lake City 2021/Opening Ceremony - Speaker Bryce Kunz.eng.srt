my handle on twitter is tweakfox

26
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,159
and there's a b-side slack that you

27
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:08,000
should be able to join from the b-sides

28
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,320
slc.org website there's a link to join

29
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,240
it so if you ever have any questions you

30
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,840
can just throw them in general and

31
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,400
b-sides and i should respond in a

32
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,360
reasonable time period

33
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,960
well welcome to b-side salt lake city

34
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,560
glad to have this back

35
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,640
in person so

36
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,320
um

37
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,880
the slogan for b-sides is really by the

38
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,280
people for the people so i know there's

39
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,520
always areas we can do better as a group

40
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,600
as organizers

41
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,560
but largely this conference is is here

42
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,240
because of you and the people who are

43
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,680
willing to come out and provide the

44
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,200
content so

45
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,040
um you know if there's

46
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,439
gaps that you see this year and you know

47
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:50,880
we think could be better you know we'd

48
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,640
love to have your help on in future

49
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,640
years

50
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,399
really there's four core principles of a

51
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:00,960
b-sides event um so

52
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,040
and and the first is really like we want

53
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,320
to create an environment where you can

54
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,479
have meaningful conversations with other

55
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:08,479
participants here right

56
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,639
so intentionally the word participant is

57
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:12,319
used right because we want you know

58
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:14,000
everyone here to be part of the

59
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,239
community and and feel actively engaged

60
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:19,520
and then the second is really

61
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,360
connections we want everyone here to be

62
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,760
able to make a few new connections

63
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,879
there's some

64
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:28,080
rooms upstairs smaller rooms that are

65
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,000
available for just kind of

66
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,239
chilling out and breakout sessions and

67
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:34,640
one of them's got some

68
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,800
soldering irons so feel free to go in

69
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,239
there and you know kind of hang out

70
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,440
the third principle is community we're

71
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,480
really trying to strengthen the

72
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,360
community help us grow especially in the

73
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,319
area of cyber security

74
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:53,440
and the fourth is careers kind of a side

75
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,879
effect of

76
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:56,560
us all coming together and building

77
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,560
relationships is

78
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,319
people are able to improve their careers

79
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:01,440
and we're able to help each other out

80
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,319
more

81
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:03,519
so if you're wondering where these four

82
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:06,640
principles come from um i did not had i

83
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,560
did not invent them so they they are

84
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,159
from a jack daniels talk that he did

85
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:12,640
previously at b-sides so so we're kind

86
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,200
of taking our direction from um you know

87
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,560
the legacy here

88
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,239
i'm just going to go over some logistics

89
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:22,319

90
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:24,159
and then i'm just going to then i'll

91
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:25,599

two two nines where the badge will be

122
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,199
located at

123
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,120
so the schedule is located on the

124
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,040
website the only

125
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,880
one

126
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,440
update is that it says that this session

127
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,720
starts at

128
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,000
10 pm uh it does not it starts at 10 a.m

129
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,880
so

130
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,919
that was just a typo

131
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,360
okay so

132
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,720
here's kind of a screenshot of the

133
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,479

00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,720
did not get a beanie um

173
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,479
you're at the end of

174
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:39,759
tomorrow i am giving away the swag so

175
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:41,520
come back and we'll give you a beanie so

176
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,440
if there's any left

177
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,080
there is i think we produced 200 beanies

178
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:50,560
and we sold more than 200 tickets so um

179
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,000
okay waylon created the badge there's

180
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,160
challenges associated with the badge

181
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,000
if you are one of the first people to

182
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,400
solve that there is a prize for that

183
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,639
come and show wayland that you solved it

184
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:03,759
and

185
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:04,639
and

186
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:06,319
you can um

187
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:08,479
you can get that prize from whelan

188
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:10,080
it's pretty obvious if you solved it

189
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,440
like all these snow lights are like

190
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,400
blinking so the badge looks cooler right

191
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,080
really appreciate all the hard work

192
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,919
women puts into this batch

193
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:19,599
i can't tell you how many hours he puts

194
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:23,199
into it so really appreciate that

195
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,360
just as an fyi this is kind of some of

196
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,960
the organizers that helped with the

197
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,919
event really appreciate everyone's help

198
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:33,520
really would not be possible without

199
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,880
these individuals and all the hard work

200
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,680
they put into it

201
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,000
and once again just want to thank the

202
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,840
sponsors they um

203
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:45,840
they they make this possible right

204
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:49,280
as an fyi

205
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:53,599
we created a nonprofit of 501c3

206
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,759
that runs this b-sides conference here

207
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:58,560
in salt lake city so

208
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,039
as part of your if you purchase a ticket

209
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:03,440
as far as your ticket you have the right

210
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:07,120
to be a member of that non-profit right

211
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,440
this is the board for the non-profit

212
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:13,120
so i am on the board and i'm also

213
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,919
the lead executing the con right so

214
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:17,919
um if you're interested in what that

215
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:20,639
means or whatnot

216
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,400
you can always hit me up in slack i'm

217
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,879
there in the slack as well as

218
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,160
there's a website with a little bit of

219
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,639
information and there's my email there

220
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:32,000
for the non-profit so happy to talk with

221
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,958
you with you more about that

222
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,919
okay so

223
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:38,719
great

224
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:40,479
okay so that was just some logistics

225
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,240
associated with the con i

226
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,519

you to the right person if i'm not that

232
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,839
okay so i just want to talk about 2021

233
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:58,240
2021 was an interesting year we're still

234
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,040
kind of mid the pandemic so that's um

235
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,760
you know that's that's you know life now

236
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,160
and i appreciate everybody following the

237
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,240
the rules that are posted on the website

238
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,160
regarding the health standards here at

239
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,720
the conference including wearing masks

240
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,560
and um

241
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,200
and you know having the appropriate

242
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,000
tests or vaccines so appreciate everyone

243
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
being

244
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,560
letting us follow the industry norms

245
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,040
there so by 2021 actually had some

246
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:30,000
really cool things in cyber security so

247
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,360
one of my favorite is that in january

248
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,839
there was a bug an oh day release for

249
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:37,040
the sudo

250
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,360
binary right so the sudo binary if you

251
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,680
get on a linux box as a normal user it

252
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,760
allows you to change into the root user

253
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,360
account right kind of that level of

254
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,279
separation between user and root level

255
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:50,320
access and there is an over 10-year bug

256
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,120
which enables someone to just basically

257
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,640
exploit a vulnerability in the app and

258
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,040
get root privileges on the box so so

259
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,200
super cool bug

260
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,240
in march we saw oh multiple o days i

261
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,839
believe four o days came out for the

262
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:05,440
microsoft exchange servers and then we

263
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,680
saw rapidly cyber criminals start to

264
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,320
leverage those so that was you know also

265
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,920
pretty exciting from a cyber security

266
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,160
standpoint then in the may we saw the

267
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,399
colonial pipeline which maybe didn't

268
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:18,480
affect us so much here in utah but

269
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,720
literally shut down gas stations in you

270
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,399
know the washington dc area and across

271
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:24,480
the east coast so

272
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,880
we saw you know cyber attacks really

273
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,720
have a real world you know kinetic

274
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,880
impact there

275
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,399
you know we've seen multiple breaches

276
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,640
across the year that seems you know from

277
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,920
linkedin to neiman's marcus to twitch

278
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,760
and then we saw the kind of microsoft's

279
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,200
response there with the principal or

280
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,240
vulnerabilities in in july where you

281
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,519
know they thought the

282
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:46,959
report you know vulnerabilities were

283
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:49,200
reported to microsoft in the principle

284
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,320
or service

285
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,760
they thought they fixed it when

286
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,839
researchers looked they found ways to

287
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:55,760
bypass the fixes and they kept moving

288
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,920
and moving and moving so

289
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,720
so really interesting year a lot of

290
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,720
odays have come out that are kind of

291
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,680
high impact here

292
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,399
and

293
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,880
you know explicitly that microsoft

294
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,000
exchange

295
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,279
it it

296
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:16,399
they estimate it impacted over 250

297
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:19,279
000 organizations in the u.s alone right

298
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:20,959
so cyber criminals were going through

299
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,640
and basically any exchange server they

300
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,399
could get to they were using these odas

301
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:28,519
to get code execution on them

302
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,160
the pipeline

303
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,839
you know caused fuel shortages

304
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:34,880
throughout the east coast

305
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:37,360
and then the prince spooler rapidly as

306
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,040
soon as that was discovered you know

307
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,120
cyber criminals and ransomware's groups

308
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,399
started to use that

309
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:44,640
the example i found easily was you know

310
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,959
in south korea victims were reporting

311
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:50,640
they'd been hit using this so

312
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,839
okay so i just want to talk for a minute

313
00:11:57,839 --> 00:11:59,360
about

314
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,240
road maps for improvements right

315
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,320
so what what can we do as a cyber

316
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,959
security community to really improve the

317
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:08,959
overall security posture you know

318
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:10,480
there's a lot of these incidents and

319
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,240
breaches occurring

320
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:16,320
what can we do as a group to really

321
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,760
um

322
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,600
defend against that and you know this

323
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,519
isn't a comprehensive list this is just

324
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:23,279
kind of like the top recommendations

325
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:24,959
that i put together so

326
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:28,560
so first is reduce attack services right

327
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,560
so and

328
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,079
generally speaking it's good to know

329
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:34,480
what your attack surfaces are right um

330
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,800
then try to limit them or reduce them as

331
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,639
much possible so

332
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:41,440
so um you know zero trust is really the

333
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,760
modern day solution for reducing attack

334
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,760
services is trying to make you know

335
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,560
old-school lateral movement techniques

336
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,360
non-applicable so in in the traditional

337
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,760
model you know you would send a spear

338
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,519
phishing or phishing email into an

339
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:57,760
organization the user would click on the

340
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,240
email they'd get code execution on the

341
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,839
endpoint and then they would

342
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:03,920
subsequently start scanning the internal

343
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,079
systems inside of that enterprise and

344
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:07,839
they would move laterally from that

345
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:10,480
beach head system onto other boxes in

346
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,600
the network

347
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,880
and expand their access like that

348
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:15,680
well

349
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,839
there's really not a

350
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,800
a great use case why systems in that

351
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,639
internal network you know why one

352
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:24,399
workstation would really need to talk to

353
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:26,320
another workstation maybe workstations

354
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,000
need to talk to servers

355
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,760
you know maybe they need to talk to a

356
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,200
file server or maybe they need to talk

357
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,200
to an app like a web application server

358
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,200
but there's not really a really strong

359
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,839
reason there that they that one person's

360
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:39,680
laptop would need to directly talk to

361
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,760
another person's laptop so

362
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,000
so zero trust has got a lot of buzz

363
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,320
behind it but the basic of the concept

364
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,199
is

365
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:49,760
every endpoint is going to authenticate

366
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,639
to kind of like a central point which is

367
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:54,160
going to say which systems they can

368
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,560
access in the network and that greatly

369
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,720
reduces the amount of attack surface or

370
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,560
options an attacker has from moving

371
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,639
laterally so they basically have to go

372
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:05,040
from the endpoint to another server

373
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,680
inside the inside of the

374
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,360
inside of the organization

375
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,399
and um yeah so that's that's one one

376
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:14,560
approach right i'm not and uh you know

377
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,399
all the xero trust vendors have their

378
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:18,959
own way of implementing that but uh

379
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:20,000
and

380
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,560
and uh

381
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,279
yeah so that's that's really helpful um

382
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,240
but there's other ways you could

383
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,760
implement that right i mean it could be

384
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,760
just as simple as implementing firewall

385
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,600
rules on your

386
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,600
local on your laptops right using

387
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,519
windows to active directory to roll out

388
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,279
windows firewalls roles preventing

389
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:39,440
people from connecting to certain ports

390
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:43,199
and services from certain ip addresses

391
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:45,279
another thing that i i strongly

392
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:47,920
recommend is is really just getting a

393
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,480
real solid multi-factor

394
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,480
authentication strategy going at your

395
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,760
enterprise

396
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:58,079
so you know a lot of those will involve

397
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:00,720
you know the use of either verification

398
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,720
via kind of a push notification to your

399
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,720
phone or app

400
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,120
or they'll involve the use of a hardware

401
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,240
token right and those those are those

402
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,560
are excellent way to upgrade your

403
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:16,000
overall security game as an organization

404
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,760
primarily because

405
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,959
it shifts the the focus right so in the

406
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:22,880
past attackers they really want to get

407
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,959
those usernames and passwords

408
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:27,199
sometimes they get them from breach data

409
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:29,920
we've all probably heard about you know

410
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,880
password spraying or and all that type

411
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,120
of tax and and that's generally where

412
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,320
you know

413
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,560
you would have one password that you

414
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,720
know is weak and a list of accounts and

415
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,160
you would try that same password against

416
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,079
all the accounts so so an example of

417
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:46,000
that is maybe you would try

418
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:46,959
you know

419
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:49,759
winter 2021 and you would try that

420
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,040
against everyone's account in an

421
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,839
organization and hopefully it would work

422
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:55,040
as somebody's password in the

423
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,279
organization to get you a foothold in

424
00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:00,399
so mfa the couple things it does two

425
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:02,320
one you know username and password is no

426
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,959
longer enough it makes you have another

427
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:06,079
third

428
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:07,680
piece of material

429
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,720
key material to authenticate two it

430
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,240
generally is going to involve some type

431
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,720
of timeout right so when you

432
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,560
authenticate successfully you'll

433
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,560
generally get like an sso token in your

434
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,800
browser maybe you're using octa or

435
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,240
another similar service and you start

436
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,560
passing those to other applications and

437
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,399
they they recognize your token and they

438
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:28,079
authenticate you so

439
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:28,880
so

440
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:29,759
um

441
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:31,199
so you're gonna have to re-authenticate

442
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:32,720
at some point so even if there is a

443
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,639
breach you're gonna time limit the

444
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:37,279
amount of time the attacker can dwell

445
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:38,560
without having to retain those

446
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,079
credentials

447
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:41,839
generally speaking and you know a lot of

448
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:43,519
this is dependent on your specific

449
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:45,279
implementation so

450
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:47,120
um so that's kind of a good

451
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,040
recommendation i i don't want to say

452
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,320
that any of this stuff that i've just

453
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,000
talked about is foolproof so please

454
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,160
don't take that away as full proof and

455
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,000
that's why my third recommendation comes

456
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,440
into play which is

457
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,680
continually test right you think you

458
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,360
have a good plan you think you've

459
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,680
reduced the tax service you think two

460
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,679
factors working all right now test it

461
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:08,079
right get someone in or have someone in

462
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:09,839
your team actually go and see if they

463
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:12,480
can bypass it and it's alarming the

464
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,400
number of organizations that really

465
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,839
don't need a third party to come in and

466
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:17,199
look at it they just need someone to

467
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:18,640
spend a week or two looking at the

468
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,079
implementation and come back with some

469
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:22,319
recommendations on how to approve it

470
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:24,160
and you know feed those recommendations

471
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,480
back into your organization and into the

472
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,760
road map on how you're going to improve

473
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,120
the information systems over the next

474
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,320
year

475
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,520
i you know

476
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,360
hardly ever when you implement something

477
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,360
does it work exactly the way you thought

478
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,679
right so just getting a fresh set of

479
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:41,440
eyes on it is extremely helpful

480
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,720
so

481
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,400
layered defenses

482
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,799
um you know if if you really have those

483
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,799
first three things crushed like you're

484
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:49,919
like hey man

485
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:52,640
like we know all of our ingress egress

486
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,320
points going in and out to the internet

487
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,679
we've got those all monitored they're

488
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:58,320
locked down we got everything sso'd and

489
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,320
we got strong authentication on it and

490
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,840
we're testing it

491
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,120
i mean the next thing that i really

492
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,280
recommend is think about a layered

493
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,679
defense strategy and namely really think

494
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:08,559
about

495
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:10,160
what are the crown jewels in my

496
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,720
enterprise and is there any additional

497
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,400
protections around the crown jewels than

498
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,400
there is the other information systems

499
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,640
and you know generally speaking you want

500
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,559
to have some additional controls in

501
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:22,640
place now those are probably going to be

502
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,320
pretty specific because the crown jewels

503
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,240
for each organization probably are going

504
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,440
to differ

505
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,039
you know things that i've seen

506
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:31,760
implemented in real life is

507
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,600
you know some organizations are really

508
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,440
concerned about an attacker gaining

509
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,000
access to c-level information systems so

510
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,400
they'll put additional monitoring on the

511
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,760
c-level or board level members and

512
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,120
ensure that there's

513
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,080
extra monitoring and detection on those

514
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,080
you know other organizations are really

515
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,919
concerned about

516
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:53,679
some type of data they collect from

517
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:56,160
users so so they'll move that into like

518
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,840
a separate network segment and they'll

519
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,919
put additional security controls both on

520
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:02,080
the host and on the network layers so

521
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,679
really you gotta figure out what makes

522
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:06,799
sense for your organization but

523
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:08,880
you know if you think about

524
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,039
cyber security

525
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:13,760
um not as a checklist like i got to do

526
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,760
all this stuff on every single box but

527
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:18,400
if you really think about it as like hey

528
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,640
there's a battle here there's a terrain

529
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,559
right maybe it's a mountainous train

530
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:24,000
there's like a river in the terrain

531
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,080
there's a forest right and then you

532
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,840
think like the attackers got to go from

533
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,160
point a to point b right to get to the

534
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,480
top of that mountain what can i do to

535
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,640
help make it more difficult for them to

536
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,480
move through my information systems to

537
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,720
get to the top of that mountain so and

538
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,559
that's where a layered defense strategy

539
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:43,440
really comes in play

540
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:47,440
i highly recommend as much as possible

541
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,640
moving

542
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,840
to

543
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:53,120
an infrastructure as code or just an as

544
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,280
code strategy in general and and the

545
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,360
reason for this is and i know this is a

546
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,120
larger lift for a lot of organizations

547
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:02,640
but the reason for this is because then

548
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,840
on the left side of the stack you can

549
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:08,320
programmatically state uh when a new

550
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,559
vulnerability comes out you can modify a

551
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:12,480
template and say like okay update this

552
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,240
version of sudo let's let's take that to

553
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,760
do vulnerability the su-duke

554
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,520
vulnerability comes out what would you

555
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,200
normally have to do in a traditional

556
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,960
model you would have to

557
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,960
ssh into all your systems you would have

558
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,360
to do an upgrade on the ssh package

559
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,360
right or you'd have to have some type of

560
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,679
solution that that would do that in an

561
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:31,360
infrastructure as code model you would

562
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,520
go back to the template for your

563
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,640
infrastructure

564
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,280
and you would say in the template

565
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,799
don't use that version of sido anymore

566
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:40,320
use this version and then you would

567
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,159
redeploy your infrastructure using the

568
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:44,240
new version so and i know a lot of

569
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,159
organizations through use of containers

570
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:49,120
and kubernetes and

571
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,720
and even just people using cloud

572
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,640
services for using like kind of like the

573
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,799
arm templates on azure or the cloud

574
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:56,799
formation templates on aws

575
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:58,159
they're really able to leverage this

576
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:00,240
kind of infrastructure as code concept

577
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,039
so

578
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:02,480
as much as possible

579
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,919
when you're reducing the amount of time

580
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:05,520
it takes you to make large scale changes

581
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,360
across your enterprise and you're really

582
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,960
baking that into your organization's

583
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,559
processes at the core

584
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:12,080
you're going to see a huge

585
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,000
a huge security benefit

586
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,840
albeit is kind of a culture shift

587
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,159
okay and then the last thing that i

588
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:22,400
highly recommend

589
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,000
and this

590
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,080
i thought i had a background slide but

591
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,720
apparently maybe i skipped over it but

592
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,320
so just as a little background about

593
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,320
myself um

594
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,480
so i'm bryce coons i'm tweak fox on

595
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,600
twitter

596
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,640
so i i used to work at homeland and at

597
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,600
homeland i was over instant response and

598
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,320
focus operation for their unclassified

599
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,600
network so

600
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,520
there was over half a million computers

601
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,320
there

602
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,880
and it was really my job when we thought

603
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,200
malware an attacker got on a system to

604
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,440
lead the incident response efforts there

605
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,360
as well as focus operations was kind of

606
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,440
the term that we came up with

607
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,799
before you know hunt and the apts were

608
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:04,159
really a thing right so we're really

609
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:06,000
focused on kind of those nation states

610
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,080
and and trying to

611
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,480
do cyber threat intel around them and

612
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,720
and come up with strategies on how to

613
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,559
defeat them right so

614
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:15,520
so

615
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,960
um the biggest thing on the on the

616
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,840
defensive side is is really

617
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,640
just the ability to get visibility into

618
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:26,000
both the endpoint and the network right

619
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,760
so when you think something's suspicious

620
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:28,960
how long does it actually take you to

621
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,960
triage that so like i got to open a jira

622
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,720
ticket with some sre and he's got to go

623
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:35,440
ssh the box and the sre comes back and

624
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,520
like everything looks cool right that's

625
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,039
not that's not good enough right he's

626
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:40,960
not trained in cyber security he doesn't

627
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,440
have a background there

628
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,240
so

629
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,000
i think a lot of the tools that are out

630
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,640
here which are in that kind of

631
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,799
edr type space will give you the ability

632
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:52,320
to respond a lot quicker get that

633
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,559
visibility a lot quicker so i highly

634
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:56,720
recommend you check those out as well as

635
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,080
kind of have the right

636
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,840
standard operating procedures in place

637
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,080
so that when an incident happens you

638
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,480
guys can go and triage it and remediate

639
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,760
it without

640
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,919
having to do

641
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:09,520
you know a lot of

642
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,760
large changes so

643
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,440
um

644
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:16,320
yeah so that's kind of my where my

645
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,320
background is on the defensive side and

646
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,919
where these recommendations kind of come

647
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:21,600
from

648
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,799
you know in in full transparency

649
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:27,360
uh you know i've subsequently since then

650
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:30,559
shifted to the offensive side and uh

651
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:31,760
um i do

652
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:34,480
i used to work at nsa i i did red

653
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,960
teaming type functions there as well as

654
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,280
i built red teams out for tech companies

655
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,200
and whatnot so

656
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,720
um so

657
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,480
you know i see a lot of hands on the

658
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,679
ground

659
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:48,640
cases at this point in my life where

660
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:52,400
security did not function well right

661
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,360
okay great

662
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:58,400
well that's me um i just wanted to kind

663
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,159
of kick you off for a minute get you

664
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:02,559
orientated on the conference

665
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:05,039
and if there's any questions feel free

666
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:05,840
to

667
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,279
hit me up on

668
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:09,440
slack or twitter

669
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,440
and thank you all for coming out

670
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:14,360
appreciate your time

671
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:22,139
[Applause]

672
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,439
you
