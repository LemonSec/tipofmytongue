pull the room<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay next slide</font>

81
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:36,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay security fundamentals and when I</font>

82
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:38,540
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of joked about it being remedial I</font>

83
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:41,239
kind of meant it a little bit so here's

84
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:43,849
what here's what you get for security

85
00:03:41,239 --> 00:03:46,910
fundamentals head plus wall plus

86
00:03:43,849 --> 00:03:48,170
momentum equals ouch right you guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> ever</font>

87
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:51,079
beat your head<font color="#E5E5E5"> up against a wall before</font>

88
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:53,599
physically like we're in real life maybe

89
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:58,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably as a kid or something well this</font>

90
00:03:53,599 --> 00:04:01,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">is what security seems to be like right</font>

91
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:02,208
now this isn't the head beating up

92
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:03,410
against the wall thing and I have to

93
00:04:02,209 --> 00:04:05,120
kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of look at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it from behind here but</font>

94
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:07,910
it's cute little animation of somebody

95
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:10,370
just kind of taking the beating because

96
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:12,350
somebody else<font color="#E5E5E5"> knows so much better how</font>

00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:16,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do things right how many you guys</font>

00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:25,380
the person to charge of security whether

144
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:27,989
that be through divine intervention or

145
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:29,340
edict right or whether<font color="#CCCCCC"> because or</font>

146
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:30,660
whether it's because you decided that

147
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:34,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">hey I'm interested in this stuff and I'm</font>

148
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:35,880
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> work on it or whether you don't</font>

149
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:38,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">really care and you're here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> because you</font>

150
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:41,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">heard</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really cool con you</font>

151
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:42,330
need to good security minded people so

152
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:44,220
let's talk about them for a minute

153
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:48,090
security is a state of mind how many

154
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:52,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">believe that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay it is it's truly a</font>

155
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:56,159
state of<font color="#E5E5E5"> mind starts with this ignorance</font>

156
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:58,409
the bliss of not knowing or not wanting

157
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,210
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know how many you guys fit your fit</font>

158
00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:03,360
yourself into this category right here I

159
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:04,739
mean legitimately like hey you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know what</font>

160
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:08,100
ignorance is bliss my wife's raising

161
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:10,800
your hand on the back<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so ignorance</font>

162
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:12,510
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> bliss we don't care do we know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if the</font>

163
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:16,980
hackers got into our main database

164
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:19,289
servers do we care right well first of

165
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:22,170
all ignorance is not bliss and for those

166
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:24,900
of you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> understand the the not</font>

167
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:26,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">sign-in they're not equal to okay then</font>

168
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:27,479
we'll talk about programming and how

169
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:30,960
important that is a little bit later

170
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:32,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so the next level of a security</font>

171
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:35,070
state of mind as we go through this

172
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:37,740
progression so we have the ignorance and

173
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:40,290
ignorance is bliss useful users or

174
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:41,970
people and then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the insightful</font>

175
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:44,550
people so they have a basic

176
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:46,590
understanding of what is out there and

177
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:48,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">what to watch out for to keep themselves</font>

178
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:50,400
safe<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay how many you guys fit into</font>

179
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:53,250
this category

180
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:54,630
okay so you're aware that you know

181
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:57,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">people from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Nigeria send you an email</font>

182
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:58,440
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know those basic things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

183
00:07:57,210 --> 00:08:00,388
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> been around</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> since the dawn of time</font>

184
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:02,400
that might have finally made it to your

185
00:08:00,389 --> 00:08:07,169
ears I don't mean that sound derogatory

186
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:09,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">at all but but being insightful okay</font>

187
00:08:07,169 --> 00:08:11,599
most<font color="#E5E5E5"> users in the computer industry</font>

188
00:08:09,539 --> 00:08:14,070
these days fit into this category

189
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:16,199
they're the ins that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they they know not</font>

190
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:17,880
to click on things and emails they know

191
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:20,460
that antivirus is a good thing they

192
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:23,460
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know why but it's a good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing and</font>

193
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:24,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">then they know that they have to VPN in</font>

194
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:26,840
to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to all their stuff at their</font>

195
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:30,300
office<font color="#E5E5E5"> and there they hate you for it</font>

196
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:34,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay then comes this level the educated</font>

197
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:36,630
version are the educated people okay

198
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:39,000
knowing enough to be able to speak out

199
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:42,330
about it but lacking some practicality

200
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,310
hey how many fit into this category okay

201
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:45,930
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of the presenters up here</font>

202
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:47,550
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> consider themselves to be</font>

203
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:49,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">educated they're probably a little bit</font>

204
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:52,740
farther down the scale here<font color="#E5E5E5"> as we go</font>

205
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:54,390
down it but educated I consider<font color="#E5E5E5"> myself</font>

206
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:56,010
to be pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> well-educated network</font>

207
00:08:54,390 --> 00:09:00,089
security it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that I've been</font>

208
00:08:56,010 --> 00:09:01,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for a long time I can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> speak about</font>

209
00:09:00,089 --> 00:09:03,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">it I can stand up here and tell you</font>

210
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:06,050
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> security fundamentals get really</font>

211
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:08,850
boring with some stupid slides like this

212
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:11,520
watch James say hey why is one side<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

213
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:15,180
the screen brighter than the other it's

214
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:17,490
okay James it's almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's OCD for all</font>

215
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:21,709
of us<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so educated next one scared</font>

216
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:24,420
okay how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many of you are to this level</font>

217
00:09:21,709 --> 00:09:25,770
okay hopefully<font color="#CCCCCC"> the work you know we're</font>

218
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:27,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of going through</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the scale here how</font>

219
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:29,579
<font color="#CCCCCC">many are scared about network security</font>

220
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:31,620
because at this point you know with real

221
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:35,880
understanding about network security

222
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:38,339
comes real fear once you realize that

223
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:40,230
your fear is actually warranted I mean

224
00:09:38,339 --> 00:09:42,750
as<font color="#CCCCCC"> you go throughout your day and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

225
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:44,279
you're whipping out your swords and

226
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:46,500
you're in<font color="#CCCCCC"> battle with the miscreants out</font>

227
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:48,060
there in the world it's a real battle

228
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:51,240
it's constantly waging there's not a

229
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:53,729
time anywhere day or night 24 hours a

230
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:55,709
day 7 days a week 365 and a quarter days

231
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:57,839
a year that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're not being bombarded</font>

232
00:09:55,709 --> 00:09:59,910
on your networks or on your systems

233
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:01,170
looking for holes vulnerabilities and

234
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:03,089
other things<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get in get your</font>

235
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:04,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">information take it out</font>

236
00:10:03,089 --> 00:10:07,350
and do things like do<font color="#E5E5E5"> things with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it so</font>

237
00:10:04,949 --> 00:10:10,439
a lot of us<font color="#E5E5E5"> are in that scared mindset</font>

238
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:15,269
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay keep going there's a couple</font>

239
00:10:10,439 --> 00:10:16,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">more there's the paranoid okay now you</font>

240
00:10:15,269 --> 00:10:18,600
guys might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be multiple parts of these</font>

241
00:10:16,829 --> 00:10:22,128
right so how many of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you are paranoid</font>

242
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:25,410
about security ok this is the sweet spot

243
00:10:22,129 --> 00:10:26,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay on this entire scale this is the</font>

244
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:28,949
sweet spot this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is where you want to be</font>

245
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:32,309
you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be paranoid so this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is where</font>

246
00:10:28,949 --> 00:10:34,378
I consider myself to be as paranoid this

247
00:10:32,309 --> 00:10:36,300
is a healthy place believe it or not I

248
00:10:34,379 --> 00:10:40,230
me paranoid in general isn't healthy but

249
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:42,628
for security purposes it is but paranoia

250
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:44,129
for security people is healthy for you

251
00:10:42,629 --> 00:10:46,490
and for the organization<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you're</font>

252
00:10:44,129 --> 00:10:50,069
protecting so security mindset paranoia

253
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:52,019
ok and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> insanity ok now you've gone</font>

254
00:10:50,069 --> 00:10:55,589
off the deep end now you've unplugged

255
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:57,899
yourself from the internet you've

256
00:10:55,589 --> 00:11:01,490
decided<font color="#E5E5E5"> that ok this isn't even worth it</font>

257
00:10:57,899 --> 00:11:05,100
anymore but there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a fine line between</font>

258
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:08,129
paranoia and sanity don't let the

259
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:09,329
insanity take you<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok insanity I've got</font>

260
00:11:08,129 --> 00:11:11,160
another one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these things when you put</font>

261
00:11:09,329 --> 00:11:14,790
two<font color="#E5E5E5"> equal signs together and programming</font>

262
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:17,839
language<font color="#CCCCCC"> that means what equal to okay</font>

263
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:20,969
just making sure that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this wasn't just</font>

264
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:24,689
I'm sure it's not but insanity equals

265
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:26,249
worry if you worry too much you're going

266
00:11:24,689 --> 00:11:28,889
to do things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like have knee-jerk</font>

267
00:11:26,249 --> 00:11:30,209
reactions to issues incidents and other

268
00:11:28,889 --> 00:11:32,100
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that happen on your networks and</font>

269
00:11:30,209 --> 00:11:33,959
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to make its good</font>

270
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:38,329
decisions so worrying about every little

271
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:41,489
thing that you cannot get<font color="#CCCCCC"> to but knowing</font>

272
00:11:38,329 --> 00:11:44,579
let's see but you know makes you

273
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:46,379
vulnerable who cares I was tired<font color="#E5E5E5"> when i</font>

274
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:48,479
wrote that slide<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so here's this</font>

275
00:11:46,379 --> 00:11:52,679
completely meaningless scale that shows

276
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:54,660
all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those mindsets from ignorance</font>

277
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:57,720
that are educated through scared

278
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:58,649
paranoid and insane it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok it doesn't I</font>

279
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:00,209
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> even know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what the graph</font>

280
00:11:58,649 --> 00:12:03,540
represents I thought it would be a

281
00:12:00,209 --> 00:12:05,670
really cool visual but most people hang

282
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:09,120
out in ignorance mode a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

283
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:11,910
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> well educated</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a few more fit into</font>

284
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:13,170
the scared and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very interesting</font>

285
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:15,449
that there's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> very many that are</font>

286
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:16,889
paranoid in fact we even raise their

287
00:12:15,449 --> 00:12:18,059
hand how many you're paranoid

288
00:12:16,889 --> 00:12:19,619
now you're all going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to raise</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your hands</font>

289
00:12:18,059 --> 00:12:23,089
like yeah we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to screw up your</font>

290
00:12:19,619 --> 00:12:25,859
scale<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay but fundamental number one</font>

291
00:12:23,089 --> 00:12:30,089
okay so we've kind of prefaced it with

292
00:12:25,859 --> 00:12:32,549
this is having good paranoid security

293
00:12:30,089 --> 00:12:34,079
minded people but that also<font color="#E5E5E5"> that but</font>

294
00:12:32,549 --> 00:12:37,910
that means having those types of people

295
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:40,229
<font color="#CCCCCC">in every</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> aspect of your technology</font>

296
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:42,509
within your organization that doesn't

297
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:44,999
mean just having security people in the

298
00:12:42,509 --> 00:12:46,049
security department why did why is it

299
00:12:44,999 --> 00:12:47,429
important<font color="#E5E5E5"> this can be a little</font>

300
00:12:46,049 --> 00:12:48,629
interactive why is it important to make

301
00:12:47,429 --> 00:12:58,350
sure that you have a good security

302
00:12:48,629 --> 00:13:00,899
minded system<font color="#E5E5E5"> administrator anyone so to</font>

303
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:03,509
quote him<font color="#CCCCCC"> too</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because the dingbat would</font>

304
00:13:00,899 --> 00:13:05,759
leave the stupid default settings on the

305
00:13:03,509 --> 00:13:10,199
piece<font color="#CCCCCC"> of junk server right that was a</font>

306
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:11,369
direct<font color="#E5E5E5"> quote okay right if you don't</font>

307
00:13:10,199 --> 00:13:14,219
have security minded system

308
00:13:11,369 --> 00:13:16,679
administrators or security minded<font color="#CCCCCC"> DBAs</font>

309
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:19,410
and security minded accounting people

310
00:13:16,679 --> 00:13:20,910
what's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> happen they're going to</font>

311
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:23,730
circumvent all of the protections that

312
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:26,309
you put in<font color="#CCCCCC"> place by opening up telnet on</font>

313
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:27,839
some stupid server and saying hey I'll

314
00:13:26,309 --> 00:13:30,738
just get to<font color="#E5E5E5"> it from home from time to</font>

315
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:33,480
time so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I can work from home right</font>

316
00:13:30,739 --> 00:13:36,649
okay so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about fundamental</font>

317
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:41,189
number two okay tools and monitoring

318
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:43,319
excuse me so tools how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you guys</font>

319
00:13:41,189 --> 00:13:45,360
would say you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a really good sub set</font>

320
00:13:43,319 --> 00:13:50,790
of tools to help you monitor and manage

321
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:53,009
network security<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a couple of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hand</font>

322
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:54,959
shakers out there right so what do the

323
00:13:53,009 --> 00:13:59,399
rest of you guys doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're blissfully</font>

324
00:13:54,959 --> 00:14:01,079
ignorant of what's going on<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay well</font>

325
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:02,429
let's talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it a little bit tools</font>

326
00:14:01,079 --> 00:14:04,258
specifically in the security industry

327
00:14:02,429 --> 00:14:06,089
are there to make your job easier<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

328
00:14:04,259 --> 00:14:08,189
make processes for managing security

329
00:14:06,089 --> 00:14:10,519
easier and so some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the essential</font>

330
00:14:08,189 --> 00:14:14,789
tools I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to put a lot of</font>

331
00:14:10,519 --> 00:14:16,139
names<font color="#E5E5E5"> to these because there's a lot of</font>

332
00:14:14,789 --> 00:14:17,759
sponsors outside they'll be happy to

333
00:14:16,139 --> 00:14:20,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk about many of these solutions with</font>

334
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:23,189
you under different names but let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font>

335
00:14:20,579 --> 00:14:24,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">about some of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the fundamentals okay do</font>

336
00:14:23,189 --> 00:14:25,969
you guys have network traffic monitors

337
00:14:24,899 --> 00:14:28,069
within your network

338
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:29,839
are you monitoring traffic do you have

339
00:14:28,069 --> 00:14:32,719
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ability to pull a packet capture off</font>

340
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:34,550
the wire if you needed to you have the

341
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:37,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">ability</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to see that hey all of a sudden</font>

342
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:38,810
I went from 2 megabits a second which

343
00:14:37,399 --> 00:14:41,720
hopefully maybe have more traffic than

344
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:43,518
that but whatever 2 megabits a second to

345
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:47,629
all of a sudden I'm doing 200 megabits a

346
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:48,800
second and we have no<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea why right how</font>

347
00:14:47,629 --> 00:14:51,620
many<font color="#CCCCCC"> of you would notice something like</font>

348
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:53,870
that raise your<font color="#CCCCCC"> hand so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all of a sudden</font>

349
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:56,269
your network traffic went<font color="#CCCCCC"> whew how many</font>

350
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:59,019
guys would notice that<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok that's good</font>

351
00:14:56,269 --> 00:15:02,810
what would the rest of you guys do

352
00:14:59,019 --> 00:15:04,069
people is fully ignorant that's I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font>

353
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:06,680
mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> beat you up that's not my point</font>

354
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:07,910
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok but network traffic monitors ok</font>

355
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:10,399
I'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a few of those here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in a</font>

356
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:12,069
minute log management systems<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok how</font>

357
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:14,300
many<font color="#CCCCCC"> of you have log management system</font>

358
00:15:12,069 --> 00:15:21,370
what are they good for somebody yell it

359
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:25,099
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> hey nice job whoo I bet that took</font>

360
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:26,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">never mind log management system right</font>

361
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:27,800
what kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of logs are you sending to</font>

362
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:32,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">your log management system maybe let me</font>

363
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:36,740
ask it like that ok firewall logs those

364
00:15:32,899 --> 00:15:41,300
are good ones anything else system logs

365
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:44,180
event logs anybody else authentication

366
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:45,469
logs failures<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok there's a lot of things</font>

367
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:50,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> send to a log management</font>

368
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:52,970
server why why<font color="#CCCCCC"> would you do that central</font>

369
00:15:50,329 --> 00:15:54,849
repository there's another word starts

370
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:58,610
with a V that I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking for here</font>

371
00:15:54,850 --> 00:16:01,759
everybody's like go on<font color="#E5E5E5"> what visibility</font>

372
00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:03,259
right the visibility of those logs now

373
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:04,879
if they sit there<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a system so if</font>

374
00:16:03,259 --> 00:16:08,209
you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> this beautiful active</font>

375
00:16:04,879 --> 00:16:09,769
directory system authentication<font color="#E5E5E5"> across</font>

376
00:16:08,209 --> 00:16:12,559
the entire organization this is a

377
00:16:09,769 --> 00:16:14,959
beautiful<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing and then nobody ever</font>

378
00:16:12,559 --> 00:16:16,219
looks at the logs<font color="#E5E5E5"> because they're just</font>

379
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:18,410
stored on the server<font color="#E5E5E5"> and nobody really</font>

380
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:20,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">gets on there to take a look at them how</font>

381
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:22,339
good is<font color="#E5E5E5"> your Active Directory</font>

382
00:16:20,319 --> 00:16:23,569
implementation when it comes to security

383
00:16:22,339 --> 00:16:26,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">and authentication and things like that</font>

384
00:16:23,569 --> 00:16:29,750
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok so visibility having a central</font>

385
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:32,809
log repository and the ability to see

386
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:35,750
those map those out is incredibly

387
00:16:32,809 --> 00:16:38,300
important and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's a fundamental ok so</font>

388
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:39,390
vulnerability scanning tools how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

389
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:40,949
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> guys do vulnerable</font>

390
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:42,240
scans against your network we should

391
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:44,370
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> see a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of hands at this</font>

392
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,720
point which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> good because a couple of</font>

393
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:48,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">years</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ago you probably would have seen</font>

394
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:52,230
no<font color="#E5E5E5"> hands because it was like what is</font>

395
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:54,000
that vulnerability scanning tools<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

396
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:56,430
there's a number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out there you</font>

397
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,290
can pay for really great ones you can

398
00:16:56,430 --> 00:17:01,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">open source some really good ones as</font>

399
00:16:58,290 --> 00:17:04,139
well and being<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to identify and</font>

400
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:06,569
manage the vulnerabilities on your

401
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:09,120
network is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a key fundamental tool okay</font>

402
00:17:06,569 --> 00:17:10,649
firewalling and filtering systems<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

403
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:12,958
pretty straightforward I'm not going to

404
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:16,560
get into<font color="#E5E5E5"> that if you have / if you need</font>

405
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:18,630
information about firewalling does that

406
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:21,270
meet buzzing if you need information

407
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:24,300
about firewalling you can come up<font color="#E5E5E5"> later</font>

408
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:26,940
we'll do a remedial remedial class fault

409
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:29,100
management processes<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay or fault</font>

410
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:33,480
management systems what's a fault

411
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:35,429
management system first and foremost up

412
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:37,320
down right the little red light green

413
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:39,720
light kinds of things whether

414
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:42,090
something's working or not<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay a fault</font>

415
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:44,670
management system we mostly tie that

416
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:46,409
into operations and seeing whether a

417
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:51,900
system is working and running but why is

418
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:55,890
it an important security tool the buzz

419
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:57,180
is deafening you find out your log

420
00:17:55,890 --> 00:17:59,520
management systems down there you go

421
00:17:57,180 --> 00:18:01,530
home okay<font color="#CCCCCC"> but no the fault management</font>

422
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:04,200
system<font color="#E5E5E5"> is there so that hey it's an</font>

423
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:05,940
anomaly what why<font color="#E5E5E5"> did such a such system</font>

424
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:08,010
go offline why is the database down

425
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:09,720
right now could it be<font color="#CCCCCC"> that be through</font>

426
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:12,000
the web server somebody did some SQL

427
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:15,270
injection that in tried<font color="#E5E5E5"> to dump the</font>

428
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:17,250
entire database<font color="#CCCCCC"> 300 times just to see if</font>

429
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:20,129
they could<font color="#CCCCCC"> right how many of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> guys</font>

430
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:21,630
would have seen or if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> watching</font>

431
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:23,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">your fault management system and you see</font>

432
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:26,910
your database server go offline how many

433
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:28,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">of you guys immediately jump to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay who</font>

434
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:30,270
tried to dump the database through the

435
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:32,100
web server how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys would jump</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

436
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:34,379
that conclusion those of you that raise

437
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:36,270
your hands during paranoid should be

438
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:38,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">raising your hands right okay because</font>

439
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:39,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's a paranoia sort of thing but a</font>

440
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:41,370
fault management system helps you see

441
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:43,500
those types of things and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then policies</font>

442
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:46,979
and procedures you know boring stuff

443
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:50,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so let's talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about a couple</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

444
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:53,290
tools in a very non vendor specific sort

445
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:55,060
of way for the most<font color="#E5E5E5"> part</font>

446
00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:56,350
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of different</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tools out</font>

447
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:57,850
there you guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> welcome to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> take a</font>

448
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:59,379
picture<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this slide these are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some of</font>

449
00:18:57,850 --> 00:19:03,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">the ones that you should</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> probably be</font>

450
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:08,080
incorporating into your networks as part

451
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:09,700
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> just basic fundamentals included in</font>

452
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:11,080
here are things like<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ability to pull</font>

453
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:13,690
net flow which I highlight it up in the

454
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:16,240
upper<font color="#CCCCCC"> left hand corner net flow is an</font>

455
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:20,350
incredible source of information we use

456
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:22,840
that all of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> time okay net flow is</font>

457
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:24,730
the ability for you to pull packet

458
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:27,520
header data and store it for<font color="#CCCCCC"> long term</font>

459
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:29,670
use and analytics on your network how

460
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:34,480
many you are not familiar with net flow

461
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:37,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay I'll throw out a little teaser at</font>

462
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:39,340
the 801 labs hackerspace we teach

463
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:41,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">netflow classes about once every two</font>

464
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:43,689
months or so if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to come out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

465
00:19:41,170 --> 00:19:45,640
find out<font color="#E5E5E5"> the cool parts and what's</font>

466
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:47,500
involved in net flow come out and see us

467
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:49,120
out there at the hackerspace there's

468
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:51,640
some really cool things about it<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

469
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:53,830
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> would what would it be like if you</font>

470
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:55,840
had a log of every<font color="#E5E5E5"> single packet that</font>

471
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:58,240
came in and<font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of your network and the</font>

472
00:19:55,840 --> 00:20:00,179
ability to run different analytics on

473
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:02,860
those logs you can start seeing patterns

474
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:04,660
fairly quickly like hey how many times a

475
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:06,699
day do<font color="#E5E5E5"> I get port scan how many times</font>

476
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:09,310
did this guy try and brute force into my

477
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:10,840
bastion SSH host that gets<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the back</font>

478
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:12,790
end of our<font color="#E5E5E5"> network how many times did</font>

479
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:15,340
somebody try and knock on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ports for</font>

480
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:16,810
our databases etc etc those types of

481
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:19,060
things you find in net flow and there's

482
00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:23,350
a ton of other tools on there<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I'll</font>

483
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:26,320
mention just a few as we go through SNMP

484
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:29,620
walk the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ability to pull SNMP data and</font>

485
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:32,560
and do analytics on that incredibly cool

486
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:34,659
<font color="#CCCCCC">Splunk I said vendor non-specific but</font>

487
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:36,840
there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> couple of money r splunk great</font>

488
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:41,050
log management system hella expensive

489
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:42,699
but great log management system nagios

490
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:44,620
is a great fault management system when

491
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:46,180
your database goes down and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to</font>

492
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:47,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">be paranoid like me and say hey who</font>

493
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:50,140
tried to dump it from the web server

494
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:52,770
nagios is a great tool to find out

495
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:55,750
whether your database is up or down a

496
00:20:52,770 --> 00:20:57,190
number of other tools in there Jeremy

497
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:58,810
did a great job just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a few minutes ago</font>

498
00:20:57,190 --> 00:21:00,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">talking a little bit about Wireshark and</font>

499
00:20:58,810 --> 00:21:03,129
packet capturing those things are on

500
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:04,600
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> Nessus is also highlighted again a</font>

501
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:07,299
little bit more<font color="#E5E5E5"> vendor specific but it's</font>

502
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:10,748
<font color="#CCCCCC">open source ish how many guys</font>

503
00:21:07,299 --> 00:21:12,399
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> Nessus</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay very cool tool if</font>

504
00:21:10,749 --> 00:21:15,100
you're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> using that and don't scan</font>

505
00:21:12,399 --> 00:21:19,168
your networks on a regular basis you're

506
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:21,580
doing it wrong plank plain and simple

507
00:21:19,169 --> 00:21:23,950
firewalls it's probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> the biggest on</font>

508
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:24,970
the screen highlighted I want to just

509
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:27,279
kind of mention a couple of things

510
00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:31,090
because this is the remedial part of

511
00:21:27,279 --> 00:21:35,019
security fundamentals a firewall having

512
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:37,869
one in place does not end your

513
00:21:35,019 --> 00:21:39,429
responsibility<font color="#CCCCCC"> for security okay there</font>

514
00:21:37,869 --> 00:21:41,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">are so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> many people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out there especially</font>

515
00:21:39,429 --> 00:21:46,200
in smaller organizations and such and

516
00:21:41,529 --> 00:21:48,429
say hey we've got a firewall we're good

517
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:51,100
firewalls are just the<font color="#E5E5E5"> beginning that</font>

518
00:21:48,429 --> 00:21:53,019
<font color="#CCCCCC">just offers you the opportunity and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

519
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:54,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">ability to then start doing things</font>

520
00:21:53,019 --> 00:21:59,679
within your network and containing stuff

521
00:21:54,850 --> 00:22:01,389
so having a firewall is good but the

522
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:02,830
rest of it once you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a firewall and</font>

523
00:22:01,389 --> 00:22:06,549
a couple of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> other things in place</font>

524
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:08,769
this is what hopefully that's animate it

525
00:22:06,549 --> 00:22:10,299
is animating that's cool so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what</font>

526
00:22:08,769 --> 00:22:13,989
your network may look like state you

527
00:22:10,299 --> 00:22:16,119
this is the slide from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the from the</font>

528
00:22:13,989 --> 00:22:17,590
movie up and you see the little<font color="#E5E5E5"> grandpa</font>

529
00:22:16,119 --> 00:22:20,619
<font color="#CCCCCC">dude</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> standing on the edge looking over</font>

530
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:24,389
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> edge this is symbolic I'm explain</font>

531
00:22:20,619 --> 00:22:26,769
the symbology here some ball whatever

532
00:22:24,389 --> 00:22:28,959
but you're looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> off this huge</font>

533
00:22:26,769 --> 00:22:30,460
precipice you've got a couple of tools

534
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:32,409
in place but look at all the stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

535
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:34,570
keeps coming<font color="#CCCCCC"> in and keeps trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to hit</font>

536
00:22:32,409 --> 00:22:37,899
what what it is you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing you want me</font>

537
00:22:34,570 --> 00:22:41,320
to move around<font color="#E5E5E5"> more I can I'm just</font>

538
00:22:37,899 --> 00:22:44,559
teasing<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so fundamental number two</font>

539
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:47,408
is having good effective security tools

540
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:50,039
okay so that you have visibility into

541
00:22:47,409 --> 00:22:52,359
the things that you're protecting

542
00:22:50,039 --> 00:22:56,350
hopefully that's helpful let's talk

543
00:22:52,359 --> 00:22:57,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">about bass lines in scope so this one's</font>

544
00:22:56,350 --> 00:23:02,709
a short section doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have any</font>

545
00:22:57,789 --> 00:23:05,408
animated slides scope how many of you

546
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:09,299
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> responsible for security within your</font>

547
00:23:05,409 --> 00:23:12,419
organization<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

548
00:23:09,299 --> 00:23:15,269
keep your hands up<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a second what the</font>

549
00:23:12,419 --> 00:23:18,419
security mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay is it just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

550
00:23:15,269 --> 00:23:21,059
responsible for security or are you

551
00:23:18,419 --> 00:23:23,279
responsible<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the security management</font>

552
00:23:21,059 --> 00:23:24,658
firewalls you know is<font color="#CCCCCC"> there something to</font>

553
00:23:23,279 --> 00:23:26,850
find<font color="#E5E5E5"> around it that's why there's quotes</font>

554
00:23:24,659 --> 00:23:30,860
around this okay are you responsible<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

555
00:23:26,850 --> 00:23:34,559
security or are you responsible<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

556
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:36,629
security<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay which is it so think about</font>

557
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:39,509
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't need the the answer</font>

558
00:23:36,629 --> 00:23:42,509
specifically from you is what you're

559
00:23:39,509 --> 00:23:44,609
charged with protecting defined okay

560
00:23:42,509 --> 00:23:48,239
this is another security fundamental

561
00:23:44,609 --> 00:23:50,489
okay here's this cute slide<font color="#CCCCCC"> i see people</font>

562
00:23:48,239 --> 00:23:53,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">laughing I mean that's cool what's she</font>

563
00:23:50,489 --> 00:23:55,470
laughing about what's so<font color="#E5E5E5"> funny define</font>

564
00:23:53,730 --> 00:23:59,820
okay well good I'm glad you're laughing

565
00:23:55,470 --> 00:24:02,850
at the same yes but the thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is is so</font>

566
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:05,549
often the trouble that we run into is

567
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:07,709
that security is defined as security

568
00:24:05,549 --> 00:24:09,869
with quotes around it and that the

569
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:11,279
responsibility or the person who has<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

570
00:24:09,869 --> 00:24:15,119
responsibility for security is

571
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:17,309
responsible for everything from soup to

572
00:24:15,119 --> 00:24:19,859
nuts let's just<font color="#CCCCCC"> use one of those crazy</font>

573
00:24:17,309 --> 00:24:21,119
terms okay the the you are here thing I

574
00:24:19,859 --> 00:24:22,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't know why I put</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that in there but</font>

575
00:24:21,119 --> 00:24:25,320
let's talk let's talk a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

576
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:27,059
about about it being defined defining

577
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:30,480
network security within your

578
00:24:27,059 --> 00:24:32,249
organization is a fundamental<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

579
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:34,590
you as the person in charge of network

580
00:24:32,249 --> 00:24:37,559
security for<font color="#E5E5E5"> your organization needs to</font>

581
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:39,840
have it defined generally that goes

582
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:42,720
through a process of hey here is the

583
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:44,399
scope of what I'm going to do I'm going

584
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:46,139
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the firewall is in</font>

585
00:24:44,399 --> 00:24:48,178
place<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it's properly filtering the</font>

586
00:24:46,139 --> 00:24:50,070
bad things out<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the internet</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going</font>

587
00:24:48,179 --> 00:24:52,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">to make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> antivirus is in place</font>

588
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:55,499
on the inside<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so many other</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font>

589
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:57,840
right but it also has helpful to make

590
00:24:55,499 --> 00:25:00,239
sure that they understand that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am NOT</font>

591
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:02,789
the system administrator and responsible

592
00:25:00,239 --> 00:25:05,669
for applying patches to the systems I am

593
00:25:02,789 --> 00:25:08,460
not the<font color="#CCCCCC"> person who is responsible for</font>

594
00:25:05,669 --> 00:25:09,809
managing the programmers depart or the

595
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:12,299
programming Department over here to make

596
00:25:09,809 --> 00:25:15,090
sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they do and they build secure</font>

597
00:25:12,299 --> 00:25:17,908
code or maybe you are and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

598
00:25:15,090 --> 00:25:19,918
job but define it okay so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not just</font>

599
00:25:17,909 --> 00:25:21,190
security because what happens when it's

600
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:24,280
just security

601
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:26,820
somebody yell it out it's too<font color="#E5E5E5"> much right</font>

602
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:30,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">there security is way too</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> big these days</font>

603
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:32,770
to just define it with a couple of

604
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:34,930
quotes anymore ok so the you are<font color="#CCCCCC"> here</font>

605
00:25:32,770 --> 00:25:37,180
thing is a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit more precursor to</font>

606
00:25:34,930 --> 00:25:38,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">baselines</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ok how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> many</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of you guys have</font>

607
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:43,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">done any one of the three of these</font>

608
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:45,850
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the last year</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok that's</font>

609
00:25:43,330 --> 00:25:48,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> good so a risk</font>

610
00:25:45,850 --> 00:25:50,709
assessment<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok having somebody come in</font>

611
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:52,360
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> help you define what is the risk</font>

612
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:53,920
that you have within your organization

613
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:55,449
what are what are the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you</font>

614
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:57,520
need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be protecting what are the</font>

615
00:25:55,450 --> 00:25:59,530
problems that they see a vulnerability

616
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:01,030
assessment hopefully to one degree or

617
00:25:59,530 --> 00:26:03,370
another you guys are<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing most of this</font>

618
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:05,740
on your own vulnerability assessment is

619
00:26:03,370 --> 00:26:07,330
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> self-assessment kind of thing having</font>

620
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:09,190
somebody come<font color="#E5E5E5"> to it externally from time</font>

621
00:26:07,330 --> 00:26:11,230
to time is a good<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea and it's</font>

622
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:14,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">something that's necessary so that that</font>

623
00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:15,760
you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get stuck in the rut of hey</font>

624
00:26:14,410 --> 00:26:17,620
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> that way because it needs to be</font>

625
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:19,360
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of thing I know that as security</font>

626
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:21,610
geeks we always do is like that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

627
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:24,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">bob stuff and it's behind the firewall</font>

628
00:26:21,610 --> 00:26:26,620
and I blocked it down as best as

629
00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:29,020
possible and we just<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of ignore it</font>

630
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:31,689
and we get into<font color="#CCCCCC"> that ignore it kind of</font>

631
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:33,100
mentality so having somebody come do

632
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:35,200
this from<font color="#E5E5E5"> an external perspective is</font>

633
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:37,240
important penetration testing how many

634
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,320
guys have<font color="#E5E5E5"> had that I mean I know we were</font>

635
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:40,750
raised her hand for all three but how

636
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:42,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">many have had a pen test in the last</font>

637
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:44,860
year that's actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> a really cool to</font>

638
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:47,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">see that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that many a penetration</font>

639
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:49,149
test actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> having either yourselves</font>

640
00:26:47,290 --> 00:26:51,610
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have the skill sets to do it or</font>

641
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:53,050
somebody else come in and actually beat

642
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:54,969
up your network bloody<font color="#E5E5E5"> your nose a</font>

643
00:26:53,050 --> 00:26:57,159
little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> and try and find here's how</font>

644
00:26:54,970 --> 00:26:59,350
we got into your network and and what we

645
00:26:57,160 --> 00:27:02,470
did<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get there and you would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

646
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:05,919
surprised how effective having this

647
00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:08,140
information from time to time helps you

648
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:10,360
it's a security fundamental you need to

649
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:12,220
test yourselves<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok it needs to be part</font>

650
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:15,010
of what you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and then as it as</font>

651
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:18,220
it applies to baselines you need to do

652
00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:20,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">all of this stuff to then find</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out where</font>

653
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:24,220
are we so that you can then make plans

654
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:27,159
for where you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok which is the</font>

655
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:29,110
end of fundamental number<font color="#CCCCCC"> 3 know where</font>

656
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:31,570
you are and<font color="#CCCCCC"> where you're where you're</font>

657
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:32,949
going ok how bad is it and what<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

658
00:27:31,570 --> 00:27:33,350
protecting<font color="#E5E5E5"> is really what we're trying</font>

659
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:36,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">to get</font>

660
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:40,639
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay let's talk about methodologies</font>

661
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:43,070
for a minute methodologies we'll call it

662
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:48,289
a game plan<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay comes in all shapes</font>

663
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:49,760
colors X's and O's things like that okay

664
00:27:48,289 --> 00:27:53,210
so here's a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the different</font>

665
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:57,950
methodologies that we play around with

666
00:27:53,210 --> 00:28:00,950
in in my industry where we're at the

667
00:27:57,950 --> 00:28:02,480
nist SP 800 series okay there's a whole

668
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:05,440
series of things in there that are

669
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:10,760
actually 171 different sub series or sub

670
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:13,370
sections to that methodology which is a

671
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:15,760
security methodology for how to

672
00:28:13,370 --> 00:28:17,959
implement all sorts of different<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

673
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:21,850
within your network how to implement a

674
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:23,840
penetration testing regimen how to

675
00:28:21,850 --> 00:28:25,850
configure your firewall how to do

676
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:28,039
hardening of your systems and services

677
00:28:25,850 --> 00:28:30,678
all sorts of things<font color="#E5E5E5"> are wrapped into</font>

678
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:32,059
that it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> probably the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> premier network</font>

679
00:28:30,679 --> 00:28:34,309
security methodology how many you guys

680
00:28:32,059 --> 00:28:36,918
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> heard of the nist SP 800 stuff</font>

681
00:28:34,309 --> 00:28:38,990
before<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so pretty fair amount that's</font>

682
00:28:36,919 --> 00:28:41,630
great for the rest of you that haven't

683
00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:43,940
this this will<font color="#E5E5E5"> require a little bit of</font>

684
00:28:41,630 --> 00:28:45,740
research there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> there but it's</font>

685
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:47,450
another security fundamental you need to

686
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:50,990
understand what it means to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a</font>

687
00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:52,460
holistic security program okay what

688
00:28:50,990 --> 00:28:55,909
you're doing within your organization if

689
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:57,650
you want nist SP 800 light there's

690
00:28:55,909 --> 00:28:59,090
something called the sands 20 critical

691
00:28:57,650 --> 00:29:00,740
controls so it kind of narrows the

692
00:28:59,090 --> 00:29:03,168
hundred and<font color="#E5E5E5"> seventy one down to about 20</font>

693
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:07,100
which includes most of the same things

694
00:29:03,169 --> 00:29:09,350
just a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little bit less broad you might</font>

695
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:12,469
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> start there but having a game</font>

696
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:15,049
plan working through understanding what

697
00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:17,210
it is you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing is important</font>

698
00:29:15,049 --> 00:29:19,549
security control number one within the

699
00:29:17,210 --> 00:29:21,020
sands 20 is understanding what<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is</font>

700
00:29:19,549 --> 00:29:24,350
that you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> on your network and how to</font>

701
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:26,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">protect it right and then number control</font>

702
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:28,070
number two is understanding<font color="#CCCCCC"> the software</font>

703
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,679
running on all of that cool hardware and

704
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:32,539
how to protect<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and it just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> goes on</font>

705
00:29:30,679 --> 00:29:36,860
and on there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of information in</font>

706
00:29:32,539 --> 00:29:38,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">there the OSS TMM that's somewhere crazy</font>

709
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:47,939
something testing methodology manual

710
00:29:43,650 --> 00:29:50,580
which is a penetration testing and and

711
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:54,780
vulnerability assessment methodology

712
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:57,550
how's it<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to be tree</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so</font>

713
00:29:54,780 --> 00:30:00,190
fundamental number four is having a plan

714
00:29:57,550 --> 00:30:01,510
and making it work for you so a security

715
00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:03,070
methodology is required how many you

716
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:05,950
guys have a security strategic plan

717
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:08,139
within your organization<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay to one</font>

718
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:09,640
degree or another the rest of you might

719
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:12,640
want to start reviewing some of these

720
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:17,200
and build a plan around it making sure

721
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:19,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing that okay so a couple</font>

722
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:22,090
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the basics since we've covered all</font>

723
00:30:19,870 --> 00:30:22,979
the hard stuff and we're almost done by

724
00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:24,699
the way you're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get out early</font>

725
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:26,380
because i'm going to go enjoy<font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font>

726
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:30,190
anniversary with my wife the rest of the

<font color="#E5E5E5">day</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> today the basics this is all the</font>

728
00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:34,060
crap you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay first of all</font>

729
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:36,939
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to be able to know how to jump</font>

730
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:41,230
rope<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay this is mandatory it's a</font>

security fundamental okay as soon<font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font>

732
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:43,960
you've seen that enough we'll move on to

733
00:30:42,910 --> 00:30:46,840
the next slide it was just one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

734
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:49,210
done little animation things<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay you</font>

735
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:53,379
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be able to do most of these</font>

736
00:30:49,210 --> 00:30:55,630
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay as a security geek and</font>

737
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:58,060
there's a whole lot more<font color="#E5E5E5"> to this but if</font>

738
00:30:55,630 --> 00:31:00,820
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> strong in a couple of these</font>

739

areas you need to become<font color="#E5E5E5"> strong in these</font>

740
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:04,899
areas in today's day and age with the

741
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:06,310
malware the way that it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> need to</font>

742
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:07,960
understand how to reverse engineer

743
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:11,139
malware how many you guys have that

744
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:13,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">skill okay there's probably</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a couple of</font>

745
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:17,350
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay how many</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> guys would love</font>

746
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:18,730
to learn<font color="#CCCCCC"> that okay awesome we'll</font>

747
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:20,830
probably teach some of that at<font color="#E5E5E5"> st. con</font>

748
00:31:18,730 --> 00:31:23,220
this year but one of the other things is

749
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:26,409
that again a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> plug for the 801</font>

750
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:28,780
labs hackerspace they teach reverse

00:31:26,410 --> 00:31:30,490
engineering classes on a weekly basis

752
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:32,170
over there if you want to come down

753
00:31:30,490 --> 00:31:35,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">there and learn about reverse</font>

engineering malware they teach that<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

755
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:39,370
port scanning how many guys know how to

756
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:42,880
do that<font color="#CCCCCC"> hopefully most of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hands go</font>

757
00:31:39,370 --> 00:31:44,620
up okay decoding IP traffic how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

758
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:46,980
you guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> could take a packet capture and</font>

759
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:50,139
completely understand what's going on

760
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:52,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay few of you a couple of hands out</font>

761
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:54,710
here like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> great okay having those</font>

762
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:56,330
types of<font color="#CCCCCC"> skill sets is important</font>

763
00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:58,370
because you've got to be able to

764
00:31:56,330 --> 00:32:01,250
understand when when when an incident

765
00:31:58,370 --> 00:32:03,590
happens you've got to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to make</font>

766
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:05,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">the determination did they get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

means or another having the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ability to</font>

00:32:12,110 --> 00:32:16,010
actually decode that traffic and

772
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:19,010
understand it is important how about

773
00:32:16,010 --> 00:32:22,039
systems administration how many you guys

774
00:32:19,010 --> 00:32:23,450
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be good system admins to be a</font>

good security guy hopefully all you're

776
00:32:23,450 --> 00:32:27,350
going to raise your hands<font color="#E5E5E5"> because of</font>

777
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:30,549
course you have to understanding<font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font>

778
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:33,279
system administration works is important

779
00:32:30,549 --> 00:32:36,500
because you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the person to</font>

780
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:37,850
recommend how to patch window patch what

781
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:39,890
big patch came out just the other day

782
00:32:37,850 --> 00:32:41,149
most of the Utah st. folks it should

783
00:32:39,890 --> 00:32:44,510
know because we made a big<font color="#E5E5E5"> deal out of</font>

784
00:32:41,149 --> 00:32:47,989
it openssl okay there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> couple of</font>

00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:53,029
you're not patching for your vulnerable

787
00:32:49,669 --> 00:32:54,710
remember heartbleed this doesn't quite

788
00:32:53,029 --> 00:32:57,830
race to the scale of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Hartley but it's</font>

789
00:32:54,710 --> 00:32:59,450
pretty close and such but system

<font color="#E5E5E5">the heart the openssl patches is those</font>

792
00:33:02,090 --> 00:33:05,570
are patches that should have been

793
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:06,709
installed already on your systems how

794
00:33:05,570 --> 00:33:10,250
many of you guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> have passed for those</font>

795
00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:14,240
already<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay there's like a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> couple</font>

796
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:16,100
people okay why not<font color="#E5E5E5"> or what why are we</font>

797
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:18,010
not patched for those yet I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font>

to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> you answer the question but</font>

00:33:18,010 --> 00:33:21,679
having that systems administration

00:33:19,909 --> 00:33:25,820
understanding knowing when it's safe to

upgrade and patch when it's not how the

802
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:28,879
databases are going to be impacted those

803
00:33:27,770 --> 00:33:30,200
are things that you need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so that</font>

804
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:33,080
you can be effective on how your

807
00:33:35,210 --> 00:33:39,500
guys could just go to town inside of a

808
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:41,449
my sequel database or<font color="#CCCCCC"> a post</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Perez</font>

of hands went up there's a couple strong

812
00:33:45,559 --> 00:33:51,080
kung fu people in here right but

813
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:59,990
understanding that structure why is it

814
00:33:51,080 --> 00:34:01,510
important crickets chirp chirp future so

815
00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:03,490
when somebody's

816
00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:05,920
on your web server you could determine

817
00:34:03,490 --> 00:34:07,030
hey what is it<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they're doing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

818
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:08,710
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> could probably do it yourself</font>

819
00:34:07,030 --> 00:34:09,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">because you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all the commands</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to in</font>

820
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:13,800
order to grab that information right

821
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:15,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay a couple</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of last items here a</font>

you be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to script or program if</font>

things in a hurry write a script to

process a specific type of information

835

00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:12,609
and things like that if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> use this</font>

845
00:35:10,870 --> 00:35:15,160
this all of the scripts and tools that

846
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:17,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">are out there to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> script kiddie world</font>

847
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:19,690
those are<font color="#CCCCCC"> good but you can't customize</font>

848
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:21,730
those very easily without understanding

849
00:35:19,690 --> 00:35:26,200
your programming language so so learn

850
00:35:21,730 --> 00:35:29,260
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of those</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and then lastly it for</font>

851
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:31,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">this section is a way to learn more as</font>

852
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:34,980
things change so<font color="#CCCCCC"> how many of you are</font>

853
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:39,460
subscribed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> some sort of information</font>

854
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:41,020
push either mailing lists or whatever

855
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:43,060
that you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> learning about the latest</font>

856
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:45,430
trends tactics and information about

857
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:47,049
what's going on out there<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay hopefully</font>

858
00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:48,399
most of you are if<font color="#CCCCCC"> there if you're not</font>

859
00:35:47,050 --> 00:35:51,100
there's a lot of really good ones out

860
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:52,930
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll plug the Utah st.</font>

861
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:54,910
organization we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> send out a ton of</font>

862
00:35:52,930 --> 00:35:57,370
information but we<font color="#E5E5E5"> do send out some some</font>

863
00:35:54,910 --> 00:35:59,049
good information from time to time about

864
00:35:57,370 --> 00:36:01,029
different threats and issues<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are</font>

865
00:35:59,050 --> 00:36:04,150
happening out there but that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> another</font>

866
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:06,820
fundamental you need to learn a way to

867
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:09,100
find new information and and integrate

868
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:10,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">it into what you're doing okay so</font>

869
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:14,020
fundamental number 5 has learned the

870
00:36:10,930 --> 00:36:16,720
basics and practice them<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

871
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:19,240
so constant learning is required it's

872
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:20,560
one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the fundamentals as well and so</font>

873
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:24,850
we'll put it all together for<font color="#E5E5E5"> you just a</font>

874
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:30,100
little bit it's a beautiful concept this

875
00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:32,380
is an<font color="#E5E5E5"> analog here of putting all of our</font>

876
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:38,130
security things together making them all

877
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:50,830
work just wait for<font color="#CCCCCC"> it this is this is so</font>

878
00:36:38,130 --> 00:36:52,030
satisfying here right so when it's all

879
00:36:50,830 --> 00:36:53,950
said and done it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to loop</font>

880
00:36:52,030 --> 00:36:56,350
now I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> no I actually didn't have</font>

881
00:36:53,950 --> 00:36:58,660
it loop but when it's all said and done

882
00:36:56,350 --> 00:37:01,089
this is how security<font color="#E5E5E5"> is going to be</font>

883
00:36:58,660 --> 00:37:03,819
you're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> continue to deal with it</font>

884
00:37:01,090 --> 00:37:05,950
because somebody in the organization

885
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:07,270
messed up you're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to continue</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

886
00:37:05,950 --> 00:37:09,310
deal with it because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you forgot to put</font>

887
00:37:07,270 --> 00:37:11,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">that configuration configuration in the</font>

888
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:13,240
way that you're supposed to and I'll

889
00:37:11,350 --> 00:37:15,880
tell you there's not a lot of times

890
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:18,129
within the security realm that there's a

891
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:22,060
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of satisfaction and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just running out</font>

892
00:37:18,130 --> 00:37:23,560
of the office go on yahoo<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and if</font>

893
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:25,480
you're in<font color="#CCCCCC"> that career or if you're in</font>

894
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:27,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">this career for that you're in the wrong</font>

895
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:29,290
career but every once in a while it does

896
00:37:27,730 --> 00:37:32,320
happen I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> had a really recent</font>

897
00:37:29,290 --> 00:37:34,060
experience where there was a compromise

898
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:36,160
on one of the machines within the state

899
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:39,340
that we were involved with<font color="#E5E5E5"> I won't give</font>

900
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:42,490
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of details about it but there</font>

901
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:46,810
is a lot of Yahoo when you crack open

902
00:37:42,490 --> 00:37:48,459
some issue that has perplexed so many

903
00:37:46,810 --> 00:37:51,700
other people and then you finally just

904
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:53,110
you make<font color="#E5E5E5"> that one little I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

905
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:55,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">Jace</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is shaking his head he knows what</font>

906
00:37:53,110 --> 00:37:56,800
I'm talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> but you make that one</font>

907
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:59,110
little leap and then you figure out<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

908
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:00,880
really cool piece of<font color="#E5E5E5"> malware but I've</font>

909
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:04,240
got a copy of if anybody would like now

910
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:07,690
and and that it helps you distribute all

911
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:09,879
kinds of cool<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff via a web web</font>

912
00:38:07,690 --> 00:38:12,310
vulnerability one that we haven't even

913
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:15,340
seen before very cool stuff it's all

914
00:38:12,310 --> 00:38:17,110
deep encoded stuff so when the text is

915
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:20,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">coming</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> across and being put into your</font>

916
00:38:17,110 --> 00:38:23,200
browser it's not plain text it's all

917
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:25,060
encoded and then your<font color="#CCCCCC"> your browser</font>

918
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:26,950
decodes it really cool stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> if anybody</font>

919
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:27,900
wants a copy i'll send<font color="#E5E5E5"> it out that i can</font>

920
00:38:26,950 --> 00:38:29,890
send<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

921
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:32,230
but there's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of satisfaction</font>

922
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:33,609
until you have a lot of these

923
00:38:32,230 --> 00:38:35,860
fundamentals and skills in place and

924
00:38:33,610 --> 00:38:38,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">then you do cool things like that but to</font>

925
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:41,470
wrap it all up you need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have good</font>

926
00:38:38,410 --> 00:38:44,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">paranoid security minded people you need</font>

927
00:38:41,470 --> 00:38:47,919
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a paranoid person so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that when you</font>

928
00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:49,930
see faults on your network and such as

929
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:52,620
the the case that I made earlier that

930
00:38:49,930 --> 00:38:55,299
you automatically jump to the paranoia

931
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:58,180
conclusion the database servers down oh

932
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:59,740
crap why is the database server down is

933
00:38:58,180 --> 00:39:01,480
it because Bob took it down for

934
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:04,299
maintenance or is<font color="#CCCCCC"> it because somebody</font>

935
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:06,670
dumped the tables a hundred<font color="#E5E5E5"> times and it</font>

936
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:08,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">just crashed it or whatever</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay but</font>

937
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:10,990
having good paranoid security people not

938
00:39:08,590 --> 00:39:12,730
just yourself but with the systems

939

say<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need to teach these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people what</font>

949

it means to have a security minded

outlook on what they're doing the system

951
00:39:35,950 --> 00:39:39,759
administrators are not going to just

952
00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:41,590
magically decide hey you know what I'm

going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to always use a heartening guide</font>

960
00:39:54,010 --> 00:40:00,010
kinds of things<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay tools you need good</font>

961
00:39:57,100 --> 00:40:02,440
tools that manage to help you manage the

962
00:40:00,010 --> 00:40:04,030
threats that you're seeing and the tools

963
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:05,740
if you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> just put a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> little equal</font>

964
00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:07,990
equal sign in their tools equals

965
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:10,029
visibility you need to be able to see

966
00:40:07,990 --> 00:40:11,439
what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going on and if you don't have</font>

967
00:40:10,030 --> 00:40:14,140
the good tools to do that you're going

968
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:16,150
to be failing okay a baseline<font color="#CCCCCC"> to work</font>

969
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:18,040
from and a scope to be effective in

970
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:19,780
having to baseline<font color="#E5E5E5"> and understanding</font>

971
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:21,820
where you're at and having a plan<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

972
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:23,920
move forward<font color="#E5E5E5"> as important but also</font>

973
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:27,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">having a scope so that you can actually</font>

974
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:29,650
be effective is key as well because if

975
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:31,300
your scope is this you're never you're

976
00:40:29,650 --> 00:40:33,100
going to be a mile wide and less than an

977
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:34,690
inch deep if your scope is pretty

978
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:36,400
refined you're going to be very

979
00:40:34,690 --> 00:40:38,380
effective at what you're doing so make

980
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:40,480
sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the scope is defined and that</font>

981
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:41,560
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> somebody thinks it's this and that's</font>

982
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,820
your boss

983
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:44,350
help them understand that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know what</font>
