00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:44,489
kind of wrap my head around this app sec

16
00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:46,230

hit me but I struggled with it I I'm a

18
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:51,960
network guy by trade came from a

19
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,149
networking background sysadmin back kind

20
00:00:54,149 --> 00:00:55,770
of background so when it came time to

21
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:58,579
actually start dealing with apps I

22
00:00:58,579 --> 00:01:02,489
really struggled with that I mean none

23
00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:04,530
of it made sense like how many of you

24
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:07,710

25
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:10,260
this was my world like I I'm cool with

26
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:13,470
this mess anybody like this mess I got

27
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:15,900
this I got this you you could throw me

28
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:18,150
in the nasty nasty server room you know

29
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:19,799
I don't even need a jacket like yeah I

30
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:20,909
mean if you guys been in the server room

31
00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:23,369
so long you don't even need a Jackie you

32
00:01:23,369 --> 00:01:24,900
don't even hear the hum anymore you just

33
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:27,570
say I'm good right now it's cool this

34
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:31,008
was me so I started

35
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,370
I started on the help desk I was a pc

36
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:41,860
tech you know telling people how to

37
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:43,450
right-click you know how that life is

38
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:45,130
right so I did that for a little while

39
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:48,100
chemist admin net admin then I had the

40
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:49,780
horrible misfortune of becoming an

41
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:52,180
incident responder you know anybody have

42
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:55,119
to live that life packet monkey baby

43
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:57,190
right so I did that for a while then it

44
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:58,750
became a pen tester and that's the way

45
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:01,960
nature intended anybody that's the way

46
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:05,550
it's supposed to work so I

47
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:10,690
affectionately called web hacking a

48
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:13,209
female dog hacking that was the word I

49
00:02:13,209 --> 00:02:15,550
used I had a particular phrase I just I

50
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:18,730
just couldn't see put in a single quote

51
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:20,950
or a back tick in something and calling

52
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:23,830
that hacking lose one like you know

53
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:26,709
where's my command prompt you know

54
00:02:26,709 --> 00:02:28,420
something should go from a dollar sign

55
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:30,370
to a pound sign something should go hey

56
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:32,950
your route like that's hacking this this

57
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:35,590
is theirs mmm there's no masculinity in

58
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:37,000
this web hacking stuff that that's all

59
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,830
I'm saying right come on anybody with me

60
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:40,930
so that that was what I struggled with

61
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:46,090
so pin testing started moving away from

62
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:48,700
the network and I struggled with that

63
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:50,829
because I was cool with networking

64
00:02:50,829 --> 00:02:53,350
sysadmin stuff but then when we started

65
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:55,420
to move to web app I started to struggle

66
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:58,930
we moved a mobile app I really started

67
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:01,720
to struggle cloud confused me even more

68
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:04,239
people started talking about mashups and

69
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:06,030
I'm thinking mashed potatoes anybody

70
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:08,739
know is it just you I can't be the only

71
00:03:08,739 --> 00:03:11,260
one so I was like okay I don't know what

72
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:13,329
the heck of mashup is and then someone's

73
00:03:13,329 --> 00:03:14,860
like well guys you got to understand its

74
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:17,019
single page applications now it's sp-a I

75
00:03:17,019 --> 00:03:19,840
was like I don't know what that is

76
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,709
either so all I could say is I don't

77
00:03:23,709 --> 00:03:24,640
know if you went through what I went

78
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,130
through but it was like houston we got a

79
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:30,579
problem all this garbled e goop is what

80
00:03:30,579 --> 00:03:32,200
I started running into when I started

81
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:36,220
doing more and more apps so I needed

82
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:39,390
something that could help me

83
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:46,680
I felt lost any of you guys got lost

84
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,450
like that Bennett and then I can get

85
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:51,420
without lost so I realized he was my

86
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:56,120
problem I couldn't program who's with me

87
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:02,370
right I i no speaka cold mm-hmm no i no

88

89
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:06,690
situation right so for those of you who

90
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:08,489
are computer science majors you smart

91
00:04:08,489 --> 00:04:11,519
people I don't know anything about turns

92
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:14,190
primitives programming logic data

93
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:16,709
structures algorithms object-oriented

94
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:18,810
programming anything like that I am a

95
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:22,650
regular guy I like alcohol I like

96

home and you're like well you know have

99
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:31,919
you really seen the differences between

100
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:37,260
ember Jas and angularjs i'm really

101
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:38,880
loving single application single page

102
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,410
application capabilities what do you

103
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:48,780
think Bob no no no no so I like most

104
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:51,900
people figured why don't I just go grab

105
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:56,940
the OWASP testing guide yeah so that'll

106
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:59,910
help me learn how to do this that's what

107
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:02,010
I figured so well okay look let me just

108
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:04,590
grab the OS testing guide and you know

109
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:10,140
maybe that'll be all I need so I can do

110
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:11,940
this so can you guys please not hack the

111
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:13,410
network while I go out to the internet

112
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:15,620
please

113
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:23,470
so I went to the Olaf testing guide and

114
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:28,690
here's how it started I said okay got my

115
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:30,910
principles of testing testing techniques

116
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:33,750
driving testing requirements okay

117
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,800
security test integrated into the

118
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,180
development and testing workflows

119
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:40,600
security test data analysis k here's

120
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,310
what i do before testing here's what i

121
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:44,440
do during testing here's during

122
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,120
development during deployment this

123
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,310
sounds freaking pretty good who's with

124
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:52,510
me Milo dead Bob I feel great then you

125
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:57,580
start scrolling down right and as I get

126
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:59,320
through the information gathering stuff

127
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:02,650
you know I can kind of you know I could

128
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:06,250
do a little bit right as well conduct

129
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:08,560
search engine discovery I could handle

130
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,530
that you know i can google and i can do

131
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:16,080
that identify application entry points

132
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:20,110
hmm map execution flows through a

133
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:26,440
website hmm so i was like i can do some

134
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:28,740
of this so here's what happened to me

135
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:33,100
most of this stuff I could do when I got

136
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:37,330
down into here authentication testing

137
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:39,790
all this kind of stuff I was like okay I

138
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:42,970
can read it I can google it session

139
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:45,880
testing yeah this kind of confused me

140
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:48,940
and then this stuff really confused me

141
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:52,930
how many of you guys actually know the

142
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:56,230
difference between ldap injection orm

143
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:58,840
injection xml injection ssi injection

144
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:01,420
xpath injection I'm map smtp injection

145
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:04,900
em code injection anybody okay you guys

146
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:06,490
are way smarter than me because I don't

147
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:10,450
so I used to watch guys pen test and

148
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:12,940
guys would say to me oh man well I'm

149
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:14,500
really working hard on that test I'm

150
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:19,570
doing full a wasp and and they were

151
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:22,990
meaning that to say that they do this

152
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:28,120
whole list so like when you look at a

153
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:30,970
page do you test the web page for all

154
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:33,770
these different things java

155
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:37,099
script execution HTML injection Lee do

156
00:07:37,099 --> 00:07:39,110
you do all of that how many of us were

157
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:40,970
like pretty proud of ourselves because

158
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:42,620
we can finally explain cross-site

159
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:45,229
scripting to our boss anybody like had

160
00:07:45,229 --> 00:07:47,030
that you're like I did pretty good on

161
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:49,699
that one high five yeah I explained

162
00:07:49,699 --> 00:07:52,009
cross-site scripting yesterday and and

163
00:07:52,009 --> 00:07:54,729
and when someone wants to talk about

164
00:07:54,729 --> 00:07:58,669
interpreter injection you know or HTTP

165
00:07:58,669 --> 00:08:00,889

215
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:48,730
over there it's the demilitarized zone

216
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:50,770
that's how we segment you know the

217
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:52,300
exterior traffic for me you know they

218
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:55,270
bled the dead it cool now on someone's

219
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:57,550
like oh it's middleware any of you guys

220
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:01,270
what the hell is where right I don't

221
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:04,690
know this stuff so it took me

222
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:06,550
two years of web app pen testing and

223
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:08,500
what I did was I did what every other

224
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:11,080
security consultant did hit every

225
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:14,230
website with 50 million tools period

226
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:16,450
typical web app pen test light that bad

227
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:19,720
boy up with to 300 tools if I had to 301

228
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:23,710
guess what I've thrown that at it too

229
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:25,720
and then I will go right to the customer

230
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:31,510
your website seems to have the something

231
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:36,070
bad it's it says that so you want to fix

232
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:37,990
that then I go over to the developer

233
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:39,250
give it to the developer and the

234
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:40,980
developer would laugh at me because

235
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:43,540
that's what they do right when you give

236
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:45,970
them stuff that makes no sense then you

237
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:49,570
go this says you have cross frame a

238
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:52,990
scripting and then developer will go no

239
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:54,730
I don't maybe like okay well maybe you

240
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:59,560
don't that was all I had I was ok so I

241
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,180
needed to come up with a way that work

242
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:02,860
for me ok so I'm going to teach you guys

243
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:04,750
my way this is the gel way you're not

244
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,670
going to find it in any book it's not an

245
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:09,250
o oz this is just what I do when I test

246
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:11,860
websites so if you were on the job with

247
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:13,690
me and I was teaching you web app I'll

248
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:16,360
be like artnet sit down with me this is

249
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:19,510
how I test web apps and then you would

250
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:20,890
use this i would say use this

251
00:13:20,890 --> 00:13:22,510
methodology and as you learn new stuff

252
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:27,580
add to it cool all right so what you're

253
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:29,590
going to do is you're going to learn

254
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:32,920
three questions so when I deal with a

255
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:36,670
web app for me I always ask myself three

256
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:40,680
questions so I'm looking at a website on

257
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:43,810
every single page of the website ask

258
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:46,570
yourself three questions so you're

259
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:48,910
looking at a website and you say okay

260
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:51,850
question number one is it talking to a

261
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:56,850
database okay yes it is or no it's not

262
00:13:56,850 --> 00:13:59,950
question number two can I or someone

263
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:05,080
else see what I type yes I can no I

264
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:08,020
can't question number three does it

265
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:10,330
reference a file if a reference is a

266
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:12,490
file I gotta think a list of things I

267
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:17,020
try that's it so on every page ask

268
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:18,430
yourself three questions

269
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:21,029
okay so guys question number one what

270
00:14:21,029 --> 00:14:24,010
come on does it talk to a database

271
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:27,399
question number two what see what I tied

272
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:30,430
question number three what that's it

273
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:31,990
that's it we're done there's no Oh asp

274
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:34,300
is that that's it that's it that's it

275
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:37,330
that's it that's all I do okay now is it

276
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:39,990
the most thorough test in the world no

277
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:45,370
right but can you with just Firefox go

278
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:47,350
through a website on every single page

279
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:50,950
and ask yourself three questions if you

280
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:52,899
can do that then you can get started

281
00:14:52,899 --> 00:14:54,880
with web testing that makes sense guys

282
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:58,320
okay so question number one what is it

283
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,180
yeah there's going to be a pop quiz yes

284
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:04,209
question number one does it talk to a

285
00:15:04,209 --> 00:15:05,860
database okay so what we got to figure

286
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:08,800
out is how do we know if it's talking to

287
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:12,490
a database so when I look up here here's

288
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:14,350
the address and guys if you guys want to

289
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:16,390
jump online and do this with me jump on

290
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:19,870
line drive right with me okay so I'm on

291
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:23,200
this website up here do you see anything

292
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,270
after the IP address you got nothing

293
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:28,570
there right okay what I'm looking for is

294
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:31,029
parameter passing ok so I'm going to

295
00:15:31,029 --> 00:15:34,870
click a link and now can you see that

296

what yeah that's cool so what you want

304
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:04,920
to do is you want to insert a single

305
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:08,070
quote and place up or immediately after

306
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:10,650
the parameter value so you have done

307
00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:12,690
well any place you were quoting here

308
00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:17,310
this is D technical stuff ready this is

like it insulted I mean it comes up

314
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:33,630
especially when able to identify as well

315
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:36,150
objection inside of your application the

316

get request for it a lesbian all right

317
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:41,750

the gear up list you can mess with

327
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:09,510
parameters and serviceable quote drawer

328
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:11,459
stuff in there try to see the ghost boom

329
00:17:11,459 --> 00:17:14,970
fair enough okay how many of you can go

330
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:17,010
to every single page in a website and

331
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:19,949
try it right maybe like that I think I

332
00:17:19,949 --> 00:17:23,490
can do this right okay so now the next

333
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:26,189
piece is all right that's a neighbor

334
00:17:26,189 --> 00:17:29,130
request sometimes you can align

335
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:32,190
post request so can you guys see this

336
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:35,790
login page so why did not aspx there's

337
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:37,440
no question mark something english

338
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,720
something here so it's not a get request

339
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:43,290
and so what guys it's a post request so

343
00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:54,660
I'm going to do some of those start

344
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:57,660
something called tamper data and tamper

345
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:00,480
data is a leadbox II just like any of

346
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,580
your other leg Rises then how do you do

347
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:05,310
people see application monkeys get into

348
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:08,250
fights over stuff like burp suite and

349
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:10,830

people think think I really mad like how

354
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:27,660
do you think the only thing you can do

355
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:30,690
to sway them on this argument is derived

356
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:34,050
in the star track now really that's all

357
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:39,600

360
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:48,690
to start timber I said go it says hey do

361
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:50,040
you want to tamper with this request

362
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:53,310
today and I got one last time too so I

363
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:54,500
want to tamper with this

364
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,450
request and we look at it says tada

365
00:18:56,450 --> 00:18:59,510
looky there there are post parameter

366
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:03,460
names and post parameter values so

367
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:06,280
immediately here in the post parameter

368
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:08,450
here's your bracket value you would

369
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:10,490
insert your single quote right there

370
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:13,970
it's the signal so if you see parameter

371
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:17,030
passing a life and serve a single bowl

372
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:21,530
that's it another stuff an awesome have

373
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:25,070
time that's it that's it okay so you're

374
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:26,660
looking for parameter passing when you

375
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:28,220
see primer cassidy answered a single

376
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:32,860
quote that's it so we're looking for

377
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:35,830
injection born release of some sort so

378
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:44,780
you gotta ask ourselves so we got to ask

379
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:49,700
ourselves why well computers like

380
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:52,880
numbers computers don't like names like

381
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:56,510
a little number number equals 10

382
00:19:56,510 --> 00:19:59,630
computers like cool right if I get a

383
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:04,910
string string equals Joe from here's

384
00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:08,450
like no doubt isn't in right because if

385
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:10,160
you're going to declare strength you

386
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:14,690
have to put it inside a lot whole spread

387
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:18,020
computer so perfectly cool with numbers

388
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:21,020
if you're going to do anything that has

389
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:24,050
taxed in it he wants the text that said

390
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:27,230
hey dude here's the beginning and here's

391
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:30,380
my life you gotta do that so here's the

392
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:37,080
problem when you have when you have

393
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:40,010
happening on the web

394
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:45,730
you have stuff is happening on the lips

395
00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:47,320
same thing like I just shows you right

396
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:50,620
you go okay no problem it this is Joe

397
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:53,740
not a problem it is a number string

398
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:55,510
here's Jill which license inside of

399
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:57,670
clothes we're cool how many of you guys

400
00:20:57,670 --> 00:21:00,100
made this mistake and another that's

401
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:04,030
important okay what happens for a thing

402
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:07,059
goes boom right okay then your professor

403
00:21:07,059 --> 00:21:08,950
walks by and something when I actually

404
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:11,070
viewed it properly turning variables

405
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:14,290
cause a syntax error right and I would

406
00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:15,940
say something like why the heck does it

407
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:18,040
say there's a pot on my mind 12 when it

408
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:22,260
comes on on five because you can what

409
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:25,179
right teach a little to me lyrics wrong

410
00:21:25,179 --> 00:21:26,740
with you Joe but no man which one but

411
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:32,020
obviously it's not working right so you

412
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:33,850
can see that as I have you got up close

413
00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:35,350
quotation mark after the character

414
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:37,540
shrink something's wrong right so let's

415
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:40,270
go with look here at specific blood I

416
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:42,730
got here's honest a select all records

417
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:45,460
from my products table where product ID

418
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:48,010
equals request having this request piece

419
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:49,330
lets me know what's coming for me on

420
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:52,570
this number is going to go right in

421
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:55,780
there that make some sense so guys

422
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:58,630
dragon you let whatever he has if you

423
00:21:58,630 --> 00:22:01,450
look here products that ESP is probably

424
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:06,250
talking about what that products table

425
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:08,830
and I need it's probably talking about

426
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:12,700
but then that number is going to go in

427
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:14,580
there so you're like okay

428
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:18,809
bad now what happens when the guy puts

429
00:22:18,809 --> 00:22:21,029
in that single book so it throws in the

430
00:22:21,029 --> 00:22:23,250
single foot right here and now look that

431
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:24,960
ends up doing designed up with two on

432
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,679
this side and what now is that going to

433
00:22:28,679 --> 00:22:31,110
make it go boom and pretty things going

434
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:34,140
to go bump right so now when it goes

435
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:39,200
boom did you basically just do this I

436
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,610
mean that's really what's happening on

437
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:44,100
the back end something sense guys so

438
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:46,519
you're like okay now that I understand

439
00:22:46,519 --> 00:22:49,860
why I put in the single quote right I'm

440
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:52,409
trying to blow up what's going on on the

441
00:22:52,409 --> 00:22:55,590
back here now the rest is just syntax

442
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:57,750
stuff that's all the others so this is

443
00:22:57,750 --> 00:23:02,610
just syntax okay the next one let's say

444
00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:05,850
I'm out and I'm surfing the web and I go

445
00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:08,820
whoa search box and put this in and I go

446
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:12,029
whoa pressing script yep how many of you

447
00:23:12,029 --> 00:23:14,639
are like me when you see that you find

448
00:23:14,639 --> 00:23:16,740
that your box gives you that locating so

449
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:24,120
something intelligent I was so what and

450
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,980
you go well actually what that means is

451
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:27,750
you can ask your code context with your

452
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:31,740
browser because although smell and

453
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:33,419
that's bad right obviously them in the

454
00:23:33,419 --> 00:23:36,389
cheese yes that's pretty bad because

455
00:23:36,389 --> 00:23:42,350
I've been lucky code because what an act

456
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:47,669
okay so this is why I don't do for us a

457
00:23:47,669 --> 00:23:49,140
soccer ball because our

458
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:53,820
that looks like this so let's sit out

459
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:57,060
here and you said you quit right I

460
00:23:57,060 --> 00:24:00,030
really informal the writing code you

461
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:01,680
guys are like me do you holy write code

462
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:04,560
if there's alcohol involved I'm gonna

463
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:06,480
come up the spot if I'm drinking I'll

464
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,370
tell you want but this it's a letter

465
00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:10,410
mouth like you gotta come cheers them

466
00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:12,690
out to kind of take the edge off a

467
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:17,580
little too much you can ok what if you

468
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:21,690
get our it so let's save my search box

469
00:24:21,690 --> 00:24:24,720
on your script alert right so I'm going

470
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:28,830
to throw this script alert now after

471
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:30,450
this in the search box diagram here

472
00:24:30,450 --> 00:24:37,260
right thing pops up was like I think I'm

473
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:39,470
strong

474
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:44,840
yeah anyways so I did the script alert

475
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:46,700
and you get that pop up so script

476
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:48,799
JavaScript code javascript is

477
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:50,269
client-side code that means a month

478
00:24:50,269 --> 00:24:53,330
later what's on the client was a new

479
00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:56,509
browser okay sir psycho asp JSP page

480
00:24:56,509 --> 00:24:59,750
that stuff runs we're on the server

481
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:03,200
right okay so when you put that script

482
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,539
alert in there that pop-up actually

483
00:25:05,539 --> 00:25:11,809
happen later yeah that happen here ok so

484
00:25:11,809 --> 00:25:15,440
the server's find as a service not

485
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,679
struggling who's struggling the client

486
00:25:18,679 --> 00:25:20,990
is struggling so and we did that pop up

487
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:23,059
we prove that we can execute code here

488
00:25:23,059 --> 00:25:25,190
so that pop-up just goes eh I can

489
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:27,710
execute code now I'm gonna get right ok

490
00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:31,220
hit my back button now I'm going to grab

491
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:36,259
another one I'm it says skirt what is if

492
00:25:36,259 --> 00:25:39,379
you're talking about what document doc

493
00:25:39,379 --> 00:25:41,149
clicking all right so I'm going to throw

494
00:25:41,149 --> 00:25:43,610
that in there hopefully a copy pasted so

495
00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:45,230
after that and this time I get a pop-up

496
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:51,070
power what ok so I'm go to gmail right

497
00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:53,230
that's what I'm like oh man pump up give

498
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:59,549
it up give us a technical term denotes

499
00:25:59,549 --> 00:26:01,929
you guys know I'm saying it right up I

500
00:26:01,929 --> 00:26:04,659
give my username and password they give

501
00:26:04,659 --> 00:26:09,580
me back the session ID no okay maybe you

502
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:11,019
guys been to a different school than I

503
00:26:11,019 --> 00:26:15,340
that's all I said that all right so HTTP

504
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:17,679
is stateless right so your website has

505
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:19,809
no idea who you are from one packet to

506
00:26:19,809 --> 00:26:21,909
the next so you need the session and he

507
00:26:21,909 --> 00:26:23,320
sold it to a web server to be like oh

508
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:25,419
that's jump he's the guy who likes

509
00:26:25,419 --> 00:26:29,080
documentary and it's not not us wrap up

510
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:32,350
of get technical it's how will you share

511
00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:34,230
that it gets an authentication mechanism

512
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:38,350
it's all I'm saying it was keep talking

513
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:41,379
so you prove to an execution with a

514
00:26:41,379 --> 00:26:43,240
pop-up you also proved that you have

515
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:45,580
access to the session ID right so you

516
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:48,009
first step one prune code execution step

517
00:26:48,009 --> 00:26:50,259
2 said hey not only web code execution

518
00:26:50,259 --> 00:26:51,970
what I also have access to the society

519
00:26:51,970 --> 00:26:57,100
so now I want to do is I want to say i

520
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:59,440
don't want to script alert I want to say

521
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:02,950
document that what it goes somewhere

522
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:06,519
okay so I want you to go to this page

523
00:27:06,519 --> 00:27:10,899
the page is called but uh huh and I'm

524
00:27:10,899 --> 00:27:12,789
going to take the session cookie on a

525
00:27:12,789 --> 00:27:17,500
hop give and send it over here this make

526
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:20,110
sense guys okay so you take that whole

527
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:25,929
link you take that whole link throw that

528
00:27:25,929 --> 00:27:29,679
in there like so right I paste that in

529
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:31,940
there the doggone thing doesn't

530
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:37,269
answer it sucks or did what happened

531
00:27:37,269 --> 00:27:41,679
yeah the session I need got sent what

532
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:45,220
somewhere else thus the term cross-site

533
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:48,679
make sense so I give this username a

534
00:27:48,679 --> 00:27:50,330
password you gave me back this session

535
00:27:50,330 --> 00:27:52,129
I'm the session ID is how the server

536
00:27:52,129 --> 00:27:54,860
knows who I am so this is how the server

537
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:57,259
knows who I am if someone else would

538
00:27:57,259 --> 00:27:58,909
have my session I think they could do

539
00:27:58,909 --> 00:28:03,590
let negativity me right so the idea

540
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:06,470
behind it is to say okay well this is

541
00:28:06,470 --> 00:28:10,730
how you steal a session ok so now you

542
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:14,929
can grab this which is right here case I

543
00:28:14,929 --> 00:28:16,519
said and when I cook you catch the

544
00:28:16,519 --> 00:28:19,340
rights out all these different cookies

545
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:20,929
anyone's ever click the link your pranks

546
00:28:20,929 --> 00:28:26,960
them out right so that's us today make

547
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:31,129
sense ok now what you could do I'm gonna

548
00:28:31,129 --> 00:28:34,970
do this in internet exploder get it so

549
00:28:34,970 --> 00:28:37,820
it's going to lay right this no it's the

550
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:39,830

do I do when I slant to my CI go I say

578
00:30:21,330 --> 00:30:24,450

582
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:43,860
write what so what I do is I just tell

583
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:46,830
my logs hey you have a process scripting

584
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:50,480
so what that means is

585
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:58,440
how many of our users will fall for this

586
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:07,330
plenty right so no give right so we tell

587

00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:11,590
scripting people can steal passwords now

589
00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:14,470
do the Nerds get mad at me when I say

590
00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:17,230
that right because I'm not explaining it

591
00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:19,990
not explaining it exactly correct in

592
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:25,540
line I mean how many nerves and get all

593
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:28,180
kinds of upset and mixed up in arms this

594
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:32,320
is some Farkle BS that's how you

595
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,600
properly explain code execution of the

596
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:40,510
context of the browser is it no but what

597
00:31:40,510 --> 00:31:43,390
do i do need the customer can do and

598

they don't know what we're gaining I'm

599
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:47,620
able to fix it right so I used to work

600
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:49,990
for this really interesting place out of

601
00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:52,210
my opinion that's going in here but you

602
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:59,410
know it was some luxury hotel so I work

603
00:31:59,410 --> 00:32:01,950
on a luxury hotel it was a great place

604
00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:04,330
strongly recommend you got a [ __ ] gets

605
00:32:04,330 --> 00:32:07,300
a chance to go strong American luxury

606
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:10,030
accommodations so this was the hyatt

607
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:13,780
regency if so i'm working with general

608
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:17,530
battle I have to tell my boss the cross

609
00:32:17,530 --> 00:32:18,970

00:32:46,759 --> 00:32:48,620
scripting now the third week I was a

624
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:50,779
certain you identify processor do you

625
00:32:50,779 --> 00:32:52,789
want people walking into the website as

626
00:32:52,789 --> 00:32:56,240
you now know Jim generals have a notch

was i speaking [ __ ] nice that's right

630
00:33:14,419 --> 00:33:16,850
that's right anybody who does my beloved

631
00:33:16,850 --> 00:33:18,409
military knows and we have this phrase

632
00:33:18,409 --> 00:33:20,389
them use when we talk to Jones beams

633
00:33:20,389 --> 00:33:22,070
bullets fuel didn't know that means

634
00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:26,230
what's being full of fuel come on

transportation right if we're not

636
00:33:32,179 --> 00:33:35,299
talking about feeding my trees if we're

637
00:33:35,299 --> 00:33:37,700
not talking about arm in my troops if

638
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:39,289
we're not talking about Moodle metrics

639
00:33:39,289 --> 00:33:41,020
or location 80 location

640
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:42,730
are we talking about anything important

641
00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:46,240
no sir actually the BPM we actually need

642
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,310
to pass the BPM so need to add more RAM

643
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:54,180
to the server sir Sir sir Sir can you

644
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:57,040
can they do it right just makin sense

645
00:33:57,040 --> 00:34:01,090
that it was awesome to VPN right so the

646
00:34:01,090 --> 00:34:03,370
whole thing here is trying to bring app

647
00:34:03,370 --> 00:34:05,050
set down and something that we can

648
00:34:05,050 --> 00:34:08,050
digest okay so question number one was

649
00:34:08,050 --> 00:34:12,909
what bass okay now how do you know if

650
00:34:12,909 --> 00:34:14,380
it's talking to a database do you

651
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:18,310
remember what to look for parameter

652
00:34:18,310 --> 00:34:20,918
passing good question number two wells

653
00:34:20,918 --> 00:34:23,679
question number two can I see what I'm

654
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:25,960
typing okay the only place where you can

655
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:28,780
see what you're typing a form a blog a

656
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:31,360
guest book a contact us form instant

657
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,969
messenger windows chat window any place

658
00:34:33,969 --> 00:34:36,699
or you can put in something and someone

659
00:34:36,699 --> 00:34:39,280
else can see it because what happened to

660
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,810
because I'm scripting is you throw in

661
00:34:40,810 --> 00:34:43,510
that script alert right this other guy

662
00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:46,510
comes to it later and because he's on

663
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:50,409
that same page he executes sit right so

664
00:34:50,409 --> 00:34:53,050
it's an abuse of trust for it you think

665
00:34:53,050 --> 00:34:55,360
that you're looking at content from the

666
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,640
real page but actually you're dealing

667
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:59,440
with script code from someone else when

668
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,090
objected it into the page that make

669
00:35:01,090 --> 00:35:04,150
sense guys so you can look for search

670
00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:07,630
boxes feedback forms anywhere where you

671
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:10,120
can type something right that's really

672
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:12,010
locally on such Perkins and its

673
00:35:12,010 --> 00:35:14,110
derivatives and prospects tributes now

674
00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:14,860
here's

675
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:16,690
crazy when we found the parameter

676
00:35:16,690 --> 00:35:19,390
passing I just told you to insert or

677
00:35:19,390 --> 00:35:22,180
what tickles insert simple moments or a

678
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:24,430
tick right if it goes boom look at the

679
00:35:24,430 --> 00:35:27,790
error message if the error message has

680
00:35:27,790 --> 00:35:31,270
you know a WBC jbc something like that

681
00:35:31,270 --> 00:35:36,850
then it's what test you all right what

682
00:35:36,850 --> 00:35:42,670
if it has XML then it's like XML

683
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:44,350
injection what if it's an ldap error

684
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:47,350
then it's like oh well it's the Surfside

685
00:35:47,350 --> 00:35:51,310
include and that's why service i'm into

686
00:35:51,310 --> 00:35:53,980
an injection this is make sense guys how

687
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:59,380
did you guys did what I did meaning when

688
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:02,410
you see this you immediately think I

689
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:08,110
test the left side for all of that like

690
00:36:08,110 --> 00:36:10,270
you look at the guy and kindle hey they

691
00:36:10,270 --> 00:36:11,950
didn't want me to check for it I would

692
00:36:11,950 --> 00:36:18,790
then right into the freaking guy right

693
00:36:18,790 --> 00:36:22,060
vroom yeah so I was like did well yeah

694
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:23,770
and people will tell me that well you're

695
00:36:23,770 --> 00:36:32,140
up to full god I'm doing it right but my

696
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:34,210
gosh guys it looks like they just play

697
00:36:34,210 --> 00:36:37,900
it on the website something says okay

698
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:43,090
last one most Western I 3d verifier

699
00:36:43,090 --> 00:36:45,790
there's a reference of five good okay so

700
00:36:45,790 --> 00:36:49,330
let's say girl something like this okay

701
00:36:49,330 --> 00:36:55,240
so if you look here I click here right

702
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:58,229
once it's a guys

703
00:36:58,919 --> 00:37:03,400
but it is it is it talking about 50 / ba

704
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:06,069
system yeah so what you want to try to

705
00:37:06,069 --> 00:37:08,019
be you want to say hey and just swap

706
00:37:08,019 --> 00:37:13,989
that sucker out with this real ways in

707
00:37:13,989 --> 00:37:17,979
it ha you made this up set out to show

708
00:37:17,979 --> 00:37:19,900
this or is that a real way I'm ended up

709
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:23,999
to show you see

710
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:42,370
I'm just saying I thought y'all it's a

711
00:37:42,370 --> 00:37:46,540
hypothetical going on you know I'm just

712
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:48,240
teaching it here for the sake of

713
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:54,010
academic warning right okay so what you

714
00:37:54,010 --> 00:37:56,020
did is you just said hey he's talking

715
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:58,330
about 50 local file system so I just

716
00:37:58,330 --> 00:38:02,620
left yeah hey man can you read this spot

717
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:05,650
right now what you could say is you go

718
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:21,400
well okay so what I got is a text file

719
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:27,550
and the text file looks for life oks

720
00:38:27,550 --> 00:38:30,580
obviously deep technical stuff so copy

721
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:35,830
that if I can look for this will call

722
00:38:35,830 --> 00:38:40,720
this an LF I global what we filed

723
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:43,810
include right now the same thing you

724
00:38:43,810 --> 00:38:44,150
should

725
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:48,200
test for what well Mull file inclusion

726
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:50,660
so all i did was uh says hey he's

727
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:54,470
talking about file so i switched what

728
00:38:54,470 --> 00:38:57,980
was that with a new father I wanted him

729
00:38:57,980 --> 00:38:59,930
to yank down and didn't get that down

730
00:38:59,930 --> 00:39:02,809
into the page okay can you google

731
00:39:02,809 --> 00:39:04,640
website and ask yourself these three

732
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:07,720
questions on every page can you do that

733
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:10,730
okay so guys is this the most thorough

734
00:39:10,730 --> 00:39:14,510
blood test out there no no it's not it's

735
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:17,990
not but how many of you have struggled

736
00:39:17,990 --> 00:39:20,779
with validating results from a scanner

737
00:39:20,779 --> 00:39:23,510
you might ever done with that or someone

738
00:39:23,510 --> 00:39:25,730
brings in the web inspect students and

739
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:27,710
they go well you've got this horner

740
00:39:27,710 --> 00:39:29,690
ability and then you the security person

741
00:39:29,690 --> 00:39:31,250
you got to walk over to the developer

742
00:39:31,250 --> 00:39:34,400
and go okay this says your cross

743
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,930
descriptive can you develop reduce

744
00:39:35,930 --> 00:39:38,569
what's cross-site scripting and you know

745
00:39:38,569 --> 00:39:40,220
we'll know it's a vulnerability that

746
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:42,020
allows code execution in the context of

747
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:45,020
your browser so it says right and then

748
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:48,049
he goes oh we're not going back right

749
00:39:48,049 --> 00:39:50,180
and you have nothing to say you guys

750
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:52,339
because if you can use these three

751
00:39:52,339 --> 00:39:53,720
questions you're going to be able to

752
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:56,900
validate a lot of our builders like this

753
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:59,390
will pick up like eighty percent of web

754
00:39:59,390 --> 00:40:01,609
app stuff guys is there more sure

755
00:40:01,609 --> 00:40:05,329
this'll course there's no okay now let's

756
00:40:05,329 --> 00:40:07,050
figure out something

757
00:40:07,050 --> 00:40:10,770
something called the fuzz DB okay buzz

758
00:40:10,770 --> 00:40:12,990
bee bee it's a project that's out on

759
00:40:12,990 --> 00:40:15,030
google code got moved to give up a

760
00:40:15,030 --> 00:40:17,520
couple of weeks ago but what I want you

761
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:19,740
guys to realize is I'm going to jump

762
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:23,190
into the attack section right and if we

763
00:40:23,190 --> 00:40:25,950
look at the attack section let's choose

764
00:40:25,950 --> 00:40:28,770
cross-site scripting so i choose

765
00:40:28,770 --> 00:40:30,360
cross-site scripting now I talk to you

766
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:32,960
one type of processor in today at night

767
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:35,880
okay but if you look at this file what

768
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:40,650
do they have I have one a whole bunch

769
00:40:40,650 --> 00:40:44,910
now everywhere where you can which

770
00:40:44,910 --> 00:40:50,730
question to see what you type so the

771
00:40:50,730 --> 00:40:52,740
reason that guys tell you that they like

772
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:56,100
burp suite so much is because they can

773
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:59,310
load this list and now when they have a

774
00:40:59,310 --> 00:41:00,960
page when they can see what they tight

775
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:05,430
they'll make it what trial trial iterate

776
00:41:05,430 --> 00:41:07,260
through everyone does that make sense

777
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:10,860
guys that's the major feature that guys

778
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:13,170
might write your bike and trigger that

779
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:15,060
like up here they like being able to

780
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:17,520
take these massive funds database list

781
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:20,070
right now guys processor in a slow

782
00:41:20,070 --> 00:41:22,200
process scripted it'd be like if I wrote

783
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:25,860
a vulnerability of SLO hit 5 of 5 equals

784
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:29,730
12 years 10 and with a below so you go

785
00:41:29,730 --> 00:41:31,230
hey I'm not going to allow you to do

786
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:35,130
that the attacker could do what six plus

787
00:41:35,130 --> 00:41:37,890
one ok what if you will rule for that

788
00:41:37,890 --> 00:41:42,510
what can the attacker you okay 73 11-1

789
00:41:42,510 --> 00:41:46,530
but how long did this go on right now

790
00:41:46,530 --> 00:41:49,950
that's why people like these massive

791
00:41:49,950 --> 00:41:52,440
plus database lists because they're just

792
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:54,870
looking for lots and lots and lots of

793
00:41:54,870 --> 00:41:58,140
different ways to say the same type of

794
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:00,750
attack that make sense hasn't so when I

795
00:42:00,750 --> 00:42:03,390
showed you right i showed you a local

796
00:42:03,390 --> 00:42:08,160
file of food did that okay but you can

797
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:10,170
do that local file include and we'll get

798
00:42:10,170 --> 00:42:11,550
all the different stuff that you can

799
00:42:11,550 --> 00:42:15,540
look for something sense guys so when

800
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:17,850
people are running something like first

801
00:42:17,850 --> 00:42:19,860
week are quite rightly anymore on our

802
00:42:19,860 --> 00:42:22,020
ability scared now that you know these

803
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:24,120
three steps do you understand what the

804
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:27,120
vulnerability scare is doing right so

805
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:28,770
it's just got this huge list of things

806
00:42:28,770 --> 00:42:30,360
it tries and if it gets a certain

807
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:33,540
response back he goes up it's all into

808
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:36,510
that attack that's all it is how many of

809
00:42:36,510 --> 00:42:37,560
you guys thought it would be so much

810
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:40,650
more complex than this right you guys

811
00:42:40,650 --> 00:42:43,620
like about me a lot harder news because

812
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:45,450
like after a couple of years Robert some

813
00:42:45,450 --> 00:42:49,080
rounder for a little bit I was like that

814
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:51,690
inning and guys like kind of expected a

815
00:42:51,690 --> 00:42:55,050
little bit more its head of here right

816
00:42:55,050 --> 00:42:57,330
you've got certain things that you said

817
00:42:57,330 --> 00:42:59,820
I was only three major classes of our

818
00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:01,950
abilities injection Bordelaise do some

819
00:43:01,950 --> 00:43:03,660
trust water abilities filing analytical

820
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:05,790
abilities everything else is like

821
00:43:05,790 --> 00:43:08,280
medication or anization it's all stuff

822
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:09,660
that your scanners are going to pick up

823
00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:13,620
right so I'm in that 8020 rule right how

824
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:15,260
many of you guys are like I just

825
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:18,980
then that picks up a big stuff right and

826
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:20,950
that's what's best but most of our cases

827
00:43:20,950 --> 00:43:23,810
so if you just need stuff that picks up

828
00:43:23,810 --> 00:43:27,470
the big stuff now that you learn my

829
00:43:27,470 --> 00:43:30,680
things what I would say your next step

830
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:32,600
if you guys want to drive all the same

831
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:34,580
commands you can take a picture of this

832
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:36,680
link right that pastebin that I just use

833
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:38,780
is public all these servers that I'm

834
00:43:38,780 --> 00:43:40,460
using or publicly available if you want

835
00:43:40,460 --> 00:43:45,200
to try any of the vulnerabilities should

836
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:55,010
i zoom in some more okay so if you guys

837
00:43:55,010 --> 00:43:56,210
want to try all these vulnerabilities

838
00:43:56,210 --> 00:43:57,830
all those servers are publicly available

839
00:43:57,830 --> 00:43:59,780
i got them out on amazon please be

840
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:01,970
gentle to my servers don't beat them up

841
00:44:01,970 --> 00:44:05,060
too bad okay but seriously you guys got

842
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:07,280
to try this stuff right I'm not a big

843
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:09,320
fan of things like web goat web may

844
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:10,580
event and all that kind of stuff the

845
00:44:10,580 --> 00:44:12,410
problem with those is not that they're

846
00:44:12,410 --> 00:44:15,770
bad they're very good at explaining how

847
00:44:15,770 --> 00:44:18,170
a particular vulnerability works right

848
00:44:18,170 --> 00:44:19,790
you can understand what cross that

849
00:44:19,790 --> 00:44:22,160
request forgery is through like Hackney

850
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:23,810
bank Hackney Bullock's Hackney casino

851
00:44:23,810 --> 00:44:26,300
web maven web goat you can learn that

852
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:28,400
what you don't learn is how to traverse

853
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:31,040
through a website that's what's kind of

854
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:33,500
tough from those kind of tools so what

855
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:34,940
you're going to notice is I built like

856
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:36,710
nine of these different vulnerable apps

857
00:44:36,710 --> 00:44:38,270
and there are all the different

858
00:44:38,270 --> 00:44:40,310
languages so I gotta a sp1 a PHP one a

859
00:44:40,310 --> 00:44:43,310
JSP one Oracle back in mysql right you

860
00:44:43,310 --> 00:44:44,660
got to cruise through the apps and look

861
00:44:44,660 --> 00:44:46,330
for vulnerabilities and the text file

862
00:44:46,330 --> 00:44:48,290
negotiates you through them like it says

863
00:44:48,290 --> 00:44:50,360
here type this here type that here that

864
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:53,120
kind of thing alright so that's

865
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:54,920
completely free you don't need to give

866
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:56,570
your email or anything like that if you

867
00:44:56,570 --> 00:45:00,710
want to do it just drive got it all

868
00:45:00,710 --> 00:45:03,260
right next thing I would say guys get

869
00:45:03,260 --> 00:45:08,420
yourself some Firefox add-ons okay you

870
00:45:08,420 --> 00:45:10,490
should be able to perform a full

871
00:45:10,490 --> 00:45:13,010
penetration test using nothing but

872
00:45:13,010 --> 00:45:16,250
firefox you should be able to perform a

873
00:45:16,250 --> 00:45:18,590
full penetration test using nothing but

874
00:45:18,590 --> 00:45:23,060
what firefox now I don't know this guy

875
00:45:23,060 --> 00:45:25,070
but whoever this guy is that put this

876
00:45:25,070 --> 00:45:25,750
together

877
00:45:25,750 --> 00:45:29,080
this link right here it's 68 different

878
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:31,120
Firefox security add-ons I don't know

879
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:32,800
the guy personally but I think you did a

880
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:35,500
really good job of organizing all those

881
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:37,450
different Firefox add-ons so you can do

882
00:45:37,450 --> 00:45:39,070
web testing because there's way more

883
00:45:39,070 --> 00:45:41,470
than just Firebug you know because

884
00:45:41,470 --> 00:45:43,000
that's what most of us right hack bar

885
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,490
Firebug we're kind of like hey we got a

886
00:45:45,490 --> 00:45:47,740
couple of cool ones but that link down

887
00:45:47,740 --> 00:45:50,320
here this guy did a really good job of

888
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:52,350
like organizing all these different

889
00:45:52,350 --> 00:45:54,580
security add-ons I really strongly

890
00:45:54,580 --> 00:45:56,950
recommend that you you know plus one or

891
00:45:56,950 --> 00:45:58,540
thumbs up the dude or something let him

892
00:45:58,540 --> 00:45:59,680
know he's doing a good job I don't know

893
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:00,850
who he is but I really think you did a

894
00:46:00,850 --> 00:46:06,360
good job on that okay next thing guys is

895
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:08,920
once you're comfortable on the Firefox

896
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:12,040
side then you can step up to a proxy

897
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:14,110
right then you can start messing around

898
00:46:14,110 --> 00:46:16,840
with burp suite zap fiddler you know

899
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:18,820
Charles proxy on the mac side for any of

900
00:46:18,820 --> 00:46:20,920
you guys who drive a Macintosh right

901
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:23,170
that's when you can kind of step into

902
00:46:23,170 --> 00:46:26,620
that I think with some proxies the

903
00:46:26,620 --> 00:46:29,430
learning curve is a little higher right

904
00:46:29,430 --> 00:46:32,650
me personally and I really try to steer

905
00:46:32,650 --> 00:46:35,020
people away from the proxies until

906
00:46:35,020 --> 00:46:36,940
they're comfortable browsing a website

907
00:46:36,940 --> 00:46:38,650
and finding trivial vulnerabilities

908
00:46:38,650 --> 00:46:41,290
after that then you can step into like a

909
00:46:41,290 --> 00:46:43,300
burp suite or something like that I

910
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:45,070
personally think if you have no

911
00:46:45,070 --> 00:46:47,110
background burp is very complicated

912
00:46:47,110 --> 00:46:50,320
right you got to kind of build your way

913
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:53,260
up to that okay all right after that

914
00:46:53,260 --> 00:46:58,000
shameless plug we have to talk about the

915
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:08,440
big boys so commercial tools IBM apps

916
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:11,320
can thirty thousand dollars a year HP

917
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:13,510
web inspect twenty four thousand dollars

918
00:47:13,510 --> 00:47:16,290
a year acunetix is six thousand dollars

919
00:47:16,290 --> 00:47:19,390
ok Nets Parker I should have put that up

920
00:47:19,390 --> 00:47:20,530
here but I was doing my slides this

921
00:47:20,530 --> 00:47:22,720
morning while we were talking Nets

922
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:24,310
Parker I think that's like five thousand

923
00:47:24,310 --> 00:47:26,320
dollars it's another one that's fairly

924
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:29,590
low cost this website sec tool market

925
00:47:29,590 --> 00:47:31,840
now I know it's a long URL but if you

926
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:35,170
just go to sexual market com this guy

927
00:47:35,170 --> 00:47:38,710
does a comparison of like 65 different

928
00:47:38,710 --> 00:47:42,400
vulnerability scanners and he rates what

929
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:45,220
they're good at so he like compares he's

930
00:47:45,220 --> 00:47:46,570
like here's all the different scanner

931
00:47:46,570 --> 00:47:50,620
sec tool market com it redirects to that

932
00:47:50,620 --> 00:47:53,230
long URL and he goes down and compares

933
00:47:53,230 --> 00:47:55,060
each of the different vulnerability

934
00:47:55,060 --> 00:47:57,070
scanners right and he shows you like

935
00:47:57,070 --> 00:47:58,420
what they're good at finding what

936
00:47:58,420 --> 00:47:59,860
they're not good at finding how much

937
00:47:59,860 --> 00:48:02,790
they cost you did a really good job here

938
00:48:02,790 --> 00:48:05,410
okay so if you're looking to move into

939
00:48:05,410 --> 00:48:07,150
that commercial scanner space like

940
00:48:07,150 --> 00:48:08,170
you're at work you have to do

941
00:48:08,170 --> 00:48:09,700
vulnerability scanning for like this my

942
00:48:09,700 --> 00:48:12,070
compliance PCI compliance something like

943
00:48:12,070 --> 00:48:14,500
that you really want to be pretty

944
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:16,330
aggressive on this page trying to learn

945
00:48:16,330 --> 00:48:18,280
what's going on and then quite frankly

946
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:19,870
trying to find a lower-cost alternative

947
00:48:19,870 --> 00:48:24,150
than apps can and HP web inspect all

948
00:48:24,150 --> 00:48:26,590
right and then time for my shameless

949
00:48:26,590 --> 00:48:31,930
plug I wrote a scanner so i need help i

950
00:48:31,930 --> 00:48:34,960
need help i need help i need help okay i

951
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:37,030
spent the last year building a web app

952
00:48:37,030 --> 00:48:38,320
vulnerability scanner and the thought

953
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:40,600
process behind it was I wanted to make

954
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:42,220
something that was kind of like the

955
00:48:42,220 --> 00:48:47,620
nessus model right free the big boys who

956
00:48:47,620 --> 00:48:49,750
like have money they can spend money on

957
00:48:49,750 --> 00:48:51,460
it but most of us are regular working

958
00:48:51,460 --> 00:48:53,920
stiffs how many of you guys regular work

959
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:56,440
and stiff like hey I show up for work

960
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:59,830
and I would do this if I you know could

961
00:48:59,830 --> 00:49:01,930
do something else but I have no other

962
00:49:01,930 --> 00:49:03,520
real qualifications in life like if I

963
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:04,930
wasn't doing security I'd be working at

964
00:49:04,930 --> 00:49:06,040
McDonald's like I don't know how to do

965
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:08,320
anything else like this is it any of you

966
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:10,390
guys in the same boat like this is kind

967
00:49:10,390 --> 00:49:12,280
of it right so if you're a regular

968
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:13,780
working stiff the thought process behind

969
00:49:13,780 --> 00:49:16,240
this was to make a vulnerability scanner

970
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:18,350
made very much just like messes

971
00:49:18,350 --> 00:49:19,550
matter of fact we stole the interface

972
00:49:19,550 --> 00:49:21,620
from Nessus so if anybody from tenable

973
00:49:21,620 --> 00:49:26,000
is here leave the room right now okay so

974
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,440
the thought process behind it guys was

975
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:28,790
to make a scanner with unlimited

976
00:49:28,790 --> 00:49:30,590
scanning right so you download this game

977
00:49:30,590 --> 00:49:31,790
you're gonna be able to scan to your

978
00:49:31,790 --> 00:49:33,680
heart's content I will not charge you

979
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:37,340
for it unlimited scanning for what for

980
00:49:37,340 --> 00:49:40,400
free yes yes yes unlimited scanning for

981
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:44,600
what for free so the whole thought

982
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:48,080
process behind the scanner guys is the

983
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:50,960
reporting engine so you're going to be

984
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:53,900
able to visualize the reports yourself

985
00:49:53,900 --> 00:49:56,750
you know change all the reporting we do

986
00:49:56,750 --> 00:50:02,630
CBE CBS s all that good stuff and let me

987
00:50:02,630 --> 00:50:05,390
jump back here right the other thing on

988
00:50:05,390 --> 00:50:07,490
our new things that we just now added we

989
00:50:07,490 --> 00:50:09,500
add an AWS scamming and sharepoint

990
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:14,450
scanning yeah so I'm really trying to

991
00:50:14,450 --> 00:50:16,730
build this now what I'm what I'm showing

992
00:50:16,730 --> 00:50:19,310
you this for today is I want your help

993
00:50:19,310 --> 00:50:23,930
what I'm looking for is feedback so the

994
00:50:23,930 --> 00:50:25,940
scanners been released now for two weeks

995
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:28,220
right it's been out for two maybe three

996
00:50:28,220 --> 00:50:30,200
weeks now right so scanners been out for

997
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:31,910
about three weeks we got about hundred

998
00:50:31,910 --> 00:50:33,800
and eighty users right now so people

999
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:35,570
downloaded people are using it right now

1000
00:50:35,570 --> 00:50:37,730
you can only download the scanner as a

1001
00:50:37,730 --> 00:50:39,590
virtual machine it's a vm virtual

1002
00:50:39,590 --> 00:50:42,290
appliance a couple of things I'm looking

1003
00:50:42,290 --> 00:50:44,270
to learn from you guys maybe you can

1004
00:50:44,270 --> 00:50:49,730
help me okay me and my team we thought

1005
00:50:49,730 --> 00:50:51,320
the best deployment model would be a

1006
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:53,600
virtual appliance most people they want

1007
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:55,250
to be able to download a virtual machine

1008
00:50:55,250 --> 00:50:58,010
and just run with that right now it

1009
00:50:58,010 --> 00:50:59,690
downloads is just a VMware virtual

1010
00:50:59,690 --> 00:51:01,040
machine we're pushing it through

1011
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:03,230
something called packer and with that

1012
00:51:03,230 --> 00:51:04,760
we'll be able to make it so that it runs

1013
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:07,490
in digital ocean runs in amazon runs on

1014
00:51:07,490 --> 00:51:09,800
OpenStack all those kind of things so a

1015
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:11,150
virtual appliance thing that's what

1016
00:51:11,150 --> 00:51:12,950
we've been working on how many of you

1017
00:51:12,950 --> 00:51:14,840
guys think it would be a big deal to

1018
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:18,140
have it have like a regular install like

1019
00:51:18,140 --> 00:51:20,900
desktop install all that kind of stuff

1020
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:22,400

1036
00:52:27,980 --> 00:52:30,470

1037
00:52:30,470 --> 00:52:34,070
in my life so I spent my last year you

1038
00:52:34,070 --> 00:52:35,930
know being like head down writing code

1039
00:52:35,930 --> 00:52:41,329
so i met a lot of drinking yes we are

1040
00:52:41,329 --> 00:52:43,250
docker should be inside of the next 90

1041
00:52:43,250 --> 00:52:49,369

00:53:27,660 --> 00:53:31,089
yeah yeah actually um second tool we

1046
00:53:31,089 --> 00:53:32,470
actually wrote a source code scanner

1047
00:53:32,470 --> 00:53:33,700
since we're doing so many source code

1048
00:53:33,700 --> 00:53:36,220
scans on our own product um go ahead but

1049
00:53:36,220 --> 00:53:43,359
i don't know if i will call us ready for

1050
00:53:43,359 --> 00:53:46,960
anything serious guys um I just look you

1051
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:48,700
guys you you know for any woman I'm

1052
00:53:48,700 --> 00:53:50,109
really gonna be offended when I say this

1053
00:53:50,109 --> 00:53:51,339
you're not a woman I got no reason to

1054
00:53:51,339 --> 00:53:53,680
lie to you we're just not ready for that

1055
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:57,010
my buddy in the you know halfway back

1056
00:53:57,010 --> 00:53:59,589
matt is here and Matt's been helping me

1057
00:53:59,589 --> 00:54:01,869
deal with this and you know how do I

1058
00:54:01,869 --> 00:54:03,700
talk to you about it do I BS or do I lie

1059
00:54:03,700 --> 00:54:07,000
about any of it right we're look I'm one

1060
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,130
of you guys right I'm not trying to make

1061
00:54:09,130 --> 00:54:10,960
a bajillion dollars on the doggone thing

1062
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:13,119
I'm just trying to push something out

1063
00:54:13,119 --> 00:54:15,640
that hopefully working stiffs can use so

1064
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:19,210
what I want to scan a complex app with

1065
00:54:19,210 --> 00:54:23,079
this not just know yeah we're not there

1066
00:54:23,079 --> 00:54:25,240
yet we're just not there yet and I just

1067
00:54:25,240 --> 00:54:27,400
don't want to lie to you guys look I

1068
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:29,470
made this because it's something that I

1069
00:54:29,470 --> 00:54:31,839
needed from my job right and then I

1070
00:54:31,839 --> 00:54:33,549
thought like okay well how do I make it

1071
00:54:33,549 --> 00:54:36,549
so that it's not twenty thousand dollars

1072
00:54:36,549 --> 00:54:39,940
a year you know what I mean but it's not

1073
00:54:39,940 --> 00:54:41,799
burp suite and the reason I say that is

1074
00:54:41,799 --> 00:54:44,020
I think Burke suite is a little too

1075
00:54:44,020 --> 00:54:46,750
complicated for a normal working guy who

1076
00:54:46,750 --> 00:54:49,900
needs to scan a lot of sites right

1077
00:54:49,900 --> 00:54:52,059
you're at work you gotta scan 30 40

1078
00:54:52,059 --> 00:54:53,770
servers I don't think you're firing up

1079
00:54:53,770 --> 00:54:55,839
herb sweet manually iterating through

1080
00:54:55,839 --> 00:54:57,700
those things most people want some sort

1081
00:54:57,700 --> 00:54:59,799
of point and click scanner that they can

1082
00:54:59,799 --> 00:55:01,030
just point out something that's what I

1083
00:55:01,030 --> 00:55:03,579
decided to try to build so I want your

1084
00:55:03,579 --> 00:55:06,330
help that's the short version so

1085
00:55:06,330 --> 00:55:07,920
I figured what i would do is i will come

1086
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:09,570
here do a little thing try to give you

1087
00:55:09,570 --> 00:55:11,160
guys some things that hopefully help you

1088
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:12,870
then hopefully you could give me some

1089
00:55:12,870 --> 00:55:15,900
feedback that helps me so definitely

1090
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:19,050
take home number one desktop install i

1091
00:55:19,050 --> 00:55:21,030
had no idea it was that big of a deal

1092
00:55:21,030 --> 00:55:23,190
right most of my customers big

1093
00:55:23,190 --> 00:55:25,470
virtualization environment so that's

1094
00:55:25,470 --> 00:55:26,970
what i thought i had no idea was that

1095
00:55:26,970 --> 00:55:28,410
big of a deal so i'll take that home

1096
00:55:28,410 --> 00:55:30,450
what else are things that you guys would

1097
00:55:30,450 --> 00:55:32,310
want to see like right now we just got

1098
00:55:32,310 --> 00:55:36,049
sharepoint what else would you like ooh

1099
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:42,330
documentation us nerds are always good

1100
00:55:42,330 --> 00:55:45,300
in that i'm not hating on you i'm

1101
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:49,860
drinking that kool-aid i'm drinking that

1102
00:55:49,860 --> 00:55:51,540
kool-aid i'm drinking that kool-aid okay

1103
00:55:51,540 --> 00:55:55,740
all right so good docs good videos to

1104
00:55:55,740 --> 00:55:57,720
walk you through how to use it and what

1105
00:55:57,720 --> 00:55:59,899
else

1106
00:56:08,700 --> 00:56:11,530
we scammed for CIS benchmarks right now

1107
00:56:11,530 --> 00:56:13,690
right we scan for CIS benchmarks right

1108
00:56:13,690 --> 00:56:15,490
now that's why we're able to do like the

1109
00:56:15,490 --> 00:56:17,530
AWS scanning the sharepoint scan and the

1110
00:56:17,530 --> 00:56:20,290
web services scanning so right now we

1111
00:56:20,290 --> 00:56:23,430
scan for that we don't adhere to it

1112
00:56:23,430 --> 00:56:26,530
right so again I don't want to turn

1113
00:56:26,530 --> 00:56:28,480
around and give me in a way I'm lying we

1114
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:30,369
built the virtual machine we tried to

1115
00:56:30,369 --> 00:56:32,349
harden it we don't allow it to point to

1116
00:56:32,349 --> 00:56:34,480
anything but our repository so the vm

1117
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:36,790
doesn't update anywhere else you know

1118
00:56:36,790 --> 00:56:38,589
that way we can keep the but we did that

1119
00:56:38,589 --> 00:56:40,720
trying to keep the platform as stable as

1120
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:45,460
possible so my thing is how do I keep

1121
00:56:45,460 --> 00:56:48,790
this where it's beneficial to you guys

1122
00:56:48,790 --> 00:56:52,000
so what things are you looking to scan

1123
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,520
like right now I got SharePoint I got

1124
00:56:54,520 --> 00:56:59,970
amazon AWS so we scan AWS s3 I am ec2

1125
00:56:59,970 --> 00:57:03,940
RDS what else are you guys testing

1126
00:57:03,940 --> 00:57:05,230
that's out there that would be big for

1127
00:57:05,230 --> 00:57:16,119
you yeah no I don't do that at all yeah

1128
00:57:16,119 --> 00:57:18,099
how do you like to keep throwing stuff

1129
00:57:18,099 --> 00:57:22,030
at me uh-huh um what me and Matt we're

1130
00:57:22,030 --> 00:57:23,740
talking about i was on a pen test with a

1131
00:57:23,740 --> 00:57:26,799

1143
00:57:57,849 --> 00:57:59,980

00:58:53,289 --> 00:58:55,089
like that does it need to integrate into

1162
00:58:55,089 --> 00:58:56,740
your asset management system if you're

1163

1173
00:59:57,360 --> 00:59:59,060
have scheduled job schedule scanning

1174
00:59:59,060 --> 01:00:06,510
schedules Canada the plan is to charge

1175
01:00:06,510 --> 01:00:09,750
for custom reporting so if you want to

1176
01:00:09,750 --> 01:00:12,210
build really complex reports the plan

1177
01:00:12,210 --> 01:00:13,980
will be to charge one thousand dollars a

1178
01:00:13,980 --> 01:00:16,950
year for that again the thought process

1179

1212

like this was not easy so you know now

1213

1228
01:02:25,780 --> 01:02:33,520
should put it up there huh yeah yeah but

1229
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:35,890
right now we have PCI reports we're

1230
01:02:35,890 --> 01:02:39,370
working on GLBA HIPAA FISMA all that

1231
01:02:39,370 --> 01:02:40,630
kind of stuff will probably be before

1232
01:02:40,630 --> 01:02:42,970
the year is over or early next year

1233
01:02:42,970 --> 01:02:44,650
we'll be getting compliance reports and

1234
01:02:44,650 --> 01:02:46,420
stuff like that out that stuff is all

1235
01:02:46,420 --> 01:02:48,640
going to be free so the idea is to keep

1236
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:50,530
all of this stuff free if you're going

1237
01:02:50,530 --> 01:02:52,330
to do enterprise integration stuff

1238
01:02:52,330 --> 01:02:54,400
that's what I want to charge for but for

1239
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:57,580
regular working stiffs drive it go ahead

1240
01:02:57,580 --> 01:03:04,440
but is it open source nope no yeah oh

1241
01:03:04,440 --> 01:03:07,120
you want me to open source it what if I

1242
01:03:07,120 --> 01:03:10,840
open if I hope if i open the api's and

1243
01:03:10,840 --> 01:03:12,520
let you guys right because somebody

1244
01:03:12,520 --> 01:03:13,300
asked me the other day about

1245
01:03:13,300 --> 01:03:15,760
extensibility like if i open if i give

1246
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:17,470
you guys api access to it so you can

1247
01:03:17,470 --> 01:03:19,930
write stuff to it I'd be okay with that

1248
01:03:19,930 --> 01:03:23,520
I'd be okay with that

1249
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:34,810
so I've had some customers ask me about

1250
01:03:34,810 --> 01:03:37,060
CI people want to like hook up with

1251
01:03:37,060 --> 01:03:38,530
Jenkins and JIRA do continuous

1252
01:03:38,530 --> 01:03:41,140
integration kind of stuff and then build

1253
01:03:41,140 --> 01:03:42,700
it into their process is that a big deal

1254
