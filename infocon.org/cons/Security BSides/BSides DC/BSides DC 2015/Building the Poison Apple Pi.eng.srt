1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
so good morning everyone and thank you

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,670
for coming and the first talks on Sunday

3
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:07,980
are not usually well attended so thank

4
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:10,889
you everyone who did come my name is

5
00:00:10,889 --> 00:00:13,650
Andrew shumate giving a talk building

6
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:15,650
the poison apple pie it's a basically

7
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:20,029
remote wireless our pen testing platform

8
00:00:20,029 --> 00:00:22,500
nothing really spectacular but I just

9
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,330
you know I like getting ideas from

10
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:26,340
conferences and then feeding those ideas

11
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:29,789
that I get back help the kind of enforce

12
00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:33,960
the feedback loop about me I was in the

13
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,329
Navy for 20 years I spent 15 years doing

14
00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:39,300
aviation electronics five years doing

15
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:42,390
computer network defense is a CTN and

16
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:45,510
then I retired I now work is a SMS

17
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:47,719
consultant for pivot point security

18
00:00:47,719 --> 00:00:51,690
small firm in New Jersey geek pirate

19
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:57,170
lover of puzzles and technology so

20
00:00:57,170 --> 00:01:00,329
there's a song there will be a lot of

21
00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:01,949
disney references in here because i'm a

22
00:01:01,949 --> 00:01:03,030
big fan of Disney and Disney

23
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:06,150
Imagineering they're really great at

24
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:08,960
taking ideas and turning them into these

25
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,850
huge things that we see and it all

26
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:14,400
starts with one little spark and if you

27
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,659
want it who knows what an earworm is

28
00:01:17,659 --> 00:01:20,549
it's a song that gets stuck in your head

29
00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:24,509
yeah go google figment one little spark

30
00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:27,180
little song with Eric Idle listen to it

31
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:29,390
it'll be stuck in your head for a while

32
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:33,030
so a lot of ideas start with that one

33
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:35,130
spark of imagination or an idea that you

34
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:39,060
hear mine started last year at bsides DC

35
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:41,970
and a little bit before that I've always

36
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:44,460
been a fan of covert testing boxes

37
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:47,939
things like that like the spark cast the

38
00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:49,350
small covert things you can leave on a

39
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:52,280
network very cheap somewhat disposable

40
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:55,500
last year i'm here at bsides DC and gift

41
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,210
or a gave the talk about the range box

42
00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:00,149
and running hostapd on a raspberry pi as

43
00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:02,009
a way to test you know breaking web and

44
00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:05,369
things like that yes okay cool you know

45
00:02:05,369 --> 00:02:07,320
what else can you do connect to the

46
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:11,520
Raspberry Pi remotely then Pony Express

47
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,480
produced

48
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,360
video Jason E Street evil briefcase vs

49
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,150
boston anybody's seen that Jason streets

50
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:19,590
walking around Boston this briefcase

51
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:22,409
full of raspberry PI's and a proxmark

52
00:02:22,409 --> 00:02:25,080
doing his stuff and at the end of the

53
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,390
video it shows he's you know attacking a

54
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:29,879
wireless network and party express his

55
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:32,879
product detects the attack goons come

56
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,950
out to the lobby and raining a man

57
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:36,599
because his heads down in a briefcase

58
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:43,700
attached to his testing devices then

59
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:47,340
about the same day that Jason I see the

60
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:50,220
Jason Street video Yuri over at red

61
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:52,099
team's blog post he was looking for a

62
00:02:52,099 --> 00:02:55,019
small backpack for covert testing and

63
00:02:55,019 --> 00:02:57,329
that kind of sealed the deal for me I

64
00:02:57,329 --> 00:02:59,760
was like you know what can I do with a

65
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,160
small covert remotely accessible

66
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:06,420
platform so about half an hour after he

67
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:10,440
tweeted this I ran around my office

68
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,390
grabbed a bunch of stuff and tweeted

69
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:18,930
that so that's that's probably a lot

70
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:20,760
more than i usually use it's raspberry

71
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:28,010
pi b 2 tp-link card rtls dr dongle and

72
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:31,590
newer tooth and it's all powered by a

73
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:35,280
honker 64,000 amp hour battery pack

74
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,859
which gives it about a day and a half

75
00:03:37,859 --> 00:03:46,349
runtime so I'm going to tempt fate with

76
00:03:46,349 --> 00:03:49,700
demo God's early

77
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:56,750
so I have the device up and running in

78
00:03:56,750 --> 00:04:02,090
here and you give it an oculus name in

79
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:04,340
my case HP jetdirect I'm going to have

80
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:06,370
to

81
00:04:12,069 --> 00:04:15,089
yes and

82
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:33,570
and we'll see the demo gods are happy I

83
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:37,470
probably will not because it's not okay

84
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:57,120
so happy which three small be honest

85
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:02,850
there we go it's happier now

86
00:05:13,679 --> 00:05:17,110
so that is the the biggest limitation is

87
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:20,139
the EDI max wireless dongle which is

88
00:05:20,139 --> 00:05:22,809
this little tiny thing here don't have a

89
00:05:22,809 --> 00:05:24,369
lot of power so if you wanted longer

90
00:05:24,369 --> 00:05:27,309
range you'd want to use the tp-link high

91
00:05:27,309 --> 00:05:29,579
power

92
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:47,690
make sure that okay and so yeah so it's

93
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:49,490
going to fail until it action negotiates

94
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:55,370
so essentially decided to take all this

95
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:58,430
put it together into wireless test

96
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:01,570
testing platform

97
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:10,669
so while the demo gods are angry at me

98
00:06:10,669 --> 00:06:12,620
will come back and I had a few build

99
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:14,060
requirements on this I wanted something

100
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:16,460
portable something that literally I can

101
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:18,500
fit this in my back pocket small

102
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:21,770
backpack non-detectable I wanted it to

103
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:24,169
be remote I don't want to be attached to

104
00:06:24,169 --> 00:06:26,780
it because a use case I'll get into in a

105
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:28,729
minute I wanted it to be non

106
00:06:28,729 --> 00:06:31,490
attributable I don't want you know fancy

107
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:33,949
hardware that people know like a poem

108
00:06:33,949 --> 00:06:36,289
plug or a Pony Express that people know

109
00:06:36,289 --> 00:06:40,490
or pin testing tool I want audit be able

110
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:43,729
to be broken down I want it modular so

111
00:06:43,729 --> 00:06:45,680
using the Raspberry Pi you've got four

112
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,509
USB ports so you can add anything you

113
00:06:47,509 --> 00:06:51,320
want to it and I wanted to be cheap if

114
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,240
you are in the business of pen testing

115
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,520
margins are an important thing and just

116
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,470
because you charge a lot of your clients

117
00:06:57,470 --> 00:06:59,000
for services doesn't mean you need to

118
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,509
pay a lot for the tools that you use so

119
00:07:02,509 --> 00:07:05,030
you know let's look at some different

120
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:07,910
tools that are available calli nut honor

121
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:11,419
is portable it runs on a nexus but you

122
00:07:11,419 --> 00:07:14,389
have to buy the hardware and unless

123
00:07:14,389 --> 00:07:16,880
you're using the cellular connection you

124
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,770
have to be attached to the device again

125
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:21,860
that's what not what I wanted poem plug

126
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:25,520
easy to use it's expensive and it's not

127
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,260
portable it's got to be on mains power

128
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:30,620
to work and then the Raspberry Pi it's

129
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:33,710
cheap portable your detached from it but

130
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:35,810
takes time and effort to put it together

131
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:37,580
in building which I'll talk about that

132
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:43,789
in a minute so again talking about what

133
00:07:43,789 --> 00:07:46,009
are you use cases aside from your

134
00:07:46,009 --> 00:07:47,539
standard attacking the wireless network

135
00:07:47,539 --> 00:07:50,750
sniffing wireless networks things like

136
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:53,180
that one of the use cases that I looked

137
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:55,449
at was gauging in sin a response if

138
00:07:55,449 --> 00:07:57,830
you're attacking a company's wireless

139
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:59,900
networks and they say they have wireless

140
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:01,699
instant response how do you gauge that

141
00:08:01,699 --> 00:08:05,870
and again you I all go to the trope from

142
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:08,000
movie has anybody seen the real McCoy

143
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,509
with Kim Basinger the real McCoy with

144
00:08:11,509 --> 00:08:13,940
Kim Basinger it's it's a heist film and

145
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:16,820
one of the tropes and it is they need to

146
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:18,529
measure the response time of the police

147
00:08:18,529 --> 00:08:19,909
showing up at the bank they're getting

148
00:08:19,909 --> 00:08:20,350
ready to

149
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:23,380
so they put a remote control car on the

150
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:25,210
bottom of an ashtray drive it around the

151
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:27,850
lobby set off the alarm time how long

152
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:30,430
the police take so similar thing with

153
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:32,169
this you put this in the lobby of a

154
00:08:32,169 --> 00:08:34,780
building somewhere you fire it up you

155
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:36,190
wait see how long it takes for the

156
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:38,559
security goons come out and again if

157
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,090
it's cheap you get an overzealous

158
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:42,789
security guru that smashes it you're out

159
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:46,810
thirty forty dollars another use case

160
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:48,190
that I thought about today while

161
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:51,130
watching people do the wireless CTF from

162
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:55,750
the fox hunt so hack RF costs what 300

163
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:58,960
plus dollars and here it's one device

164
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,120
you're running around trying to measure

165
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,900
signal strength what if you took a half

166
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:07,780
dozen of these put them around in your

167
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:10,270
area with the twenty-dollar rtls dr

168
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:12,880
dongles and then had them all report

169
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,430
back to you on signal strength readings

170
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:16,930
there's already open source software out

171
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:18,730
there that will take all that correlate

172
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:20,290
and help you do the triangulation to

173
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:23,800
locate what you're looking for so that's

174
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,210
another use case that came up with

175
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:27,700
justin is con looking at how people are

176
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:33,810
trying to execute the wireless ETF so

177
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:36,160
looking into the future of other things

178
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:39,280
to do it attach the DIY MC catcher on it

179
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:43,180
using the open bc firmware modified

180
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:46,210
motorola devices adding cellular

181
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:47,920
connectivity so i can leave it in place

182
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,380
longer connect to it remotely so i can

183
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:52,660
do this from my house and then using a

184
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:54,720
microcontroller for sweet blake times

185
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,140
the microcontroller does have the

186
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:00,790
downside of if you want a luxe encrypted

187
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:02,890
partition on your device protect

188
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:04,900
information you can't do that unless

189
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:07,240
you're doing auto login which is not

190
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,850
really a good idea because vice level

191
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:11,740
wakes up you need to have be able to put

192
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:14,260
in the credentials so the sleep/wake is

193
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:18,220
slightly problematic but depends on what

194
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:22,480
data you're storing on the device so

195
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,380
let's try the demo again

196
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:14,120
no HP jetdirect again as you know gave

197
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:16,220
it something innocuous that you're

198
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:18,380
likely to see in any business or

199
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:28,810
corporate environment so apparently my

200
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:31,730
my sacrifice to the demo gods is not

201
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:37,550
sufficient so who I should recorded that

202
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:40,250
last night so I'm sorry I don't have the

203
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:42,770
the demo is basically simply connecting

204
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:44,570
to it I had hoped to have it in the

205
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:46,459
flower pot over there fire up a few

206
00:11:46,459 --> 00:11:52,399
scans so so that's that's my simple

207
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:54,890
feedback loop for ideas that i get from

208
00:11:54,890 --> 00:11:56,720
coming to the conferences and trying to

209
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,080
feed ideas back into the community you

210
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:03,529
know the people up here that thank our

211
00:12:03,529 --> 00:12:08,260
red jeans blog guitar dave Conroy who

212
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:11,900
created the module for EDI max cali

213
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:15,560
won't natively run hostapd using an EDI

214
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:19,459
max card so Dave Connolly put together a

215
00:12:19,459 --> 00:12:22,220
nice how to and a driver that will work

216
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:25,040
and then of course Jason Street already

217
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,709
expressed for kind of inspiration of how

218
00:12:27,709 --> 00:12:30,860
to do this put it together so actually

219
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:32,839
building the box is fairly simple

220
00:12:32,839 --> 00:12:36,560
raspberry pi 2 point 0 grab cali image

221
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:40,160
put it on the SD card go get Dave

222
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,160
Conroy's EDI max hostapd driver and put

223
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:46,820
it on from there connect and you know

224
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:49,610
use it as you will like I said if you're

225
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:52,430
into the wireless CTF Fox hunts it's a

226
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:54,770
great thing you get a half dozen of

227
00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:57,589
these and put the twenty-dollar dongles

228
00:12:57,589 --> 00:13:00,170
on it and start having them all report

229
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:02,329
back as a wireless mesh to measure a

230
00:13:02,329 --> 00:13:04,459
signal strength that'll help you speed

231
00:13:04,459 --> 00:13:08,240
up your your Fox hunts again having a

232
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,240
way to wirelessly attack network if

233
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:13,790
security dude goons do come out you're

234
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:15,740
sitting 20 feet away from it completely

235
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:18,920
detached not attributable they run off

236
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:22,069
with a device and you walk away so

237
00:13:22,069 --> 00:13:24,569
so thank you for coming to my short talk

238
00:13:24,569 --> 00:13:26,550
you all get an early lunch because the

239
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:28,829
demo gods are not pleased and I will

240
00:13:28,829 --> 00:13:38,430
take any questions so yeah I did the

241
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:40,440
range box works really well and again I

242
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:43,110
had to modify XA at the time I had an A

243
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:45,690
and an ED imax and it can do the the

244
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:48,690
five-minute it takes a little bit of

245
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:51,180
practice but it works after a little

246
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:56,870
while any others

247
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:02,020
all right thank you
