so my name is Tom make up my partner

4
00:00:29,949 --> 00:00:31,570
Chris Rogers you were here day talking

5
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:34,059
about stop breathing I'll announce

6
00:00:34,059 --> 00:00:38,850
technique we're going to start with a

7
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:42,249
green card with a product demo so please

8
00:00:42,249 --> 00:00:44,739
go ahead lot worse time I be comical the

9
00:00:44,739 --> 00:00:48,069
next two hours I'm going to take you

10
00:00:48,069 --> 00:00:50,409
through great detail browsing the

11
00:00:50,409 --> 00:00:56,289
current apt landscape diagram kill chain

12
00:00:56,289 --> 00:00:57,729
optimization of your current

13
00:00:57,729 --> 00:00:59,889
infrastructure for synergy and most

14
00:00:59,889 --> 00:01:02,999
important pricing and availability I

15
00:01:02,999 --> 00:01:05,468
took it I don't know you want to

16
00:01:05,468 --> 00:01:09,490
acknowledge that so again playing time I

17
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:12,369
talk I've been involved

18
00:01:12,369 --> 00:01:15,859
various out there currently I work for

19
00:01:15,859 --> 00:01:18,409
the Dallas Times appearing on our prep

20
00:01:18,409 --> 00:01:21,340
research team i work in Citizen Kane and

21
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:25,280
Chris often have a very background well

22
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,189
yeah mostly government contacts now I

23
00:01:28,189 --> 00:01:29,810
didn't work without the bank American

24
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:33,350
purple Goodfellas senior allies for

25
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:38,149
research now or so use the mic say guess

26
00:01:38,149 --> 00:01:43,969
our mellor okay bye forget it out of the

27
00:01:43,969 --> 00:01:47,619
river up or kind of work one microsoft

28
00:01:47,619 --> 00:01:49,880
you can actually pick up and hold the

29
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:55,520
mic it's okay alright so this actually

30
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:59,569
started sherlock holmes pan and stir

31
00:01:59,569 --> 00:02:01,220
Arthur Conan Doyle through Sherlock

32
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:04,579
Holmes broaching the sign for about the

33
00:02:04,579 --> 00:02:07,340
doctor bruising and so he said that you

34
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:09,530
know if you see a thousand you know

35
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:12,920
crime scenes and pieces of it you know

36
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:15,079
what's going on the following first

37
00:02:15,079 --> 00:02:17,569
shouldn't be a surprise we can actually

38
00:02:17,569 --> 00:02:20,299
apply the exact same logic to mallar

39
00:02:20,299 --> 00:02:22,519
analysis and if you've seen you know

40
00:02:22,519 --> 00:02:24,799
thousands of malicious files and the

41
00:02:24,799 --> 00:02:27,340
behavior know the symptoms you can

42
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:30,170
relatively easily pick it up and find

43
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:31,940
Amell or without actually going into and

44
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:34,299
every time

45
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:40,990
so just a little bit of a disclaimer

46
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:44,260
here for for this talk I don't really

47
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:45,670
have a feel a lot of people to various

48
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:48,280
go up and background this is really

49
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:52,900
heavy media introductory type or talk a

50
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:54,850
lot of things i'm going to show you when

51
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:58,090
necessary to prefer anything sound these

52
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:03,190
are things that you have a look at it

53
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:06,700
yeah here's something I figure out I

54
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,650
don't need the feedback very well got

55
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:11,739
better so basically if you've got a

56
00:03:11,739 --> 00:03:14,080
system on a file on and computer the

57
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,519
looks a little bit suspicious we're

58
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:16,269
going to give you some tools

59
00:03:16,269 --> 00:03:18,940
capabilities of how to take a look at it

60
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:20,560
and kind of critically analyze it and

61
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,800
eternal mother not texting malicious so

62
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,140
this is to basically we know this it's a

63
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:29,769
very deep topic and we know that a lot

64
00:03:29,769 --> 00:03:31,630
of techniques many days for some of yer

65
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:36,790
so keep that in mind we go along yeah

66
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:38,950
you're not in ir that you're probably

67
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:41,709
doing it for your family oh so what is

68
00:03:41,709 --> 00:03:45,190
network it's really just writing a logic

69
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:51,630
you know what is it it's not magic it's

70
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:55,180
simply a series of instructions with

71
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:57,910
computers like the basic level are just

72
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:59,410
tools that just translate by our

73
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:02,560
instructions dimock at pictures or you

74
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,850
know lover dead and you know better guy

75
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:09,310
shade marketers because of user friendly

76
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:11,470
nature they take a full advantage of it

77
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:14,079
and get there get there little flexion

78
00:04:14,079 --> 00:04:14,760
if it's

79
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:21,029
system so talk about backers email web

80
00:04:21,029 --> 00:04:24,000
you know you see them knew Stephen

81
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,389
everywhere you know it's common it's

82
00:04:27,389 --> 00:04:29,760
something that everyone knows it ha stop

83
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,380
it say it's in through the wire comes in

84
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:33,960
through the internet so how was it still

85
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,840
a bit I mean it's been 20 plus years and

86
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:39,479
the same same methodology still getting

87
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:41,639
it well a lot of it has to do with

88
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:44,850
user-friendly itís the user experience

89
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:47,039
is paramount in especially the corporate

90
00:04:47,039 --> 00:04:49,289
setting you have to you know go to the

91
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:52,139
user go and give them whatever they want

92
00:04:52,139 --> 00:04:53,940
there's a lot of latency stuff backwards

93
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:59,250
compatibility and really it's it's kind

94
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:01,440
of purply so I mean we're in 64-bit

95
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,210
architecture and we're still getting 32

96
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:05,220
good now we're pulling employment

97
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:08,460
systems everybody has experienced I'm

98
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:09,870
sure you know you go to network and

99
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:12,539
you're the server they're running ng for

100
00:05:12,539 --> 00:05:14,940
you know that's that's what I only don't

101
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,620
have with the server you know every

102
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:18,270
server happen basically it's running

103
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:21,720
from lengthy application it works don't

104
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,610
mess with it leave in place but that

105
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:25,169
oftentimes it took one of the biggest

106
00:05:25,169 --> 00:05:27,449
vulnerability that you have network it's

107
00:05:27,449 --> 00:05:31,800
old patch just don't ever leave along so

108
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,449
those are all things that work against

109
00:05:33,449 --> 00:05:36,090
us we're looking at a networking the

110
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:39,449
security posture yeah the end result is

111
00:05:39,449 --> 00:05:42,750
always the same tacker gets in system is

112
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:45,280
owned and they get whatever they want

113
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,820
there's information or money or just

114
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:51,940
control so we're going to fight your

115
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:53,530
account and break down a little bit of

116
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:55,480
the process and stuff you can do an

117
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:58,780
essay response I'm gonna take it with a

118
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:00,760
little bit of what you might seem to be

119
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:03,700
game your so called instant response

120
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:06,940
type of situation basically if it looks

121
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:09,160
like how it smells like now probably

122
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,950
mount rack system okay probably wasn't

123
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:14,919
that catch that funny cat screensaver

124
00:06:14,919 --> 00:06:19,120
that you thought your download so what

125
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,830
important things that I'm going to talk

126
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:23,950
about our map times those of you not

127
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:25,990
familiar with that time back and for

128
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:28,300
modified access control and look at the

129
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:29,320
time stamps that are on a different

130
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:32,650
files and doesn't one of the things that

131
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:34,810
Allah will try to play with your kind of

132
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:38,770
time and you'll see the different ways

133
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:40,120
but basically I'm getting a couple

134
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:43,180
things you can take a look out to some

135
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:46,180
to do to look after your particular file

136
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:50,860
to my hat on compute so what is it one

137
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:54,220
more problem operating system maybe you

138
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:56,979
encounter any of them probably one more

139
00:06:56,979 --> 00:06:59,200
common process is about their the

140
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:02,890
waiting list there the final structure

141
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:05,740
between the map quality and if you have

142
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:09,750
never woken to back to top and

143
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:11,740
essentially what we're looking for in

144
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:14,650
here there's tea sets of timestamps the

145
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:17,710
standard information than the finally

146
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:20,800
that's embedded within the master

147
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:25,810
positive now when we talk about those

148
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:28,060
two different time scales the one that

149
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:31,240
you interact with this user is the

150
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:35,200
standard remain tight mp4 file property

151
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:38,080
for this be here and what we have yes I

152
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,960
Jon and in this case here we've got

153
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:45,520
created a modified number 2005 when you

154
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,390
see that cloud access in November 2014

155
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:51,310
now those bottoms I already will be

156
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:54,460
allowed just put was like on a service

157
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:58,710
so he was either this is going to see

158
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,210
now the one that I did a little bit

159
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:03,490
deeper tomorrow we want to look a little

160
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:07,600
bit deeper thank you anything but one

161
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,460
game with it further detail out there

162
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:11,880
all this going on we can actually use

163
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:15,280
control to comment available as I go

164
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,900
through some of the slides and his Chris

165
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:18,730
goes through a number of length of the

166
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:21,040
back of the slide deck will happen so

167
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:24,040
much slideshow thing wrong number links

168
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,410
just teaching reference files or

169
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:28,440
programs

170
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:32,020
first let's draw a clock out of deputy

171
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:34,630
manager uses a lot of instant response

172
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:36,729
which is the nice eh tool to having a

173
00:08:36,729 --> 00:08:39,700
controlled up the case opportunities

174
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,830
program basic usage we're just going to

175
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:44,350
grab and have to file table take a look

176
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:48,040
at these have to go through your whole

177
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:53,500
system and create a rank amateurs the

178
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:57,720
cable is an export house key gamma team

179
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:04,480
right and what would actually heck

180
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,860
supported that out there is a really

181
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:07,420
nice and I'm cool that I've used in the

182
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:10,300
past called MFG dome and what this does

183
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,430
it take the contents of America quality

184
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:15,070
and dumps it out to you cscs when you

185
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:18,790
take a closer look and in this cave and

186
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:20,920
I spoke about the standard formation of

187
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,440
the bombing times before we can see that

188
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:27,520
they don't match up so is great for went

189
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:30,370
on really quickly we keep hundred times

190
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:32,110
of my job makes yourself a filter it

191
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:35,950
shows where SI or the attend involved on

192
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:38,529
match and that deference that should

193
00:09:38,529 --> 00:09:40,510
raise a red flag which is followed by

194
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:42,760
peppered with whom I take a closer look

195
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:45,610
at this some one thing that first point

196
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:50,100
talk about will help

197
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:56,249
one of the other places we can book are

198
00:09:56,249 --> 00:10:00,220
on the ankle classes himself the storms

199
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:03,160
are poking around you know you'd be

200
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,839
pretty simple most of you know where

201
00:10:04,839 --> 00:10:08,559
offers to it so we put a file and

202
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:10,959
location and we can go through and

203
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:17,740
finding that works as the complexities

204
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:20,350
increased a lot more location victim

205
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:23,079
operating system version windows are

206
00:10:23,079 --> 00:10:25,300
coming into play and so there could be

207
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:27,610
potentially stuff a different directory

208
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:30,069
word for I have against Winky and it's

209
00:10:30,069 --> 00:10:31,389
like that here in the reference section

210
00:10:31,389 --> 00:10:35,230
they can go through and look out to the

211
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:37,329
twentieth place the local sufficient

212
00:10:37,329 --> 00:10:39,430
five but essentially we're really

213
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:42,939
looking for think that's just both long

214
00:10:42,939 --> 00:10:44,850
and one of these things is not like you

215
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:47,740
all right in this case here we're

216
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:50,589
looking at windows system32 whose duty I

217
00:10:50,589 --> 00:10:54,360
are equally oir people about exe file

218
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:57,189
please stick out like a sore thumb not

219
00:10:57,189 --> 00:10:59,319
only did you get money from you know

220
00:10:59,319 --> 00:11:02,499
certain cases ontology hypocrisy Chinese

221
00:11:02,499 --> 00:11:06,490
characters and rural character a 15 to

222
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:10,439
30 blanket stitch with in that direction

223
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:13,509
here to get our edge of the list i put

224
00:11:13,509 --> 00:11:15,459
together three guys with his life just

225
00:11:15,459 --> 00:11:18,070
some convocation again

226
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:23,170
one place did you book these our economy

227
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:29,140
people we talked to her for now another

228
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:31,750
thing that will look through we're

229
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:33,910
trying to figure out the potentially got

230
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:37,780
some curve actually on a computer

231
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:44,490
ravages and we can use regex jalabiya

232
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:47,410
background offering you project your

233
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:50,080
auditors in this case what we're looking

234
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:54,550
for the bad guys they want their our

235
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:58,030
Kela so to reboot the tube there's no

236
00:11:58,030 --> 00:11:59,470
persistence necessarily South

237
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:02,890
persistence is what we call when now our

238
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:09,100
internet trench on sir the reboot okay

239
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:16,330
the road or review system and again we

240
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:19,930
have a positive rotation that's going to

241
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:23,170
look through and this isn't family bir

242
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:26,130
people's IDs you follow a decision on

243
00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:29,940
remote software Microsoft Windows

244
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:33,160
version and grumpy is actually an entry

245
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:36,580
the dentist on to the files of the

246
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:39,520
senior you'll see the dough reader the

247
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:42,280
product and we all use who want to start

248
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:46,090
up as we you know use our computer on

249
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:50,800
database we don't want that I reveal so

250
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,740
but we won think when you do a little

251
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:56,030
bit work nation may be about to happen

252
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:58,700
in there you can take out the echo

253
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:02,060
registry key so again just using read

254
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:05,090
Genesis 4 300 system you just go bottle

255
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:11,060
x1 save it out of text file and doing

256
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:14,660
here in this case I'm protecting you

257
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:17,840
open up he is realizing to the actual

258
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:20,330
the last time that key derivative we see

259
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:22,250
that remember second 2014 date again

260
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:24,950
okay one of the things we do as

261
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:26,510
investigators if we try to go through

262
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:28,910
all these lots of family time but what

263
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:31,130
time something thing is so important for

264
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:35,210
the throwing you know things they can

265
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:41,240
play kind of protracted so again this

266
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:44,150
lists common refugees idiot not one of

267
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:47,690
moms but he doesn't communication that

268
00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:50,480
you see get wings of that was like that

269
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:56,710
show anyone of government is Jesus who

270
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:59,990
doesn t need to do to you if you wanna

271
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:03,080
get kogi on Roger I thought this

272
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:06,970
approach number of high school

273
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:10,600
all around they told will be more than

274
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:16,540
just recipe itself test Network some

275
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:18,040
other application for the election your

276
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:26,920
sister and contraction through by pritha

277
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:31,270
another table mommy duty to do this

278
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:36,310
particular topic basically Freddie's

279
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:42,520
windows XP Bernie windows XP princess

280
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:44,560
loud for treating the basically just to

281
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,990
help you speed up to start off along the

282
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:49,600
applications on game days total do it up

283
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:54,010
and thrown up cash and so the recreation

284
00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:56,260
is a good educational closet and run on

285
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:59,050
system so in this case here who does the

286
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:01,390
windows prefetch directory and we will

287
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:03,790
be in there the great time in that file

288
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:05,529
itself giving indication when i bought

289
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:07,810
my first and run on the system now

290
00:15:07,810 --> 00:15:09,820
that's impartial a lion

291
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:13,010
diesel gas remains my date time it was

292
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:15,980
worked on that kind of educational I

293
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:19,390
product all embedded within the

294
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:24,950
profession outside one laughing I'll

295
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:28,030
talk about here the task Edward and

296
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:32,290
basically you know another method

297
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:38,180
precision and see without his schd you

298
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:41,090
got txt file to pay what version when

299
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:42,620
you're trying to be located ecology

300
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:45,140
replaces underway to try three minutes

301
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:49,850
pass and nice blog column gives us

302
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:53,120
information about Hitler Casper job at

303
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,580
their schedule offices this case here we

304
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:58,340
see his iron eagle job was started on

305
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:00,470
another stop again seeing the day

306
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:04,730
together second 114 in this case here is

307
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:07,190
positive 1 thought that he's a lot of

308
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:10,070
reasons just to be in net framework on

309
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:15,020
computer or business random panettiere

310
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:17,900
maybe this is a mitigation of the time

311
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:19,940
starters follow miss Kay to meet our

312
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:24,800
next success now that is tha that's kept

313
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:29,180
a lot of text file is it the water there

314
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:31,370
that can top job positive created and

315
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:34,430
set up cats so he indicated the entire

316
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:36,740
agreement optional we actually open that

317
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:42,520
up and the past 11

318
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:50,310
so into the report immediately proposed

319
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:53,250
a little bit and i'ma turn over to

320
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:54,630
prison you can kind of walking through

321
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:57,620
just some other things with pools are

322
00:16:57,620 --> 00:17:00,450
ultimately 5 i'm struggling with

323
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:06,420
something medals alright so you're

324
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:08,670
actually equity going off nanosystems

325
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:11,940
he's got something I on three locations

326
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:15,709
and you're not sure about what you do

327
00:17:15,709 --> 00:17:20,190
well it has a detective clues you need a

328
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:22,050
needle in some way to get the

329
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:25,640
information so you can process it and

330
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:28,950
make a determination so the first thing

331
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:30,510
you want to happen it will get is the

332
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:35,040
internet it is definitely living

333
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:38,040
information age and for every you know

334
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:40,890
cute cat picture or funny video there's

335
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:43,680
two or three you know malware blockers

336
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,750
talking about something on your NC just

337
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:49,010
go out there google it hopefully from

338
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:53,450
thank you had a story yeah one example I

339
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:55,730
have is my uncle actually confirm i'll

340
00:17:55,730 --> 00:17:59,240
add a female right so this bark echo

341
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:02,540
you're gonna and the little cat thing

342
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:08,300
you got any now and so he's like a tiny

343
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:13,220
bit of water so i took a closer by both

344
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:17,300
get a bargain by horse crap northern at

345
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:20,900
every time I try to use common AFRICOM

346
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:24,710
so shut it down so you know brighton

347
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:26,540
rough so they know they are trying to

348
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:29,720
cover the tracks with this stuff so you

349
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:32,030
where you want a clean system are we

350
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:35,660
doing here resources like that yeah and

351
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:37,490
we are going to make the internets

352
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:41,420
that's nice and easy do this I'll second

353
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:44,240
thing you're going to use a hesitant I

354
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,300
will you the hex editor it based I think

355
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:51,620
that takes the binary little bits and

356
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:54,500
with SP heads and that SQ excellency

357
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:57,140
here actually translates it a little

358
00:18:57,140 --> 00:19:00,590
human readable text over here and all of

359
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:03,050
this is searchable as a bottom enter

360
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:06,950
you've taken first few bikes there plug

361
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:08,480
it into google and you should come back

362
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,600
I think Barry tester has the largest

363
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:17,450
batch of plastic matures today so HD

364
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:20,180
here we have a funny bad game bang but

365
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:25,280
the first two 45-8 is actually an

366
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:28,790
executable pop so it's not what it says

367
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:31,790
it and so when they hear you no reason

368
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:34,940
it's going to read it based on the based

369
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:36,679
on this information and not the

370
00:19:36,679 --> 00:19:40,520
extension neck stated menus tends to be

371
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:42,860
analyzer I don't know how many of us

372
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:46,160
would be so just bear with me what

373
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:50,030
you're looking at here is two files this

374
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:52,790
one's on depressed and this one's using

375
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:55,670
a freshman of some sort and entropy is

376
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:58,580
the measurement of you know order

377
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:02,420
disorder in a bottle Wayne information

378
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:03,770
it's actually what is it the natural

379
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:07,240
order as well yeah

380
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:10,400
so what were what we're looking at here

381
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,220
is the same file aggressively congrats

382
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:16,070
the first one leave intelligence you

383
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:18,260
know a bunch of patterns and data

384
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:20,720
clusters if you get kinky mm and the

385
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:24,110
Petrified fairly low and this file over

386
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:26,930
here is pretty much scattered it's very

387
00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:32,960
random and I XP like high stuffing press

388
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,550
files you want each people can see and

389
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:39,080
what's inside oh and this is shannon

390
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:44,840
corner plot channel in 1948 thing those

391
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:48,740
you trivedi bucks so the next item one

392
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:52,370
is a hatch people use hash cab there's

393
00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:55,160
another player pipeline there's pee

394
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,309
bottle and

395
00:20:57,309 --> 00:21:02,110
so but why passions are essentially

396
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:04,240
fingerprints of applies the way to file

397
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,789
instead of typing in you know services

398
00:21:06,789 --> 00:21:08,590
that exe and coming up with a thousand

399
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:11,309
different things you type in the md5 and

400
00:21:11,309 --> 00:21:13,120
you're going to get a whole different

401
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,950
thing is this actually what a file is

402
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:20,049
and as great thumb the caches from sears

403
00:21:20,049 --> 00:21:23,230
either can do down to the Shahs you can

404
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:25,860
see the number of characters increases

405
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:28,539
md5 and sha-1 are pretty much banister

406
00:21:28,539 --> 00:21:30,909
standard you're going to hear your hash

407
00:21:30,909 --> 00:21:34,419
collisions a lot of math needs together

408
00:21:34,419 --> 00:21:36,190
and they try to basically break the

409
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:39,419
algorithms it doesn't invalidate them I

410
00:21:39,419 --> 00:21:42,669
get to see a heavy fog bleeding a lot

411
00:21:42,669 --> 00:21:44,940
and I've been doing this for a while

412
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:48,190
Shah line and that's even more us you

413
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:49,899
know 40 characters as opposed to the 32

414
00:21:49,899 --> 00:21:52,299
so it's even more active and there's a

415
00:21:52,299 --> 00:21:55,629
variety of shots too many sixes start to

416
00:21:55,629 --> 00:21:59,969
pick up a little bit but there's also

417
00:22:00,149 --> 00:22:03,100
for a bottle oh yeah which is 120

418
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:06,279
characters that is a lot of show how the

419
00:22:06,279 --> 00:22:09,419
other equals here that is action

420
00:22:09,419 --> 00:22:11,649
that is pretty fuzzy matching it's a

421
00:22:11,649 --> 00:22:14,559
wonderful way to competitive out I get

422
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:16,809
the black count and two different hashes

423
00:22:16,809 --> 00:22:20,320
and those will be able to tie those two

424
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,730
other clouds and great family

425
00:22:21,730 --> 00:22:26,409
resemblances it's good to amongst its

426
00:22:26,409 --> 00:22:27,879
really good on X file some of the

427
00:22:27,879 --> 00:22:29,769
compression algorithms will scroll that

428
00:22:29,769 --> 00:22:31,590
up and so you

429
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:34,700
relation the authentic ashes to their

430
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:37,230
widows Africa you guys have seen that

431
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:40,350
right click on a five that's what that

432
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:44,010
is it's just another hatch they use to

433
00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:45,679
authenticate the integrity of the

434
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:48,870
executable club and the in cash in cash

435
00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:53,100
has been in popularity when I compiler

436
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:57,090
works and compile the executable file it

437
00:22:57,090 --> 00:22:59,970
takes all the imports and holds them in

438
00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:02,460
a certain order the impact goes through

439
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:04,950
and says okay well here's the order you

440
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:07,169
know and it ashes you know that series

441
00:23:07,169 --> 00:23:09,750
and then you compare that with other

442
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:11,399
stuff but that tells you is that it's

443
00:23:11,399 --> 00:23:13,799
the same high so it's not going to tell

444
00:23:13,799 --> 00:23:17,100
you it's the same same mail or family

445
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:19,470
but the same product so you can actually

446
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:23,520
equate it to actors or such accuracy in

447
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:26,070
that if you go out there and look at

448
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:28,950
individual ski you know after sharing

449
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:31,830
sets and there's a variety of stuff on

450
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:36,809
there now that works with that an

451
00:23:36,809 --> 00:23:40,409
analyzer or information sure there are a

452
00:23:40,409 --> 00:23:44,190
dozen or more out there they apply

453
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:46,679
signatures mr. on this one's probably my

454
00:23:46,679 --> 00:23:51,029
favorite piece video it's a beautiful

455
00:23:51,029 --> 00:23:52,950
thing we actually has so many signatures

456
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:54,929
that are augmented so you just drop the

457
00:23:54,929 --> 00:23:57,270
file in and it will go through and it

458
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:58,620
will look at all the signatures that it

459
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:00,539
knows about and it'll tell you hey I

460
00:24:00,539 --> 00:24:02,640
think this is the dishes because X Y or

461
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:07,220
Z and you can use your custom new Jarrah

462
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:13,020
for those of you who they r & P explore

463
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:13,980
there's nothing there's a dozen

464
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:16,140
elevators will break down the aisle with

465
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:19,070
the information game you see the hatches

466
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:23,399
and there's a variety of available women

467
00:24:23,399 --> 00:24:33,630
for comm mark oh yeah I agree the P

468
00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:35,640
information why is this important

469
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:38,549
because all eyes people have effort and

470
00:24:38,549 --> 00:24:44,669
the header is not human readable for you

471
00:24:44,669 --> 00:24:46,380
that but it pulls out stuff like a

472
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:51,960
creation time and time again how late I

473
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:55,200
which like John sake love with the time

474
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,809
something it's it's kind of easy to

475
00:24:57,809 --> 00:25:02,039
month too much this but most Iraqis

476
00:25:02,039 --> 00:25:03,659
don't if you can you said the system

477
00:25:03,659 --> 00:25:06,179
time to something will you can compile

478
00:25:06,179 --> 00:25:10,890
it and it will be and you know most of

479
00:25:10,890 --> 00:25:12,870
most of the compilers you know when they

480
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:14,580
running through with everyone thousands

481
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:16,289
of files through in order to get via the

482
00:25:16,289 --> 00:25:19,620
now we're out there it will have a more

483
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:23,260
so now you have a tool set what do you

484
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:26,200
do well you go off to the file system

485
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,420
birthday might look at it will get the

486
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:30,820
bottoms I like down on the same if you

487
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:32,470
see you know Cyrillic or Russian

488
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:35,650
characters on nano system there's

489
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:39,750
something that's a big clue right there

490
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:42,280
service those it's misspelled you guys

491
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:43,660
in the spellings or something that's

492
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:46,030
close the windows would not play that's

493
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:48,940
another clue and then there's the total

494
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:51,490
random character you know I created this

495
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:55,060
you know with a piece of code the

496
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:56,710
feeling things simpler than finding

497
00:25:56,710 --> 00:25:59,800
something like this is finding pfft XD

498
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:06,130
or word that EAC the hash we just talked

499
00:26:06,130 --> 00:26:08,950
about the hashes so what do you do you

500
00:26:08,950 --> 00:26:11,020
go out the google aquifers football

501
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:13,090
control Nash you know see what's out

502
00:26:13,090 --> 00:26:15,880
there they'll give you options I'll

503
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,920
cotabato just know that if you're

504
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:21,100
uploading file you're losing control you

505
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:22,810
no longer have you know what I was

506
00:26:22,810 --> 00:26:25,210
inside so if it's a key log you know

507
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:28,990
this up about an hour now Nana's recipe

508
00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:30,940
and all the bank account informations on

509
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:35,040
the internet which is just never good

510
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:38,500
filetype we're talking about the heck

511
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:40,570
side is where the heck's that is really

512
00:26:40,570 --> 00:26:42,700
awesome so here you see creative

513
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:44,980
involvement freedom about legs are live

514
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:50,590
and this is the old office on d0 cm11

515
00:26:50,590 --> 00:26:53,590
easy row here's the new office which is

516
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:57,330
XML in a compressed file or if you did

517
00:26:57,330 --> 00:27:00,080
and then down here you have the SP

518
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:05,679
OMG header this is you know really word

519
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:09,730
as a human looking at the binary with a

520
00:27:09,730 --> 00:27:11,870
hex editor you can actually pick out

521
00:27:11,870 --> 00:27:13,220
some of the stuff and you can go down

522
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:15,860
through and pull up strings and stuff if

523
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:18,740
there's nothing blocking you are

524
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:23,510
compressing the file the size they lata

525
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:26,080
cisely possess play a part of anything

526
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:29,510
well it's pretty relevant you know if

527
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:30,559
you got to pee dee up and it's

528
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:32,809
incredibly small or if you got word docs

529
00:27:32,809 --> 00:27:34,940
or powerpoints and they're really large

530
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:36,950
and there's one like one day or two

531
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:39,350
slicing them that's a key in it that

532
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:41,690
there's something that might be like up

533
00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:43,429
here and so you want to take a closer

534
00:27:43,429 --> 00:27:47,630
look how do you do that we break the

535
00:27:47,630 --> 00:27:50,539
files now now this is actually pretty

536
00:27:50,539 --> 00:27:53,720
cool because those office files and you

537
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:56,029
know the PK header it's just straight

538
00:27:56,029 --> 00:27:59,720
brushing so you can actually take 7-zip

539
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:02,779
which way did in this case and in this

540
00:28:02,779 --> 00:28:05,779
one I took an executable file and I just

541
00:28:05,779 --> 00:28:07,340
said Kate well they can extract as

542
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:09,320
executable Bob and this is what you come

543
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:10,909
up with you got the text section on our

544
00:28:10,909 --> 00:28:12,740
date of the data and this resource

545
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:14,419
section well what you're going to find

546
00:28:14,419 --> 00:28:16,730
more often than not is in that resource

547
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:18,710
section that the camera offers you're

548
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:20,269
going to stop other things like will say

549
00:28:20,269 --> 00:28:22,190
is an icon file but it's another rescue

550
00:28:22,190 --> 00:28:24,669
so you can dig through that you know

551
00:28:24,669 --> 00:28:27,980
repeat leatherby go through process and

552
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:31,460
it all worked with a about determination

553
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:35,720
on validity this is what a power level

554
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:38,929
is like when you break it down using zip

555
00:28:38,929 --> 00:28:40,639
format again become their breaks down

556
00:28:40,639 --> 00:28:42,400
into all these wonderful little

557
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,440
directories and you see here these are

558
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:47,140
the slides in XML format and look

559
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:50,620
there's a exe right there in his life so

560
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:54,550
they've got their efforts in there it's

561
00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:56,290
never going to be that easy but you can

562
00:28:56,290 --> 00:28:58,240
you can go through and find something

563
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,340
that's suspicious or you know do this

564
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:01,780
with an office document below through

565
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:04,990
the VBA code it'll break up with one

566
00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:10,450
player there is a CBE 2015 4 14 that we

567
00:29:10,450 --> 00:29:14,590
just will report on and that was exact

568
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:16,810
same thing they basically packaged up a

569
00:29:16,810 --> 00:29:20,380
new vulnerability it was an iphone or

570
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:22,780
build ethic and PowerPoint and they did

571
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:25,240
it is packaged it up and you know using

572
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:28,000
the slide so there's a big file one

573
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,310
slide relatively easy to find ones you

574
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:32,230
extracted it hey look this doesn't look

575
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:37,540
right time job talk about times counting

576
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:41,560
how is very important to us well here

577
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:43,540
you see you know there's this time in

578
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:47,050
2008 which eight years old so if you go

579
00:29:47,050 --> 00:29:49,900
out and look up you know w get you know

580
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:52,180
and look for this specific package you

581
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:53,530
should be able to find some information

582
00:29:53,530 --> 00:29:54,740
online so

583
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:57,380
compared to or just download another

584
00:29:57,380 --> 00:30:00,080
version check the versioning check out

585
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:02,840
the rest of the data that's too old or

586
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:06,650
too you then Jacques towns not ball it

587
00:30:06,650 --> 00:30:11,350
means it a question upon the metadata

588
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:14,830
metadata is literally just information

589
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:17,600
so you go ahead and look at what was

590
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,850
this great advice yeah was it created by

591
00:30:19,850 --> 00:30:22,250
a tool that you know should it should

592
00:30:22,250 --> 00:30:25,220
record who was the author how many pages

593
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:27,530
you know there's a lot of information

594
00:30:27,530 --> 00:30:29,660
you can do to say hey this is this looks

595
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:32,540
suspicious you know and this and with

596
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:34,280
everything else you can make a

597
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:36,590
determination this is a bad bot this is

598
00:30:36,590 --> 00:30:40,880
a good Bob yeah you media QPS update

599
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:44,440
when the attackers like use very valid

600
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:46,850
entropy we talked about a little bit

601
00:30:46,850 --> 00:30:48,260
earlier i'm going to break it down for

602
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:53,570
you so try to stay awake here i use

603
00:30:53,570 --> 00:30:56,240
crippled pretty cool that is just

604
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:59,630
phenomenal and i downloaded the second

605
00:30:59,630 --> 00:31:02,660
board for product boot bird and electra

606
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:04,220
night didn't actually check on it and

607
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:07,100
there you see the entropy it was pretty

608
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:10,370
low then I'm going to have to use the

609
00:31:10,370 --> 00:31:14,600
same tool I did the encryption a

610
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:18,140
symmetric encryption using our c4 with

611
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:23,600
the key f00 be pushed encrypt and this

612
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:24,920
is what it looks like so you have a

613
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:27,309
plain text over here and this is the

614
00:31:27,309 --> 00:31:29,900
encrypted version on this side any of

615
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:32,450
you tell you know you can easily look

616
00:31:32,450 --> 00:31:35,360
read this and you know if you do this in

617
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:35,840
your head

618
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:41,270
and the other job way any CSP is way

619
00:31:41,270 --> 00:31:43,549
high the reason you want to look for I

620
00:31:43,549 --> 00:31:46,520
entropy is malware authors won't change

621
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:49,130
and the little repack something just

622
00:31:49,130 --> 00:31:51,140
using a crypt or using a different style

623
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:53,710
and this is a way to get it passed 8e

624
00:31:53,710 --> 00:31:56,900
but as even you can easily go and just

625
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:59,570
go right feel good and enter each other

626
00:31:59,570 --> 00:32:04,429
and say hey this doesn't look up and

627
00:32:04,429 --> 00:32:09,559
let's all say boxes so a lot of times

628
00:32:09,559 --> 00:32:12,669
sandboxes artwork they're just their

629
00:32:12,669 --> 00:32:15,590
dominance put up a almost there's not a

630
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:17,870
lid over and they don't work you know

631
00:32:17,870 --> 00:32:20,120
and you know you look at the static

632
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:22,370
affections you can tell it's malware but

633
00:32:22,370 --> 00:32:24,980
I'll doing any sandbox I mean nowadays

634
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:29,929
there's virtual deduction there's some

635
00:32:29,929 --> 00:32:31,760
tables will see it's on the now examples

636
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:34,580
are out there are you know love you doin

637
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:35,720
gravity three checks looking for

638
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:39,289
existence of VMware virtual box looking

639
00:32:39,289 --> 00:32:40,880
for existence of Wireshark and things

640
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,320
like that that's about where to test

641
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:43,460
that will actually change of behavior

642
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:46,309
just shut down deliver different payload

643
00:32:46,309 --> 00:32:48,679
with something long coastline so you

644
00:32:48,679 --> 00:32:50,330
know it's kind of cat mouse keep going

645
00:32:50,330 --> 00:32:52,909
back or if we have get to be cool to try

646
00:32:52,909 --> 00:32:53,970
to detect now

647
00:32:53,970 --> 00:32:56,430
doing it out what we're doing we go back

648
00:32:56,430 --> 00:33:00,570
and forth back and forth even now Kevin

649
00:33:00,570 --> 00:33:02,490
we bought a lot of good rat decoders and

650
00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:04,980
now we're actually seeing power authors

651
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:07,920
and use that put you know lovely

652
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,720
messages in there about those reporters

653
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:13,620
and some of the breakdowns you aren't

654
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:16,800
checking I'm Chester's ways to basically

655
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:19,500
patty hinder analysis for those of you

656
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:22,190
in about a little more advanced analysis

657
00:33:22,190 --> 00:33:25,790
and sometimes their dependencies either

658
00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:28,770
you get a file that you don't have the

659
00:33:28,770 --> 00:33:30,570
accompanying while that was on the

660
00:33:30,570 --> 00:33:33,450
system or the file like Java said

661
00:33:33,450 --> 00:33:36,750
earlier yes yeah like stuff that looked

662
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:39,690
first at a keyboard leg and it would

663
00:33:39,690 --> 00:33:42,830
install and work only that was present

664
00:33:42,830 --> 00:33:46,710
and sometimes you know you're missing a

665
00:33:46,710 --> 00:33:48,990
component on United the whole system so

666
00:33:48,990 --> 00:33:50,880
you're trying to be something wrong

667
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,800
version of word we're peers virtual

668
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:56,460
environment or sandbox you got a variety

669
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:58,230
of different you know things that could

670
00:33:58,230 --> 00:34:01,190
prevent it from detonating properly

671
00:34:01,190 --> 00:34:04,260
malware itself could use other

672
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:06,390
techniques that you can go up to a known

673
00:34:06,390 --> 00:34:09,210
bug own site to try to pull that guy P

674
00:34:09,210 --> 00:34:10,639
address in the duck down

675
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:16,879
then again it fix it ever before I look

676
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:19,668
back to the laterals using the internet

677
00:34:19,668 --> 00:34:25,849
and trying to get ever information if

678
00:34:25,849 --> 00:34:27,980
you go up you have a file decided to

679
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:30,529
send a hash bar sold our soul comes back

680
00:34:30,529 --> 00:34:33,500
0 56 you know 80 butters attacking it

681
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:35,480
doesn't make it a good file it just

682
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:39,710
means if not most fun and so yeah those

683
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:41,989
are great but you gotta get a better

684
00:34:41,989 --> 00:34:45,589
movie but you gotta use a little little

685
00:34:45,589 --> 00:34:49,219
of your resource and try to make a

686
00:34:49,219 --> 00:34:51,849
decision whether or not that is valuable

687
00:34:51,849 --> 00:34:54,889
sometimes matters now our reports will

688
00:34:54,889 --> 00:34:56,779
be very high level and won't give you

689
00:34:56,779 --> 00:34:58,579
the technical details you need so you

690
00:34:58,579 --> 00:35:00,799
know just kind of give it off their go

691
00:35:00,799 --> 00:35:02,960
find something that will help you make a

692
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:07,970
determination these the whole thing we

693
00:35:07,970 --> 00:35:11,690
were talking about can be related in a

694
00:35:11,690 --> 00:35:15,130
couple stories we had from experience

695
00:35:15,130 --> 00:35:17,960
there was one time we have a response

696
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:21,280
and we went out to the five

697
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:24,310
had an alert we get down there it was a

698
00:35:24,310 --> 00:35:26,680
common location and I'll was just you

699
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:29,790
know there he had a scrambled name I

700
00:35:29,790 --> 00:35:32,860
entropy it was obvious so we were able

701
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:35,320
to pull a file we're through in our

702
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:39,430
sandbox and it didn't work and so then

703
00:35:39,430 --> 00:35:41,170
you know what happens and you have to

704
00:35:41,170 --> 00:35:42,340
take it to the next level Trevor

705
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:45,070
happened it's a hoodie thing to email or

706
00:35:45,070 --> 00:35:49,180
analyst and and we saw some weird system

707
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:51,250
checks going and we're like us as the

708
00:35:51,250 --> 00:35:52,870
main jets and we're like well why is it

709
00:35:52,870 --> 00:35:54,700
checking system e-check assistant named

710
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:56,380
it would just kind of sit there and spin

711
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:59,620
for a while and then Germany and so we

712
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:01,630
know what was going on following go down

713
00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:03,840
through the path well thought if I know

714
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:07,360
when it sells itself onto the original

715
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:09,670
system it queried the original system

716
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:12,730
systems name edited during the melt or

717
00:36:12,730 --> 00:36:15,430
the melting process and then was looking

718
00:36:15,430 --> 00:36:17,890
for the system and comparing it to the

719
00:36:17,890 --> 00:36:20,110
system thing that was currently on and

720
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:22,300
it didn't match it completely went a

721
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:24,430
different way so once we're able to go

722
00:36:24,430 --> 00:36:26,710
ahead and bypass that we're able to get

723
00:36:26,710 --> 00:36:28,630
all the deepening information figure out

724
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:31,120
exactly what it was you know based on

725
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:36,700
the behavior okay so another motion area

726
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:39,910
we had with non-network law result who

727
00:36:39,910 --> 00:36:42,120
is this Bishop people enjoy how to

728
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:45,100
Chinese efforts now never ratified yes

729
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:48,040
you'll go with what we was we just very

730
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:52,360
randomly and so both down third looking

731
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:55,640
at it and it

732
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:58,760
fighting it so it left a lot of gnashing

733
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,620
of teeth we realized that there was a

734
00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:02,360
very critical pendant we need to have

735
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:04,580
this particular piece of melon we had to

736
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:07,280
have web browser open and have a paint

737
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:10,010
file loaded up and browsing itself to

738
00:37:10,010 --> 00:37:12,320
actually execute payroll from now so

739
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,480
just keep in mind you may have a very

740
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:17,360
suspicious file out there but you don't

741
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,520
you can't get drunk you have 30 per year

742
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:21,200
but it's something called it may be time

743
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:26,649
to avoid doing before the xix chiste but

744
00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:29,330
yeah like what you're saying the

745
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:31,400
techniques that we you know we showed

746
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,290
you guys if they're not named you know

747
00:37:33,290 --> 00:37:35,510
but you use them the terms of the that

748
00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:37,820
is malware without actually knowing with

749
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:41,900
Mallory's going beyond windows these

750
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:44,240
same tactics could be applied what we

751
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:46,460
looking at here is is an alt better

752
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:51,760
brought you two mixers out there and

753
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:54,980
literally you can search stuff you use a

754
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:58,700
lot of the same tactics including trying

755
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:00,620
to decompress it out using winzip it'll

756
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:03,140
break it down to the components it's

757
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:06,890
it's just a really really nice way to

758
00:38:06,890 --> 00:38:12,710
cheat so in the inclusion and we are

759
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:16,850
breathing steadily well what would I let

760
00:38:16,850 --> 00:38:18,680
you guys know in some clues are key

761
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:22,130
entities it's you can get the smoking

762
00:38:22,130 --> 00:38:23,710
gun just looking at

763
00:38:23,710 --> 00:38:25,780
some of their comment has a specific

764
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:29,050
mutex I think for Sarah Carol put a

765
00:38:29,050 --> 00:38:31,869
wonderful their common thing for our

766
00:38:31,869 --> 00:38:36,520
blog and some booths you know you can

767
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:38,589
get up massing the flues but you won't

768
00:38:38,589 --> 00:38:40,570
have enough to say to make a final

769
00:38:40,570 --> 00:38:42,700
determination you know so even though

770
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:44,950
you have like a weird filing and a known

771
00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:47,050
location you know sometimes the glove

772
00:38:47,050 --> 00:38:50,140
doesn't fit so you gotta move on try

773
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:52,930
different things I think the final

774
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:54,339
fitting both of them leave you guys

775
00:38:54,339 --> 00:38:56,710
would tie this whole thing back together

776
00:38:56,710 --> 00:38:59,050
that the more bizarre thing less

777
00:38:59,050 --> 00:39:02,140
mysterious it grew to be which you go

778
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:03,940
out and you see and it fits all the

779
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:08,230
criteria you know it's bad but if you

780
00:39:08,230 --> 00:39:10,210
got something that looks like a system

781
00:39:10,210 --> 00:39:12,760
file is behaving erratically you know

782
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:14,140
those are the ones that are really

783
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:18,180
really hard to find it hard to define

784
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:21,640
good yeah I think that's it I have any

785
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:30,130
questions there we go vitamins oh no

786
00:39:30,130 --> 00:39:40,230
nobody okay yes how do we deal with SLR

787
00:39:40,230 --> 00:39:46,300
that is a really good question if you

788
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:48,310
have access to the host and you can do

789
00:39:48,310 --> 00:39:52,830
it daily that's probably best that I

790
00:39:52,830 --> 00:39:57,550
don't know any good good automation for

791
00:39:57,550 --> 00:40:00,500
that long time on network

792
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:03,680
yeah we do a lot of networking national

793
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:06,230
network stuff when you're hooking

794
00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:08,120
actually have a physical system it's a a

795
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:18,370
bit more of a sticky wicket anyone's got

796
00:40:18,370 --> 00:40:22,750
failing I think we're done thanks
