you guys to know you all haven't paid a

193
00:07:33,169 --> 00:07:35,479
lot of money for your tickets right and

194
00:07:35,479 --> 00:07:37,130
the reason we're able besides

195
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:39,229
organizations nationally internationally

196
00:07:39,229 --> 00:07:41,100
and us write our

197
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,630
are able to keep that ticket price down

198
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:44,460
is because of these sponsors right

199
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:46,800
without the sponsors this event does not

200
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,040
happen most of the money for for putting

201
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:52,020
this event on comes from the sponsorship

202
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:54,450

of got too many of these things at home

281
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,040
they mate they make great collectors

282
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,870
items so we'll have to back up for the

283
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:25,880
recording yes no listen you're lost

284
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:29,410
nothing we could start over yet anyway

285
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:31,910
think about it what's been going on with

286
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:33,740
all these credit card breaches we look

287
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:36,350
at things like at Target and Sally's at

288
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:37,580
home depot and of course there's more

289
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:38,660
coming but what are they all got in

290
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:43,490
common yeah Dave well they all got it

291
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:44,660
they all got whacked they got whack of

292
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:46,340
the pretty big way and what they're

293
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:47,840
going after we're finding after as

294
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,370
criminals are going after credit card

295
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:51,320
and debit card information it's really

296
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53,180
kind of a little bit back to go back

297
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:55,490
Willie Sutton remember the bank robber

298
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:57,290
when they asked him why do you rob banks

299
00:11:57,290 --> 00:11:59,300
his answer was because that's where the

300
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:01,430
body is well this is where the money is

301
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:03,440
now it's last year's verizon data breach

302
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,850
report but you know he could still

303
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:06,680
squeak a little bit out of it they said

304
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,030
hey you know it's a year the retailer

305
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:10,310
bridge now of course any year could

306
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:11,780
probably be the year the retailer breach

307
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:13,790
it's just the nature of things because

308
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:16,100
with so much information available for

309
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:18,080
compromise it's really really kind of

310
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,810
hard to say no if you're an attacker

311
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:22,490
particularly if you don't even have to

312
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:26,570
gain physical access to a system to get

313
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:27,680
all the goodies that come out of it and

314
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,870
so what we want to think about is what's

315
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:32,540
going on here card fraud it's a huge

316
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:35,180
industry 11 billion dollars in 2013 went

317
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:37,310
up to about 12 and change in 2014 and

318
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:38,690
still trying to get some final number

319
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:40,550
sixteen billion dollars when you throw

320
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:41,840
in the cost of all their credit card

321
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,340
remediation you're gonna watch your

322
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:44,900
credit history for like seriously

323
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:47,360
remember that OPM hack whether they can

324
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,530
where they come out after the OPI

325
00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:50,150
anybody here yeah you're probably part

326
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:52,250
of that if you've got a dot every we're

327
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:53,960
headed clearance and they say we'll give

328
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,460
you a free credit monitoring for a year

329
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:57,410
like seriously you think the Chinese you

330
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:58,520
don't all that's like it steal your

331
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:01,580
credit cards dudes hello anyway credit

332
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:03,080
cards oh yes they do want your money

333
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:05,000
about sixteen billion dollars total well

334
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,910
the problem is is expensive banks and

335
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:09,410
generally eat about sixty-three percent

336
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:11,030
of that loss almost two-thirds of it the

337
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:13,010
rest goes to the merchant saying okay if

338
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:14,720
a merchant didn't actually get that

339
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,580
three digit cvv on the back or they

340
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:18,260
didn't swipe the card because oh I left

341
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:19,370
my card at home but I remember my number

342
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:23,450
or card-not-present think online all

343
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:25,250
those folks tend to pay for it well the

344
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:27,320
thing is what's missing for that

345
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,930
equation you how much do you get ripped

346
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:32,090
off I don't know because you might not

347
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:33,380
know either unless you're kind of

348
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:34,670
meticulous about checking your

349
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:36,650
statements I even got popped about ten

350
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:38,840
years ago and I missed it cuz I was on

351
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,040
the road like I always am and it's like

352
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,510
a ten-dollar charge I read a couple

353
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:43,490
years later these guys stole two million

354
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:46,730
cards they made one $10 charge on each

355
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:48,290
of the two million cards and that's it

356
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:49,220
they threw the rest they threw the

357
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:51,110
numbers away well that was actually

358
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:52,640
pretty smart business model because they

359
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,980
got away with it because ten dollars

360
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:56,660
it's not worth getting on the phone and

361
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:59,000
arguing with your bag for 45 minutes so

362
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,490
you'll let it go and it scales up pretty

363
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:03,650
well well the US has got a huge

364
00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:05,330
disproportionate amount of volume on

365
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:06,740
this mostly because while we don't

366
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:09,290
really have those Chip and PIN cards at

367
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:11,120
all Europeans use cuz well we're

368
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,130
Americans were better or smarter maybe

369
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:15,380
well so what's happened is banks as

370
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:16,700
default of these neural network type

371
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:18,920
things the systems that are basically

372
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:21,290
mainframe applications that run just

373
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:22,940
like a giant firewall if then else if

374
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:24,500
then else if then else and you can screw

375
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,300
with those rule sets if you want and you

376
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:28,520
can do it legally so for example if you

377
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,170
want to see if your bank is using a

378
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:31,640
certain type of fraud prevention and

379
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:32,900
you're a getting ready to go buy

380
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:34,490
something at best buy because it's

381
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:36,140
coming up a shopping season here's what

382
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:37,910
you do take your credit card go to the

383
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:40,400
gas station authorize your gas but then

384
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,440
cancel it then drive down to best buy

385
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,960
and buy your stuff and see what happens

386
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:46,670
alright that one-two punch ought to kick

387
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:48,260
into windows firewall rules and your

388
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:50,120
card ought to either be hey was a

389
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,620
problem with or declined or whatever now

390
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:52,380
you haven't committed for

391
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:53,940
god it's your old cart but what you're

392
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:55,470
doing is like you're doing a good hacker

393
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:57,420
you're probing like a black boxes rule

394
00:14:57,420 --> 00:15:00,750
sets and that's exactly what criminals

395
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:02,190
have done over the last few years they

396
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:03,990
probed out that entire rule set and

397
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:05,700
they've kind of figured it out and so

398
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:07,560
this chip and pin or chip and signatures

399
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:08,760
were doing the u.s. is not going to

400
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,800
solve this problem it just changes the

401
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,300
nature of the fraud because if you think

402
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:14,100
about it we're going to find out that it

403
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,540
really doesn't do a whole lot for things

404
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:17,790
like online or card-not-present so card

405
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:20,280
fraud it's complex it's not a bunch of

406
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,720
computers dueling it out it's not like

407
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,250
some Star Trek thing where you're okay

408
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:24,660
you have to report to the disintegration

409
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:26,370
chamber because your sector was bombed

410
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:29,910
no these are set up the static defenses

411
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:32,220
attackers attack next week or next month

412
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:33,780
whenever you push the updates we push

413
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:35,580
the updates and it's a constantly losing

414
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:37,530
battles by the way anybody sign up for

415
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:40,940
Apple pay how's that working for you

416
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,560
you're like smiling was it easy to

417
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,120
seriously was it easy or hard to set up

418
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,630
Apple pay for your bank relatively

419
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:50,420
anybody have like a super easy way just

420
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:53,550
provision your card and go anybody had

421
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:55,170
to go like show up at a bank or actually

422
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:57,030
do a phone call or do some other nation

423
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:58,740
yeah because when Apple pay started out

424
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:00,600
what happened is Apple they're brilliant

425
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,580
they did the crypto well they did the

426
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:04,770
near field communications well they did

427
00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:06,390
the interface with all the switches they

428
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:08,160
didn't think very carefully about how do

429
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,870
we provision the card and figure it out

430
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:11,370
pretty quickly with a stolen credit card

431
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:13,380
number and just create an itunes account

432
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:16,650
you can now provision your iphone 6 with

433
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:18,360
a stolen card and now you got Apple pay

434
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:21,390
but Apple pay is card present so very

435
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:24,090
low fraud concern charges always go

436
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:25,860
through but where's the card it's either

437
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:27,390
in your sock drawer or somebody else's

438
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:29,220
doctor or it's stolen so some of the

439
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:30,930
banks that started doing Apple pay early

440
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:33,060
on to do the easy provisioning six

441
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:35,600
thousand percent increase in fraud

442
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,250
massive spike in front because what you

443
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:39,510
do you go ahead you steal one of these

444
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:41,010
things then you come back and you go to

445
00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:42,420
the apple store you said hey you know I

446
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:44,370
got one of these iphones last yeah

447
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:46,140
yesterday I like them so much I want to

448
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:48,240
buy them for everybody in my company and

449
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,130
and I'm going to pay for it with Apple

450
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:51,840
pay in the cars going wow this is

451
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,760
wonderful apples changing the world but

452
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,560
of course it's all stolen so Apple is

453
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,780
really one of the biggest victims of

454
00:16:57,780 --> 00:16:59,670
that and they don't want to admit that

455
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:02,100
I've gotten emails from Apple saying hey

456
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:03,780
I'm sorry was learning things about us

457
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:04,890
they say well you guys

458
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:06,599
more lawyers than I do so no I'm not

459
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:08,099
going to talk to you you know what you

460
00:17:08,099 --> 00:17:10,470
did go fix it and like anything else

461
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:12,000
we're starting to see improvements but

462
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,220
usually early adopters catch the first

463
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:17,579
arrows so typical fraud prevention we're

464
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:20,700
looking for this anomalous user behavior

465
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:22,500
what I mean think about in the beginning

466
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,569
for those of us hey Kahuna with a gray

467
00:17:24,569 --> 00:17:27,569
hair we remember back in the 70s or no

468
00:17:27,569 --> 00:17:31,800
hair in your case but in any case yeah

469
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,390
we have to add all this stuff out the

470
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:35,370
that's nothing i like about b-sides you

471
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:36,180
don't have to be politically correct

472
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:39,300
even in Washington DC so what happened

473
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:40,950
was this if you remember the old days

474
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:42,300
you got your first credit card you went

475
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:43,380
down to the Merkin you buy something

476
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:44,850
they had a little onion skin booklet

477
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:46,740
like little eight point font so you had

478
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:48,720
to be younger than we are now to read it

479
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,910
and they listed literally every single

480
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:53,370
stolen credit card that week and then

481
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:54,600
the next week they'd issue a new book

482
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,460
it's like a very very small certificate

483
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:59,040
revocation list but the problem was is

484
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,960
that it didn't scale too well when

485
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,760
things got a little bit bigger okay so

486
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,980
now it happened I remember there was a

487
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:07,080
clerk is like it can't find your number

488
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,480
in the book it's a good thing Lady you

489
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,220
know and that's probably why she was

490
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:13,380
there making minimum wage well the

491
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:14,730
problem was is that as more people

492
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:16,680
started using cars as hotlist got bigger

493
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,240
and bigger and bigger like a dot hosts

494
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,680
file which you couldn't go ahead and

495
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,690
scale to the size of the internet you

496
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:22,890
had to have something a little bit

497
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:25,140
bigger and better so what do we do we

498
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:26,880
want for these knuckle Buster run your

499
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,570
card through to these online validation

500
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:34,590
using this ooh a modem 1200 baud 24 and

501
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:35,550
things like that but here's a crazy

502
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:38,130
thing do you know what percentage of the

503
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:40,070
merchants still use an unauthenticated

504
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:42,330
unencrypted dial-up modem to run your

505
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:46,830
credit card about ninety percent because

506
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:48,540
if you want to do it across the internet

507
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:50,340
you have to pay extra to the merchant

508
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:53,130
bank so why would you do that if your

509
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:54,810
dry cleaner you don't want to say a bend

510
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:56,460
extra money on it so you put up with it

511
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:58,890
so the cool thing is so you can check

512
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:01,320
for authorization real time because now

513
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:03,180
you had a little bit of latency with

514
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:05,550
that little book right you can steal car

515
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:06,660
to money but nobody would know about it

516
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:08,760
to the next week but now you can go

517
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,110
ahead into a real time check online

518
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:12,150
that's pretty cool and so now we can

519
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:13,890
tell if your card not only is stolen or

520
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:15,480
not we can tell there's a balance on it

521
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,620
and whether or not the merchant should

522
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:18,450
take it merchants like this because it

523
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:18,720
helped

524
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,340
protect them then from people going

525
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:22,440
ahead having cards that were out of

526
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:24,120
money and if you didn't know that when

527
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:26,100
you did the knuckle Buster thing and

528
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:27,510
then you'd submitted it to your bank in

529
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:28,740
three days later you found out there's

530
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:30,870
no money there you got ripped off now we

531
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:31,710
don't have to worry about it anymore

532
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:34,470
well the problem is today for those

533
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:36,390
Monty Python fans how do you know she's

534
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:40,320
a witch of course what's the answer yeah

535
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,970
she floats all right you must be made of

536
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:45,299
wood so we look at all these solutions

537
00:19:45,299 --> 00:19:46,679
that come out of these mainframe type

538
00:19:46,679 --> 00:19:48,299
things these big copper and these are

539
00:19:48,299 --> 00:19:49,919
hundred million dollar companies and oh

540
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:52,590
by the way you know working with mock 37

541
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:55,470
who Dan Woolies out there and yeah I got

542
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:57,960
their little card in here but talk to

543
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,039
these folks by the way that's really

544
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:00,870
cool they're a cybersecurity accelerator

545
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:02,880
and they helped fund this little guy

546
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,799
here which is why did all this research

547
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:08,690
for you guys so what do you do then is

548
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:12,510
we learn a behavior of a user and look

549
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:14,400
for anomalous stuff now do any of us

550
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,650
ever do anomalous things in her life oh

551
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:19,320
it's sort of defines us right and so it

552
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,570
works really well my grandma who's in

553
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:23,669
Ohio who doesn't drive more than 20

554
00:20:23,669 --> 00:20:25,169
miles from her house and never charges

555
00:20:25,169 --> 00:20:26,909
more than forty dollars on a credit card

556
00:20:26,909 --> 00:20:29,549
solar guard Jose up in these Los Angeles

557
00:20:29,549 --> 00:20:31,230
on a friday night for 800 bucks to the

558
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,659
best buy probably not grandma that's

559
00:20:33,659 --> 00:20:36,350
easy to spot but the thing is is that

560
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:38,970
you get a lot of false positives that

561
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:42,419
way and so even spite of that 12 billion

562
00:20:42,419 --> 00:20:44,220
dollars get past it and this is like an

563
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:45,840
intrusion detection intrusion prevention

564
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,120
but this is more of an IPS system if

565
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:50,370
it's blocking transactions people aren't

566
00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:52,260
happy when your car doesn't work so

567
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:54,179
things are changing on the first of

568
00:20:54,179 --> 00:20:55,980
October just a couple weeks ago what's

569
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:58,020
happened they've just realigned the

570
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:59,940
liability rules by the way you got told

571
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:02,669
2017 if you're in a gas pump and the

572
00:21:02,669 --> 00:21:04,770
idea is this if you're a bank and you

573
00:21:04,770 --> 00:21:06,150
issue cars you don't have that little

574
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:08,159
chip on there then you're paying for the

575
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:09,659
fraud if you're a merchant and you don't

576
00:21:09,659 --> 00:21:11,220
take little chip you're paying for the

577
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:13,289
prod by lana the carrot doesn't doesn't

578
00:21:13,289 --> 00:21:14,940
matter you're paying for it what if you

579
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,440
both are guilty well then you have an

580
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,880
arm wrestling or something they all work

581
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,320
out the rules but this is not the

582
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:23,220
federal government this is not the banks

583
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:24,600
that are saying this this is the

584
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:27,360
switches visa mastercard and discover

585
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:30,000
and american express by least 20 of them

586
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,380
out there in the united states alone

587
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:32,310
here's a

588
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:34,830
you take a look at the fraud equation

589
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:37,920
how much fraud losses do visa have every

590
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:41,880
year zero and mastercard 0 why because

591
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,530
it's in their contract we don't pay for

592
00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:45,810
fraud in fact it's even better than that

593
00:21:45,810 --> 00:21:47,760
fraudulent transaction comes through

594
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,590
their system they get a little

595
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:51,720
percentage of that too they're actually

596
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,940
making money on fraud dude that is one

597
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:55,680
rocket industry now you know why your

598
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:58,680
stock has been doing so well except

599
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:00,000
there's some other issues coming up so

600
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,110
before you go out and buy their stock

601
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:02,580
i'll give you some pointers on that so

602
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:05,340
how are we doing so far so as of this

603
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:07,290
past month eighteen percent up from

604
00:22:07,290 --> 00:22:09,030
about three percent of the credit cards

605
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:10,380
now have a chip who here's got at least

606
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:12,630
one card with a chip on it look around

607
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:14,070
yeah that's about seventy percent who

608
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:16,770
here still has the old legacy ones in

609
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:17,940
your wallet Oh from some of the old

610
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:19,950
stuff yeah so we're in that transition

611
00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:21,840
phase even though the rules have kicked

612
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,760
in by the way the estimate is going to

613
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,160
cost about 8 billion dollars for all

614
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:28,290
these donut shops and the Chinese

615
00:22:28,290 --> 00:22:29,940
restaurants and the dry cleaners and

616
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:31,470
everybody else to upgrade all other

617
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:33,720
hardware well gee whiz for that kind of

618
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,850
money you could get for his estimates as

619
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:37,500
high as 35 but you could buy a bunch of

620
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,510
aircraft carriers and go rule part of

621
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:42,840
the world or you could take chip cards I

622
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:44,130
don't know about you but ruling part of

623
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:45,690
the world sounds more cool than taking a

624
00:22:45,690 --> 00:22:47,250
different form of payment heck we'll use

625
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:51,030
Bitcoin and rule the world anyway not

626
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:52,560
too many merchant locations a lot of

627
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:54,410
these locations are maybe your big

628
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:57,480
organizations like Target who spent 100

629
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,160
million dollars fixed in their systems

630
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,960
but now they finally rolled them out

631
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,520
walmart was pretty much first major

632
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,710
retailers free so August and now you're

633
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:06,240
going to see the customer experience a

634
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,640
lot of frustration come black friday and

635
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,930
all these shopping when people instead

636
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:11,730
of swiping their card for half a second

637
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:13,080
gotta stick it in there and leave it in

638
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:15,690
there for six seconds seems like forever

639
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:17,010
when there's 10 people in line behind

640
00:23:17,010 --> 00:23:18,480
you that think we're gonna see the first

641
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,430
fights coming out pretty soon it's

642
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:22,080
probably going to be on cops and i'm

643
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,430
sure it's gonna be down in pinellas park

644
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:24,540
florida because that's where everybody

645
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:25,620
is and the guys going to have no shirt

646
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:27,240
on and it's always said you have to be

647
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,130
if you want to be in cops and it's going

648
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:30,600
to be a fight about people get stuck in

649
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,650
line for these things so why are we

650
00:23:31,650 --> 00:23:33,720
doing this because we got this chip and

651
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:37,230
pin thing it's not really pin it's not

652
00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:38,820
while the chip we call it formerly

653
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:41,910
europay MasterCard and Visa EMV no to

654
00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:43,500
get the first billing and it's

655
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,330
alphabetical know as Europe a is driven

656
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:45,970
by the Europe

657
00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:47,920
it's been the standard there for several

658
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:50,230
years up in Canada now for about seven

659
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:51,670
years actually I guess eight and a half

660
00:23:51,670 --> 00:23:53,700
of the exchange rate but in any case

661
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:56,770
we're finding that 92 the 20 countries

662
00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:59,170
use Chip and PIN except for the US where

663
00:23:59,170 --> 00:24:00,910
a special we're different we're going to

664
00:24:00,910 --> 00:24:03,130
go to chip and pin when when we go to

665
00:24:03,130 --> 00:24:05,530
the metric system cuz we're America yeah

666
00:24:05,530 --> 00:24:09,070
we know better right so I ask the

667
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:10,210
Europeans I was over there a couple

668
00:24:10,210 --> 00:24:12,760
times in the last two months oh why do

669
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:14,230
we do you Americans you love criminals

670
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:15,760
what do you mean you make movies about

671
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:18,280
them you elect them to public office I

672
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:20,700
mean it's it's it's an American thing

673
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:23,440
okay what else oh we got much worse

674
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,360
fraud no we already saw the statistics

675
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,100
it's much worse than us they're more

676
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:29,020
security conscious in Americans I don't

677
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:30,220
know you guys had more wars in last

678
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:31,300
century then you have although we're

679
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:33,240
trying to do our best to catch up

680
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,900
Europeans are smarter than Americans

681
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:36,100
I'll let you decide that for yourself

682
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:38,200
but let's look at the real reason why

683
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,270
this thing took off back in the United

684
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:41,470
States when you want to get a new phone

685
00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:43,600
line 25 years ago what you do you called

686
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,700
up one of the baby bells or even before

687
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:47,230
the Bell System got broken up by Judge

688
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:50,350
green call up AT&T hey it's Tuesday you

689
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:52,870
got a new phone line by Friday so you

690
00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:55,270
can take these new online credit card

691
00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:57,460
checking things over in Europe though

692
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:59,440
they're running through PTT postal

693
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,810
telephone and telegraph PTT is one of

694
00:25:01,810 --> 00:25:03,940
those ossified government organizations

695
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:05,770
it takes forever to get something done

696
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:07,780
and so you talk to somebody who grew up

697
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:09,580
over in France or Germany or Italy or

698
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:11,200
something like that back in the 70s or

699
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,410
it would take you six to eight months

700
00:25:13,410 --> 00:25:15,310
seriously no kidding you get a new phone

701
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:17,230
line in well you can't do that you can't

702
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:20,350
scale these little onion skin revocation

703
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:22,180
list because you'd be setting out phone

704
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:24,790
books every week and so they had to come

705
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:26,350
up with something else so the idea was

706
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:27,520
we're going to bite the bullet we're

707
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,410
going to pay about ten times as much for

708
00:25:29,410 --> 00:25:31,450
the card and we're going to put into the

709
00:25:31,450 --> 00:25:33,400
hands of the merchants a way that they

710
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:37,570
can validate that the cardholder and the

711
00:25:37,570 --> 00:25:40,750
card itself have a shared common secret

712
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:42,670
and that's really all we're talking

713
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:45,400
about by the way the software is written

714
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:48,490
in Java for those of us who think that's

715
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:49,960
a really fun idea here's an interesting

716
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:52,150
project for next year anyway wants to

717
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:53,110
work with me on a research project

718
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:54,970
looking at the code and trying to see

719
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:57,090
because how are you going to patch a

720
00:25:57,090 --> 00:25:59,000
credit card

721
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,310
I mean we talk about the Internet of

722
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:03,560
Things we're already into here but a lot

723
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:05,090
of our money's tied up in this stuff

724
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:06,800
here when you insert into a reader the

725
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,540
device interrogate sit and then I asked

726
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:09,650
for the user so if you go to Europe it's

727
00:26:09,650 --> 00:26:10,730
kind of nice because your card never

728
00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:12,740
goes in the back room we don't see some

729
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:14,360
shifty-looking person go back there

730
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:16,220
skimming it a bunch of times they bring

731
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:17,780
a little machine out there you put it in

732
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:19,580
your peepee poo-poo and now you're in

733
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:22,130
cool well why can't we do that in

734
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:24,700
America well because we're Americans

735
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:27,800
besides what does it not do it doesn't

736
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,000
prove that there's any balance on the

737
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,580
card for example if it was a debit card

738
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:33,680
you don't know if his money it doesn't

739
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,600
prove necessarily if the cards even

740
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,580
valid if maybe it's been revoked it

741
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:39,050
doesn't prove that has been part of a

742
00:26:39,050 --> 00:26:43,790
large time of fraud because and it

743
00:26:43,790 --> 00:26:45,680
doesn't really check for anything if

744
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,360
your card not present because we don't

745
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,860
have e-commerce back in nineteen ninety

746
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:53,900
all he had was what 1 800 flowers and

747
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:55,070
like you're really gonna send flowers

748
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:56,360
your grandma with a stolen credit card

749
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:58,190
that's going to work like really welcome

750
00:26:58,190 --> 00:27:02,660
time for reading the will so it doesn't

751
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:04,580
do any of these things but what it did

752
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:07,820
do is it solved a different problem back

753
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:10,270
then it allowed them to go ahead and do

754
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:15,140
computer sort of verification of what

755
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:17,780
that the cardholder and the card itself

756
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:20,390
shared a common secret of pin that's it

757
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:23,090
which is good when somebody stole one

758
00:27:23,090 --> 00:27:26,600
card but what happens if these still 20

759
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,160
million cards see it doesn't scale very

760
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:30,620
well or when you think about why would

761
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:33,230
you even do that today well if you're in

762
00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:35,240
the payment card industry and if your

763
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:36,710
abuse or MasterCard you're making these

764
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:38,810
ridiculous profits good idea though we

765
00:27:38,810 --> 00:27:41,630
got a monopoly and now you've got things

766
00:27:41,630 --> 00:27:43,310
like alternative forms of payment

767
00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:47,390
Bitcoin currency Apple pay Samsung pay I

768
00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:49,460
think JP Morgan Chase just announced

769
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:51,530
there is this past week a new form of

770
00:27:51,530 --> 00:27:53,090
electronic payment we're going to see a

771
00:27:53,090 --> 00:27:55,520
whole sea of payment forms that are

772
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,920
going to potentially rock this industry

773
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,930
to the core because remember who's

774
00:27:59,930 --> 00:28:01,340
driving this it's Visa and MasterCard

775
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:04,100
who are driving the shift they want to

776
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:06,050
show something anything out to the user

777
00:28:06,050 --> 00:28:08,330
the consumer to show that hey somebody's

778
00:28:08,330 --> 00:28:10,429
doing something but the reality is is

779
00:28:10,429 --> 00:28:12,530
that although there's a lot of fraud

780
00:28:12,530 --> 00:28:12,950
being

781
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:16,190
lost Visa and MasterCard technically

782
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:18,889
make money on fraud and a certain odd

783
00:28:18,889 --> 00:28:21,260
extent banks because they get such a big

784
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:22,820
percentage if you have a merchant bank

785
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:24,470
where you pay in three to five percent

786
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:26,059
to process anything from a visa or

787
00:28:26,059 --> 00:28:28,250
mastercard up to an amex but we don't

788
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:30,559
have three to five percent fraud fraud

789
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:32,840
really is around 10 9 to 10 basis points

790
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:37,029
point zero zero nine and say a point

791
00:28:37,029 --> 00:28:40,220
zero nine percent so how do you justify

792
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:42,919
three percent you make money on the

793
00:28:42,919 --> 00:28:44,450
fraud because you can convince the

794
00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:46,190
regulator is not to regulate us it's a

795
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:49,130
whole interesting system that if we

796
00:28:49,130 --> 00:28:51,710
drove the fraud out or very low you

797
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:53,779
couldn't support those rates anymore and

798
00:28:53,779 --> 00:28:55,039
you'd have to lower your rates which

799
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:56,330
would lower the cost to merchants which

800
00:28:56,330 --> 00:28:59,179
would lower your prices now as we get to

801
00:28:59,179 --> 00:29:01,190
this October first deadline in other

802
00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:02,960
word past that we found out that it was

803
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:05,269
a big thing was like y2k it's like okay

804
00:29:05,269 --> 00:29:07,610
what happened not a whole lot but we

805
00:29:07,610 --> 00:29:09,230
find out that a lot of efforts were made

806
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:11,360
to try to go ahead and steal stuff so

807
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,500
let's take a quick look at a couple he

808
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:15,590
snakes target 40 million cars stolen so

809
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:16,789
guys stole the cards what's it going to

810
00:29:16,789 --> 00:29:18,429
do is he got a cache about himself

811
00:29:18,429 --> 00:29:20,990
seriously no way what do you do if you

812
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:22,250
take all these cards and you're going to

813
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:24,049
sell them off to some criminal gang so

814
00:29:24,049 --> 00:29:25,549
we get someone like Al here he's going

815
00:29:25,549 --> 00:29:26,570
to stand in there for a criminal gang

816
00:29:26,570 --> 00:29:29,149
leader and Ellen is going to buy a whole

817
00:29:29,149 --> 00:29:31,549
bunch of cards and in fact lots of gangs

818
00:29:31,549 --> 00:29:33,260
going to buy lots of cards and then all

819
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:34,789
these cards worked away into circulation

820
00:29:34,789 --> 00:29:36,679
see what you're starting to see here now

821
00:29:36,679 --> 00:29:38,630
for the first time is there is an

822
00:29:38,630 --> 00:29:40,789
ecosystem there is an entire underground

823
00:29:40,789 --> 00:29:43,070
economy that starts not even with this

824
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:45,110
but the person who wrote the malware who

825
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:47,960
first did the memory scraping selling it

826
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:50,029
a person implemented it who then sells

827
00:29:50,029 --> 00:29:52,100
the cards often the batches of to a

828
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:54,980
major website like a rescatar and yet

829
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:57,320
before I remind myself I got should have

830
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:58,700
some websites here yeah if you go to

831
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:00,679
their underground site here anybody

832
00:30:00,679 --> 00:30:04,039
recognize this fine gentleman here Brian

833
00:30:04,039 --> 00:30:06,769
Krebs yeah John's a great security blog

834
00:30:06,769 --> 00:30:07,970
I'd like to meet the guy lives right

835
00:30:07,970 --> 00:30:09,409
here in Northern Virginia although it's

836
00:30:09,409 --> 00:30:12,049
interesting because in his exposé about

837
00:30:12,049 --> 00:30:14,179
yo I'm in the underground hack hacking

838
00:30:14,179 --> 00:30:16,010
your stuff and learning your wares he's

839
00:30:16,010 --> 00:30:17,539
publishing all this and he's actually

840
00:30:17,539 --> 00:30:19,580
pointing out to the criminals some other

841
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:22,070
operational security errors and failures

842
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:24,230
so what are the crooks doin they're

843
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:26,630
fixing it so although

844
00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:28,820
they don't seem to like him to a certain

845
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:30,680
extent he's kind of a hero of the soviet

846
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:33,710
union because he is enabling the

847
00:30:33,710 --> 00:30:36,200
criminals to get free consulting to fix

848
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,700
their errors and now the banks are

849
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:39,200
paying millions more trying to fix the

850
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,570
stuff you go to their website refund and

851
00:30:41,570 --> 00:30:44,000
replace policy they move around a little

852
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,530
bit because yeah they're technically

853
00:30:45,530 --> 00:30:47,480
extra legal but if you pay your host

854
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,830
country the right amount of money you

855
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:50,780
get to stick around for a while and you

856
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:52,250
can go look for car it's hard to see in

857
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:53,330
the back of the room that'll teach you

858
00:30:53,330 --> 00:30:54,470
to pretend you're encouraged you should

859
00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:57,380
have SAT up front but you can find here

860
00:30:57,380 --> 00:31:00,530
cards $10 17 bucks six dollars why

861
00:31:00,530 --> 00:31:01,880
because that chase card was getting

862
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,200
ready to expire at the end of the month

863
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,940
but what they have is they give you the

864
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:06,770
individual dumps the batches that they

865
00:31:06,770 --> 00:31:07,790
came out of and they give you a

866
00:31:07,790 --> 00:31:09,560
percentage because when the target stuff

867
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:11,150
first came out they're rated at one

868
00:31:11,150 --> 00:31:13,100
hundred percent why because none of the

869
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:15,290
bank's none of the merchants none of the

870
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:16,490
card holders knew their card was

871
00:31:16,490 --> 00:31:17,990
compromised you had a hundred percent

872
00:31:17,990 --> 00:31:20,480
chance of that card being good if you

873
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:23,030
bought it early on they're still for

874
00:31:23,030 --> 00:31:25,250
sale they're down around thirty percent

875
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:27,140
or so because what's happened after year

876
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:28,550
and a half a lot of these cards age

877
00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:30,200
because typically you three years old so

878
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,060
to statistically fifty percent are dead

879
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:33,890
bigger banks just bit the bullet

880
00:31:33,890 --> 00:31:35,510
reissued it but smaller banks credit

881
00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:37,520
unions and things like that little bit

882
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:39,350
concerned about the fixed cost of

883
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:41,570
reissuing cards depending upon how big

884
00:31:41,570 --> 00:31:42,950
you are it could be anywhere from three

885
00:31:42,950 --> 00:31:45,110
to twelve dollars to reissue the card

886
00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:46,340
send it out in the mail so they just

887
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:47,300
saying you know we're going to suck it

888
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:50,690
up and take our chances and some banks

889
00:31:50,690 --> 00:31:51,860
has turned out to be a multi-million

890
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:53,690
dollar decision error but you can

891
00:31:53,690 --> 00:31:57,700
actually get here zip code city state

892
00:31:57,700 --> 00:32:00,320
the last four digits I was searching for

893
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,090
specific last for did used to match one

894
00:32:02,090 --> 00:32:04,130
of my card the first six digits or

895
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:05,150
what's called tube in the back

896
00:32:05,150 --> 00:32:06,980
identification number so one of the

897
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:08,270
things that Brian was pointing out is

898
00:32:08,270 --> 00:32:10,310
said hey with the first six digits for

899
00:32:10,310 --> 00:32:12,080
the bin knowing the bank knowing the

900
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:14,480
last four digits knowing the city in the

901
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,580
state in the zip code do you think you

902
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:18,260
could triangulate on your customers and

903
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:19,640
figure out which ones are for sale and

904
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:21,980
then preemptively kill them right why

905
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:23,420
would you point this out to the

906
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:26,000
criminals okay this is an operational

907
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,560
security error that they've been making

908
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:31,040
that has allowed clever banks to spot

909
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:32,750
stuff like that now you don't want to

910
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:34,190
kill them all or some little reverse

911
00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:36,440
engineer what you're doing so again this

912
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:37,580
is a little game that you're playing

913
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:39,020
where you're trying to go ahead and

914
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:39,770
you're trying to

915
00:32:39,770 --> 00:32:42,560
op them a little bit at a time do it in

916
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,420
a strategy so that they're not going to

917
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:46,490
figure out exactly how do you know what

918
00:32:46,490 --> 00:32:48,140
you know you go back and you look at

919
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:51,980
World War two in the Enigma and the

920
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:53,990
challenge that came up for the Britain

921
00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:56,090
when they learned that the Germans were

922
00:32:56,090 --> 00:32:58,430
going to bomb Coventry fire bomb killing

923
00:32:58,430 --> 00:32:59,900
hundreds maybe thousands of their

924
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:02,750
citizens what do you do do you evacuate

925
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:04,910
the city and let the Nazis know that you

926
00:33:04,910 --> 00:33:06,440
can crack their code at which point you

927
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:08,030
never read another message or do you

928
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:10,760
take the hit and these are that's why

929
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:11,990
you get paid the big bucks right but

930
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:13,460
those are tough problems that's life and

931
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:15,470
death but you got to start thinking the

932
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:16,820
same way in this type of is because this

933
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:18,890
is economic warfare this is huge so

934
00:33:18,890 --> 00:33:19,970
criminals that get around with these low

935
00:33:19,970 --> 00:33:21,440
value tests they said you had years to

936
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,790
go ahead and poke around to these things

937
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:24,890
and figure out what will work so here's

938
00:33:24,890 --> 00:33:26,870
this ecosystem I was talking about what

939
00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:28,760
happens is is that you buy the card you

940
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:30,560
steal them you sell to the next guy cell

941
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:32,630
to the next guy cell to the next guy why

942
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:35,240
are you ever going to buy a cyst of

943
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:36,890
stolen credit cards it could be revoked

944
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:39,590
at any time by the bank you what do you

945
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:40,610
want to make sure that they're going to

946
00:33:40,610 --> 00:33:42,290
do they're still going to work right so

947
00:33:42,290 --> 00:33:43,070
how do you know they're still going to

948
00:33:43,070 --> 00:33:45,340
work you run this little micro test

949
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:48,440
because I understand if I get a call

950
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:50,210
from my bag you know we just cancel your

951
00:33:50,210 --> 00:33:51,410
guard cuz someone trying to spend eight

952
00:33:51,410 --> 00:33:52,970
hundred and fifty seven dollars over in

953
00:33:52,970 --> 00:33:55,160
London okay got it but they said you

954
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,660
know we cancel your carrot cuz somebody

955
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:58,010
spend a dollar thirty seven at a

956
00:33:58,010 --> 00:34:00,740
starbucks seriously you back guys are

957
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:02,900
nuts but so what do you know you run a

958
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:04,940
little test like in starbucks and you

959
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:06,110
run it through hotel tests we've

960
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:08,060
literally catalog a couple thousands of

961
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:09,949
these tests which allow you then to go

962
00:34:09,949 --> 00:34:11,239
ahead and run under the radar because

963
00:34:11,239 --> 00:34:12,649
you do a little test early on and then

964
00:34:12,649 --> 00:34:15,350
what do you do you void it out you

965
00:34:15,350 --> 00:34:17,780
cancel the transaction so what happens

966
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:19,639
the bank pays nothing because the

967
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:21,199
merchant doesn't get money the merchant

968
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:22,370
might have had their credential stolen

969
00:34:22,370 --> 00:34:23,780
they don't know what's going are the

970
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:25,219
cardholder sees nothing on your

971
00:34:25,219 --> 00:34:28,280
statement nothing happened except for

972
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:30,949
what so this guy selling you the packing

973
00:34:30,949 --> 00:34:32,090
stack of cards you take this hundred

974
00:34:32,090 --> 00:34:33,980
cards you run a little test run a little

975
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:35,600
test run a little test other hundred

976
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:38,510
cards a hundred work or 98 or 50 it's

977
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:39,560
like I guess in the movies you see them

978
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:40,880
doing the heroin packets they're always

979
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,800
like tasting it I don't know what

980
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,719
heroines supposed to taste like I mean I

981
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:46,550
maybe they're just taking sure it's not

982
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:48,139
powdered sugar or something or powdered

983
00:34:48,139 --> 00:34:49,460
milk I don't know but it's sort of like

984
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:51,560
tasting the credit card numbers so

985
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:53,139
anyway what they'll do is

986
00:34:53,139 --> 00:34:56,079
now the bank doesn't see this the bank

987
00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:57,849
doesn't see that they get no visibility

988
00:34:57,849 --> 00:34:59,529
to list boom this cash out at the end

989
00:34:59,529 --> 00:35:01,029
here's a crazy thing people seem to

990
00:35:01,029 --> 00:35:02,500
think that a car gets stolen and gets

991
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:04,240
used a few minutes later it could be

992
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:06,010
weeks and sometimes months we've seen

993
00:35:06,010 --> 00:35:08,619
cards in the underground for over a year

994
00:35:08,619 --> 00:35:10,510
work on their way through the system

995
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:12,970
it's old stock it still sells but hey if

996
00:35:12,970 --> 00:35:15,880
the validity rate on this batch is down

997
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,650
to twenty percent your may only paying a

998
00:35:17,650 --> 00:35:19,150
few pennies per card instead of a couple

999
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:20,950
bucks it's worth it to give it a try

1000
00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:22,260
particularly if you're doing online

1001
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:24,190
because what's your risk no one's going

1002
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:25,510
to arrest you especially be coming

1003
00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:27,730
through tor so what not what happens to

1004
00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:29,710
do is the big challenges trying to

1005
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:31,809
figure out can we spot these tests and

1006
00:35:31,809 --> 00:35:34,359
kill the cards before the cash out that

1007
00:35:34,359 --> 00:35:35,920
way we can figure that stuff that's kind

1008
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,180
of the problem I've been focusing on

1009
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:38,710
here this is not a sales pitch because

1010
00:35:38,710 --> 00:35:40,359
i'm outside now with my computer

1011
00:35:40,359 --> 00:35:42,069
security world working on bank stuff but

1012
00:35:42,069 --> 00:35:43,660
it's a really fun problem to take the

1013
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:45,339
way that we think about problems and

1014
00:35:45,339 --> 00:35:48,099
apply it to different areas of industry

1015
00:35:48,099 --> 00:35:50,650
so the current problem is what we try to

1016
00:35:50,650 --> 00:35:53,049
profile users hey users are difficult to

1017
00:35:53,049 --> 00:35:54,819
profile why because they do anomalous

1018
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:56,740
things for humans so do you ever get a

1019
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:58,869
call from your bank or difficult rands

1020
00:35:58,869 --> 00:36:01,269
actually didn't work yeah that's a false

1021
00:36:01,269 --> 00:36:03,400
positive okay what's the problem with a

1022
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,170
false positive well they're annoying and

1023
00:36:05,170 --> 00:36:06,549
they're embarrassing hey I've been doing

1024
00:36:06,549 --> 00:36:07,809
a start-up which means I'm eating it

1025
00:36:07,809 --> 00:36:11,079
things like subway all day long now I'm

1026
00:36:11,079 --> 00:36:12,339
finally getting an important meeting

1027
00:36:12,339 --> 00:36:13,809
with some back and take them out to like

1028
00:36:13,809 --> 00:36:16,359
a fancy French restaurant trying to wine

1029
00:36:16,359 --> 00:36:18,549
and dine this client and then the waiter

1030
00:36:18,549 --> 00:36:21,309
comes back and says a credit card has

1031
00:36:21,309 --> 00:36:23,980
been declined yeah as only a French

1032
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:25,960
waiter could say pardon my french accent

1033
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:28,750
there but what comes out of that is what

1034
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:30,579
you're horribly embarrassed and what we

1035
00:36:30,579 --> 00:36:32,049
find out is a big percentage of

1036
00:36:32,049 --> 00:36:33,549
customers who just take that card either

1037
00:36:33,549 --> 00:36:34,779
never use it again or stick it in the

1038
00:36:34,779 --> 00:36:38,109
back of the wallet what card vendors

1039
00:36:38,109 --> 00:36:39,519
want you to have them on in front of the

1040
00:36:39,519 --> 00:36:41,890
wall they want their card to be first

1041
00:36:41,890 --> 00:36:43,630
there so what's in your wallet by the

1042
00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:45,190
way I did bring a card reader so we

1043
00:36:45,190 --> 00:36:46,630
could do some scanning remind me to do

1044
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:47,890
this I'll show you some cool stuff and

1045
00:36:47,890 --> 00:36:50,500
some frightening stuff as well but

1046
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:52,420
imagine trying your kid comes home with

1047
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:54,700
a box of crickets or cockroaches and

1048
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:56,380
you've got 500 of them do you want to

1049
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:57,970
find out two hours later and then case

1050
00:36:57,970 --> 00:36:59,289
them all around the house or do you want

1051
00:36:59,289 --> 00:37:00,730
to get the kid on the front doorstep no

1052
00:37:00,730 --> 00:37:01,990
young man you train around get rid of

1053
00:37:01,990 --> 00:37:03,519
that thing and so that's the whole idea

1054
00:37:03,519 --> 00:37:05,349
is trying to change this entire fraud

1055
00:37:05,349 --> 00:37:06,619
paradigm around

1056
00:37:06,619 --> 00:37:08,359
now what we look at this false positive

1057
00:37:08,359 --> 00:37:11,569
huge amount of lost sales by the way 13

1058
00:37:11,569 --> 00:37:15,619
times the cost of false negatives if we

1059
00:37:15,619 --> 00:37:19,609
lose 12 billion de card fraud but we

1060
00:37:19,609 --> 00:37:21,799
give up a hundred and eighteen billion

1061
00:37:21,799 --> 00:37:26,599
in false positive fraud because it's not

1062
00:37:26,599 --> 00:37:28,249
really fraud it's just denied

1063
00:37:28,249 --> 00:37:30,019
transaction this is deals that just

1064
00:37:30,019 --> 00:37:31,789
don't go through that's huge impact and

1065
00:37:31,789 --> 00:37:34,430
so as they say people stop trying and so

1066
00:37:34,430 --> 00:37:37,460
here's a challenge where's where's the

1067
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:38,900
fraud in there there are two fraudulent

1068
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:40,460
transactions on that screen it's a big

1069
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:41,839
data dump yes I'm stating to take a

1070
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:43,249
picture good luck with the resolution

1071
00:37:43,249 --> 00:37:46,220
but and yes I did change the card

1072
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:48,170
numbers to protect the innocent but this

1073
00:37:48,170 --> 00:37:49,999
stuff comes pouring in if you're a major

1074
00:37:49,999 --> 00:37:51,890
bank you might be getting literally

1075
00:37:51,890 --> 00:37:54,140
millions of transactions every 24 hours

1076
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:57,200
we hate to be cliche you throw a big

1077
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:59,480
data but in a way it's that sort of a

1078
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:01,190
problem you're trying to look at this

1079
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:03,380
big huge stream of information and

1080
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:05,839
typically what financial companies do is

1081
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:07,880
you look at it at the instant it comes

1082
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:10,249
in because you've got a small amount of

1083
00:38:10,249 --> 00:38:12,079
time to make a decision now in this case

1084
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:13,369
well we've done is we taking a little

1085
00:38:13,369 --> 00:38:15,019
different look we said hey wait a minute

1086
00:38:15,019 --> 00:38:16,519
instead of just looking at a transaction

1087
00:38:16,519 --> 00:38:18,170
good or bad is this grandma she and Ohio

1088
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:20,900
is it a small transaction that's fast

1089
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:24,890
set of rules now we say who else are you

1090
00:38:24,890 --> 00:38:26,989
shopping with because if you're doing

1091
00:38:26,989 --> 00:38:29,480
card fraud it doesn't scale very well if

1092
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:32,089
you're only doing one car at a time by

1093
00:38:32,089 --> 00:38:34,789
that I mean that if I got to go online

1094
00:38:34,789 --> 00:38:37,160
steal one card get in the car drive down

1095
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:38,930
Walmart go buy a gift card then run back

1096
00:38:38,930 --> 00:38:42,019
go ahead by another stunt no you take 50

1097
00:38:42,019 --> 00:38:43,400
at a time or if you're on the

1098
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,539
wholesaling you're going to do it

1099
00:38:44,539 --> 00:38:46,970
literally thousand or up to a million at

1100
00:38:46,970 --> 00:38:48,920
a time huge blocks of the stuff move

1101
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:51,349
around and now what we find out is this

1102
00:38:51,349 --> 00:38:52,849
particular card we were tracking went

1103
00:38:52,849 --> 00:38:55,279
shopping in six different places that

1104
00:38:55,279 --> 00:38:58,160
was very suspicious why because there's

1105
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:00,049
nothing because the card had already

1106
00:39:00,049 --> 00:39:02,450
been killed it was a dead card this is a

1107
00:39:02,450 --> 00:39:04,849
zombie the cardholder had already had

1108
00:39:04,849 --> 00:39:06,589
their card reissued they cut up the old

1109
00:39:06,589 --> 00:39:08,809
card threw it away and yet the card is

1110
00:39:08,809 --> 00:39:11,359
still out shopping how could that be

1111
00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:14,180
because not all crooks are very careful

1112
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:15,920
and sometimes people kind of really

1113
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,089
never know that car that didn't work

1114
00:39:17,089 --> 00:39:18,890
last week maybe the card older put money

1115
00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:20,570
on to it so what we did that

1116
00:39:20,570 --> 00:39:22,430
as we said hey let's take a look it kind

1117
00:39:22,430 --> 00:39:25,490
of a guilt by association and we found

1118
00:39:25,490 --> 00:39:28,100
out that there was same card it was used

1119
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:30,860
here with 50 other cards all in a very

1120
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:32,930
short period of time all for the

1121
00:39:32,930 --> 00:39:35,660
identical transaction and what does that

1122
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:38,270
tell you those other 50 cards are all

1123
00:39:38,270 --> 00:39:39,800
stolen we didn't know about any of them

1124
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:41,840
it turns out there's a Coke machine in

1125
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:43,430
one in particular part of California

1126
00:39:43,430 --> 00:39:45,500
it's on a loading dock and about once a

1127
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:47,510
week I think it's fridays nights around

1128
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:50,780
10pm must be a bus 50 people from around

1129
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:52,850
America line up in front of that Coke

1130
00:39:52,850 --> 00:39:55,130
machine and they all by exactly one coke

1131
00:39:55,130 --> 00:39:57,500
at about 20 second intervals what's

1132
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:59,960
going on here right somebody's got a new

1133
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:01,910
stack of cards and by the way remember

1134
00:40:01,910 --> 00:40:03,800
that food chain that we saw that's not

1135
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:06,320
somebody up here because they were going

1136
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,580
to reverse it you can't reverse the

1137
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:09,620
purchase of a coke so this is somebody

1138
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:11,360
who's getting ready to drive down to the

1139
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:13,550
store and cash out and when you cash out

1140
00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:16,970
what are you gonna buy best thing you

1141
00:40:16,970 --> 00:40:19,010
buy as a gift card why because then you

1142
00:40:19,010 --> 00:40:20,690
can fence the gift card and you broken

1143
00:40:20,690 --> 00:40:22,520
you laundered the money yeah you can buy

1144
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:23,840
merchandise that you got to return the

1145
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:26,000
merchandise I lost my receipt then we'll

1146
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,370
have to give you a gift card okay that's

1147
00:40:28,370 --> 00:40:31,820
a good thing here is what most people

1148
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:33,080
don't understand what's happening in

1149
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:35,270
there is that when I go to a merchant I

1150
00:40:35,270 --> 00:40:36,920
go shopping there's an order system or I

1151
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:38,450
could just be a point-of-sale that

1152
00:40:38,450 --> 00:40:40,280
information then gets sent to their

1153
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:41,840
merchant bank they have an acquiring

1154
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,490
bank that may then go through a payment

1155
00:40:43,490 --> 00:40:45,320
processor sort of aggregates all that

1156
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:47,960
which then gets into your switch visa

1157
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:50,210
mastercard discover american express etc

1158
00:40:50,210 --> 00:40:51,980
thats which then sends over to the

1159
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:53,630
issuing bank which will authorize it

1160
00:40:53,630 --> 00:40:56,150
send it back up here account check it

1161
00:40:56,150 --> 00:40:58,430
validated come back that's about a 3-2

1162
00:40:58,430 --> 00:41:01,280
for second round trip so when you swipe

1163
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:03,920
your card or now dip your card is the

1164
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:06,770
correct term is the verb that's what's

1165
00:41:06,770 --> 00:41:09,860
happening but what it mean what's banks

1166
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:10,940
every also been when they've been

1167
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:14,900
waiting from this 3 6 10 12 month cycle

1168
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:16,760
of things getting stolen to the last

1169
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:19,400
three seconds to take a look seriously

1170
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:21,260
it's like why do you want to wait till

1171
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:22,940
the bullets already in the air before

1172
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:24,680
you decide there's a sniper out there

1173
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:26,420
maybe you should do a little bit

1174
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:27,890
preemptive stuff as well so if you

1175
00:41:27,890 --> 00:41:30,050
understand this ecosystem you can also

1176
00:41:30,050 --> 00:41:32,630
see where you can go do stuff and now if

1177
00:41:32,630 --> 00:41:34,250
you understand how people work we find

1178
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:35,570
that all these different tests that are

1179
00:41:35,570 --> 00:41:36,740
out there he said we found a couple

1180
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:39,110
thousands of them have different

1181
00:41:39,110 --> 00:41:42,560
visibilities so I met a hotel hotel

1182
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,840
tests are great because hotels when you

1183
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:46,490
check in even if your room is prepaid

1184
00:41:46,490 --> 00:41:47,930
what do they want I carried for

1185
00:41:47,930 --> 00:41:50,360
incidentals do they charge your card no

1186
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:51,250
they do what they call a

1187
00:41:51,250 --> 00:41:55,690
pre-authorization what a pre off does is

1188
00:41:55,690 --> 00:41:58,850
it says hey I'm going to pre-authorize

1189
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:00,110
two hundred dollars so if you walk out

1190
00:42:00,110 --> 00:42:01,340
of here and we find out you empty the

1191
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:02,690
minibar because he had the munchies or

1192
00:42:02,690 --> 00:42:03,800
something like that because it's an

1193
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:06,920
Oregon or Washington or Denver they

1194
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:08,120
might sell a lot in the minibar these

1195
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:11,060
days I still have that girl scout it

1196
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:12,260
made a fortune selling cookies outside

1197
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:13,640
of marijuana shop and they kind of

1198
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:16,070
called following says come on in any

1199
00:42:16,070 --> 00:42:18,620
case they get their money if you check

1200
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:21,440
in get your pre off done on monday and

1201
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:23,000
then on tuesday you cancel your card

1202
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,310
saying it was stolen the hotel still

1203
00:42:25,310 --> 00:42:26,840
gets their money because they have

1204
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:28,610
locked out that money which is why you

1205
00:42:28,610 --> 00:42:29,840
don't want to use a debit card to rent a

1206
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:31,280
car because they're gonna block out like

1207
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:32,780
fifty thousand dollars or something like

1208
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:35,020
that you get it back two weeks later

1209
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:37,130
fake merchants course you won't see that

1210
00:42:37,130 --> 00:42:38,870
card verify brute force i'm not gonna go

1211
00:42:38,870 --> 00:42:40,250
into the details in the chart the whole

1212
00:42:40,250 --> 00:42:41,780
idea is there's a lot of different ways

1213
00:42:41,780 --> 00:42:43,640
you can look at this stuff and remember

1214
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:45,170
if you're a crooked you've been doing

1215
00:42:45,170 --> 00:42:46,880
this for a couple years you share it you

1216
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:48,410
put out there on YouTube videos you put

1217
00:42:48,410 --> 00:42:50,180
it in onion there's all kinds of places

1218
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:51,890
you can go ahead and get resources to

1219
00:42:51,890 --> 00:42:53,660
learn how to do card fraud and get good

1220
00:42:53,660 --> 00:42:56,090
at it and what we're doing is we are

1221
00:42:56,090 --> 00:42:57,470
saying hey wait a minute this is a link

1222
00:42:57,470 --> 00:42:59,420
analysis problem isn't it instead of

1223
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:00,950
looking at it one dimensional images

1224
00:43:00,950 --> 00:43:02,810
here's your card and every time your

1225
00:43:02,810 --> 00:43:04,460
card is presented for a new transaction

1226
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:06,920
we make a one-time decision does this

1227
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:10,250
look like you so 50 people go into that

1228
00:43:10,250 --> 00:43:12,980
Coke machine have what 50 people that

1229
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:14,960
are all being asked do you look like you

1230
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:16,460
while buying a coke is not that unusual

1231
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:19,130
so they all go through never triggers an

1232
00:43:19,130 --> 00:43:21,560
alarm nobody's saying 50 people from

1233
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:22,700
around the country going to the same

1234
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:24,380
coke machine should trigger an alarm and

1235
00:43:24,380 --> 00:43:26,150
oh by the way let's pull back on that

1236
00:43:26,150 --> 00:43:29,180
and now because of PCI DSS the data

1237
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:30,860
security standards banks can't share

1238
00:43:30,860 --> 00:43:32,150
certain data you're not allowed to

1239
00:43:32,150 --> 00:43:34,700
crooks can share it kind of weird world

1240
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:36,110
so all these things linked together

1241
00:43:36,110 --> 00:43:38,480
here's a real example again change a

1242
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:39,620
little bit of the data to make sure that

1243
00:43:39,620 --> 00:43:42,590
it was anonymized but think about that

1244
00:43:42,590 --> 00:43:46,010
ecosystem legitimate card holder in June

1245
00:43:46,010 --> 00:43:47,900
goes amazon gets a one dollar

1246
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:50,029
authorization that is reversed in seven

1247
00:43:50,029 --> 00:43:51,770
minutes later there's $11 charge live

1248
00:43:51,770 --> 00:43:55,130
real or fraud that's real because that's

1249
00:43:55,130 --> 00:43:56,420
what Amazon does you enter a car they're

1250
00:43:56,420 --> 00:43:57,829
going to say does this thing work and if

1251
00:43:57,829 --> 00:43:58,940
it does work they let you go to check

1252
00:43:58,940 --> 00:43:59,930
out if it doesn't work they don't let

1253
00:43:59,930 --> 00:44:02,359
you go to check out number two now four

1254
00:44:02,359 --> 00:44:04,520
days later Apple online to dollar charge

1255
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:08,990
good sure why not now a month later they

1256
00:44:08,990 --> 00:44:11,000
say Cabela's what sets boarding goods

1257
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,010
store yeah $12 sixty-six cents

1258
00:44:13,010 --> 00:44:16,910
authorization that is reversed hmm no

1259
00:44:16,910 --> 00:44:20,150
harm no foul so far but then the

1260
00:44:20,150 --> 00:44:22,089
following month we see a holiday in

1261
00:44:22,089 --> 00:44:24,109
seven dollar eighty two cent

1262
00:44:24,109 --> 00:44:29,599
pre-authorization also reversed and then

1263
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:31,700
two weeks later a gymboree for seven

1264
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:33,470
dollars it's approved and then a few

1265
00:44:33,470 --> 00:44:36,710
minutes later euro car parts 448 bucks

1266
00:44:36,710 --> 00:44:39,349
works Eurostar 110 bucks works punky

1267
00:44:39,349 --> 00:44:41,750
fish 695 buck Bam Bam Bam Bam but they

1268
00:44:41,750 --> 00:44:43,190
have to have her in that debit card

1269
00:44:43,190 --> 00:44:45,049
within a matter of seconds they've

1270
00:44:45,049 --> 00:44:46,099
emptied out almost twelve hundred

1271
00:44:46,099 --> 00:44:48,819
dollars out of their card maxed it out

1272
00:44:48,819 --> 00:44:51,349
now let's do a little bit of analysis

1273
00:44:51,349 --> 00:44:53,270
here what we think we know about what's

1274
00:44:53,270 --> 00:44:56,059
going on is it the same crook doing all

1275
00:44:56,059 --> 00:44:57,980
this stuff no because they got a

1276
00:44:57,980 --> 00:44:59,029
different mo because we found another

1277
00:44:59,029 --> 00:45:03,289
card just had two charges on it the same

1278
00:45:03,289 --> 00:45:07,069
date a cabela's almost the same time for

1279
00:45:07,069 --> 00:45:08,660
the same amount twelve dollars and

1280
00:45:08,660 --> 00:45:10,520
sixty-six cents what does that tell you

1281
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:12,670
that that crook is the same person

1282
00:45:12,670 --> 00:45:14,869
because they do the same merchant for

1283
00:45:14,869 --> 00:45:18,289
the same amount now at 20-8 august at

1284
00:45:18,289 --> 00:45:19,940
eight fifty one is compared to 20-8

1285
00:45:19,940 --> 00:45:21,680
august at 851 so it's probably an

1286
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:24,740
automated script euro car parts 448 euro

1287
00:45:24,740 --> 00:45:28,460
car parts for 42 different crook doing

1288
00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:30,410
what modifying their numbers a little

1289
00:45:30,410 --> 00:45:32,510
bit so you can start to look at the data

1290
00:45:32,510 --> 00:45:34,069
and figure out whose we're in the food

1291
00:45:34,069 --> 00:45:36,500
chain oh by the way they got NSF why

1292
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:38,240
because the card only had three hundred

1293
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:40,309
eighty bucks they try to hit it for 440

1294
00:45:40,309 --> 00:45:43,039
if they tried it for 370 you'd win but

1295
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:44,539
most time you want to get in or get the

1296
00:45:44,539 --> 00:45:45,920
money and go and as soon as you get the

1297
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:49,250
merchandise you get to chip some place

1298
00:45:49,250 --> 00:45:51,260
or you get a gift card you're home free

1299
00:45:51,260 --> 00:45:53,059
and the idea being is that now the

1300
00:45:53,059 --> 00:45:54,589
bank's stuck to deal with the loss and

1301
00:45:54,589 --> 00:45:56,390
there's all kinds of things we can find

1302
00:45:56,390 --> 00:45:58,010
these clones as we call them they're

1303
00:45:58,010 --> 00:45:59,930
copies a legitimate car the track to

1304
00:45:59,930 --> 00:46:01,339
which is what's on the mag stripe

1305
00:46:01,339 --> 00:46:03,140
on the back of the card so you look at

1306
00:46:03,140 --> 00:46:04,849
any card whether it's a hotel card or a

1307
00:46:04,849 --> 00:46:06,469
credit card you got a mag stripe and

1308
00:46:06,469 --> 00:46:08,950
touch it up to three tracks to data here

1309
00:46:08,950 --> 00:46:11,359
full mag stripe copy that's useful why

1310
00:46:11,359 --> 00:46:14,599
because you can clone the card cvv the

1311
00:46:14,599 --> 00:46:16,249
three digit code printed on the back of

1312
00:46:16,249 --> 00:46:17,630
your car door for digital in front of

1313
00:46:17,630 --> 00:46:19,460
the amex is not encoded in the mag

1314
00:46:19,460 --> 00:46:21,259
stripe better not be unless you got a

1315
00:46:21,259 --> 00:46:23,809
really dumb Bank which tells you then

1316
00:46:23,809 --> 00:46:26,390
that if a card is a card present

1317
00:46:26,390 --> 00:46:30,440
compromise which means they got the mag

1318
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:33,799
stripe data it doesn't become a card not

1319
00:46:33,799 --> 00:46:36,079
present compromise where somebody has to

1320
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:38,779
enter in the three digit cvv so there's

1321
00:46:38,779 --> 00:46:40,729
a pretty good firewall in between these

1322
00:46:40,729 --> 00:46:43,099
two types of fraud unless somebody gets

1323
00:46:43,099 --> 00:46:45,019
what we call the foals if they got

1324
00:46:45,019 --> 00:46:47,900
everything you got it so if i'm running

1325
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:49,369
a skimmer if i'm at a restaurant or

1326
00:46:49,369 --> 00:46:51,380
something and i skim your card I write

1327
00:46:51,380 --> 00:46:53,390
down the three digits as well I got it

1328
00:46:53,390 --> 00:46:55,339
or if you look at target where they lost

1329
00:46:55,339 --> 00:46:57,349
40 million cards but 70 million customer

1330
00:46:57,349 --> 00:46:59,479
records with addresses and things like

1331
00:46:59,479 --> 00:47:01,849
that now if I'm trying to hack granmoun

1332
00:47:01,849 --> 00:47:05,089
Ohio I don't go ahead and buy her card

1333
00:47:05,089 --> 00:47:07,400
if I'm out in East Los Angeles I buy it

1334
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:09,890
if I'm in Ohio and then what happens is

1335
00:47:09,890 --> 00:47:11,630
a credit card fraud algorithms gone

1336
00:47:11,630 --> 00:47:13,729
eight hundred dollar purchase I I guess

1337
00:47:13,729 --> 00:47:15,529
grandma is upgrading her television set

1338
00:47:15,529 --> 00:47:16,519
because she hasn't made a big purchase

1339
00:47:16,519 --> 00:47:18,979
in three years must be legit boom it

1340
00:47:18,979 --> 00:47:20,269
goes through because the more you know

1341
00:47:20,269 --> 00:47:22,789
about your target the better you can do

1342
00:47:22,789 --> 00:47:24,559
I'll show you some jumpers and things

1343
00:47:24,559 --> 00:47:26,420
like that and trainwreck cards and

1344
00:47:26,420 --> 00:47:28,279
already showed you a zombie it's already

1345
00:47:28,279 --> 00:47:30,920
been killed it's out shopping so what we

1346
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:33,410
find then is that criminals and the

1347
00:47:33,410 --> 00:47:35,029
behavior or such that there are certain

1348
00:47:35,029 --> 00:47:37,039
things you gotta do to make this crime

1349
00:47:37,039 --> 00:47:39,200
scale you can't do one car at a time

1350
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:41,719
usually do 20 30 50 100 there's big

1351
00:47:41,719 --> 00:47:43,819
batches because it's a batch processing

1352
00:47:43,819 --> 00:47:45,410
when you can let's see enough of the

1353
00:47:45,410 --> 00:47:47,210
batch you can start to infer patterns a

1354
00:47:47,210 --> 00:47:49,160
lot of times to buy exactly the same

1355
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:51,829
items for the same merchant some crooks

1356
00:47:51,829 --> 00:47:53,150
are smarter they'll mix up the dollar

1357
00:47:53,150 --> 00:47:57,410
amounts a little oftentimes they may

1358
00:47:57,410 --> 00:47:59,390
only appear once before cash out now as

1359
00:47:59,390 --> 00:48:01,999
we're getting a more sophisticated to or

1360
00:48:01,999 --> 00:48:04,009
three times as they move from the

1361
00:48:04,009 --> 00:48:07,160
wholesaler to the retailer if you will

1362
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:09,229
to the gang member and who by the way at

1363
00:48:09,229 --> 00:48:11,450
the very end you get a mule typical car

1364
00:48:11,450 --> 00:48:13,969
gets popped for about 250 bucks plus or

1365
00:48:13,969 --> 00:48:14,810
minus

1366
00:48:14,810 --> 00:48:16,610
so here's the deal hey you want to make

1367
00:48:16,610 --> 00:48:18,350
some money here's 50 cards you go back

1368
00:48:18,350 --> 00:48:19,910
and you bring me back ten thousand

1369
00:48:19,910 --> 00:48:21,560
dollars worth of stuff gift cards

1370
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:24,080
anything more you keep anything less I

1371
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:26,750
break your legs well that might not seem

1372
00:48:26,750 --> 00:48:29,480
like a bad deal and so what you can do

1373
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:30,920
is if you start to get inside this

1374
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:32,540
decision cycle you can start to mess

1375
00:48:32,540 --> 00:48:34,550
with these ecosystems somebody goes out

1376
00:48:34,550 --> 00:48:36,050
there and they started panicking when

1377
00:48:36,050 --> 00:48:37,490
all the cards that they knew we're good

1378
00:48:37,490 --> 00:48:39,440
half an hour ago half of them don't work

1379
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:42,260
anymore and so what you can do is you're

1380
00:48:42,260 --> 00:48:43,190
going to show a little bit of heat and

1381
00:48:43,190 --> 00:48:45,470
gets content in there and now we find

1382
00:48:45,470 --> 00:48:46,670
out that even the chip cards can get

1383
00:48:46,670 --> 00:48:47,840
cloned as well we've seen some great

1384
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:51,050
talks Kristen Padgett did a couple

1385
00:48:51,050 --> 00:48:52,610
things a couple years ago she talked

1386
00:48:52,610 --> 00:48:54,980
about near field communications cards

1387
00:48:54,980 --> 00:48:56,300
and Oh major malfunction talked about

1388
00:48:56,300 --> 00:48:58,010
cloning the chip cards so there's the

1389
00:48:58,010 --> 00:48:59,960
technologies out there it just raises

1390
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:02,330
the cost of doing at wholesale instead

1391
00:49:02,330 --> 00:49:04,190
of costing you twenty to thirty cents a

1392
00:49:04,190 --> 00:49:05,570
card you might be spending three dollars

1393
00:49:05,570 --> 00:49:07,430
a card and that's a fixed cost if your

1394
00:49:07,430 --> 00:49:08,750
criminal trying to do all that stuff but

1395
00:49:08,750 --> 00:49:10,850
there's easier ways to do so like we've

1396
00:49:10,850 --> 00:49:12,320
seen in every other country that's going

1397
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:14,330
over to the chips what do we do we go to

1398
00:49:14,330 --> 00:49:17,150
online fraud even better why because you

1399
00:49:17,150 --> 00:49:18,620
don't have to present yourself in front

1400
00:49:18,620 --> 00:49:20,030
of the merchant in front of cameras

1401
00:49:20,030 --> 00:49:21,500
where there might be a possibility local

1402
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:23,600
sheriff could pick you up so what we're

1403
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:25,850
doing is we just whack Amole push the

1404
00:49:25,850 --> 00:49:27,440
fraud down here and it pops up right

1405
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:29,780
over there and so here's a car this is a

1406
00:49:29,780 --> 00:49:31,970
train wreck we see the 001 or legit cars

1407
00:49:31,970 --> 00:49:34,190
this is a real customer up here hmm

1408
00:49:34,190 --> 00:49:37,400
there's a marriott pulsar global

1409
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:40,010
e-commerce boom all of a sudden on the

1410
00:49:40,010 --> 00:49:43,640
twenty-second we started seeing $67 591

1411
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:46,220
50 51 the bam ba-bam until finally the

1412
00:49:46,220 --> 00:49:48,470
car ran out of money Oh 59 but it's

1413
00:49:48,470 --> 00:49:49,940
still going Bam Bam Bam Bam Bam Bam Bam

1414
00:49:49,940 --> 00:49:51,590
Bam Bam because is an automated script

1415
00:49:51,590 --> 00:49:53,120
it's not smart enough to stop because

1416
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:54,590
well maybe the cards temporary might

1417
00:49:54,590 --> 00:49:56,240
work again but what does this tell you

1418
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:58,610
if you're on the defense now I know a

1419
00:49:58,610 --> 00:50:00,020
list of the merchant ID is that they're

1420
00:50:00,020 --> 00:50:01,580
trying to use to run it against you see

1421
00:50:01,580 --> 00:50:02,930
you leak a little bit of information

1422
00:50:02,930 --> 00:50:04,460
every time and you can learn more and

1423
00:50:04,460 --> 00:50:06,350
more about your opponent's a jumper we

1424
00:50:06,350 --> 00:50:08,540
found this card moving around card

1425
00:50:08,540 --> 00:50:11,570
present real cardholder California card

1426
00:50:11,570 --> 00:50:13,610
not present and now we find within four

1427
00:50:13,610 --> 00:50:15,920
minutes the card goes from Illinois to

1428
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:20,090
Alaska in a card present transaction not

1429
00:50:20,090 --> 00:50:22,820
going to happen and so again crooks make

1430
00:50:22,820 --> 00:50:25,160
mistakes little mistakes that don't seem

1431
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:26,720
significant because a lot of the people

1432
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:28,770
at the end of this whole pipeline

1433
00:50:28,770 --> 00:50:30,000
are going ahead go ahead and they're

1434
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,290
trying to cash out they're not the

1435
00:50:31,290 --> 00:50:33,540
sophisticated crooks who upstream we're

1436
00:50:33,540 --> 00:50:34,890
making sure that they don't take any

1437
00:50:34,890 --> 00:50:36,930
part of this end game by the way when

1438
00:50:36,930 --> 00:50:38,250
target was hacked one of the first

1439
00:50:38,250 --> 00:50:39,420
question they got a call from one of the

1440
00:50:39,420 --> 00:50:41,400
bank's hit G mark you think they got the

1441
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:44,310
pins because if they had the pins to all

1442
00:50:44,310 --> 00:50:45,900
the debit cards Wow let's like game over

1443
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:47,400
and so I did a little bit of quick

1444
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:48,780
research you find out the company that

1445
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:50,700
manufactures the pin pads uses a special

1446
00:50:50,700 --> 00:50:53,130
key cryptography protocol that was

1447
00:50:53,130 --> 00:50:55,260
developed by the ANSI Banking Committee

1448
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:57,330
x9 here's the crazy thing I helped write

1449
00:50:57,330 --> 00:50:59,850
this standard 1992 it's still around

1450
00:50:59,850 --> 00:51:02,550
what it was there's one major major key

1451
00:51:02,550 --> 00:51:06,570
for the merchant another one for the

1452
00:51:06,570 --> 00:51:08,400
device and every single transaction had

1453
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:10,140
its own separate key so every pin came

1454
00:51:10,140 --> 00:51:12,090
out with a separate key and so and when

1455
00:51:12,090 --> 00:51:13,290
they found out that they were using the

1456
00:51:13,290 --> 00:51:14,850
stuff that I helped write 25 years like

1457
00:51:14,850 --> 00:51:17,160
cool you're good so within half an hour

1458
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:18,330
I could tell the bank don't worry about

1459
00:51:18,330 --> 00:51:19,620
it and it turned out was the right call

1460
00:51:19,620 --> 00:51:21,450
so what happens that you get social

1461
00:51:21,450 --> 00:51:22,830
engineering and brute force by the way

1462
00:51:22,830 --> 00:51:24,000
there's no three tries and you're on a

1463
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,830
credit card in this hacking so we see

1464
00:51:25,830 --> 00:51:29,580
things coming in 00 00 01 02 03 but the

1465
00:51:29,580 --> 00:51:32,730
average 500 to get a cvv 5,000 tries to

1466
00:51:32,730 --> 00:51:34,590
go ahead and hack a pin they don't time

1467
00:51:34,590 --> 00:51:37,050
out or we go ahead and social engineer

1468
00:51:37,050 --> 00:51:40,260
hello mr. well Sam hi this is your bank

1469
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:42,720
calling hi this is Peggy and we

1470
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:44,220
understand you were shopping at Target

1471
00:51:44,220 --> 00:51:45,330
well we want to protect you were going

1472
00:51:45,330 --> 00:51:47,160
to issue a new card because we don't

1473
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:48,630
want you to be liable for any of the

1474
00:51:48,630 --> 00:51:50,730
fraud that might have been done oh wow

1475
00:51:50,730 --> 00:51:52,110
what a great Bank course you already

1476
00:51:52,110 --> 00:51:54,060
covered by Reggie anyway but most people

1477
00:51:54,060 --> 00:51:55,950
don't know that so what we like to do is

1478
00:51:55,950 --> 00:51:57,480
to just verify your current information

1479
00:51:57,480 --> 00:51:59,190
I'm going to send you over to our

1480
00:51:59,190 --> 00:52:01,200
automated system and ask you to validate

1481
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:03,570
your PIN now you don't tell it to me no

1482
00:52:03,570 --> 00:52:05,190
bank employee is ever going to ask you

1483
00:52:05,190 --> 00:52:06,600
for a pen so don't ever give that up but

1484
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:09,990
it's okay to tell it to the computer so

1485
00:52:09,990 --> 00:52:13,290
wait a minute please enter your PIN beep

1486
00:52:13,290 --> 00:52:15,390
boop thank you very much your card will

1487
00:52:15,390 --> 00:52:17,550
be on its way in seven to 10 days thank

1488
00:52:17,550 --> 00:52:19,320
you for being a customer of big bang of

1489
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:21,240
course your car gets emptied out within

1490
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:23,400
the next few minutes and we see a lot of

1491
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:25,410
this social engineering so look at the

1492
00:52:25,410 --> 00:52:26,850
social engineering training for your

1493
00:52:26,850 --> 00:52:28,200
family your friends your companies and

1494
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:29,970
things like that this zombie I showed

1495
00:52:29,970 --> 00:52:31,140
you this thing we had a little zombie

1496
00:52:31,140 --> 00:52:33,480
thing who goes out there it Krabs around

1497
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:36,450
it cones itself we saw the big spread it

1498
00:52:36,450 --> 00:52:38,310
goes everywhere zipping through some of

1499
00:52:38,310 --> 00:52:39,420
these things here but we find out that

1500
00:52:39,420 --> 00:52:42,360
when clones are born what they do is

1501
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:44,870
that they have different characteristics

1502
00:52:44,870 --> 00:52:48,180
so I can tell the type of fraud would

1503
00:52:48,180 --> 00:52:49,980
trace back to the type of compromise and

1504
00:52:49,980 --> 00:52:52,620
so online as they said online i can go

1505
00:52:52,620 --> 00:52:54,030
to youtube i can get a whole bunch of

1506
00:52:54,030 --> 00:52:55,380
videos i can learn how to do this and

1507
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:57,240
for the most part once your online if

1508
00:52:57,240 --> 00:52:58,920
you get away with something you got away

1509
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:00,630
with it involves shipping merchandise

1510
00:53:00,630 --> 00:53:02,910
yeah well its got actually the loading

1511
00:53:02,910 --> 00:53:04,350
dock and it usually goes to an abandoned

1512
00:53:04,350 --> 00:53:05,730
house or some other drop place and

1513
00:53:05,730 --> 00:53:07,920
merchants typically just share that list

1514
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:10,620
of bad addresses but if I'm buying now

1515
00:53:10,620 --> 00:53:12,330
one of these gift cards it is just

1516
00:53:12,330 --> 00:53:13,950
electronic information is not physical

1517
00:53:13,950 --> 00:53:16,050
once it got it I got it because I can

1518
00:53:16,050 --> 00:53:17,700
shift it over to a gift card exchange

1519
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:19,740
company and had that thing soul within

1520
00:53:19,740 --> 00:53:21,360
five minutes I can launder my laundered

1521
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:23,460
money all kinds of tests that are out

1522
00:53:23,460 --> 00:53:24,900
there again go online if you want to

1523
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:26,370
look at it some more kind of zipping

1524
00:53:26,370 --> 00:53:27,810
through here mostly because this is just

1525
00:53:27,810 --> 00:53:29,610
an encyclopedic list of things to think

1526
00:53:29,610 --> 00:53:31,800
about not so much cheating out of

1527
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:33,330
information but basically telling you

1528
00:53:33,330 --> 00:53:35,220
that if you see these things that

1529
00:53:35,220 --> 00:53:36,840
there's a lot of stuff going on so if

1530
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:38,400
you look at how do we going to protect

1531
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:40,440
this ecosystem in the future we got a

1532
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:42,080
hair worried about all these cash-outs

1533
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:44,670
merchandise it gets brought in back the

1534
00:53:44,670 --> 00:53:46,860
next day hey I can't use it it's the

1535
00:53:46,860 --> 00:53:48,690
wrong size i don't like it i bought

1536
00:53:48,690 --> 00:53:50,820
extra that's okay here's your gift card

1537
00:53:50,820 --> 00:53:54,180
exactly what the crook wants and they'll

1538
00:53:54,180 --> 00:53:57,030
be careful what you buy used gift cards

1539
00:53:57,030 --> 00:53:59,580
on the underground market because i like

1540
00:53:59,580 --> 00:54:00,720
i'm saving money i did that for my

1541
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:02,250
brother a few years ago before i started

1542
00:54:02,250 --> 00:54:03,360
getting into card fraud prevention

1543
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:04,830
because he was working on his house a

1544
00:54:04,830 --> 00:54:06,810
bunch of home depot gift cards but what

1545
00:54:06,810 --> 00:54:08,730
i do i got a discount on him because i

1546
00:54:08,730 --> 00:54:10,050
bought him some place turned out the

1547
00:54:10,050 --> 00:54:11,550
lady said yeah these are stolen people

1548
00:54:11,550 --> 00:54:13,050
steal stuff off with a job site they

1549
00:54:13,050 --> 00:54:14,880
bring it back for for merchandise credit

1550
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:16,770
we don't want to be part of that fraud

1551
00:54:16,770 --> 00:54:18,630
ecosystem but it's just sort of the cost

1552
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:20,790
of doing business unfortunately you can

1553
00:54:20,790 --> 00:54:22,680
block certain transactions and now we

1554
00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:23,940
find out that there's certain dollar

1555
00:54:23,940 --> 00:54:26,010
values hey a fifty dollar gift card that

1556
00:54:26,010 --> 00:54:29,780
has a transaction fee that could be an

1557
00:54:29,780 --> 00:54:33,870
exit because it's 495 so 5495 is a as a

1558
00:54:33,870 --> 00:54:36,300
blacklisted number so you buy a candy

1559
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:37,530
bar at the same time you buy your gift

1560
00:54:37,530 --> 00:54:38,640
card and now you throw off the

1561
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:41,010
algorithms again it's trivial to defeat

1562
00:54:41,010 --> 00:54:43,200
these existing fixed algorithms cuz they

1563
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:45,900
just like a bunch of rule sets so i look

1564
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:47,220
for bad merchants i look for weak

1565
00:54:47,220 --> 00:54:49,080
merchants anything of value i can send

1566
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:50,760
the mail drops all these are ways that I

1567
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:52,830
cash out and I'm able to go ahead and

1568
00:54:52,830 --> 00:54:54,720
get stuff out of there so banks are

1569
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:55,830
spending a fortune on the

1570
00:54:55,830 --> 00:54:57,030
cards they say they go in from our

1571
00:54:57,030 --> 00:54:58,890
thirty cents the three dollars a card

1572
00:54:58,890 --> 00:55:00,690
and all these little chips are expensive

1573
00:55:00,690 --> 00:55:01,890
by the way it'd be interesting to take a

1574
00:55:01,890 --> 00:55:05,250
look more at them merchants are spending

1575
00:55:05,250 --> 00:55:06,960
a fortune on this technology is anywhere

1576
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:08,700
from eight to thirty billion dollars

1577
00:55:08,700 --> 00:55:10,260
when all is said and done with all these

1578
00:55:10,260 --> 00:55:11,850
new readers and of course criminals are

1579
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:14,130
trying to cash these out yo and now as

1580
00:55:14,130 --> 00:55:15,720
al there these folks are trying to make

1581
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:17,130
a ton of money off of this up and it's

1582
00:55:17,130 --> 00:55:19,260
working pretty well so that's a little

1583
00:55:19,260 --> 00:55:20,580
quick insight by the way got a mag

1584
00:55:20,580 --> 00:55:21,810
stripe reader show you a couple things

1585
00:55:21,810 --> 00:55:23,520
but that's the formal presentation on

1586
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:25,590
this but let me shift over real quick

1587
00:55:25,590 --> 00:55:36,210
I've got a couple questions now that the

1588
00:55:36,210 --> 00:55:37,860
smart chip has been available the cost

1589
00:55:37,860 --> 00:55:39,900
of the fraud is purchase it's pushed to

1590
00:55:39,900 --> 00:55:42,030
the merchant if the merchant does not

1591
00:55:42,030 --> 00:55:49,490
invest in a chip card reader if the bank

1592
00:55:50,930 --> 00:55:52,800
how is going to clay out it'll be

1593
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:53,700
interesting to see how it plays out

1594
00:55:53,700 --> 00:55:55,500
because they can't be cloned well it has

1595
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:57,240
been done it's been demonstrated Def Con

1596
00:55:57,240 --> 00:55:58,110
a couple times and other hacker

1597
00:55:58,110 --> 00:55:59,910
conferences it's more expensive to do it

1598
00:55:59,910 --> 00:56:01,320
but it can be done especially you can

1599
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:02,820
find a phone that Java so what's going

1600
00:56:02,820 --> 00:56:03,810
to happen there's going to be a lot of

1601
00:56:03,810 --> 00:56:06,900
blaming game no yes no yes arguing about

1602
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:08,670
it it's can all get fought out and the

1603
00:56:08,670 --> 00:56:10,980
problem is ultimately you the user if

1604
00:56:10,980 --> 00:56:13,050
you're a victim of somebody cloning your

1605
00:56:13,050 --> 00:56:15,720
chipped card in the early days you just

1606
00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:16,680
couldn't get your money back because

1607
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:18,060
they would argue is mathematically

1608
00:56:18,060 --> 00:56:20,160
impossible well we've since proven it is

1609
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:22,080
possible it's just difficult when

1610
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:23,460
somebody gets to a breakthrough on that

1611
00:56:23,460 --> 00:56:24,300
though it's going to be whole game

1612
00:56:24,300 --> 00:56:27,060
changer so again recognize that credit

1613
00:56:27,060 --> 00:56:29,130
cards and plastic goes back to the 1950s

1614
00:56:29,130 --> 00:56:31,860
and are we getting to a different thing

1615
00:56:31,860 --> 00:56:34,470
where for the most part our new means of

1616
00:56:34,470 --> 00:56:36,840
doing commerce is not going to be

1617
00:56:36,840 --> 00:56:38,490
plastic but it's going to be electronic

1618
00:56:38,490 --> 00:56:40,350
silicon and I think this is what's

1619
00:56:40,350 --> 00:56:41,790
happening with all these card companies

1620
00:56:41,790 --> 00:56:43,200
are going hey you know what we've got an

1621
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:45,030
entrenched marketplace but look at Kodak

1622
00:56:45,030 --> 00:56:47,250
they missed the turn you can't buy

1623
00:56:47,250 --> 00:56:48,780
kodachrome anymore they you know

1624
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:50,640
companies that Miss the turn because

1625
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:52,170
they were so entrenched and so in love

1626
00:56:52,170 --> 00:56:53,700
with their own technology and so

1627
00:56:53,700 --> 00:56:54,930
recognize that I think going forward

1628
00:56:54,930 --> 00:56:56,280
we're going to see some real risks out

1629
00:56:56,280 --> 00:56:58,620
there other thoughts of questions yes

1630
00:56:58,620 --> 00:57:00,710
sir

1631
00:57:07,530 --> 00:57:12,420
right i mentioned that we just like not

1632
00:57:12,420 --> 00:57:13,800
relinquishing your cards in restaurants

1633
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:15,330
well if all they have is a reader in the

1634
00:57:15,330 --> 00:57:16,410
back because some of these things are

1635
00:57:16,410 --> 00:57:17,940
fixed they're actually attached to the

1636
00:57:17,940 --> 00:57:19,320
the cart they're not going to drag that

1637
00:57:19,320 --> 00:57:22,080
entire cash register out to you you are

1638
00:57:22,080 --> 00:57:23,910
not at risk for more than fifty dollars

1639
00:57:23,910 --> 00:57:25,650
based upon regulation deregulation a

1640
00:57:25,650 --> 00:57:26,630
sign back in the carter administration

1641
00:57:26,630 --> 00:57:29,610
but i'd avoid dodgy restaurant side

1642
00:57:29,610 --> 00:57:31,290
avoids people that look weird if you're

1643
00:57:31,290 --> 00:57:32,940
really really really worried about a pic

1644
00:57:32,940 --> 00:57:35,880
hash or use a gift card that has a limit

1645
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:37,710
and then once it goes to zero goes to

1646
00:57:37,710 --> 00:57:38,580
zero but that's a little bit more

1647
00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:40,200
expensive for you the customer but we're

1648
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:41,940
starting to see competing technologies

1649
00:57:41,940 --> 00:57:43,380
with the near field communications like

1650
00:57:43,380 --> 00:57:45,360
Apple pay going to currency which is

1651
00:57:45,360 --> 00:57:46,890
going to do qrk a lot of different

1652
00:57:46,890 --> 00:57:48,480
things but yeah you're right that's

1653
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:50,340
always unnerved European folks and they

1654
00:57:50,340 --> 00:57:52,320
think of the US as a high-risk area when

1655
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:53,940
they come here for credit card fraud and

1656
00:57:53,940 --> 00:57:55,680
problem is I go over there with Mike

1657
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:58,200
chip and it's not shipping pin I called

1658
00:57:58,200 --> 00:57:59,730
up a max I pay a lot of money for that

1659
00:57:59,730 --> 00:58:01,740
fancy American Express card oh we don't

1660
00:58:01,740 --> 00:58:03,300
issue pins unless you're not in the US

1661
00:58:03,300 --> 00:58:05,580
this is but everybody uses them I go to

1662
00:58:05,580 --> 00:58:07,320
buy groceries there you gotta wait line

1663
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:08,670
45 minutes for someone going to get you

1664
00:58:08,670 --> 00:58:10,290
to sign a little piece of paper when

1665
00:58:10,290 --> 00:58:11,100
you're at the grocery it's like

1666
00:58:11,100 --> 00:58:13,410
seriously everybody else being boom Bing

1667
00:58:13,410 --> 00:58:15,870
boom and out it's inconvenient but they

1668
00:58:15,870 --> 00:58:17,640
figure all Americans aren't smart enough

1669
00:58:17,640 --> 00:58:19,710
to learn how to use pins I think reality

1670
00:58:19,710 --> 00:58:21,720
check is is that if we got everything

1671
00:58:21,720 --> 00:58:23,400
that way we might see fraud go down you

1672
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:25,680
couldn't support those charges the banks

1673
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:27,150
are able to levy on to the merchants and

1674
00:58:27,150 --> 00:58:28,800
that would change the ecosystem really

1675
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:30,660
cut profits Durbin amendment did a lot

1676
00:58:30,660 --> 00:58:33,230
to cut profits by forcing certain

1677
00:58:33,230 --> 00:58:35,550
merchants certain banks they have to use

1678
00:58:35,550 --> 00:58:37,530
multiple paths to process their stuff

1679
00:58:37,530 --> 00:58:42,420
how we doing on time good wrap it up

1680
00:58:42,420 --> 00:58:44,400
alright it's what I do is wrap up on

1681
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:46,440
time okay so we're really good by the

1682
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:47,910
way if you want to see what's on your

1683
00:58:47,910 --> 00:58:49,320
wallet I've got a little card reader

1684
00:58:49,320 --> 00:58:50,760
here no this is not a skimmer this

1685
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:52,740
doesn't fit in your hand but this is a

1686
00:58:52,740 --> 00:58:54,030
tractor reader and it's interesting

1687
00:58:54,030 --> 00:58:55,500
because you find out that in the back of

1688
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:56,790
card you got your credit card number an

1689
00:58:56,790 --> 00:59:00,420
11 digit security code by the way the 11

1690
00:59:00,420 --> 00:59:01,680
digit security code I was going to show

1691
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:05,870
you for my us a bank card is 11 zeros

1692
00:59:05,990 --> 00:59:08,520
seriously guys okay anyway thank you

1693
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:09,450
very much hope you enjoyed a little

1694
00:59:09,450 --> 00:59:11,160
insight on card fraud and welcome to be

1695
00:59:11,160 --> 00:59:13,399
sides
