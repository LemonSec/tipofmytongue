1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,500
so good afternoon my name is Jim gilson

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,109
and I'm going to be talking about

3
00:00:06,109 --> 00:00:08,370
network reliability monitoring for

4
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:10,610
industrial control systems so ICS skata

5
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:13,980
and this is really going beyond what NSM

6
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:17,130
and seemed can do into areas that they

7
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:19,260
don't really work out so well so a

8
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:22,380
little bit about me I'm a senior

9
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:24,840
investigator at Connexus consulting

10
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:27,230
we're a small consulting firm that does

11
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:31,769
reliability systems for industrial

12
00:00:31,769 --> 00:00:35,100
controls and scada so a large portion of

13
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:37,950
our business does safety systems so fire

14
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:42,629
and gas and safety and process hazard

15
00:00:42,629 --> 00:00:44,969
analysis things like that I work on the

16
00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:48,989
ICS networking and security side so we

17
00:00:48,989 --> 00:00:51,149
do Network assessments security

18
00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:54,149
assessments designs things like that and

19
00:00:54,149 --> 00:00:56,460
I'm also in the process of developing

20
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:58,500
some software to actually automate some

21
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,079
of what's in here so I will not mention

22
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:03,690
my product anymore but basically we're

23
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:06,439
doing this kind of stuff as we go along

24
00:01:06,439 --> 00:01:09,510
previously I was in the NIST engineering

25
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:12,659
lab for 20-plus years doing cyber

26
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:15,810
security and network performance for ICS

27
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:18,570
systems I've also worked in control

28
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:20,460
systems automated vehicles wireless

29
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:23,189
sensors and systems things like that and

30
00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:25,290
for those that know anything about the

31
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:27,720
ICS cyber security space I'm the

32
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:30,840
co-chair of the is a 99 committee which

33
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,570
develops the 624 for 3 series and I'm

34
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:36,380
also developing the security program for

35
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:41,909
ICS SCADA as well so so what is network

36
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:46,049
security monitoring so NSM is I'll read

37
00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:48,780
this this is the collection analysis and

38
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:51,990
escalation of indications and warnings

39
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:54,240
to detect and respond to intrusions and

40
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,119
it's a way to find intruders on your

41
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:58,649
network and do something about them

42
00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:02,250
before they damage your enterprise so it

43
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:04,290
uses a lot of the existing information

44
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:10,020
that that you exist amiss log and a lot

45
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:12,209
of the different logging capabilities

46
00:02:12,209 --> 00:02:14,380
and tracking capabilities that you have

47
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:18,910
on your network already to monitor for

48
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:20,740
things large scale over your whole

49
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:23,650
system now a lot of times it involves

50
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:26,080
adding sensors to your system so you've

51
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,660
got to add sensors around your networks

52
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:30,430
a lot of times they're at your the

53
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:34,950
points that crossover zones but so they

54
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:36,870
try and take all that kind of stuff

55
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:39,190
aggregated into one location and then

56
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:44,140
look for security incidents now what

57
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:46,450
seemed it seemed is something it's sort

58
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:49,660
of similar but it uses a little bit

59
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:52,570
different technology and so seen

60
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:53,830
products are available for real-time

61
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:57,070
analysis of security alerts generated by

62
00:02:57,070 --> 00:03:00,370
network hardware and applications so

63
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:02,170
they do data aggregation correlation

64
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:03,970
alerting dashboards a lot of the a lot

65
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:07,000
of similar kinds of things but they use

66
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,740
different technology a lot of times seem

67
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:12,520
systems are a dedicated product and seem

68
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:16,440
fits into a larger scale NSM system but

69
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,700
seem systems are something generally

70
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,410
it's a product you buy from a company

71
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:24,910
that does these things so this is not a

72
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:28,810
talk about NSM and seen I am NOT an NSF

73
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:32,050
expert i'm not a scene excerpt i know a

74
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:34,030
lot about the lower level protocols and

75
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:36,820
on the ICS space if you want to find out

76
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:42,040
more about NSM there's a Richard Richard

77
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,260
and I've always mess up his name bail

78
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:47,650
each I think he's got some really good

79
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:50,440
books on NSM and then one of the other

80
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,420
guys in the ICS space Chris Sistrunk

81
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:54,160
he's got some really good presentations

82
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:57,160
he did the one at Def Con this past year

83
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:01,840
on NSM for ICS systems and then of

84
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,580
course you can pick your own search

85
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:05,320
engine and find all sorts of stuff out

86
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,630
on the internet as always take it with a

87
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:09,340
grain of salt especially if you're going

88
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:10,660
to vendor sites they're going to claim

89
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:12,400
they have the end-all be-all of

90
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:18,700
everything so when does NSM while or

91
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:21,940
when NSM won't work if you can't observe

92
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:24,370
the traffic that you're that you care

93
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:28,030
about NSM really won't work and then no

94
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:30,070
denote activity in your network though

95
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:32,650
is largely unserved bine at the network

96
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:35,770
level so when you have a lot of systems

97
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:37,690
that talk to each other and they're not

98
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:39,130
actually going up through the

99
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:41,740
architecture and crossing over zone

100
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,990
boundaries you don't have a lot of

101
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:45,940
visibility into what they can do and

102
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:47,860
what what security indications that are

103
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:52,810
going on so here's an example ICS skate

104
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:55,270
and network architecture I've this is

105
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:57,160
the the upper level architecture so this

106
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,270
is dealing with a lot of the server

107
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:01,210
communications so we've got a business

108
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:03,280
level systems and they talked down to

109
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,820
systems in the DMZ and then they talked

110
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:09,610
down to the plant control servers and

111
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:11,710
generally you've got most of the traffic

112
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:13,780
crossing across the boundaries so you've

113
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:16,090
got the majority of traffic at the

114
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:19,030
servers are doing information passing

115
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:21,340
between the DMZ and then the DMZ is

116
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:23,800
doing information pack down into the

117
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,320
plant servers and vice versa so you're

118
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,180
getting a lots of circular communication

119
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:30,070
going through these zone boundary points

120
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:33,280
where you can actually put NSN and it's

121
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,410
Emma sensors and get a lot of

122
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:37,330
information out of your system so you

123
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:39,700
can do a lot of security monitoring at

124
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:42,160
that you written you're not dealing with

125
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,380
a lot of the ICS protocols at this point

126
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:48,250
either so you've got a lot of more

127
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:50,530
common protocols being used so you've

128
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:54,520
got XML information you've got OSI PI

129
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,580
databases you've got different kind of

130
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:59,979
higher level protocols that are more

131
00:05:59,979 --> 00:06:02,560
well-known and there's stuff that's been

132
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,100
written to actually analyze those even

133
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:09,430
in the IT space and then you've got more

134
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:11,919
common platform so you you have normal

135
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:13,750
server kind of hardware it sits in a

136
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:16,979
rack and it it gets all the normal data

137
00:06:16,979 --> 00:06:20,289
data server kind of systems data comm

138
00:06:20,289 --> 00:06:23,440
centers so there you can install things

139
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,479
on them you can actually put software on

140
00:06:25,479 --> 00:06:27,520
these whether they're Linux whether

141
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,370
they're pc-based most in the industrial

142
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:32,650
world almost everything is is windows

143
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:35,140
server based it's rare that you will

144
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:37,060
find things that are not windows server

145
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:39,430
based but things like Active Directory

146
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:42,990
are run on here things like

147
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:46,270
sequel databases and a lot of this kind

148
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:48,759
of stuff that already exists and the IT

149
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:51,520
world knows about they can they can

150
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,120
analyze in NSM systems and get a lot of

151
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:59,550
information out of that so as I said

152
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:01,749
most of network traffic crosses crowd

153
00:07:01,749 --> 00:07:04,150
boundaries you can actually observe it

154
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:06,909
with your actual NSM sensors that you

155
00:07:06,909 --> 00:07:09,099
can put in line you can put taps in

156
00:07:09,099 --> 00:07:11,009
there and actually pull things off

157
00:07:11,009 --> 00:07:13,270
you're not dealing with as many ICS

158
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:16,479
protocols so there's more automated

159
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,250
traffic analysis you don't have to do as

160
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:20,830
much by hand you don't have to have an

161
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:22,270
engineer actually sitting there looking

162
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:24,849
at it you can get Splunk or whatever

163
00:07:24,849 --> 00:07:27,009
whatever product you choose to use can

164
00:07:27,009 --> 00:07:30,129
do a lot of that analysis for you and

165
00:07:30,129 --> 00:07:32,740
then you can actually get things that

166
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:36,189
have security logs so you can find you

167
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:38,710
can install agents on them maybe you can

168
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:41,979
actually get access to SNMP information

169
00:07:41,979 --> 00:07:44,889
you can do your sis logs you can have a

170
00:07:44,889 --> 00:07:46,960
lot of that information already existing

171
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,089
on your platforms and you don't have to

172
00:07:49,089 --> 00:07:50,800
do anything special to get that out I'll

173
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,719
you just have to pull it at a particular

174
00:07:52,719 --> 00:07:56,020
frequencies so now what happens down at

175
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:57,849
the lower level of industrial control

176
00:07:57,849 --> 00:08:02,080
systems so in these kind of cases you

177
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,139
have a lot of communications that runs

178
00:08:04,139 --> 00:08:09,219
locally in these sub networks that exist

179
00:08:09,219 --> 00:08:12,009
down here so this controller is going to

180
00:08:12,009 --> 00:08:13,810
talk to some devices here on this field

181
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:15,879
bus and it's going to talk to this

182
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:18,219
little HMI server a human machine

183
00:08:18,219 --> 00:08:22,210
interface and maybe that's a PC or maybe

184
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:25,659
it's some form of specialized panel pc

185
00:08:25,659 --> 00:08:28,779
or things like that but almost all of

186
00:08:28,779 --> 00:08:31,479
that communication resides inside this

187
00:08:31,479 --> 00:08:35,320
switch and never leaves that switch and

188
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,479
a lot of times these are layer 2

189
00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:39,250
switches as well so you're not talking

190
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:42,279
about really smart kind of devices same

191
00:08:42,279 --> 00:08:45,519
thing sometimes you have it's not

192
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:47,470
uncommon to have radio links between

193
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:51,730
remote sites so this may be a natural

194
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:55,220
point-to-point wireless dedicated link

195
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:57,920
um using directional antennas and

196
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,439
everything like that or it's not

197
00:09:00,439 --> 00:09:03,259
uncommon to have radio links are sorry

198
00:09:03,259 --> 00:09:06,439
uh satellite links between remote

199
00:09:06,439 --> 00:09:10,100
facilities generally you won't see them

200
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:12,589
it's not it's not uncommon but it's not

201
00:09:12,589 --> 00:09:14,389
really as common to see them using the

202
00:09:14,389 --> 00:09:16,670
public telephone system anymore most of

203
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:18,589
time they're doing more higher bandwidth

204
00:09:18,589 --> 00:09:21,949
radio links than trying to go over the

205
00:09:21,949 --> 00:09:25,399
pots network anymore so but the majority

206
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:28,189
of all that traffic resides and stays in

207
00:09:28,189 --> 00:09:31,639
these small remote sensors you may have

208
00:09:31,639 --> 00:09:34,189
say an engineering workstation that can

209
00:09:34,189 --> 00:09:37,579
talk to these over the network but it

210
00:09:37,579 --> 00:09:40,069
isn't constantly communicating this is

211
00:09:40,069 --> 00:09:41,870
when they need to make a change they go

212
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:44,329
out communicate with that controller and

213
00:09:44,329 --> 00:09:46,639
they they do a particular task and then

214
00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:48,019
they log off because you don't want to

215
00:09:48,019 --> 00:09:49,129
leave that session up and running

216
00:09:49,129 --> 00:09:50,990
especially if these are low bandwidth

217
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:52,699
links that are running over radio or

218
00:09:52,699 --> 00:09:55,689
satellite things like that you may have

219
00:09:55,689 --> 00:09:57,680
environmental sensors that are in your

220
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,779
system so the EPA comes into certain

221
00:09:59,779 --> 00:10:01,610
facilities and they've got a monitor 24

222
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:03,559
7 so they've got their own set of

223
00:10:03,559 --> 00:10:05,809
sensors that have to go through and a

224
00:10:05,809 --> 00:10:07,339
lot of times there has to be a very

225
00:10:07,339 --> 00:10:10,430
specialized link through VPNs and or

226
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:12,709
like their own separate lines they even

227
00:10:12,709 --> 00:10:16,160
bring into the facility only a very

228
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,839
small amount of information actually

229
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:20,920
makes it up into the plant servers so

230
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:24,019
the majority of traffic doesn't even

231
00:10:24,019 --> 00:10:27,980
really leave this network zone at all

232
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:31,189
and a lot of it i would say 80-plus

233
00:10:31,189 --> 00:10:34,309
percent only stays inside those local

234
00:10:34,309 --> 00:10:36,829
switches so you're not really going to

235
00:10:36,829 --> 00:10:39,579
have access to a lot of that information

236
00:10:39,579 --> 00:10:42,790
and you're also dealing with very

237
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:45,829
dedicated ICS protocols these are

238
00:10:45,829 --> 00:10:47,750
protocols that are designed to do

239
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:51,680
controls at that level so there's

240
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,050
ethernet/ip there's Modbus there's profi

241
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:55,779
net there's a whole list of different

242
00:10:55,779 --> 00:10:57,589
control protocols that are out there

243
00:10:57,589 --> 00:10:59,809
that use ethernet as a physical media

244
00:10:59,809 --> 00:11:03,769
and some of them use different various

245
00:11:03,769 --> 00:11:06,769
levels of the tcp stack some of them use

246
00:11:06,769 --> 00:11:08,810
the full tcp stack some of them have

247
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:11,540
that they wanted to do more determinism

248
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:13,190
so they've actually like eliminated

249
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:15,080
portions so some actually will reside

250
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,990
right on top of 8023 some actually even

251
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:20,390
get rid of the link layer in 802 and run

252
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:22,460
right over the hardware layer of 80 to 1

253
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:27,290
or 8023 so they get down into really

254
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:32,750
trying to do sub micro second real-time

255
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:37,100
communications with their systems and

256
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:39,110
then you're dealing with ICS specific

257
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:41,990
platforms so these are small computers

258
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:44,600
that are about the size some of them are

259
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:47,210
about the size of your phone but they've

260
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:50,240
gotta run 24-7 for the next 5 to 10

261
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,839
years and never be shut down think about

262
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:56,000
that for a second how many times do you

263
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:02,300
reboot your phone so as I said the

264
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:04,010
traffic generally doesn't flow through

265
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:07,100
any of these actual NSM sensors in a

266
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,810
system you would have to literally put

267
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:11,450
an n sm sensor off of here hanging off

268
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:13,550
of here hanging off of both sides of

269
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:16,250
this radio link hanging off of this

270
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:18,710
plant network control and this is just a

271
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:20,810
small one in a typical plant you're

272
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:23,330
going to have anywhere from 20 to 30 of

273
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:27,020
these ice or segregated networks inside

274
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:30,920
the plant control network so and that's

275
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:33,110
that's a normal sized facility that I

276
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:35,570
deal with which is considered actually

277
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:37,850
medium size small to medium when it

278
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:39,080
comes to actual industrial control

279
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,580
plants when you deal with large-scale

280
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:43,550
SCADA systems like water utilities

281
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:46,880
wastewater power plant utilities

282
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,920
pipelines things like that then you're

283
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:53,510
dealing with sometimes you're dealing

284
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:57,890
with like a thousand independent like

285
00:12:57,890 --> 00:12:59,480
isolated networks because you've got

286
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,490
that many substations in your network or

287
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:04,220
whatever so and each sub station gets

288
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:06,050
its own separate segment of the network

289
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:08,930
so it doesn't transmit over back to the

290
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:11,949
main network so

291
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,320
once which went down to tell you that

292
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:21,290
some that would go down for now

293
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:27,180
yeah typically these it's so typically

294
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:31,710
these are not even oh yeah um so yeah

295
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:37,500
the question was about basically load

296
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,960
balancing on the switches and having

297
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:42,240
like spanning tree running and and if

298
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,540
these switches go down do what would

299
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:48,690
happen if for that subnet going down in

300
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:51,960
in reality most of the time unless these

301
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:54,900
are truly critical systems there's one

302
00:13:54,900 --> 00:14:00,570
switch that's it you may have dual fiber

303
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:02,310
coming in so in some of the high

304
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:03,900
availability systems they will be a dual

305
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:06,000
fiber coming in to that switch so they

306
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,770
have two independent paths coming there

307
00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:10,170
but that one switch if that fails you're

308
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:15,930
done so but again for critical systems

309
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:18,480
yes you can actually have two switches

310
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,790
and meshed and things like that but your

311
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:22,770
most the time talking about only two

312
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:25,860
lines coming into there because in some

313
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:27,360
of these facilities like in a nuclear

314
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,710
power plant it's $5,000 a foot to run

315
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:35,940
wire um minimum then that it can go up

316
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:42,090
from there in like remote oil and gas

317
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:46,350
pump fields you've got fields that cover

318
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:50,010
and like 25 square miles so you're not

319
00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:52,650
going to be running wired communications

320
00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:56,820
to a lot of those so it just it's really

321
00:14:56,820 --> 00:15:01,440
difficult you can run it to maybe a like

322
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,510
a centralized control center and then

323
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:05,700
you can plan for having dual path and

324
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:09,210
redundant systems and yes in those kind

325
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:12,180
of cases like you will see a lot of

326
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:16,470
times having independent paths so that

327
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:19,800
when the forklift runs over our pulls

328
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,210
down the fiber thats hanging on the

329
00:15:21,210 --> 00:15:23,130
poles he doesn't shut down the whole

330
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,780
plant you've got another path over there

331
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:27,780
and redundant sir redundant switches on

332
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:30,120
both sides but that's very rare that's

333
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:33,800
only for critical sites typically

334
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:56,480
the problem is you got to remember most

335
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,570
of these systems have to actually sit in

336
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:07,970
place for decades it's I just got

337
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:12,500
through a plant last year that had deck

338
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:16,610
alphas and running x11 traffic over

339
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:20,090
their network which is back mid 80s and

340
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:24,610
they had a plan to replace it by 2018

341
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:29,050
these systems are older than you are and

342
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:33,070
they have to stay up and running 24 7

343
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:36,830
365 so basically you have to deal with

344
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:39,590
what exists because also like you can't

345
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:41,750
get parts for a deck elfa anymore it's

346
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:44,570
not like they went and actually like had

347
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:46,870
to go in and get someone to actually

348
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:49,640
build replacement parts for them

349
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:51,050
especially because they couldn't get

350
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:54,560
them anymore it things like that happen

351
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,710
and that's not uncommon that one was a

352
00:16:57,710 --> 00:16:59,720
more extreme example because they were

353
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:03,320
they were just really really bad but

354
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,270
it's not uncommon to see things in in

355
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:10,240
service for 15 years so

356
00:17:18,089 --> 00:17:27,369
monitor at all the question was couldn't

357
00:17:27,369 --> 00:17:30,010
you set up load balancing vlans and

358
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:33,070
things like that in in the way it's

359
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:34,840
typically set up the way we we typically

360
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,280
do each one of these is a separate VLAN

361
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:39,010
for performance reasons no it's it's

362
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:41,020
it's specifically for performance

363
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:44,410
reasons because this these systems have

364
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:46,960
to stay up and running and they have to

365
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:50,070
run continuously all the time and

366
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:53,230
determinism is much more important than

367
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:56,950
security so they were they would much

368
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:58,870
rather deal with the VLAN stuff and yeah

369
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:00,430
you can do trunking and yeah you can do

370
00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:02,590
monitor things and stuff like that but

371
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:04,480
also you're dealing with a lot of times

372
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,460
these are layer 2 switches so they're

373
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:09,700
not smart enough to do any of the VLAN

374
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:12,340
trunking that you can do up at layer 3

375
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:15,929
routing kind of layer switches

376
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:25,850
um we actually have concentrated on

377
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:30,050
assuming the hosts cannot be touched so

378
00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:33,360
so we have gotten to the point I'll talk

379
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,320
about a little bit later but basically

380
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,770
we actually go in and as long as these

381
00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:40,500
have mirror reports we can basically go

382
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:45,300
in and do assessments periodically and

383
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:47,960
actually do signature-based detection

384
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,910
but it's it's developing a signature of

385
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:53,610
what good looks like and then comparing

386
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:57,150
that signature over time so so it

387
00:18:57,150 --> 00:18:58,410
actually leads into some of the other

388
00:18:58,410 --> 00:19:00,180
stuff so again you're doing you're not

389
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:02,100
dealing with standard OS is a lot of

390
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,870
time these are real time all Rances if

391
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:05,820
you've heard of vxworks that's like

392
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:08,280
that's a high-end one for a lot of

393
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,720
systems and so that's actually really

394
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,820
good a lot of these guys actually decide

395
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:14,040
to write their own real-time operating

396
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:16,530
systems because they can actually get

397
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:19,890
down to sub micro second timings and

398
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:21,840
determinism on a lot of these things

399
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,200
sometimes down into nanoseconds of

400
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:27,990
timing determinism kind of jitter on

401
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:30,740
their communications so very low

402
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:34,590
determinism on their systems so again

403
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:36,240
and then also even when you have

404
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:40,680
standard os's in your systems you can't

405
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,900
always trust that the vendor will allow

406
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:44,700
you to install something on there

407
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,080
because they've got it sort of locked

408
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:49,980
down as a warranty thing of we won't

409
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:52,770
service this if you install antivirus on

410
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:55,920
it because antivirus slows it down to

411
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:56,970
the point where you've lost your

412
00:19:56,970 --> 00:20:03,960
determinism so the devices really aren't

413
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,760
capable a lot of times the information

414
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,640
doesn't exist and then the hardware

415
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,010
designs they're minimalistic design so

416
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:15,990
they said assume a cell phone from 10

417
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:17,400
years ago is what you're actually

418
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:20,820
powering the substation on that's the

419
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:25,200
power you're dealing with typically so

420
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:30,600
what do you do looking at NSM a lot of

421
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:33,150
times looks for negative cases it looks

422
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:36,039
for something bad happen so I'm going to

423
00:20:36,039 --> 00:20:40,989
an alert and someone should go and look

424
00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:46,200
at it well in an industrial plant

425
00:20:46,229 --> 00:20:48,340
looking at the negative is not always

426
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:49,989
the best thing which you want to do is

427
00:20:49,989 --> 00:20:51,759
actually look for the positive look for

428
00:20:51,759 --> 00:20:53,049
what it should look like and then

429
00:20:53,049 --> 00:20:56,229
anything outside of that is actually

430
00:20:56,229 --> 00:20:58,690
what you want to look for so looking for

431
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:02,080
anomalies developing a known good set of

432
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:05,799
traffic I have not walked into a plant

433
00:21:05,799 --> 00:21:09,940
yet that everyone or like anyone knew

434
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:12,129
what their traffic looked like on the

435
00:21:12,129 --> 00:21:15,729
network they knew what it should kind of

436
00:21:15,729 --> 00:21:18,580
look like but they never had done full

437
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:20,289
traffic captures and actually gotten to

438
00:21:20,289 --> 00:21:22,479
the point of isolating each one of the

439
00:21:22,479 --> 00:21:24,580
traffic streams and looking to see what

440
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:30,849
it should look like and so these systems

441
00:21:30,849 --> 00:21:33,460
generally go through multiple levels of

442
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:35,499
testing before they're actually up and

443
00:21:35,499 --> 00:21:37,359
running there's usually some sort of

444
00:21:37,359 --> 00:21:39,009
factory automate our factory acceptance

445
00:21:39,009 --> 00:21:41,590
testing of the systems before they even

446
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:43,899
get to the site then there's site

447
00:21:43,899 --> 00:21:46,119
acceptance testing before there's

448
00:21:46,119 --> 00:21:48,099
actually like start up a lot of times

449
00:21:48,099 --> 00:21:49,330
there's some sort of commissioning

450
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:52,389
testing of the whole system then there's

451
00:21:52,389 --> 00:21:54,580
when you got your system changes when

452
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:57,159
any like major system changes a lot of

453
00:21:57,159 --> 00:21:58,330
times they will have to go through and

454
00:21:58,330 --> 00:22:01,330
recertify it and then almost always

455
00:22:01,330 --> 00:22:03,159
there's some form of periodic testing a

456
00:22:03,159 --> 00:22:06,129
lot of times it's a yearly sometimes it

457
00:22:06,129 --> 00:22:07,539
may be like three years or five years

458
00:22:07,539 --> 00:22:09,429
but again you're dealing with there is

459
00:22:09,429 --> 00:22:11,440
some form of periodic testing that goes

460
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:14,200
on these systems and and so what you can

461
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:17,109
start to do is compare what the traffic

462
00:22:17,109 --> 00:22:20,049
looks like now to what it looked like

463
00:22:20,049 --> 00:22:23,499
during those known good sets and if you

464
00:22:23,499 --> 00:22:25,629
see things that are out of the norm if

465
00:22:25,629 --> 00:22:27,220
you see new traffic streams that

466
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:29,590
shouldn't be there if you see traffic

467
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:31,599
streams behaving differently than they

468
00:22:31,599 --> 00:22:33,669
should if you see anomalies in the

469
00:22:33,669 --> 00:22:35,499
traffic that are appearing that you

470
00:22:35,499 --> 00:22:37,629
didn't see before that's something to

471
00:22:37,629 --> 00:22:41,019
alert these systems don't change all the

472
00:22:41,019 --> 00:22:44,590
time you don't have or okay you

473
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:47,739
shouldn't have people down on the

474
00:22:47,739 --> 00:22:50,140
control networks looking at web pages

475
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:54,130
they shouldn't be going out to name your

476
00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:57,400
malicious actor country they shouldn't

477
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,710
go out to those countries if you start

478
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:01,540
seeing traffic going there there's

479
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:03,970
probably something wrong egress

480
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:06,700
filtering for firewalls is one of the

481
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:09,910
biggest things that should throw up red

482
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:11,920
flags if you start seeing egress traffic

483
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:15,610
out of your and out of your company from

484
00:23:15,610 --> 00:23:17,140
the industrial control system directly

485
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:19,570
then you should be like running to

486
00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:24,760
figure out what's going on network

487
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,830
reliability monitoring really doesn't

488
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:30,820
have to be difficult a lot of the tools

489
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:34,840
exist already I mean wire I live in

490
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:40,930
wireshark and XML like text files or

491
00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:44,230
basically Excel spreadsheets you can do

492
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:46,330
a lot of what you need to do with

493
00:23:46,330 --> 00:23:49,870
wireshark and Wireshark will export PS

494
00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:53,110
ml or pd ml files which are their packet

495
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:54,760
data markup language you can actually

496
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,710
like look at the individual fields from

497
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:58,780
there and then you can process that

498
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:02,350
pretty easily inside either Microsoft

499
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:05,440
Excel or a lot of different tools and

500
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:09,280
get some data out of there I won't say

501
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,780
it's the best data but it's at least

502
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:13,720
something to look at and the metrics

503
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,460
you're looking at aren't very difficult

504
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:18,100
either so you're looking at jitter on a

505
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:20,230
deterministic signal you should be

506
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:22,270
getting a straight line across there and

507
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:23,950
all of a sudden I have some wiggle in

508
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:27,370
there why and so you go investigate that

509
00:24:27,370 --> 00:24:30,810
and then latency these systems as a

510
00:24:30,810 --> 00:24:33,610
controller I talked to some device and

511
00:24:33,610 --> 00:24:37,150
that device responds back how long does

512
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:39,520
that latency take what's the latency

513
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,490
there almost invariably it's the latency

514
00:24:42,490 --> 00:24:44,980
in the actual devices if you're having

515
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:47,260
network latency problems then you need

516
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:49,390
to talk to your ISP or you need to go to

517
00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:51,760
your network guys but almost all the

518
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:54,880
time 95 plus percent of the time it's

519
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,530
the devices that are actually having the

520
00:24:56,530 --> 00:24:59,700
problems unless you're dealing with

521
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:01,630
manufacturing and then it's usually the

522
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:03,420
guys with the forklifts that run over

523
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:09,960
or cables or do things like that as I

524
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,280
said Wireshark really has a lot of

525
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:13,950
capabilities you're not going to find

526
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:16,140
things like I don't know if there was a

527
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:17,340
Wireshark class here before but

528
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:20,730
basically like the the TCP streams

529
00:25:20,730 --> 00:25:22,200
you're not gonna be able to use those

530
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,750
really to follow industrial control

531
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:27,000
system traffic generally Wireshark

532
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,280
doesn't know how to follow those treats

533
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:31,560
EP streams very well what you need to do

534
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:33,570
is actually get in and just learn how to

535
00:25:33,570 --> 00:25:35,880
do your filters really well in wireshark

536
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,890
and you can filter down to getting all

537
00:25:37,890 --> 00:25:43,590
the individual streams yes you can yeah

538
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:44,850
so you can write your own decoder I

539
00:25:44,850 --> 00:25:47,040
actually what I personally do is I

540
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:50,490
actually scripty shark and use that as a

541
00:25:50,490 --> 00:25:53,790
way to do my filtering because i can

542
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:55,200
actually automate the process of

543
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,880
scripting the t shark and then getting

544
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,590
my data and then automatically pumping

545
00:25:58,590 --> 00:26:01,230
that into something else so but yeah in

546
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:02,790
wireshark you can you can do that

547
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:06,480
graphically or whatever as I said my

548
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,790
company is developing a process to

549
00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:12,570
automate this automate this but I'm

550
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:15,300
telling you that what I'm doing to

551
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:17,460
automate the process is no different

552
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:20,880
than what you can hand do with wireshark

553
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:25,290
and Excel it's faster it's cheaper it's

554
00:26:25,290 --> 00:26:28,110
easier so my company actually is doing

555
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:29,670
it because when we go in and do

556
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:32,190
assessments I want to be able to go in

557
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:33,900
and I don't want to have to be the one

558
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:36,300
to go to every single facility to look

559
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:38,610
at the graphs and say yep that's good or

560
00:26:38,610 --> 00:26:40,830
nope there's something weird here I want

561
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:42,630
to send a junior guy out there to do the

562
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:45,810
to do the basic stuff and maybe if he

563
00:26:45,810 --> 00:26:47,400
finds something really weird he'll send

564
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,050
me that but I don't want to have to be

565
00:26:49,050 --> 00:26:50,610
the one to go out there to do it plus we

566
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:52,110
want to be able to actually teach vendor

567
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:54,480
or teach end-users how to do this stuff

568
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,520
so that when they find the really bad

569
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:58,770
stuff they can come ask us but we want

570
00:26:58,770 --> 00:27:01,250
to be able to sell them products and

571
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:04,830
services associated with that so really

572
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:06,720
it's really not that hard to generate

573
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:11,690
basic graphs and charts um now as I said

574
00:27:11,690 --> 00:27:14,100
detailed analysis of these things can

575
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:15,640
take a lot more experience

576
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:18,280
I have been doing ICS network

577
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:22,900
performance now for 15 or more years

578
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:25,750
I've seen enough graphs to kind of get a

579
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:27,940
feel for what might be going wrong in

580
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:30,790
some of these devices and what we're

581
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:32,320
trying to do is actually build some of

582
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,390
that intelligence into our analysis

583
00:27:34,390 --> 00:27:37,420
tools so that it gets easier for end

584
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:39,580
users to actually use and then root

585
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:41,230
cause analysis is one of those really

586
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:44,350
hard things to do with this because then

587
00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:46,000
the vendors actually have to get

588
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,190
involved in a lot of cases if you've got

589
00:27:48,190 --> 00:27:50,260
devices that are showing weird things

590
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:53,440
even like right from the factory and

591
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,570
I've done some prototype testing on on

592
00:27:55,570 --> 00:27:59,980
vendor devices and they they have to

593
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:01,600
then go back and sort of analyze all

594
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,970
that traffic data and figure out oh it

595
00:28:03,970 --> 00:28:09,570
was something weird going on okay so

596
00:28:09,570 --> 00:28:11,740
what do you what do I actually look like

597
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:15,760
so this is a graph of what's called

598
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:19,360
measured packet interval and you'll see

599
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:22,000
this nice sort of clear line at around

600
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,160
10 milliseconds what you're actually

601
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:27,250
seeing is the deterministic frequency of

602
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:29,440
every 10 milliseconds this device was

603
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,620
transmitting a packet on the network and

604
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:34,930
it should happen at approximately 10

605
00:28:34,930 --> 00:28:37,990
milliseconds these variations in here

606
00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:40,840
are the sort of like it's sort of around

607
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:44,500
10 milliseconds and as long as you're

608
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:46,360
within a certain percentage you can

609
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:50,500
consider it a good device in this

610
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:52,270
particular case you had 10 milliseconds

611
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:55,330
and a 400 400 microns hitter so that's a

612
00:28:55,330 --> 00:28:57,340
well-performing device that's considered

613
00:28:57,340 --> 00:28:58,960
something that I don't have to worry

614
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:03,490
about this is another device similar 10

615
00:29:03,490 --> 00:29:05,620
millisecond but it was slightly shifted

616
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:08,890
off and it had a wider distribution so

617
00:29:08,890 --> 00:29:10,510
if i did standard deviation and all the

618
00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:11,980
kind of math to go along with that it

619
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:13,810
would be a wider distribution here but

620
00:29:13,810 --> 00:29:16,240
again 10 milliseconds 40 miles per

621
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,700
second jitter not that bad so now you

622
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:21,100
get some weird stuff happening so this

623
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:22,810
is this is actually a time scale I've

624
00:29:22,810 --> 00:29:24,700
blown it up here so it actually shows up

625
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:27,940
nice here on PowerPoint but this is

626
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:31,080
about a 60 second

627
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:33,250
performance test that I was running and

628
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:35,320
you'll see there's actually some sort of

629
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:37,470
beat pattern that happens every 30

630
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:41,550
seconds in this case it's interesting

631
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:43,930
again this was one of these prototype

632
00:29:43,930 --> 00:29:45,730
devices where I had to like give it to

633
00:29:45,730 --> 00:29:47,860
the vendor and say we saw something

634
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:50,260
interesting go figure it out in your

635
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:53,140
system I believe in this case it was

636
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:54,550
actually a garbage collection routine

637
00:29:54,550 --> 00:29:56,410
they had running in there real-time

638
00:29:56,410 --> 00:29:58,300
operating system they weren't using a

639
00:29:58,300 --> 00:29:59,560
standard one they had written their own

640
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:01,480
and their garbage collection would go

641
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:02,650
and actually slow down their

642
00:30:02,650 --> 00:30:06,190
communications is this a good when we

643
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:07,630
did the root cause analysis we found a

644
00:30:07,630 --> 00:30:09,040
vendor was actually causing this problem

645
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:12,790
if I saw this in in an ICS plant itself

646
00:30:12,790 --> 00:30:15,220
what I know whether that's good or bad

647
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:18,010
if you've done the signature analysis or

648
00:30:18,010 --> 00:30:20,680
at least signature collection earlier in

649
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:23,410
your process factory acceptance testing

650
00:30:23,410 --> 00:30:25,570
SAT commissioning things like that you

651
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:27,640
would know that this device looks like

652
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:29,560
this and if i see this down the road

653
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:34,270
it's nothing special so this is where

654
00:30:34,270 --> 00:30:36,580
you get into the ok what does it really

655
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:38,470
look like not what it should look like

656
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:39,940
but this is actually what it really

657
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:42,760
looks like another thing here to here's

658
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:44,680
another one this actually had a beat

659
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:47,230
pattern it was about 50 seconds long in

660
00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:50,320
this case but again lots of sort of

661
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:53,470
wiggle traffic around there and if I

662
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:56,050
looked at this at an ICS plant I would

663
00:30:56,050 --> 00:30:58,240
question them well what's going on to

664
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,520
cause this I would have to go back and

665
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:03,190
actually deep dig deep into that vendor

666
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:05,170
device to find out if that vendor device

667
00:31:05,170 --> 00:31:07,840
was the cause or if it was some sort of

668
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:10,120
network attack or things like that so a

669
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:13,480
lot of these are more individual testing

670
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:17,680
I said so what's causing some of these

671
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:19,410
so it may be garbage collection

672
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:22,870
antivirus checks and updates are like

673
00:31:22,870 --> 00:31:25,920
terrible human machine interface HMI

674
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:28,870
they will actually kind of like lock up

675
00:31:28,870 --> 00:31:32,410
when antivirus kicks in some aav vendors

676
00:31:32,410 --> 00:31:35,500
are worse than others at it to the

677
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:40,660
large-scale AV vendors are better but

678
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:43,090
even then they get they get kind of

679
00:31:43,090 --> 00:31:46,090
really hard on the system once they

680
00:31:46,090 --> 00:31:48,160
actually kick in and again you're

681
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:50,290
dealing with systems that are processed

682
00:31:50,290 --> 00:31:52,480
limited to begin with and now you're

683
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:55,330
loading it down with something that has

684
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:57,610
to go out and download a three Meg file

685
00:31:57,610 --> 00:32:01,510
every whatever and oh I've got to run my

686
00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:02,830
process and check to make sure

687
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:04,480
everything is going wrong but the

688
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,010
nuclear power plant can't shut down

689
00:32:06,010 --> 00:32:07,840
right now because I've got to actually

690
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,670
hit the button on the screen and make it

691
00:32:09,670 --> 00:32:13,810
do something on-screen operations are

692
00:32:13,810 --> 00:32:14,920
actually another one of those that

693
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:17,410
causes weird things to happen sometimes

694
00:32:17,410 --> 00:32:20,950
especially windows will just go off into

695
00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:23,560
slaw la land while it's waiting for some

696
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:26,830
process to happen in on the screen you

697
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:28,360
click the button and it kind of just

698
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:30,880
decides not to react so that's another

699
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:33,460
reason why a lot of times the vendors

700
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:36,130
will not allow you to install things on

701
00:32:36,130 --> 00:32:38,050
there that they don't know about because

702
00:32:38,050 --> 00:32:39,610
it could interfere with their HMI

703
00:32:39,610 --> 00:32:41,170
software or their whatever software

704
00:32:41,170 --> 00:32:43,480
they've got and then you run into

705
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:46,630
problems of okay well now who do I sue

706
00:32:46,630 --> 00:32:48,220
and effectively that's what you're

707
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:50,320
talking about in this case the end user

708
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,240
couldn't do something they had a fault

709
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,760
they had an incident who do they sue to

710
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:59,350
blame for that incident going on um

711
00:32:59,350 --> 00:33:01,540
there's network anomalies a lot of times

712
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:04,260
in these in these plants you've got a

713
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:07,050
large-scale emi kind of interference

714
00:33:07,050 --> 00:33:10,380
large motors about the size of this room

715
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:15,750
generating a lot of EMI interference or

716
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:21,100
welders or toxic chemical areas where it

717
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:23,560
actually corrodes the contacts and

718
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:26,710
things I was in a corn processing plant

719
00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:28,630
where the corn dust was actually eating

720
00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:31,000
away at the gold contacts on the rj45

721
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,130
plugs so they had to replace their

722
00:33:33,130 --> 00:33:35,140
switches every six months to a year

723
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:37,090
because they were actually getting eaten

724
00:33:37,090 --> 00:33:39,190
away until they figured out oh yeah well

725
00:33:39,190 --> 00:33:41,250
let's put some positive pressure

726
00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:44,830
environmentally sealed cases in here and

727
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:47,710
then work with those but that was only

728
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:50,970
in critical locations not every location

729
00:33:50,970 --> 00:33:53,770
signal degradation you're dealing with

730
00:33:53,770 --> 00:33:55,420
places where there's a lot of metal a

731
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:57,010
lot almost

732
00:33:57,010 --> 00:33:59,200
every machine is made of metal and if

733
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,150
you've got all if you're actually

734
00:34:01,150 --> 00:34:03,520
dealing with wireless networking or

735
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:04,720
something like that you've got a lot of

736
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:07,360
refraction there's a lot of reflections

737
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:09,399
you'll get and you'll end up with a real

738
00:34:09,399 --> 00:34:11,380
mess in in some cases so they have to be

739
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:12,699
really careful literally like a you

740
00:34:12,699 --> 00:34:15,010
could be here and get ten reflections

741
00:34:15,010 --> 00:34:18,699
and then here and you'd be fine so it

742
00:34:18,699 --> 00:34:22,540
happens a lot flaky connections stupid

743
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:26,050
human tricks with forklifts and dump

744
00:34:26,050 --> 00:34:29,699
trucks and people hauling stuff around

745
00:34:29,699 --> 00:34:32,199
you'll find anything that could go wrong

746
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:34,120
with the network has happened in a

747
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:37,570
nutshell plant and then maybe it is a

748
00:34:37,570 --> 00:34:39,310
security related incident and then what

749
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:42,639
happens what do you do so I actually

750
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:44,530
decided to test this and see what

751
00:34:44,530 --> 00:34:45,610
happens when you actually run a

752
00:34:45,610 --> 00:34:47,020
man-in-the-middle attack against an

753
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:48,880
industrial control system I didn't bring

754
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:50,199
it in here but I have a little suitcase

755
00:34:50,199 --> 00:34:53,168
with a controller and IO block and some

756
00:34:53,168 --> 00:34:57,130
buttons and it literally is just it's a

757
00:34:57,130 --> 00:35:01,990
switch it's the netgear like 1g s108 so

758
00:35:01,990 --> 00:35:05,500
it's got the it's got me report on it an

759
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:07,780
eight port so I can run that I've got a

760
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:11,080
PLC controller it's a programmable logic

761
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:15,850
controller a 24 volt io block and then

762
00:35:15,850 --> 00:35:18,870
what I did is I hooked up a cali vm and

763
00:35:18,870 --> 00:35:21,400
Wireshark on two separate machines so

764
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:23,590
the Wireshark was on the me report and

765
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:27,340
Callie was on the on the network I am

766
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:29,200
NOT a man-in-the-middle attack

767
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,450
specialist there's other people if you

768
00:35:31,450 --> 00:35:33,640
want to do I'm a script kiddie so I said

769
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:39,010
ettercap and so I ran the first one

770
00:35:39,010 --> 00:35:40,960
which is art poisoning and found some

771
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:44,620
really weird stuff happened my capture

772
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:46,120
traffic on a me report I was using a

773
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:48,340
protocol called ethernet/ip this is not

774
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:51,190
ethernet/ip that we know this is

775
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:53,380
ethernet industrial protocol this is a

776
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:56,050
trademark name very bad name but it is

777
00:35:56,050 --> 00:35:58,660
what it is and running a 10 millisecond

778
00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:00,250
frequency and I was running the Manimal

779
00:36:00,250 --> 00:36:02,380
attack against the controller itself so

780
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:04,840
I was actually trying to mess with the

781
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:07,030
community the commands coming from the

782
00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:10,580
controller to the i/o block itself

783
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:13,470
so this is the communication actually

784
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:16,830
from the i/o block back to the

785
00:36:16,830 --> 00:36:20,880
controller and again this was I think

786
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:23,369
this is baseline but again the i/o block

787
00:36:23,369 --> 00:36:25,619
didn't notice that the man in the middle

788
00:36:25,619 --> 00:36:27,480
attack was going on for the entire time

789
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:29,480
I was running didn't have any problems

790
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:32,430
now this is one I actually ran the man

791
00:36:32,430 --> 00:36:33,930
in the middle attack against the idea

792
00:36:33,930 --> 00:36:36,780
the PLC controller itself so again I

793
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:39,119
have this nice relatively stable

794
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:41,540
connection at 10 milliseconds and then

795
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:44,100
this is where I ran the man the middle

796
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:46,290
attack and if you see there's something

797
00:36:46,290 --> 00:36:48,420
happened there well what happened this

798
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:53,609
is actually the PLC itself did not even

799
00:36:53,609 --> 00:36:56,580
know that the attack was going on it was

800
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:59,760
too stupid to know it just said I'm

801
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:02,609
sending my data I'm sending my data it

802
00:37:02,609 --> 00:37:04,890
never even knew that the mantle attack

803
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:07,950
was going and this is likely due to the

804
00:37:07,950 --> 00:37:10,740
fact that this protocol actually uses a

805
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:14,850
multicast signal for this this guy

806
00:37:14,850 --> 00:37:17,430
actually transmits over multicast back

807
00:37:17,430 --> 00:37:19,920
to the controller and that's actually

808
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,900
for a it's actually for performance

809
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:23,880
reasons because this guy could actually

810
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:25,230
be talking to a controller could be

811
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:26,760
talking on hm I could be talking about

812
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:29,130
historian and you don't want to send

813
00:37:29,130 --> 00:37:31,920
three individual packets out there you

814
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:34,440
want to send one from this i/o block and

815
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:36,660
have everyone just listen in on that

816
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:37,740
just like you would for video

817
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:40,500
conferencing her things like that so the

818
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:41,700
protocol is designed to actually

819
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:45,210
transmit multicast out this guy listens

820
00:37:45,210 --> 00:37:48,270
to it and because this guy continued to

821
00:37:48,270 --> 00:37:50,970
transmit over multicast he had already

822
00:37:50,970 --> 00:37:52,830
set up and said I'm going to listen to

823
00:37:52,830 --> 00:37:54,510
your multicast he didn't even know

824
00:37:54,510 --> 00:37:55,619
anything happened with a

825
00:37:55,619 --> 00:37:58,350
man-in-the-middle attack so with this

826
00:37:58,350 --> 00:38:00,990
there actually was I think three

827
00:38:00,990 --> 00:38:03,660
additional packets in here because of

828
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:05,490
the way I had had the vm set up I don't

829
00:38:05,490 --> 00:38:08,900
think I set it up properly but there was

830
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:11,490
yeah so there was a there was a large

831
00:38:11,490 --> 00:38:13,890
there was a couple different streams of

832
00:38:13,890 --> 00:38:17,490
extra traffic in here and I've actually

833
00:38:17,490 --> 00:38:20,040
signed up for Delaware to talk in more

834
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:21,920
in depth about this whole

835
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:23,809
the middle attack so if you're in the

836
00:38:23,809 --> 00:38:25,280
area i'm going to try and talk at that

837
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:30,460
besides delaware about that um and then

838
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:33,770
when i actually isolated the plc traffic

839
00:38:33,770 --> 00:38:35,450
from the man in the middle attack itself

840
00:38:35,450 --> 00:38:37,220
in in wireshark i was able to go and

841
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:38,869
stripped down into just looking at them

842
00:38:38,869 --> 00:38:41,059
the plc traffic it so if it didn't

843
00:38:41,059 --> 00:38:43,190
notice anything even happened it didn't

844
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:45,020
blip-it nothing happened at all it was a

845
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:46,490
nice straight line across the whole

846
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:50,510
thing and then what i did from there is

847
00:38:50,510 --> 00:38:52,309
i actually wrote some editor caps

848
00:38:52,309 --> 00:38:55,819
scripts to change the actual command

849
00:38:55,819 --> 00:38:58,640
signals to the PLC or to the to the ayah

850
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:01,760
blog so when issued when it actually

851
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:04,069
went and was trying to turn these lights

852
00:39:04,069 --> 00:39:06,920
on and off I basically switched it to

853
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:10,430
the other light so you'd push the green

854
00:39:10,430 --> 00:39:12,309
one in the red button would light up

855
00:39:12,309 --> 00:39:15,890
things like that so but and I did this

856
00:39:15,890 --> 00:39:18,440
all in the man and middle attack again

857
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:20,299
the PLC didn't even notice anything was

858
00:39:20,299 --> 00:39:24,079
going on there's a sequence number in in

859
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:26,150
the traffic stream to actually go and

860
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:28,790
and basically identify the packets so

861
00:39:28,790 --> 00:39:31,460
that if you get one that's out of at

862
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:34,460
because it's multicast it's not TC it's

863
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:36,859
not using TCP it's using UDP so again

864
00:39:36,859 --> 00:39:38,359
you don't have that session information

865
00:39:38,359 --> 00:39:40,250
to actually make sure you've got this

866
00:39:40,250 --> 00:39:41,690
your session coming in the right order

867
00:39:41,690 --> 00:39:44,359
so that's actually handled by the

868
00:39:44,359 --> 00:39:46,010
industrial protocol and the industrial

869
00:39:46,010 --> 00:39:47,990
protocol can be spoofed by basically

870
00:39:47,990 --> 00:39:49,910
just advancing the sequence number out

871
00:39:49,910 --> 00:39:54,049
of out of range so you can actually get

872
00:39:54,049 --> 00:39:55,670
it to basically forget about what's

873
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:58,670
going on I know I just to try it out and

874
00:39:58,670 --> 00:40:00,589
see what happened I actually ran my

875
00:40:00,589 --> 00:40:02,750
capture files through virustotal network

876
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:09,260
liner and bro oh cool thank so yeah I I

877
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:10,730
did bring it with me I just didn't bring

878
00:40:10,730 --> 00:40:14,119
it in the room the so I ran it through

879
00:40:14,119 --> 00:40:16,490
virustotal virus noddles notice the ICMP

880
00:40:16,490 --> 00:40:17,809
ping messages but it didn't actually

881
00:40:17,809 --> 00:40:20,960
trigger on an alert network minor and

882
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,609
bro both did not trigger on an alert

883
00:40:22,609 --> 00:40:24,530
either when I was doing that I didn't

884
00:40:24,530 --> 00:40:26,930
run art watch against this but I'm not

885
00:40:26,930 --> 00:40:28,609
sure what that would have shown I just

886
00:40:28,609 --> 00:40:30,260
didn't have didn't have enough time to

887
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:33,430
actually run it before I came here

888
00:40:39,390 --> 00:40:43,240
well it's it's an issue to deal with

889
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:45,549
that it wouldn't it didn't even notice

890
00:40:45,549 --> 00:40:49,890
the it didn't even notice the the ARP

891
00:40:49,890 --> 00:40:55,920
the rearming of the system at all so um

892
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:59,650
so and it sounds good if you're doing it

893
00:40:59,650 --> 00:41:02,880
great it doesn't cover everything though

894
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:05,799
and especially when you're down at the

895
00:41:05,799 --> 00:41:08,940
lower levels of ICS skate and networking

896
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:13,299
it really it can be it can be difficult

897
00:41:13,299 --> 00:41:16,289
to deal with and then there are

898
00:41:16,289 --> 00:41:20,559
relatively easy ways to measure network

899
00:41:20,559 --> 00:41:22,240
reliability for industrial control

900
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:24,579
systems the tools exist there freely

901
00:41:24,579 --> 00:41:29,019
available and as I said there there are

902
00:41:29,019 --> 00:41:31,779
some people that are actually trying to

903
00:41:31,779 --> 00:41:33,819
do some investigation down at the lower

904
00:41:33,819 --> 00:41:42,538
level so that's my information yes

905
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:53,450
the question was how we actually found

906
00:41:53,450 --> 00:41:55,460
anything malicious in industrial control

907
00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:56,450
system that we've gone in and done

908
00:41:56,450 --> 00:42:00,410
assessments yes we found active malware

909
00:42:00,410 --> 00:42:03,910
on some systems and then we also found

910
00:42:03,910 --> 00:42:06,860
things that alerted as active malware

911
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:10,010
but we're actually false positives to we

912
00:42:10,010 --> 00:42:11,480
found actually you'll find a lot more

913
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:13,550
false positives than you were then you

914
00:42:13,550 --> 00:42:16,850
will active malware but I we have found

915
00:42:16,850 --> 00:42:18,620
active malware on systems and a lot of

916
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:23,120
times it's it's where they did not

917
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:26,920
protect or they didn't prevent the

918
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:30,020
operators from loading web pages and

919
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:33,410
plugging in their devices into the state

920
00:42:33,410 --> 00:42:36,890
the operator stations so if they didn't

921
00:42:36,890 --> 00:42:38,780
have their firewall lock down to not

922
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:40,820
allow web traffic through then what

923
00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:42,290
happens a lot of times as they will

924
00:42:42,290 --> 00:42:46,190
introduce stuff by visiting whatever

925
00:42:46,190 --> 00:42:48,950
they go to and and it's sad to say but

926
00:42:48,950 --> 00:42:52,760
it's not uncommon to see porn on HMIS in

927
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:55,570
industrial control systems or other

928
00:42:55,570 --> 00:43:01,690
weird places that people have visited so

929
00:43:06,230 --> 00:43:11,600
um it is actually on so we haven't

930
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:14,060
noticed like malware down at that lower

931
00:43:14,060 --> 00:43:16,760
level but we've noticed strange things

932
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:18,700
happening let's just put it that way

933
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:21,590
some of the industrial controllers have

934
00:43:21,590 --> 00:43:27,440
USB ports on them and when the operator

935
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:29,510
gets just has to sit in front of that

936
00:43:29,510 --> 00:43:32,960
system for 24 like eight hours a day and

937
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:35,690
they want to charge their cell phone but

938
00:43:35,690 --> 00:43:37,369
they haven't been told not to plug that

939
00:43:37,369 --> 00:43:40,520
into the hmr to the controller itself

940
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:44,119
they will do stupid human tricks and you

941
00:43:44,119 --> 00:43:45,859
will sometimes see weird things

942
00:43:45,859 --> 00:43:49,040
happening to the network at that point a

943
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:50,540
lot of times it's easier to actually

944
00:43:50,540 --> 00:43:52,790
just reflash it than it is to try and

945
00:43:52,790 --> 00:43:55,640
fix whatever's going on so if they start

946
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:57,800
seeing weird things happening with the

947
00:43:57,800 --> 00:43:59,359
network they will actually most times

948
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:03,590
just re upload the latest firmware of

949
00:44:03,590 --> 00:44:05,900
that device and the latest program and

950
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:13,359
that's it so it's rare that you will see

951
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:17,240
ICS forensics down at the controller and

952
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:21,710
lower levels at for the HMIS and pc

953
00:44:21,710 --> 00:44:24,800
based systems yes but you're not going

954
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:26,240
to you're not going to see the FBI

955
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:28,400
knocking on your door and saying let me

956
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:31,100
see your plc they just don't know what

957
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:33,170
to do with that another thing too is

958
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:36,109
that that plc has to stay powered in

959
00:44:36,109 --> 00:44:38,150
order to get the forensics off of it

960
00:44:38,150 --> 00:44:40,310
properly and there there don't there

961
00:44:40,310 --> 00:44:42,740
isn't a really good way to do memory

962
00:44:42,740 --> 00:44:45,130
mapping on devices that don't have

963
00:44:45,130 --> 00:44:48,590
standard memory and standard interfaces

964
00:44:48,590 --> 00:44:52,730
so you can't do a lot of that and as it

965
00:44:52,730 --> 00:44:55,100
is the firmware for these devices is

966
00:44:55,100 --> 00:44:57,590
getting loaded into NVR into nvram

967
00:44:57,590 --> 00:45:00,080
anyway so they'll just like reflash with

968
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:02,060
what the vendor gave them to begin with

969
00:45:02,060 --> 00:45:08,750
and be done with it so I are is not they

970
00:45:08,750 --> 00:45:11,420
don't do a lot of IR and forensics in

971
00:45:11,420 --> 00:45:13,580
the ICS space simply because the devices

972
00:45:13,580 --> 00:45:16,840
just don't have that capability

973
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:27,180
um so the question was about targeted

974
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:29,250
threats did they consider themselves to

975
00:45:29,250 --> 00:45:32,369
be targeted threats some do so I know

976
00:45:32,369 --> 00:45:34,530
Anonymous has a pile and they've got

977
00:45:34,530 --> 00:45:35,819
some of those kind of things where they

978
00:45:35,819 --> 00:45:38,540
will attack they will actively go after

979
00:45:38,540 --> 00:45:42,630
those kind of companies and there's

980
00:45:42,630 --> 00:45:46,109
always pick your malicious actor country

981
00:45:46,109 --> 00:45:50,280
and you'll see all sorts of warnings

982
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:54,030
from ICS certain DHS and oh my god

983
00:45:54,030 --> 00:45:57,780
cybers and they're coming to get us they

984
00:45:57,780 --> 00:46:01,950
there's been a lot of that talk outside

985
00:46:01,950 --> 00:46:05,160
of Stuxnet which was perpetrated by

986
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:07,380
certain countries that we happen to

987
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:12,270
maybe reside in there aren't too many of

988
00:46:12,270 --> 00:46:17,760
those going on it it you'll hear a lot

989
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:18,960
of stuff and you'll hear a lot of fun

990
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:23,390
about everyone's coming to tea at us and

991
00:46:23,390 --> 00:46:27,059
this country and other countries are

992
00:46:27,059 --> 00:46:29,190
coming and Isis is coming and everyone's

993
00:46:29,190 --> 00:46:34,500
coming to get us there is some true to

994
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:39,690
that they did find controllers in I mean

995
00:46:39,690 --> 00:46:41,609
they found like manuals for controllers

996
00:46:41,609 --> 00:46:43,490
they found actual hardware in

997
00:46:43,490 --> 00:46:45,869
Afghanistan when they like did the whole

998
00:46:45,869 --> 00:46:47,549
bombing of that mountain they found

999
00:46:47,549 --> 00:46:50,010
stuff in there they found stuff when

1000
00:46:50,010 --> 00:46:51,390
they've gone in to investigate a lot of

1001
00:46:51,390 --> 00:46:53,040
things you can get a lot of stuff on

1002
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:55,950
eBay I mean it's not that hard to get

1003
00:46:55,950 --> 00:46:59,730
and it's the same equipment for decades

1004
00:46:59,730 --> 00:47:02,220
so if you find something in there it's

1005
00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:03,630
not uncommon to find that same

1006
00:47:03,630 --> 00:47:06,630
vulnerability in there for years again

1007
00:47:06,630 --> 00:47:08,460
it doesn't benefit the vendors in a lot

1008
00:47:08,460 --> 00:47:10,740
of cases in these things to actually go

1009
00:47:10,740 --> 00:47:13,950
out there and try and fix problems too

1010
00:47:13,950 --> 00:47:16,440
it's not like the vendor shaming that

1011
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:19,170
happens in the IT world a lot of this

1012
00:47:19,170 --> 00:47:20,819
stuff actually gets hidden behind closed

1013
00:47:20,819 --> 00:47:23,730
doors because it does affect real things

1014
00:47:23,730 --> 00:47:27,599
and there is a real boom factor and big

1015
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:29,940
clouds of ethyl methyl death and stuff

1016
00:47:29,940 --> 00:47:34,230
like that so that stuff a lot of times

1017
00:47:34,230 --> 00:47:37,079
is actually held closer to the chest by

1018
00:47:37,079 --> 00:47:37,960
these companies be

1019
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:46,720
they don't want to release it out any

1020
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:49,070
more questions

1021
00:47:49,070 --> 00:47:52,030
thank you very much
