podium I will literally explode I'm

4
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:10,110
highly caffeinated I apologize for that

5
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:13,500
but I think it'll be to the benefit for

6
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,109
all of us um thank you for spending your

7
00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:18,270
afternoon this is the last talk of the

8
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:19,800
day from what I understand before the

9
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:23,519
hackfest the drinking and other party

10
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:24,930
stuff going on so thank you for spending

11
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:26,699
it with me I do appreciate it

12
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:29,130
um this is a little bit about me I am a

13
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:31,529
standards instructor or Nova hacker yeah

14
00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:33,149
I know but Nova hackers anybody else oh

15
00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:36,059
look at all you good um so I'm a Nova

16
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:37,380
hacker

17
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:39,960
I am also somebody that really enjoys

18
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:43,170
doing open source intelligence on other

19
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:45,870
people um some people refer to this as

20
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:50,460
stalking I prefer to call it open source

21
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:52,949
investigations um I'm a backpacker I

22
00:00:52,949 --> 00:00:55,250
love the Appalachian Trail as well um

23
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:58,230
this talk is not a highly technical talk

24
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:01,129
it's more of a talk to get people

25
00:01:01,129 --> 00:01:03,930
understanding what the risks of online

26
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:06,450
activity are okay we're going to go

27
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:08,159
through some web application stuff and

28
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:10,409
of course I need to throw this up there

29
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:12,659
um I am representing myself Michael

30
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:15,450
Hoffman not my employers so my words are

31
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:18,320
my own and so I have a question for you

32
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,939
I'm going to do a little survey and find

33
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:23,850
out what your comfort level is with

34
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:26,750
information on the Internet okay so

35
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:29,159
let's find out what information you're

36
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:31,470
uncomfortable with people in the world

37
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:35,009
knowing so on the Internet would you be

38
00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:38,009
uncomfortable if other people knew your

39
00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:40,049
name your address and your phone number

40
00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:41,579
just raise your hand if you're

41
00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:42,810
uncomfortable with people knowing that

42
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:45,210
okay some people out there that's cool

43
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:47,460
um you know there is the the white pages

44
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:49,470
and phone books and stuff we used to get

45
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:52,229
this huge book in the mail for those of

46
00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:53,579
you that are older you remember the

47
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:54,299
white pages

48
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:56,399
um that's out there that's kind of

49
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,920
public information that stuff we can't

50
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,200
control we're going to talk more about

51
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,229
that later in the talk but what about

52
00:02:03,229 --> 00:02:06,930
where you work now in this area some

53
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:09,090
people are not allowed to have other

54
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:10,919
people know where they work right just

55
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:12,150
raise your hand if you're one of those

56
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:14,170
people

57
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:16,700
it's getting late in the day might have

58
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:19,489
gotten somebody but yeah I mean your

59
00:02:19,489 --> 00:02:21,500
places of work some places don't want

60
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,230
you telling where you're working and so

61
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:25,549
especially if you're an instant

62
00:02:25,549 --> 00:02:27,440
responder or defender you don't want

63
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,299
people to know that your defender for a

64
00:02:29,299 --> 00:02:31,069
certain company because you might get

65
00:02:31,069 --> 00:02:33,500
targeted your personal account might get

66
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:37,010
targeted let's take another step into

67
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:40,280
the creepy what if people on the

68
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:43,879
internet had pictures of your kids your

69
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:46,790
pets family would that freak out some

70
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:48,349
people I know this is starting to get

71
00:02:48,349 --> 00:02:50,569
into that quasi area and what about had

72
00:02:50,569 --> 00:02:53,900
pictures or videos inside your house now

73
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:56,980
that's starting to get freaky right okay

74
00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:00,500
well up until recently I stopped here

75
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:03,799
but we do have another thing that's out

76
00:03:03,799 --> 00:03:05,420
there and I think some of you know about

77
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:06,650
the data breaches I'm talking about

78
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:08,150
we'll get to that in just a second but

79
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:10,340
if somebody knew this I think people

80
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:12,620
would really have some some problems

81
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:14,170
right if they could tie that back to you

82
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:18,680
at the embarrassing when we sign up for

83
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,720
a council on the internet when we sign

84
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,849
up for Facebook or Twitter or Instagram

85
00:03:22,849 --> 00:03:25,519
so we have the option of securing that

86
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:29,989
data we have the option of making that

87
00:03:29,989 --> 00:03:33,139
data private or public for the whole

88
00:03:33,139 --> 00:03:36,680
world to see by default it usually is

89
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:39,169
public right we have to take action to

90
00:03:39,169 --> 00:03:42,019
make it private and you know what if I

91
00:03:42,019 --> 00:03:44,629
have to authenticate to a website in

92
00:03:44,629 --> 00:03:46,040
order to post data

93
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:50,540
I expect that the service provider does

94
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:53,030
something to protect my data make sure

95
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:55,280
that only I or the people that I want

96
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,260
the people in my circles or my groups or

97
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:59,449
my friends or whatever only they can see

98
00:03:59,449 --> 00:04:00,980
the stuff that I want them to see I

99
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:02,629
don't want them sharing it with the

100
00:04:02,629 --> 00:04:06,650
entire world otherwise I just tweeted so

101
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:10,849
here's a question how does our data get

102
00:04:10,849 --> 00:04:13,430
divulged to the entire world well

103
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:14,599
there's a couple of different ways in

104
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:15,949
the first way which you're probably very

105
00:04:15,949 --> 00:04:18,889
familiar with is companies have created

106
00:04:18,889 --> 00:04:22,789
a business model where my data becomes

107
00:04:22,789 --> 00:04:26,180
their price point it provides money for

108
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:27,150
their company

109
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:29,759
um this is something that happens

110
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:31,770
RadioShack went into bankruptcy they're

111
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:34,259
like damn what do we have resistors LEDs

112
00:04:34,259 --> 00:04:36,240
oh we had this huge customer list with

113
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,160
all of the things that Michael likes to

114
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,860
buy how about somebody buy this nobody

115
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:42,900
wanted it but that was a prune thing

116
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:45,810
that they could have sold all right what

117
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:48,090
about this stuff people stealing our

118
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:50,789
data all the time now we seem to have

119
00:04:50,789 --> 00:04:52,620
this I don't know if you remember number

120
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:53,910
of years ago there used to be this

121
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:55,259
hacker safe badge

122
00:04:55,259 --> 00:04:56,970
I know it's still out there on some

123
00:04:56,970 --> 00:04:58,620
websites and you see it's like hacker

124
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:01,470
safe no one can hack this site okay

125
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:03,360
that's cool now it's almost like I

126
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,740
expect to see right next to that is

127
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:07,530
we've been hacked three times yeah yeah

128
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:09,330
because it's like a badge of honor now

129
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:11,760
to be hacked to have your data so

130
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:14,039
important that hackers have targeted you

131
00:05:14,039 --> 00:05:16,080
broken into the systems and then spread

132
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:20,270
all the data throughout the internet in

133
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:23,160
fact some of the breaches and some of

134
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,979
the information that's out there is

135
00:05:24,979 --> 00:05:28,080
highly personal information that nobody

136
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,750
expected that it ever got out there on

137
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:33,120
the internet right hey there's a website

138
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,370
out there for people that want to cheat

139
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:37,320
on their spouses now there are reasons

140
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,270
why people did this I read some of the

141
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:40,410
comments and some of the things and

142
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:43,620
there are legitimate reasons but that

143
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:46,610
stuff is personal it is kind of private

144
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:48,840
but it gets out there on the internet

145
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,720
and then we have the other category

146
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,449
which is the oops category where

147
00:05:54,449 --> 00:05:57,750
companies buy an actually by mistake by

148
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:02,310
accident have divulged our data or bits

149
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:04,500
of our data to the rest of the world and

150
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,909
what I want to do is go through an

151
00:06:05,909 --> 00:06:08,430
example of this with you to show you

152
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:11,010
that sometimes these vulnerabilities are

153
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:13,080
still out there and this is how we tie

154
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,990
in the open source intelligence with the

155
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:20,400
web so one day I went for a bicycle ride

156
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,800
with one of my friends and no I wasn't

157
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,570
in Paris or anything like that but that

158
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:26,490
was a good picture of bicycle riders um

159
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:30,570
so after the ride she sent me an email

160
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:32,490
and said hey Micah just wanted you to

161
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:34,979
know I used this cool app called Strava

162
00:06:34,979 --> 00:06:38,370
and what Strava does is it was running

163
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:39,529
on my phone and

164
00:06:39,529 --> 00:06:42,229
created a geographical map of where we

165
00:06:42,229 --> 00:06:44,749
Road and you can access it by just

166
00:06:44,749 --> 00:06:46,879
clicking this link and as a security

167
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:48,529
reach researcher what do I do

168
00:06:48,529 --> 00:06:52,489
I click links so I clicked it don't you

169
00:06:52,489 --> 00:06:55,279
guys so I clicked it and what did I see

170
00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:57,769
I saw this it was like ah this is cool

171
00:06:57,769 --> 00:06:59,809
that's exactly where we Road and and

172
00:06:59,809 --> 00:07:01,999
here's a map and there's how far we went

173
00:07:01,999 --> 00:07:04,599
ten nineteen point two miles that's cool

174
00:07:04,599 --> 00:07:09,049
wait a second I looked at the URL and

175
00:07:09,049 --> 00:07:11,029
the URL looks something like this was

176
00:07:11,029 --> 00:07:11,409
like

177
00:07:11,409 --> 00:07:14,359
I didn't have to authenticate to get at

178
00:07:14,359 --> 00:07:16,789
this data I click the link I went to

179
00:07:16,789 --> 00:07:19,759
this site which has an integer on the

180
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:23,089
end so I started thinking and I know

181
00:07:23,089 --> 00:07:24,169
that some of you were thinking the same

182
00:07:24,169 --> 00:07:25,789
thing I see your smiles so it's like

183
00:07:25,789 --> 00:07:28,309
well if I could just get it get to my

184
00:07:28,309 --> 00:07:30,739
event by clicking on one number what

185
00:07:30,739 --> 00:07:32,359
would happen if I incremented that

186
00:07:32,359 --> 00:07:35,029
number or decremented it and sure enough

187
00:07:35,029 --> 00:07:37,669
if I went ahead and did that I found

188
00:07:37,669 --> 00:07:39,259
that I got different events different

189
00:07:39,259 --> 00:07:42,919
activities oh this is probably not

190
00:07:42,919 --> 00:07:44,599
something that they wanted to do so I

191
00:07:44,599 --> 00:07:46,399
looked in the page code a little bit and

192
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:48,409
I saw that not only could I do this with

193
00:07:48,409 --> 00:07:50,659
activities but I could do this with

194
00:07:50,659 --> 00:07:53,629
athletes as well so here I have two

195
00:07:53,629 --> 00:07:56,809
different athletes and but I think I

196
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:59,360
have Zach and Eric whoa that's pretty

197
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,059
cool well if there's a fleet and

198
00:08:02,059 --> 00:08:04,069
activities is there other stuff in the

199
00:08:04,069 --> 00:08:06,649
code so I'm going to solve a webpage and

200
00:08:06,649 --> 00:08:08,779
I looked at it and if you right-click on

201
00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:10,399
the page you can look at the source code

202
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:12,949
of the page looking at the source code

203
00:08:12,949 --> 00:08:15,799
now I put in these colored boxes if you

204
00:08:15,799 --> 00:08:17,239
do the source code you're not going to

205
00:08:17,239 --> 00:08:19,909
see the boxes but the day is there I had

206
00:08:19,909 --> 00:08:21,499
one person come after me you can come up

207
00:08:21,499 --> 00:08:23,239
afterwards like I see it on my phone but

208
00:08:23,239 --> 00:08:26,059
I don't see any boxes yeah that's magic

209
00:08:26,059 --> 00:08:26,899
of PowerPoint

210
00:08:26,899 --> 00:08:30,949
so um so I hat I saw this data I was

211
00:08:30,949 --> 00:08:33,529
like wow there's actually a ton of data

212
00:08:33,529 --> 00:08:36,259
that I didn't have to authenticate to

213
00:08:36,259 --> 00:08:39,979
get that is being disclosed with every

214
00:08:39,979 --> 00:08:42,169
page that's out there now what Strava

215
00:08:42,169 --> 00:08:44,779
does is it may or may not present this

216
00:08:44,779 --> 00:08:47,990
to you in the web browser it doesn't

217
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:50,360
mean that you can't see it doesn't mean

218
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,519
that's not being transmitted just you

219
00:08:52,519 --> 00:08:53,450
don't see it so I was like

220
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:57,290
well I'm a cissp and so I'm like I have

221
00:08:57,290 --> 00:08:58,790
to do the right thing you know that that

222
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:02,240
badge of honor and I said Strava you

223
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,459
know I don't use your application but I

224
00:09:04,459 --> 00:09:06,589
saw this vulnerability I wanted you to

225
00:09:06,589 --> 00:09:08,480
know that you're using integers it's

226
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,850
really easy to find all this data bad

227
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:13,010
people could do that things with this

228
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:15,380
and I want you to know there's a good

229
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:18,139
way to change this and strawberry back

230
00:09:18,139 --> 00:09:19,970
and says well thank you very much for

231
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:22,670
for your email um we think that we're

232
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:26,449
doing okay but thanks very much no we

233
00:09:26,449 --> 00:09:28,519
don't have to change anything it's like

234
00:09:28,519 --> 00:09:31,459
well wait a second so I can do all these

235
00:09:31,459 --> 00:09:34,579
things and you don't think that we

236
00:09:34,579 --> 00:09:37,250
should change so I said to him that's

237
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:38,959
like well if you don't think there's a

238
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:41,149
problem would you mind if I did a talk

239
00:09:41,149 --> 00:09:44,510
on this and they were like yeah you can

240
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:46,550
do a talk thanks you know we have

241
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:48,680
security settings where people can

242
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,449
restrict certain information they can

243
00:09:50,449 --> 00:09:53,120
throw that privacy bit so we're cool

244
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,490
with you making a talk about this and I

245
00:09:55,490 --> 00:10:01,100
thought to myself sir so I was like yeah

246
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,440
okay game on let's make a talk about

247
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,800
this so that's tight take a quick look

248
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,140
at pry at the privacy bit that you throw

249
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:11,870
on the Strava website it's a master

250
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:14,930
switch it's on or it's off who thinks

251
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:19,070
that it's off by default yeah yeah your

252
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:21,890
public your data is public so if you

253
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:24,769
throw this master switch to protect your

254
00:10:24,769 --> 00:10:28,209
data your name will be anonymized now

255
00:10:28,209 --> 00:10:31,130
anonymizing your name means just getting

256
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:32,930
the last the first initial of your last

257
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:36,189
name not the whole name

258
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,420
and then only Strava athletes that you

259
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:42,670
approve can follow you and I like the

260
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:44,770
last one here only approved followers

261
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:46,560
can see and download your activities

262
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:52,720
whoo boy am I glad of that so I went to

263
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:59,290
Google and I typed in Strava dot-com /

264
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:02,860
activities Google knows - about 25

265
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:05,500
million of these activities now I'm not

266
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,120
sure about this but if we go one slide

267
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,760
back I'm not sure I approved Google to

268
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:13,360
go ahead and harvest all my data so uh

269
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:16,630
so since Google had all of this data

270
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:19,420
I thought Strava must be okay with me

271
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:25,120
grabbing all that data yeah so so how

272
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,100
can I get it and I didn't grab all the

273
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:28,480
data I would I must admit

274
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,040
Verizon would probably have a problem

275
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:32,740
with my bandwidth while I'm sucking it

276
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:35,470
all down so if we look at the webpage

277
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:38,860
itself um we again go into the source

278
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:40,960
code and we can see that certain fields

279
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:43,090
are here right activity ID eighty

280
00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:45,810
thousand and one activity type ride

281
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:49,330
these things are easily parsed out using

282
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:52,210
a script Python Perl Ruby whatever you

283
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:55,690
want to do I'm a web guy so I use a

284
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:59,290
web-based tool or a tool for um for

285
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:02,500
looking at web sites that tool that I

286
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,870
used is called burp suite and what we

287
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:07,180
can do with the pro version of burp

288
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:11,350
suite is we can tell it that we want to

289
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:14,830
change one section of a request all

290
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:17,440
right so this is activities I want to

291
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,390
change this number from 80,000 and

292
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:22,480
here's what I want you to do burp burp

293
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,310
suite I want you to change it pick a

294
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:27,940
random number between 80,000 and 240

295
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:29,890
million because at the time that I wrote

296
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:33,100
this there were over 240 million

297
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,600
activities out there on the Internet

298
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:38,200
well guy I told burp sweet to go ahead

299
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,690
and grab two hundred thousand events

300
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:42,970
make two hundred thousand requests my

301
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:44,950
thought was I could create a master

302
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:47,800
dictionary see I couldn't go ahead and

303
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,839
say just give me all of john doe's rides

304
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:51,279
that's not how the

305
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:53,230
this vulnerability will work but what I

306
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:56,019
can do is I can request two hundred

307
00:12:56,019 --> 00:12:59,610
thousand activities and hope that I get

308
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:03,269
multiple activities from the same person

309
00:13:03,269 --> 00:13:07,120
so I went ahead and did that now I want

310
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,129
this to pull out certain pieces of

311
00:13:09,129 --> 00:13:10,990
information sorry if this is getting

312
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:12,999
technical this is as technical as the

313
00:13:12,999 --> 00:13:16,420
talk gets so I tell it hey in this area

314
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:17,829
I want to go ahead and pull that

315
00:13:17,829 --> 00:13:19,629
information and put it into a column and

316
00:13:19,629 --> 00:13:21,459
I do that for a whole bunch of different

317
00:13:21,459 --> 00:13:24,220
sections then I hit the Go button and I

318
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:26,410
get this which is an Excel spreadsheet

319
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:30,999
with over 800,000 entries excellent um

320
00:13:30,999 --> 00:13:33,370
so I did it multiple times I did the two

321
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:34,809
hundred thousand multiple times and then

322
00:13:34,809 --> 00:13:36,550
there were some overlaps and some errors

323
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:38,589
and stuff but over time I got over eight

324
00:13:38,589 --> 00:13:42,129
hundred thousand entries who this is

325
00:13:42,129 --> 00:13:44,559
what they look like so I have what type

326
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:47,439
I have the athlete ID the name gender

327
00:13:47,439 --> 00:13:51,209
and the profile which will come back to

328
00:13:51,209 --> 00:13:55,569
so putting on my attacker hat I thought

329
00:13:55,569 --> 00:13:58,300
what can I do with this data if somebody

330
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:00,279
were to harvest all of these records

331
00:14:00,279 --> 00:14:03,189
from Strava what would they do and the

332
00:14:03,189 --> 00:14:04,870
answer that I came up was threefold one

333
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:07,750
find patterns of behavior if I had that

334
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,879
description field that shows your

335
00:14:09,879 --> 00:14:11,589
description for the ride or I'm not

336
00:14:11,589 --> 00:14:13,449
saying that any of you use Strava but I

337
00:14:13,449 --> 00:14:15,100
was in California I was giving this talk

338
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:17,559
and I was thinking when we travel is out

339
00:14:17,559 --> 00:14:19,059
here in California excuse me does

340
00:14:19,059 --> 00:14:23,290
anybody work at Strava no good um scared

341
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:24,759
me for a second other than end up in

342
00:14:24,759 --> 00:14:28,000
handcuffs or something um so one find

343
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,709
patterns could I find people going to

344
00:14:29,709 --> 00:14:32,500
and from work to and from home that

345
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:35,139
might be interesting could I find the

346
00:14:35,139 --> 00:14:38,110
real person you know Strava anonymizes

347
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:40,300
the name if they astronomies the name

348
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:42,269
does that really provide you protection

349
00:14:42,269 --> 00:14:45,790
hmm and then I just decided to look at

350
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:48,160
the data and see what's there let the

351
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,129
data drive what I'm looking for and what

352
00:14:51,129 --> 00:14:54,689
my analysis is let's take a step back

353
00:14:54,689 --> 00:14:57,699
open source intelligence or OS int or

354
00:14:57,699 --> 00:15:01,629
OSINT is really just doing things that

355
00:15:01,629 --> 00:15:03,759
we do on a normal basis you want to

356
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:05,500
research a company to invest

357
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,870
you want to research your school a new

358
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:10,930
partner a friend somebody else that

359
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:12,660
you've met on the internet or something

360
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:15,490
you google it or DuckDuckGo it or

361
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:17,380
something like that that's open source

362
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:19,450
investigation seeing what the

363
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:21,610
information out there that's on the

364
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:24,280
Internet provides about something the

365
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:26,800
most important part of this is the

366
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:30,550
analyze getting the information is

367
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:33,400
really easy anybody can Google it's what

368
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:36,300
you Bleen out of it that's so important

369
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:39,280
what can people do with it while there's

370
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:40,660
a ton of things that they can do but

371
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:42,240
these are just my top five things

372
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,840
identity theft

373
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,220
if I can find out enough information

374
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:47,140
about you maybe I can find what school

375
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:49,030
you went to or the name of your first

376
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:51,100
pad or your your favorite teacher I

377
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:52,990
don't know people put crazy things in

378
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:55,090
their blogs and other things on their

379
00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:58,300
Facebook pages and youtubes um could I

380
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:00,100
since I have geographic information

381
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:02,440
about where you do your rides or your

382
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:05,830
runs or your walks maybe somebody could

383
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:08,770
stalk you or or wait for you as you walk

384
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:10,720
around the lake and then physically

385
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,970
assault somebody somebody that could

386
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:15,220
happen social engineering social

387
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:16,210
engineering is all about gaining

388
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:18,820
somebody's trust right it's me gaining

389
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:20,860
your trust and then exploiting that

390
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:23,830
trust to some end will show you that a

391
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:26,020
little bit later on how easy it is in

392
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:30,010
certain situations to do that with the

393
00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:32,140
disclosure of the Ashley Madison and the

394
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:34,060
Adult Friend Finder information and even

395
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:37,660
OPM data how about extortion and

396
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:39,790
espionage those are some prime things

397
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:41,110
that people can do with this and then of

398
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:42,940
course dating now I've been out of the

399
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:45,700
dating market for a long time and but I

400
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,170
am told that one of the first things

401
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:48,490
that happens now when you meet somebody

402
00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:50,830
is you look up what their online profile

403
00:16:50,830 --> 00:16:53,410
is if that's your key if that's a case

404
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:54,880
for somebody out in the audience I'm

405
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,710
going to show you a really easy way to

406
00:16:56,710 --> 00:17:00,460
do that very quickly that's safe it's

407
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:02,770
like so let's go back to those questions

408
00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:04,000
that I asked and take a look at the

409
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Strava data alright so let's see if we

410
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,209
can find repeated activities by the same

411
00:17:10,209 --> 00:17:13,089
people in the Strava data what I found

412
00:17:13,089 --> 00:17:14,230
was that you don't even have to go to

413
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:16,449
Strava Google knows about these things

414
00:17:16,449 --> 00:17:17,599
already like

415
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:19,939
all right well if I started doing that

416
00:17:19,939 --> 00:17:23,000
that would be I mean that that's bad

417
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,880
enough but let's go to my data and I did

418
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,829
find that this is my Excel spreadsheet I

419
00:17:27,829 --> 00:17:30,500
did find that yeah we found Aaron Turner

420
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:34,700
went to work and and Alex h-he went to

421
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:36,380
work and this is what some of it looks

422
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:40,820
like here we have Aaron Turner commuting

423
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:42,919
to work he started here he finished

424
00:17:42,919 --> 00:17:45,110
their lives in Sydney Australia well

425
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:48,320
that's pretty cool the interesting thing

426
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:52,580
about Strava is that the longer the ride

427
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:56,929
the the the less detail is shown on the

428
00:17:56,929 --> 00:17:59,600
map so i started looking at that going

429
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,669
well you know what I want to find

430
00:18:01,669 --> 00:18:03,620
something where somebody did a short

431
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:06,980
ride or a short walk or short run so

432
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:08,809
that I can see street names because if I

433
00:18:08,809 --> 00:18:10,429
can see street names and I can see where

434
00:18:10,429 --> 00:18:12,620
you started and where you ended I might

435
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:13,730
be able to find out where you live or

436
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:16,039
where you work so let's move to number

437
00:18:16,039 --> 00:18:20,030
two right can I find the information it

438
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:21,830
just using straw and open source

439
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:24,980
intelligence about where the person

440
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:29,179
would live enter Dan now Dan likes to

441
00:18:29,179 --> 00:18:32,809
take walks Dan walked one point four

442
00:18:32,809 --> 00:18:34,850
miles he lives over there in Sunnyvale

443
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:38,210
California and on two different locate

444
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:40,100
in two different dates as you can see

445
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:42,980
here let me go back on Wednesday in

446
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:45,740
December he went and he started his walk

447
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:49,730
here on near Hebrides way on flamingo

448
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:52,340
driver flamingo Street and he walked

449
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:55,360
around this park and back to there okay

450
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,590
residential area I make an assumption

451
00:18:57,590 --> 00:19:00,530
doing penetration testing doing open

452
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:02,270
source intelligence we make assumptions

453
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:05,090
educated guesses and then we refine them

454
00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:06,740
based upon the information we get back

455
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:08,780
so I'm going to make a guess that he

456
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:11,240
lives somewhere around that area so the

457
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,799
next thing I do is I look for

458
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:15,020
corroborating evidence okay in October

459
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:17,179
he again started in that same area

460
00:19:17,179 --> 00:19:19,520
around flamingo and he ended in the same

461
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,289
area so he probably walked out of his

462
00:19:21,289 --> 00:19:23,350
house started his phone walked his dog

463
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:26,030
came bat stopped his phone tracked it

464
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:28,190
put it on Strava expected Strava to

465
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:30,050
protect him because he threw that bit

466
00:19:30,050 --> 00:19:34,760
see that they've anonymized his name

467
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:38,640
Sunnyvale has a population last time I

468
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,740
checked of 147 thousand people so let's

469
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:43,050
see if we can find Dan s in one hundred

470
00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:45,450
forty seven thousand people first thing

471
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:47,340
we do is we go to the Google's Google

472
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:49,740
map knows everything right so Google I

473
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:51,960
put a pin here that tells me that then

474
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:55,650
that house is 1501 flamingo away okay

475
00:19:55,650 --> 00:19:57,960
makes no difference to me I'm going to

476
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:00,330
go ahead and take that put Dan's first

477
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:03,150
name in 1501 flamingo away Sunnyvale

478
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:05,610
California and I get this now this is an

479
00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:07,200
interesting piece of data because Dan

480
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,660
didn't put this on the internet this is

481
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:11,760
that information that our governments or

482
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,860
other people put on the internet about

483
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:15,300
us because there's freedom of

484
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:17,670
information and this stuff is public

485
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:20,310
information we cannot control this and

486
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:23,760
as an open-source investigator I love it

487
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,520
because what I can do is I can take that

488
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:29,850
information go to the details of it and

489
00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:32,640
I see that oh my god his name was

490
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,040
anonymized it's his full name is daniel

491
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:37,290
sato and there's his wife's name too

492
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:39,780
and they didn't live at 1501 they lived

493
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:42,720
at 1507 the land values twenty nine

494
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:43,890
thousand dollars you see where I'm going

495
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:44,640
with this

496
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,160
because I can take this information go

497
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,460
to white pages com get his phone number

498
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:52,650
look at his house and then we have the

499
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:54,630
magic of Google Streetview we can see

500
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:57,390
what his house looks like and that's all

501
00:20:57,390 --> 00:20:59,580
within five minutes without me living

502
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:03,000
leaving my chair so does the straw a

503
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,980
privacy bit we're done autumn eyes is

504
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:07,410
your last name does that work oh hell no

505
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:12,360
no so what is the really the point of

506
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:15,060
this well with Google Street View and

507
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:16,920
with all the other information that we

508
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:19,470
have out there on the internet it's

509
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:21,480
really easy for people to do

510
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:24,300
reconnaissance about you or about the

511
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:26,640
places you walk or the places that you

512
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,100
ride your bike then when I first started

513
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:30,540
giving this talk in February of this

514
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:33,540
past year um I hypothesized I said hey

515
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:36,510
you know if somebody were to do this you

516
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:38,010
know and see where you started and ended

517
00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:40,320
your ride maybe they could use Google

518
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,210
Street View and see where you know if

519
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:43,260
there's a some

520
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:44,820
is around that area where you usually

521
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:46,860
start your ride and then they could hide

522
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:48,300
there and they could assault you and

523
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:49,800
people like you have like a that's funny

524
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:52,410
huh but what's happened since then is

525
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:54,870
that there have been attacks people have

526
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:57,240
followed people on Strava or look for

527
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:00,240
those patterns met them and what they've

528
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,680
done is they've actually broken into

529
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:04,170
their cars while they while the persons

530
00:22:04,170 --> 00:22:06,780
out on their 28 mile ride somewhere they

531
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:08,670
the other person just waits for them the

532
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:09,960
attacker waits for them breaks into

533
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,790
their cars and they've got time right

534
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:13,530
because they know that the person's out

535
00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:15,450
on a bike ride dude comes back from his

536
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:17,460
rides like oh my god how did they know I

537
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:18,350
was here

538
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:25,410
son Strava there are other activity

539
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:27,210
trackers out there and I'm not going to

540
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:29,310
make this talk about all going through

541
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:30,780
and telling you which is the best ones

542
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:36,510
Fitbit but but I have done a little bit

543
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:37,910
of research and what I found

544
00:22:37,910 --> 00:22:40,290
overwhelmingly is that the one that has

545
00:22:40,290 --> 00:22:43,980
the the allows you to control the most

546
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:46,830
amount of information that you disclosed

547
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:49,290
is Fitbit they have very granular

548
00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:52,560
controls that can allow you to to hide a

549
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:56,550
lot of your information but if you don't

550
00:22:56,550 --> 00:22:59,010
use them there are still ways to get at

551
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:01,760
this and this this goes into some other

552
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,740
ways that we work on the internet now

553
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:07,950
okay this is John John is a woman on the

554
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:10,530
internet and she has protected her

555
00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:12,420
Fitbit profile and we can tell that

556
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:14,700
because we see that her mood is private

557
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:17,850
her allergies are private and even today

558
00:23:17,850 --> 00:23:19,280
is Tuesday

559
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:23,490
Wow whatever um so here's John and John

560
00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:25,590
for those of you in the back she's a 40

561
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:26,880
year old woman from saline Michigan

562
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:30,210
saline Michigan has 9,000 people in it

563
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:33,990
as of 2013 what we're going to do is

564
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:35,850
we're going to exploit another open

565
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:38,460
source web application vulnerability to

566
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:40,560
find John because if I did the exact

567
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:41,970
same thing again you guys would probably

568
00:23:41,970 --> 00:23:43,800
throw stuff at me and those badges will

569
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:48,120
hurt me if you throw it as an open

570
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,680
source intelligence investigator one of

571
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:52,419
the best tools I have is my brain

572
00:23:52,419 --> 00:23:54,369
I have to be observant and I have to

573
00:23:54,369 --> 00:23:56,649
record stuff and look at the differences

574
00:23:56,649 --> 00:23:59,919
in the data for instance her name is

575
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:03,460
Jonathan J right if we look down here we

576
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:07,359
see Zhanna Z H a n a hmm

577
00:24:07,359 --> 00:24:10,899
that's weird something I'd log just put

578
00:24:10,899 --> 00:24:12,909
in the back of my mind let's take a look

579
00:24:12,909 --> 00:24:16,029
here one of the things that some sites

580
00:24:16,029 --> 00:24:19,570
don't allow you to make private are your

581
00:24:19,570 --> 00:24:22,239
pictures for instance on Facebook last

582
00:24:22,239 --> 00:24:24,460
time I checked if you went ahead through

583
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:26,769
all of those privacy settings to protect

584
00:24:26,769 --> 00:24:28,600
all of your information so that only

585
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,909
your friends can see your stuff the one

586
00:24:30,909 --> 00:24:32,830
thing that you have no control over are

587
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:35,230
any of your profile pictures that you've

588
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:38,440
put up for your profile so if I had a

589
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:41,559
profile picture of myself surfboarding

590
00:24:41,559 --> 00:24:44,710
at the beach one time anybody that knows

591
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:47,350
my that can stumbles across my profile

592
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:49,149
even though I've made everything private

593
00:24:49,149 --> 00:24:51,970
they can still see that and they can see

594
00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:53,919
the comments and who made those comments

595
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:57,609
on that picture so same thing here Jonna

596
00:24:57,609 --> 00:25:00,340
has gone ahead and created some pictures

597
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:03,730
here we have our picture here um if you

598
00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:06,100
didn't know it in google chrome you can

599
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:08,799
right click on a picture and search the

600
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:11,710
image on Google in Firefox you can do

601
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:13,869
this with a plug-in and what we do is

602
00:25:13,869 --> 00:25:16,149
when we look at Google for that image

603
00:25:16,149 --> 00:25:18,190
Google will pull up all the pages that

604
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:20,950
it knows about where it sees that image

605
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:26,470
or one like it luckily for us Jonna has

606
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:30,100
used that image on other sites now this

607
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:32,279
goes into the human behavior part of the

608
00:25:32,279 --> 00:25:37,269
talk we as people sometimes want others

609
00:25:37,269 --> 00:25:39,489
to find us across our multiple social

610
00:25:39,489 --> 00:25:41,559
media accounts right I mean I want you

611
00:25:41,559 --> 00:25:43,899
to come to my Instagram a town a my my

612
00:25:43,899 --> 00:25:46,090
Twitter account and so to do that I have

613
00:25:46,090 --> 00:25:48,279
to have some kind of tie-in yeah I might

614
00:25:48,279 --> 00:25:50,169
use my hacker name my web breacher name

615
00:25:50,169 --> 00:25:51,100
that's cool

616
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:53,200
but what if you just saw a picture of me

617
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,480
oh that's mica yeah okay that's his

618
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:57,879
account because I see that as an open

619
00:25:57,879 --> 00:25:59,499
source intelligence gatherer I can

620
00:25:59,499 --> 00:26:02,889
exploit that because this picture from

621
00:26:02,889 --> 00:26:05,289
her Fitbit now appears on Google+ and

622
00:26:05,289 --> 00:26:05,890
look

623
00:26:05,890 --> 00:26:07,750
it appears in two different accounts on

624
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:10,720
Google+ why would they appear in two

625
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,900
different accounts anybody

626
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:15,880
yeah they friended her or in Google's

627
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:18,550
parlor in terminology they put her in a

628
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:20,860
circle so there is some kind of

629
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:22,810
relationship between Oleg to can and

630
00:26:22,810 --> 00:26:24,880
John omission Koba oh we have her last

631
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:28,240
name now nice let's take a look at this

632
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,520
if we now google John emission cover

633
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:33,160
from sailing Michigan we see her

634
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:35,050
LinkedIn page we see more information

635
00:26:35,050 --> 00:26:37,960
about Oleg and since the goal of this is

636
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:40,480
to find the where they live and all I'd

637
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,640
go ahead and take Oleg's information put

638
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:45,580
it in here to white pages comm I get his

639
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:48,790
age his phone number this and at the

640
00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:50,890
bottom that there is some kind of

641
00:26:50,890 --> 00:26:52,990
relationship between Jonica token and

642
00:26:52,990 --> 00:26:56,620
John emission Cova so my thought is that

643
00:26:56,620 --> 00:27:00,490
maybe John emission kova is really John

644
00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:02,680
a token and these people are married or

645
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:03,480
something like that

646
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:06,520
and all of this kind of goes together

647
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:08,260
and you build that open source

648
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:12,790
intelligence profile so if I can get

649
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:14,980
name an address and zip codes name

650
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:17,470
address and phone number and stuff how

651
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:19,240
far down the rabbit hole can we go how

652
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:21,610
bad can it be what can people really

653
00:27:21,610 --> 00:27:24,820
find about us before we get into that

654
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:28,840
and answer that question we share data

655
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:31,120
on the Internet and we as you know as

656
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,070
Americans or people in United States

657
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:35,950
I'll say we share a lot of data on the

658
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:39,430
Internet and that's okay what we think

659
00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:41,500
though is that when I give LinkedIn a

660
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:44,050
little bit about me and I give Facebook

661
00:27:44,050 --> 00:27:45,250
a little bit about me when I give

662
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:46,720
Instagram a little bit about me and

663
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:49,150
tumblr a little bit about me nobody ever

664
00:27:49,150 --> 00:27:51,070
is going to go through the work of tying

665
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:53,350
all those accounts together and creating

666
00:27:53,350 --> 00:27:57,340
a whole profile about me so in some

667
00:27:57,340 --> 00:28:00,400
situations one bird is no big deal but

668
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,890
when I put a whole bunch together we

669
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:04,930
have a problem right so putting

670
00:28:04,930 --> 00:28:06,910
aggregating all the information about

671
00:28:06,910 --> 00:28:10,360
you together can really make a

672
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:13,480
compelling argument and can really put

673
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:15,730
us at risk depending upon how much we

674
00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:17,970
share

675
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:21,200
there's an extreme version of people

676
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,400
that are out there on the internet there

677
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:26,690
I call them over sharers one overshares

678
00:28:26,690 --> 00:28:29,420
do is they think that the internet the

679
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:32,870
public facing internet is their personal

680
00:28:32,870 --> 00:28:34,790
diary they were there these are the

681
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:36,230
people that you see taking pictures

682
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:38,030
before during and after their meals

683
00:28:38,030 --> 00:28:39,350
because they want you to see them

684
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:41,690
digesting the food as it's being eaten

685
00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:43,570
these are the people that are are

686
00:28:43,570 --> 00:28:45,559
location-tracking themselves in five

687
00:28:45,559 --> 00:28:47,470
different applications because they want

688
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:50,330
everybody to see who they are and what

689
00:28:50,330 --> 00:28:52,549
they're doing there's a problem with

690
00:28:52,549 --> 00:28:55,340
that because not everybody in this world

691
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:57,620
and I'm talking on I'll be very honest

692
00:28:57,620 --> 00:28:59,030
with you not everybody in this world is

693
00:28:59,030 --> 00:29:01,910
a good person there are bad people out

694
00:29:01,910 --> 00:29:04,610
there let's see how a bad person would

695
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:06,740
go about doing this so I wanted to find

696
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:09,020
somebody on Fitbit so what did I do i

697
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:13,150
typed in anyone want to be friends and

698
00:29:13,150 --> 00:29:16,490
there are people out there now okay this

699
00:29:16,490 --> 00:29:19,010
is a very Google centric talk I know so

700
00:29:19,010 --> 00:29:21,370
I used the other search engine um

701
00:29:21,370 --> 00:29:26,299
DuckDuckGo and I typed in I need some

702
00:29:26,299 --> 00:29:29,240
Fitbit friends there are people out

703
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:31,790
there whose basic needs of a belonging

704
00:29:31,790 --> 00:29:33,530
to a group are not being met maybe

705
00:29:33,530 --> 00:29:35,090
they're isolated in some part of the

706
00:29:35,090 --> 00:29:36,919
country or some part of the world where

707
00:29:36,919 --> 00:29:39,140
they don't have friends or or I don't

708
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:42,500
know what but there's a guy named Alfred

709
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:44,510
Adler who's a psychologist around the

710
00:29:44,510 --> 00:29:46,940
same time as Sigmund Freud and he

711
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:48,679
proposed that people have an

712
00:29:48,679 --> 00:29:51,049
overwhelming need to belong to groups

713
00:29:51,049 --> 00:29:54,530
for people to belong and want them and

714
00:29:54,530 --> 00:29:56,000
need their input and stuff and when

715
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,150
people don't have those needs met they

716
00:29:59,150 --> 00:30:00,140
reach out for them

717
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:02,780
so these are people that are trying that

718
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:04,820
are saying hey I got a Fitbit I got a

719
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:06,980
tracker you want to be my friend I have

720
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:08,900

721
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:11,299
come support me and that sounds a little

722
00:30:11,299 --> 00:30:14,480
funny but it's the case and so we can

723
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:17,900
exploit that sorry that sounds right um

724
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:20,809
we can exploit that by visiting some of

725
00:30:20,809 --> 00:30:22,610
these web pages so this is spark people

726
00:30:22,610 --> 00:30:25,280
calm which is a site that's a meta site

727
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,510
for people that want to lose weight

728
00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:29,059

733
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:41,590
here's her Fitbit user now again we

734
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:43,120
could go to Fitbit and do all the other

735
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,860
things that I did was Jana and stuff and

736
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:46,180
but we're not going to do that we're

737
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:48,580
just going to follow what she's opening

738
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:51,670
up to us here so PBJ mama on the spark

739

742
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:02,170
profile section oh we have when she's a

743

great mommy sister and friend now think

745
00:31:06,730 --> 00:31:10,410
about this I'm her social engineering

746
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:13,120
social engineering we learn about people

747
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:15,370
we research a person and then we exploit

748
00:31:15,370 --> 00:31:15,820
that

749
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:17,680
wouldn't it be need to know what's

750
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:20,830
driving a person what that person really

751
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:23,680
wants to do and be in life it's being

752
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,720
given away right here all you have to do

753
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:29,530
is look for it my program here's what

754
00:31:29,530 --> 00:31:31,780

755
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:33,640

um she lives in cameras Canada her

757
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:39,520
Facebook page and a link to her YouTube

758
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:43,750
site now as an oversharer tricia is an

759
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:46,990
avid vlogger video blogger she makes

760
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:50,430
these videos of herself in her home and

761
00:31:50,430 --> 00:31:52,300
remember that too one of the first

762
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:54,160
questions I asked you well who would be

763
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,660
freaked out if I had pictures inside

764
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:58,030
their home well when Tricia does some of

765
00:31:58,030 --> 00:32:01,990
her videoing she takes her phone and she

766
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:04,120
goes like this right she's like this and

767
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:06,370
she's walking around her house and she's

768
00:32:06,370 --> 00:32:08,200
she's video herself talking about her

769
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,700
weight loss and all these struggles that

770
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:12,130
she's having and all as a person that's

771
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:13,900
doing open source intelligence gathering

772
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:16,120
what I pay attention to is not her face

773
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:19,270
I look behind her in the pictures I look

774
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:22,240
for what furniture does does she have

775
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:25,300
does she have little kid toys what kind

776
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:27,730
of socio-economic guesses can I make

777
00:32:27,730 --> 00:32:30,580
about her lifestyle does she have an

778
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:34,270
alarm system on the wall in width in

779
00:32:34,270 --> 00:32:37,540
some cases she gives the me information

780
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:39,400
now let's talk about social engineering

781
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,950
right I need to get your trust to get

782
00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:44,920
you to do something bad if she

783
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:46,360
she's holding her cellphone up to the

784
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:48,370
screen and I can tell that she's got the

785
00:32:48,370 --> 00:32:51,280
Rogers cell phone carrier how easy would

786
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:52,780
it be for me to call her up going hi uh

787
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:55,930
Tricia yeah this is Mike Hoffman

788
00:32:55,930 --> 00:32:57,550
I'm calling from Rogers cell phone

789
00:32:57,550 --> 00:32:59,650

793
00:33:06,430 --> 00:33:08,170

00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,190
on it click past all the banners and

796
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:15,510
install the malware that's there

797
00:33:17,490 --> 00:33:21,640
exploiting trust so Tricia of course we

798
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:23,380
can find her address we can find her

799
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:25,120
phone number we can find out what our

800
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:27,040
house looks like and do all the physical

801
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:29,860
stalking things in fact Tricia is a very

802
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:32,230
prolific person that wants all of her

803
00:33:32,230 --> 00:33:33,940
information be out there so her LinkedIn

804
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:36,730
page has where she works there's even a

805
00:33:36,730 --> 00:33:38,560
biol on that page about her if you

806
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,630
didn't have enough information about her

807
00:33:40,630 --> 00:33:43,540
here's even more to be able to social

808
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:45,400
engineers steal her identity et cetera

809
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,890
in fact she even has a fax number in

810
00:33:47,890 --> 00:33:54,310
case you need to fax her Facebook hopes

811
00:33:54,310 --> 00:33:56,980
dreams what she likes what if I sent her

812
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:59,290
a cake boss something something with an

813
00:33:59,290 --> 00:34:01,810
embedded USB stick or something that

814
00:34:01,810 --> 00:34:04,210
recorded all of the conversations in her

815
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:06,640
house I mean the the the opportunities

816
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:09,159
here are are really limited by my

817
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:13,300
imagination so if Tricia was a person

818
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:14,889
that I was interested in building a

819
00:34:14,889 --> 00:34:18,909
profile on I've got a lot of things that

820
00:34:18,909 --> 00:34:22,239
I have on her right in fact anybody in

821
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:24,760
the world has a lot of information about

822
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:26,860
Tricia I would argue a lot of

823
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:28,570
information a lot more information than

824
00:34:28,570 --> 00:34:33,370
they should if I just did this as a

825
00:34:33,370 --> 00:34:34,840
Google Talk you probably would throw

826
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,370
things at me and the badges are sharp so

827
00:34:36,370 --> 00:34:39,340
let's go beyond it we talked about

828
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:41,918
taking those individual pieces of where

829
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:43,750
you've logged in and where you're you

830
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:45,520
have accounts and putting them all

831
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,620
together I like putting them together in

832
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:49,870
a tool called a mind map now this is the

833
00:34:49,870 --> 00:34:51,820
free technology that's out there at the

834
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:54,360
end I have a

835
00:34:54,370 --> 00:34:59,020
a link to one of the people that now one

836
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:06,120
of the comp words are hard won them so

837
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:09,370
bad as I was saying mine maps are free

838
00:35:09,370 --> 00:35:12,550
this is a Java based tool and X mind and

839
00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:14,920
free mind there's a link at the end with

840
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:18,610
a URL and they are free software it's

841
00:35:18,610 --> 00:35:20,260
really neat to be able to put things

842
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:22,690
together and see relationships see the

843
00:35:22,690 --> 00:35:25,180
links between stuff and as we can see if

844
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:27,130
I when I put the information about

845
00:35:27,130 --> 00:35:29,560
Tricia up here the detailed information

846
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:32,620
from the pictures to where she works to

847
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:34,570
other information about her

848
00:35:34,570 --> 00:35:36,340
it really makes an interesting

849
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:40,420
compelling case about her in fact one of

850
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:42,190
the things that I really like doing when

851
00:35:42,190 --> 00:35:43,900
I do open source intelligence gathering

852
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:46,330
is focused on the user names that people

853
00:35:46,330 --> 00:35:49,600
use because we as people want others to

854
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:52,480
find us if you want to find me on on

855
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:55,030
Twitter you go to web breacher if you

856
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:57,340
want to find me on github hub web

857
00:35:57,340 --> 00:35:59,320
breacher it's real easy we use the same

858
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:02,160
user names across multiple sites right

859
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:05,680
what if I could exploit that too let's

860
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:10,390
do that so enter recon ng now recon ng

861
00:36:10,390 --> 00:36:12,880
is a free Python tool that Tim tomes

862
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:16,000
Landmaster 53 created it's a framework

863
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,880
that allows people to create modules

864
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,970
I wrote a module and my module what it

865
00:36:21,970 --> 00:36:24,430
does is it goes out it takes well let's

866
00:36:24,430 --> 00:36:27,340
take a look at what it does is it will

867
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:32,470
take user names and it will talk to over

868
00:36:32,470 --> 00:36:34,750
a hundred and eighty different websites

869
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:37,240
190 different web sites and I'll say hey

870
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:39,820
do you have this username do you have a

871
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:42,250
user by this username oh you do okay

872
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:44,320
cool I'm going to record that do you

873
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,030
have this username it goes out and makes

874
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:48,520
those calls and it's very fast unless

875
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:50,410
you're on a dial-up modem but it's very

876
00:36:50,410 --> 00:36:53,560
very fast in general I can do three user

877
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:57,280
IDs across 190 sites in 30 seconds and

878
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:59,320
you know what this is what it looks like

879
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:03,190
I do have to warn you when I created the

880
00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:06,700
profiler module I thought you know what

881
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:08,290
are some cool sites out there and I

882
00:37:08,290 --> 00:37:10,840
about Instagram and and imageshack and

883
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:12,520
stuff I found this I am pregnant

884
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:14,830
wouldn't that be interesting to know if

885
00:37:14,830 --> 00:37:16,900
your spouse the person you're dating or

886
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:18,760
whatever um the person that you're

887
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:21,400
researching if they had an account here

888
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:23,470
or they had an account on an insane

889
00:37:23,470 --> 00:37:25,660
journal I don't even know what that is

890
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:29,440
but it's in there um and so what it

891
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,300
looks like when it comes back is this

892
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:34,840
hey this username was found on that

893
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:38,290
server and here's the URL where you can

894
00:37:38,290 --> 00:37:40,720
go and do the research and see what's on

895
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,970
that page now are there false positives

896
00:37:42,970 --> 00:37:44,110
yeah

897
00:37:44,110 --> 00:37:46,660
Missy trishy misses me I can't say that

898
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:49,360
when PBJ mommy could be used by anybody

899
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:52,540
in the world so it's up to you or me or

900
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:54,370
whoever's doing the research to go and

901
00:37:54,370 --> 00:37:57,400
see oh is this really my target but does

902
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,590
this get you a lot of places faster does

903
00:37:59,590 --> 00:38:00,190
it get you

904
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:02,530
does it make your job of visiting all

905
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:04,780
these different sites easier like hell

906
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:09,100
yeah yeah I do have to warn you that

907
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:10,780
some of the websites that are out here

908
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:12,970
are you can see that where I've

909
00:38:12,970 --> 00:38:14,860
classified them as social or shopping

910
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:18,520
whatever I thought about what sites I

911
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:20,290
should put in here so I put the normal

912
00:38:20,290 --> 00:38:22,300
ones in like that but I also thought

913
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,460
about well if I'm going to do research

914
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:27,940
on somebody might I want to know if the

915
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:30,760
person has a site has a user name or

916
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:33,540
user account on a pornographic website

917
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:36,910
or a site that has some kind of sexual

918
00:38:36,910 --> 00:38:39,970
fetish or something like that and so the

919
00:38:39,970 --> 00:38:43,660
tool will go out and try to visit some

920
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:45,820
of these other sites so if you're using

921
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:51,700
it at work and and your firewall blocks

922
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:54,190
access to certain pornographic websites

923
00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:56,140
and then you know or you're using at

924
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:58,420
home and mom or dad nut is monitoring

925
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:00,400
what sites people go to make sure you

926
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,710
tell them hey it's just recon gee it's

927
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:08,140
okay so all right so we've stocked

928
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:11,170
people but I decided to answer question

929
00:39:11,170 --> 00:39:14,320
number three and and see just looking at

930
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,540
those 800,000 records look at the

931
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:18,460
descriptions and see if there was

932
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:20,110
anything that kind of popped out at me

933
00:39:20,110 --> 00:39:21,850
and this is the fun thing

934
00:39:21,850 --> 00:39:23,590
I like doing this I love looking for

935
00:39:23,590 --> 00:39:25,870
patterns in data and when I found

936
00:39:25,870 --> 00:39:28,810
overall was that there was one word that

937
00:39:28,810 --> 00:39:29,950
kept coming back

938
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:34,750
it was patrol patrol patrol like what is

939
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:36,640
this patrol thing and why are all these

940
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,860
the entries so I visited one of them

941
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:43,540
this is the clever patrol on 24 514

942
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:46,660
Tilbury be they've used the privacy bit

943
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:49,840
and in London England okay cool

944
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:51,970
and the person walked well it looks like

945
00:39:51,970 --> 00:39:53,350
they walked out and then they walked

946
00:39:53,350 --> 00:39:55,390
back well that's interesting

947
00:39:55,390 --> 00:39:57,910
so Strava doesn't allow you to zoom in

948
00:39:57,910 --> 00:40:00,310
and that sucks but since we know that

949
00:40:00,310 --> 00:40:02,410
it's London England and we are looking

950
00:40:02,410 --> 00:40:05,080
for this little piece right here what we

951
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:07,150
can do is go over to Google Maps and do

952
00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:09,310
the research ourselves so if we zoom in

953
00:40:09,310 --> 00:40:12,460
on that on the real Google Maps we look

954
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:13,990
for that care of that feature which is a

955
00:40:13,990 --> 00:40:16,120
pretty prominent feature and then we

956
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:17,740
turn on the satellite view we see that

957
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:21,430
it's a power substation an electrical

958
00:40:21,430 --> 00:40:23,560
power substation in fact it's the

959
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:30,270
Tilbury B power substation so somebody

960
00:40:30,270 --> 00:40:34,120
was lazy and they thought it was to

961
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:36,520
their benefit to have their security

962
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:40,900
guard start the Strava application walk

963
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:44,050
the patrol path that they're doing to

964
00:40:44,050 --> 00:40:46,390
protect the Tilbury b power substation

965
00:40:46,390 --> 00:40:49,300
and then clock off and then log on the

966
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:51,340
website that they walk that route and

967
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:54,640
that's probably to show that yes this

968
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:56,590
security guard did their nightly rounds

969
00:40:56,590 --> 00:40:59,950
and Strava isn't protecting that

970
00:40:59,950 --> 00:41:02,950
information right anybody in the world

971
00:41:02,950 --> 00:41:05,200
can see it in fact if we look at some

972
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:09,520
other ones barking saw beginning UK here

973
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:10,870
we know that the people walking were

974
00:41:10,870 --> 00:41:13,630
Dominique and Allen would that be

975
00:41:13,630 --> 00:41:14,950
helpful if you're trying to do some

976
00:41:14,950 --> 00:41:16,570
social engineering of whatever they're

977
00:41:16,570 --> 00:41:18,010
protecting well what are they protecting

978
00:41:18,010 --> 00:41:20,470
see the ripple Nature Preserve Reserve

979
00:41:20,470 --> 00:41:23,890
oh cool they're protecting animals - an

980
00:41:23,890 --> 00:41:25,650
again

981
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:28,559
so Dominic and Alan are out on their

982
00:41:28,559 --> 00:41:30,420
nightly ride walk and we know that

983
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:32,869
because here we know that it was done at

984
00:41:32,869 --> 00:41:36,509
4:25 a.m. now of course I have multiple

985
00:41:36,509 --> 00:41:38,279
of these and I see that every day at

986
00:41:38,279 --> 00:41:41,490
4:25 a.m. they go on this nightly walk

987
00:41:41,490 --> 00:41:44,970
so I call up this patently the company

988
00:41:44,970 --> 00:41:46,349
that's responsible this are like hey uh

989
00:41:46,349 --> 00:41:48,630
Dominic and Alan are out on their patrol

990
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:50,640
they want need to have access to the

991
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:52,079
facility so I'm just going to show up at

992
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:53,910
the front gate you okay with it yeah he

993
00:41:53,910 --> 00:41:55,589
knows Dominic and Alan yeah okay sure

994
00:41:55,589 --> 00:41:56,400
come on in

995
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:00,569
could I do it maybe but the point is is

996
00:42:00,569 --> 00:42:01,980
that this information is out there on

997
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:03,660
the internet and it's not being

998
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:05,730
protected in fact it's not just the

999
00:42:05,730 --> 00:42:09,059
substations we have Britvic soft drinks

1000
00:42:09,059 --> 00:42:11,579
we have tons of these and if again if we

1001
00:42:11,579 --> 00:42:13,289
do this we look and they walked around

1002
00:42:13,289 --> 00:42:14,789
this place near their Chelmsford

1003
00:42:14,789 --> 00:42:17,099
cemetery the chumford cemetery is a

1004
00:42:17,099 --> 00:42:19,170
really prominent feature and if we look

1005
00:42:19,170 --> 00:42:21,450
there's kind of a boxy area right here

1006
00:42:21,450 --> 00:42:24,269
oh wow look at that it's a building and

1007
00:42:24,269 --> 00:42:26,460
if we zoom in there do the street view

1008
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:28,950
we see it's a soft drink company we see

1009
00:42:28,950 --> 00:42:30,989
how high their fences we see there's

1010
00:42:30,989 --> 00:42:33,720
barbed wire so as an attacker from the

1011
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:35,970
comfort of my living room I can now do

1012
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:39,769
physical reconnaissance on my target and

1013
00:42:39,769 --> 00:42:42,690
this is why in a penetration test in a

1014
00:42:42,690 --> 00:42:43,739
Red Team activity

1015
00:42:43,739 --> 00:42:45,900
you never ever skip the reconnaissance

1016
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:48,119
phase because you never know what you're

1017
00:42:48,119 --> 00:42:52,380
going to see well it wasn't just patrols

1018
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:53,730
and other things that I saw in the data

1019
00:42:53,730 --> 00:42:54,960
there were some things that I just

1020
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:57,930
couldn't explain for instance now I'm

1021
00:42:57,930 --> 00:42:59,849
I'm a person that's never been hunting

1022
00:42:59,849 --> 00:43:03,869
my life okay if you go on a bird list

1023
00:43:03,869 --> 00:43:07,100
bird hunt isn't that just a walk

1024
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:10,170
and if that's the case I have no idea

1025
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:17,640
what this is the only thing I can figure

1026
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:19,920
is he's either a South Park aficionado

1027
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:22,830
or after going 92 miles and with a

1028
00:43:22,830 --> 00:43:25,350
suffer score of 232 it's in red so it's

1029
00:43:25,350 --> 00:43:26,280
got to be hard

1030
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:28,740
he was like hallucinate he's like hairy

1031
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:32,430
legs a chocolate olive off-post yeah

1032
00:43:32,430 --> 00:43:34,580
that's gonna be good

1033
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:38,880
what's that California that's right we

1034
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:42,720
expect that so let me turn the camera

1035
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:45,869
towards you all if I create if somebody

1036
00:43:45,869 --> 00:43:48,090
in this room were to create a social

1037
00:43:48,090 --> 00:43:50,700
media profile or an Internet profile on

1038
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:53,640
you your kids your spouse's because

1039
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:55,050
let's think about this you all are

1040
00:43:55,050 --> 00:43:57,240
security people okay or married to a

1041
00:43:57,240 --> 00:43:58,950
security person you all know to protect

1042
00:43:58,950 --> 00:44:00,960
your facebook you all know to throw that

1043
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:03,390
security bit when possible right don't

1044
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:04,860
raise your hands you all know that I'll

1045
00:44:04,860 --> 00:44:07,290
just accept that but if I want

1046
00:44:07,290 --> 00:44:09,570
information about you I'm probably going

1047
00:44:09,570 --> 00:44:11,100
to go ahead and do that open source

1048
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:14,070
intelligence gathering effort I will

1049
00:44:14,070 --> 00:44:15,660

1050
00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:18,330
spouse your roommate your son your

1051

daughter your parents and I'll try to

1052
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:23,310
access your information that way at work

1053
00:44:23,310 --> 00:44:25,260
one of my co-workers came to me and said

1054
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:26,730
Mike and you know I know you do these

1055
00:44:26,730 --> 00:44:28,260
open source intelligence things but you

1056
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:30,090
can't find anything about me I said

1057
00:44:30,090 --> 00:44:31,470

00:45:56,269 --> 00:45:58,729
unprotected account and now I have

1097

1100
00:46:06,410 --> 00:46:09,739
it's easy if somebody were to do this

1101
00:46:09,739 --> 00:46:11,630
now none of the things that I did in

1102
00:46:11,630 --> 00:46:14,299
here was proprietary you all can go home

1103
00:46:14,299 --> 00:46:16,519
or go into the next room and download

1104
00:46:16,519 --> 00:46:19,519
recon ng and download Google well you

1105
00:46:19,519 --> 00:46:21,469
don't have to down but you could use

1106
00:46:21,469 --> 00:46:23,150
Google or DuckDuckGo to do these things

1107
00:46:23,150 --> 00:46:25,999
these are easy things the question is is

1108
00:46:25,999 --> 00:46:28,099
are people already doing that about us

1109
00:46:28,099 --> 00:46:30,169
the last talk that was here in G Mark's

1110
00:46:30,169 --> 00:46:32,689
talk the keynote you know all talks

1111
00:46:32,689 --> 00:46:35,029
about credit card theft and and and

1112
00:46:35,029 --> 00:46:37,249
stealing identities and stuff like that

1113
00:46:37,249 --> 00:46:39,679
well what if you take a target breach or

1114
00:46:39,679 --> 00:46:42,679
an OPM breach and some basic open source

1115
00:46:42,679 --> 00:46:46,249
intelligence if we can do that have a

1116
00:46:46,249 --> 00:46:50,390
lot of information so here's some just

1117
00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:52,159
overall tips and I know this is kind of

1118
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:53,989
a cop-out because this is this won't

1119
00:46:53,989 --> 00:46:55,669
ever fix the problem the only thing that

1120
00:46:55,669 --> 00:46:58,189
can fix the problem is you you telling

1121
00:46:58,189 --> 00:47:00,169
your kids or your wives or whatever hey

1122
00:47:00,169 --> 00:47:02,839
go see go ahead and tighten that down

1123
00:47:02,839 --> 00:47:04,459
you don't need to share everything do

1124
00:47:04,459 --> 00:47:06,439
you really need to take a pictures of us

1125
00:47:06,439 --> 00:47:09,140
inside of our house all that think about

1126
00:47:09,140 --> 00:47:10,759
this from the attacker perspective

1127
00:47:10,759 --> 00:47:12,739
you've got to limit what you post

1128
00:47:12,739 --> 00:47:14,479
now that doesn't work for people if

1129
00:47:14,479 --> 00:47:16,339
you're a millennial if you're somebody

1130
00:47:16,339 --> 00:47:19,309
that's that you know my son is now on on

1131
00:47:19,309 --> 00:47:21,769
the Facebook's and stuff and and you

1132
00:47:21,769 --> 00:47:24,349
know he's liking things because well he

1133
00:47:24,349 --> 00:47:27,049
doesn't see the the downside to it he

1134
00:47:27,049 --> 00:47:29,329
doesn't see why or how somebody could

1135
00:47:29,329 --> 00:47:32,029
use that against him or against me or

1136
00:47:32,029 --> 00:47:34,370
against our family so educate the pee

1137
00:47:34,370 --> 00:47:36,260
that you know and love enable and

1138
00:47:36,260 --> 00:47:37,880
monitor your privacy settings I say and

1139
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:39,740
monitor it because you know what I threw

1140
00:47:39,740 --> 00:47:42,350
all those bits to protect all my stuff

1141
00:47:42,350 --> 00:47:44,720
on LinkedIn I was feeling pretty good

1142
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:46,670
and then I decided to do this this quick

1143
00:47:46,670 --> 00:47:48,050
talk you know what can I find on

1144
00:47:48,050 --> 00:47:50,540
somebody in ten minutes and I decided to

1145
00:47:50,540 --> 00:47:52,280
go ahead and do it on myself from an

1146
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:55,010
unauthenticated browser and and I went

1147
00:47:55,010 --> 00:47:56,750
into LinkedIn and I saw myself in like

1148
00:47:56,750 --> 00:47:58,880
holy shoot I'm sorry there's kids in

1149
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:01,400
there holy cow look at all the stuff

1150
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:02,780
that's out that I thought I turned on

1151
00:48:02,780 --> 00:48:05,810
all those bits well I had but it's

1152
00:48:05,810 --> 00:48:08,240
LinkedIn is data right so they decided

1153
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:11,420
to open it back up so you have to

1154
00:48:11,420 --> 00:48:13,190
monitor your stuff you have to go back

1155
00:48:13,190 --> 00:48:16,330
and go is it still protected okay cool

1156
00:48:16,330 --> 00:48:18,650
understand the risks of using each

1157
00:48:18,650 --> 00:48:21,710
service location-based services recon ng

1158
00:48:21,710 --> 00:48:23,960
has an e module in there called push pin

1159
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:26,420
push pin you put a virtual pin in a map

1160
00:48:26,420 --> 00:48:29,240
say this latitude and longitude my kids

1161
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:32,960
school my place of work show me all the

1162
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:35,600
tweets Instagram photos and other things

1163
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:38,660
that have a geographic tag in that place

1164
00:48:38,660 --> 00:48:40,850
and it will pop it up and you can see

1165
00:48:40,850 --> 00:48:42,770
who's tweeting or or doing other things

1166
00:48:42,770 --> 00:48:44,930
from that location it's pretty

1167
00:48:44,930 --> 00:48:46,310
interesting to see who's tweeting during

1168
00:48:46,310 --> 00:48:49,100
the middle of the day then the thing is

1169
00:48:49,100 --> 00:48:51,080
if this works for you these are

1170
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:53,480
suggestions you know your social profile

1171
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:54,950
and what you want to get out of it much

1172
00:48:54,950 --> 00:48:56,900
better than I do if it works for you

1173
00:48:56,900 --> 00:48:58,430
make it more challenging for me to

1174
00:48:58,430 --> 00:49:01,490
figure out that you are you you know if

1175
00:49:01,490 --> 00:49:03,680
you have accounts for work don't use the

1176
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:06,200
same usernames on sites like web breach

1177
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:08,090
or don't use web root I'll don't use web

1178
00:49:08,090 --> 00:49:10,730
reacher but for you don't pick the same

1179
00:49:10,730 --> 00:49:13,520
user names across multiple sites go

1180
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:16,550
organize things separate things these

1181
00:49:16,550 --> 00:49:18,080
things I use for work I'm going to use

1182
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:19,310
this one name and then I'm going to use

1183
00:49:19,310 --> 00:49:21,230
something else now is it 100% absolutely

1184
00:49:21,230 --> 00:49:23,960
not but it gets you a little bit more

1185
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:26,570
secure don't use the same picture on all

1186
00:49:26,570 --> 00:49:29,360
your sites it's easy too easy it's easy

1187
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:32,060
to find it and most of all limit the Geo

1188
00:49:32,060 --> 00:49:35,420
traffic geo tracking when you enable the

1189
00:49:35,420 --> 00:49:38,510
the track my location when you're when

1190
00:49:38,510 --> 00:49:40,190
you're checking in on Facebook when

1191
00:49:40,190 --> 00:49:42,290
you're checking in on these other things

1192
00:49:42,290 --> 00:49:43,670
and you're posting the latitude and

1193
00:49:43,670 --> 00:49:45,860
longitude of where you are that opens up

1194
00:49:45,860 --> 00:49:48,359
a lot of risk for you

1195
00:49:48,359 --> 00:49:50,309
let's face it this real this whole talk

1196
00:49:50,309 --> 00:49:53,279
is about risk a lot of us in our jobs we

1197
00:49:53,279 --> 00:49:56,299
try to mitigate risk for our companies

1198
00:49:56,299 --> 00:49:58,950
but you don't realize that you make

1199
00:49:58,950 --> 00:50:01,289
risk-based decisions in your lives in

1200
00:50:01,289 --> 00:50:04,349
your personal lives all the time this

1201
00:50:04,349 --> 00:50:06,480
talk is about mitigating the risk that's

1202
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:09,380
being posed to you and your families so

1203
00:50:09,380 --> 00:50:11,670
here's my information there's recon

1204
00:50:11,670 --> 00:50:14,369
energy and there's mine map X mind net

1205
00:50:14,369 --> 00:50:16,950
um that's the end of my talk I'll take

1206
00:50:16,950 --> 00:50:18,749
any questions I have I don't know

1207
00:50:18,749 --> 00:50:20,489
well there's no talks after this so I've

1208
00:50:20,489 --> 00:50:39,049
got a couple hours yes sir yes yeah okay

1209
00:50:39,049 --> 00:50:41,369
so the comment was let's talk about

1210
00:50:41,369 --> 00:50:43,289
legal um there's a ton of information

1211
00:50:43,289 --> 00:50:45,630
about you that I do Orbach not about you

1212
00:50:45,630 --> 00:50:47,910
but about other people about whether

1213
00:50:47,910 --> 00:50:49,769
they've been put in jail speeding

1214
00:50:49,769 --> 00:50:53,730
tickets other things that could be very

1215
00:50:53,730 --> 00:50:57,239
interesting for you to pull up now it's

1216
00:50:57,239 --> 00:51:00,299
not so there's this whole stalking law

1217
00:51:00,299 --> 00:51:02,099
right there are stalking laws out there

1218
00:51:02,099 --> 00:51:04,859
there's daxing laws where if you do have

1219
00:51:04,859 --> 00:51:07,200
open source profile like this with the

1220
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:10,049
intent or to actually execute it now I'm

1221
00:51:10,049 --> 00:51:11,730
not a lawyer so don't quote me on this

1222
00:51:11,730 --> 00:51:13,799
stuff but if you use that information

1223
00:51:13,799 --> 00:51:17,930
for evil then that's breaking the law if

1224
00:51:17,930 --> 00:51:20,670
you use this for other purposes like

1225
00:51:20,670 --> 00:51:22,319
research purposes or educational

1226
00:51:22,319 --> 00:51:24,480
purposes that's different so within your

1227
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:32,130
company it excellent so if can you make

1228
00:51:32,130 --> 00:51:34,980
higher fire decisions based upon this my

1229
00:51:34,980 --> 00:51:37,499
answer is no I'm not a lawyer you need

1230
00:51:37,499 --> 00:51:38,940
to talk to your legal department but I

1231
00:51:38,940 --> 00:51:40,589
would say that one of the things and I'm

1232
00:51:40,589 --> 00:51:41,970
not going to get into that whole well

1233
00:51:41,970 --> 00:51:44,369
you know this losses this but you have

1234
00:51:44,369 --> 00:51:46,410
to apply the same rules to everybody so

1235
00:51:46,410 --> 00:51:48,089
if you're going to go ahead and do open

1236
00:51:48,089 --> 00:51:49,799
source intelligence gathering against

1237
00:51:49,799 --> 00:51:51,960
one person you kind of need to do it

1238
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:54,210
against everybody and that can be very

1239
00:51:54,210 --> 00:51:56,249
time-consuming even with the tools that

1240
00:51:56,249 --> 00:51:58,499
I showed you there so talk to your legal

1241
00:51:58,499 --> 00:52:00,269
department because if you don't apply

1242
00:52:00,269 --> 00:52:01,950
the rules evenly then your

1243
00:52:01,950 --> 00:52:04,470
setting yourself up for a problem yes

1244
00:52:04,470 --> 00:52:12,990
sir so when you comes to tracking the

1245
00:52:12,990 --> 00:52:14,460
movements of people you mean the Geo

1246
00:52:14,460 --> 00:52:18,020
tracking and location-based information

1247
00:52:21,050 --> 00:52:24,750
yet not so tracking movements if you do

1248
00:52:24,750 --> 00:52:26,880
that via like putting a GPS tracker on

1249
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:30,089
their car yeah probably but what we're

1250
00:52:30,089 --> 00:52:32,070
doing while I'm doing is harvesting

1251
00:52:32,070 --> 00:52:33,630
information that you have pushed out

1252
00:52:33,630 --> 00:52:35,640
onto the internet for anybody in the

1253
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:39,060
world to see so people in Moldova people

1254
00:52:39,060 --> 00:52:41,460
in Hawaii they can see this in aggregate

1255
00:52:41,460 --> 00:52:44,880
this information too so I'm going to say

1256
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:47,160
no and again I'm not a lawyer but I'm

1257
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:50,629
pretty comfortable saying no yes ma'am

1258
00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:56,579
just does Facebook aggregate likes and

1259
00:52:56,579 --> 00:52:59,490
stuff in your profile um so the very

1260
00:52:59,490 --> 00:53:01,230
famous person said that if you're not

1261
00:53:01,230 --> 00:53:03,750
paying for a service you are the service

1262
00:53:03,750 --> 00:53:06,240
Facebook nobody pays for it so

1263
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:09,440
absolutely they are they most likely um

1264
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:12,210
his camera they're they most likely

1265
00:53:12,210 --> 00:53:15,000
harvest and generate information

1266
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:18,450
metadata profiles on every single thing

1267
00:53:18,450 --> 00:53:23,700
that you put into their system there's

1268
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:26,730
metadata in pictures yes metadata is the

1269
00:53:26,730 --> 00:53:28,710
information about the picture so if you

1270
00:53:28,710 --> 00:53:30,930
tweet something and then it came from

1271
00:53:30,930 --> 00:53:34,800
your Samsung Galaxy s5 in the metadata

1272
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:37,020
of that picture it says hey I was taken

1273
00:53:37,020 --> 00:53:39,569
from a samsung galaxy s5 from this

1274
00:53:39,569 --> 00:53:41,940
location and yes that information can be

1275
00:53:41,940 --> 00:53:45,050
aggregated or called

1276
00:53:53,930 --> 00:53:56,009
yeah you know it sounds like you might

1277
00:53:56,009 --> 00:53:57,569
have some extra question I'm happy to

1278
00:53:57,569 --> 00:53:59,160
talk to you afterwards but think about

1279
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:01,680
this if the data is out on their server

1280
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:03,839
you have no control over it when you

1281
00:54:03,839 --> 00:54:06,089
delete something and it removes it from

1282
00:54:06,089 --> 00:54:07,650
the public eye that doesn't necessarily

1283
00:54:07,650 --> 00:54:09,480
mean that it's removed from their

1284
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:12,059
systems or removed from their backups or

1285
00:54:12,059 --> 00:54:14,249
removed from other things they still may

1286
00:54:14,249 --> 00:54:16,170
have access to it or law enforcement may

1287
00:54:16,170 --> 00:54:17,720
still also yes sir

1288
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:21,660
so thinking about Facebook and what

1289
00:54:21,660 --> 00:54:23,400
information that we can't control

1290
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:26,519
I'm sure that as security guys they're

1291
00:54:26,519 --> 00:54:29,099
all more or less aware of what you're

1292
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:30,900
making public and Markel trying to keep

1293
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:34,529
drive by now what what's your advice

1294
00:54:34,529 --> 00:54:37,079
about stuff that's out of control for

1295
00:54:37,079 --> 00:54:40,019
example or phone number you know I want

1296
00:54:40,019 --> 00:54:42,119
I want made a fake account on Facebook

1297
00:54:42,119 --> 00:54:43,530
that's something

1298
00:54:43,530 --> 00:54:46,500
my wife's phone number I'm from Romania

1299
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:49,560
and all the details all the details that

1300
00:54:49,560 --> 00:54:51,600
I lose were from the US Open in January

1301
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:55,590
so calm everything from that right okay

1302
00:54:55,590 --> 00:54:58,020
now all the couple comments that

1303
00:54:58,020 --> 00:54:59,880
Facebook recommended one of my wife's

1304
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:04,050
friends why because those people sent

1305
00:55:04,050 --> 00:55:07,110
over crazy phone books which had I was

1306
00:55:07,110 --> 00:55:11,280
sunburned so basically our data is being

1307
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:13,200
sent over to third parties by our

1308
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:15,600
friends and there's absolutely nothing

1309
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:17,940
we can do about it besides break their

1310
00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:24,140
faces ah that's a different website um

1311
00:55:24,140 --> 00:55:27,540
but so yes and that's the world that

1312
00:55:27,540 --> 00:55:30,390
many of us live in right now is that we

1313
00:55:30,390 --> 00:55:33,150
have pushed so much data and our friends

1314
00:55:33,150 --> 00:55:35,610
our neighbors our governments our stores

1315
00:55:35,610 --> 00:55:39,180
have released so much data about us into

1316
00:55:39,180 --> 00:55:42,090
the world into the internet that our

1317
00:55:42,090 --> 00:55:44,730
efforts to remove ourselves remove our

1318
00:55:44,730 --> 00:55:46,890
social media profiles remove information

1319
00:55:46,890 --> 00:55:50,520
about us won't ever be able to purge all

1320
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:53,070
of the data out there just by living and

1321
00:55:53,070 --> 00:55:55,020
operating in the in the society that we

1322
00:55:55,020 --> 00:55:57,870
live in the stuff about us you go to

1323
00:55:57,870 --> 00:55:59,520
church or temple or a mosque or

1324
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:01,170
something like that they may put your

1325
00:56:01,170 --> 00:56:03,810
picture in there and Google Facebook and

1326
00:56:03,810 --> 00:56:05,610
other places have great facial

1327
00:56:05,610 --> 00:56:08,010
recognition capabilities so your face

1328
00:56:08,010 --> 00:56:10,320
can be tied to you even though you have

1329
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:12,720
no facebook profile there are absolutely

1330
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:15,000
things like that and it's up beyond our

1331
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,740
control so it's risk based decision

1332
00:56:16,740 --> 00:56:18,240
right when you can change the way you

1333
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:20,460
look you cannot go out in public which

1334
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:22,650
with Amazon Prime makes it a lot easier

1335
00:56:22,650 --> 00:56:26,340
to do um but I mean it really is about

1336
00:56:26,340 --> 00:56:28,470
limiting what's out there your phone

1337
00:56:28,470 --> 00:56:30,570
number has never ever been private even

1338
00:56:30,570 --> 00:56:32,640
though people think it is you're where

1339
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:35,190
you are where you live it's not private

1340
00:56:35,190 --> 00:56:37,320
data it might be harder to get was not

1341
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:38,880
private was there another question yes

1342
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:41,810
sir yeah

1343
00:56:45,140 --> 00:56:48,299
they are and actually one of the coolest

1344
00:56:48,299 --> 00:56:50,400
so one of the things I did at work was

1345
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:53,009
um I did a profile on some executives

1346
00:56:53,009 --> 00:56:56,130
saying hey what is what is the profile

1347
00:56:56,130 --> 00:56:58,140
what does their social media what is the

1348
00:56:58,140 --> 00:57:00,299
what on the internet shows about them

1349
00:57:00,299 --> 00:57:01,619
and one of the things I found was that

1350
00:57:01,619 --> 00:57:04,619
one of them had a an apartment or condo

1351
00:57:04,619 --> 00:57:08,910
in a building that was in a vacation

1352
00:57:08,910 --> 00:57:10,859
area and it was a second home I was like

1353
00:57:10,859 --> 00:57:12,420
oh that's neat it's it's on this

1354
00:57:12,420 --> 00:57:14,009
apartment that's cool I found in a tax

1355
00:57:14,009 --> 00:57:16,049
record which they couldn't control and I

1356
00:57:16,049 --> 00:57:19,170
was like well huh I wonder if and so I

1357
00:57:19,170 --> 00:57:21,420
went to a real estate page and on a real

1358
00:57:21,420 --> 00:57:24,630
estate page I found a like unit and that

1359
00:57:24,630 --> 00:57:26,549
real estate agent had not only published

1360
00:57:26,549 --> 00:57:28,769
inside pictures of what the floor plan

1361
00:57:28,769 --> 00:57:30,269
looked like but they published the

1362
00:57:30,269 --> 00:57:32,279
architectural diagrams for what that

1363
00:57:32,279 --> 00:57:34,410
apartment looked like the sizes of the

1364
00:57:34,410 --> 00:57:36,180
rooms how the rooms flowed and stuff and

1365
00:57:36,180 --> 00:57:39,209
I thought well do I not have the floor

1366
00:57:39,209 --> 00:57:41,219
plan for the apartment above them that

1367
00:57:41,219 --> 00:57:44,459
my targets in yeah so sometimes we go to

1368
00:57:44,459 --> 00:57:47,160
other places and make those jumps up to

1369
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:49,589
to get information about our targets

1370
00:57:49,589 --> 00:57:51,150
yeah there's tons of information out

1371
00:57:51,150 --> 00:57:57,930
there anybody else yes sir so for recon

1372
00:57:57,930 --> 00:57:59,400
ng that's an excellent question

1373
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:02,160
recon ng does require for some of its

1374
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:05,160
modules API keys that cost money which

1375
00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:07,400
is when API keys are those

1376
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:09,509
authentication pieces that say hey

1377
00:58:09,509 --> 00:58:11,430
website I've paid give me this stuff

1378
00:58:11,430 --> 00:58:14,099
that I want the answer is no sir my MA

1379
00:58:14,099 --> 00:58:16,709
my profiles my profiler script and all

1380
00:58:16,709 --> 00:58:18,539
of the sudden recon ng modules that I

1381
00:58:18,539 --> 00:58:21,299
write are 100% free you don't need any

1382
00:58:21,299 --> 00:58:23,819
keys there's no barrier to usage aside

1383
00:58:23,819 --> 00:58:27,449
from just using the tool and also no any

1384
00:58:27,449 --> 00:58:29,489
other questions all right well thank you

1385
00:58:29,489 --> 00:58:30,900

1386
00:58:30,900 --> 00:58:33,499
