1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,909
my name is Ken Weston I am a senior

2
00:00:02,909 --> 00:00:05,370
security analyst with tripwire I'm based

3
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:07,350
out of Portland Oregon one to thank you

4
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:08,519
guys for having me out here this is

5
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:11,160
great been on a bit of a tour I was in

6
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:13,200
Texas actually at a panel talking about

7
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,780
skate of security and then I'm heading

8
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:18,150
up to a sect or next to talk about cyber

9
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:21,090
stalking so this is kind of a stop in

10
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:23,400
between I'm going to be talking today

11
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,230
about point of sale to point to fail so

12
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:27,869
talking about sort of the the rash of

13
00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:29,220
retail breaches that we've seen over the

14
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:31,590
last few years talk about you know how

15
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:34,110
this actually came to be and then also

16
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:36,450
offer some guidance as to what we can do

17
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:38,730
to actually stop at least these types of

18
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:43,079
breaches so again my name is Ken Weston

19
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:45,870
I I do work at a Portland I work a lot

20
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:48,149
on with customers I look at emerging

21
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:51,090
threats we have a lot of large retail

22
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:53,100
customers I'm actually with a lot of

23
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:53,940
these breaches that were actually

24
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:55,620
occurring we actually have one customer

25
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:57,420
that was using our tools and we actually

26
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:59,250
were able to detect that before those

27
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:01,649
credit cards were exfiltrated and that

28
00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:03,870
focus to go look at them and acts you

29
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:05,430
know how did you guys do this with our

30
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:07,530
tools and through that we were able to

31
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:08,939
create additional tools to help mitigate

32
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:11,070
some of these risks particularly when it

33
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:12,960
comes to the new point-of-sale malware

34
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,670
with memory scraping things like that

35
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:16,680
we're dealing with very sophisticated

36
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,509
types of tools that we haven't really

37
00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:21,210
seen before and a lot of retailers were

38
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:23,100
sort of dumbfounded as to how they

39
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:25,130
actually can can block this type of

40
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:28,170
attack and actually the technologies

41
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:30,210
have existed for a long time to actually

42
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:32,610
block these types of attacks the problem

43
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:34,350
is is very expensive as it requires

44
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:36,150
major hardware refresh a--'s and I'll

45
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:38,729
talk a little bit about that you know

46
00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:41,100
previous leaf to tripwire I I developed

47
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,829
a number of tools to sort of use malware

48
00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:46,829
to recover stolen devices and solve

49
00:01:46,829 --> 00:01:49,110
other crimes I've been involved with a

50
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:51,270
number of cases I probably put several

51
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:53,820
dozen people in prison for stealing

52
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:56,310
devices or child pornography or other

53
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:57,719
things and other investigations I've

54
00:01:57,719 --> 00:01:59,640
been part of so I'm very interested

55
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,250
particularly and how criminals actually

56
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:04,170
do what they do and that's what I'll

57
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:07,110
kind of walk through here so if we

58
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:08,340
actually look at the evolution of

59
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:10,410
cybercrime it actually follows the

60
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:12,040
evolution of money

61
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,650
and if we actually sort of look at how

62
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:17,049
our money has evolved really we

63
00:02:17,049 --> 00:02:19,480
shouldn't be surprised that hackers or

64
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:21,159
criminals are targeting point-of-sale

65
00:02:21,159 --> 00:02:22,329
systems because that's where the money

66
00:02:22,329 --> 00:02:26,019
is you know as we evolved you know the

67
00:02:26,019 --> 00:02:28,180
the US dollar became a point of currency

68
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:31,239
became a fiat currency most transactions

69
00:02:31,239 --> 00:02:33,220
most money is now digital in some format

70
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:35,560
be it through credit card transactions

71
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:39,010
we're also seeing cryptocurrency and the

72
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:41,139
the sort of pseudo anonymity that

73
00:02:41,139 --> 00:02:43,329
Bitcoin actually provides has actually

74
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:45,099
helped fuel some of the elements of

75
00:02:45,099 --> 00:02:46,720
cybercrime which I'll talk about a

76
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,519
little bit talk about underground

77
00:02:48,519 --> 00:02:50,379
markets hidden services and things like

78
00:02:50,379 --> 00:02:51,849
that that are helping to really fuel

79
00:02:51,849 --> 00:02:54,220
this and so I got a quick trivia

80
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:58,419
question for you who is this because

81
00:02:58,419 --> 00:03:00,549
anyone know all right I'm gonna give you

82
00:03:00,549 --> 00:03:02,730
a hint

83
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:08,760
it's Black Bart also known as Charles

84
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:11,490
Bolton so Black Bart was known for

85
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:14,490
robbing stagecoaches he actually he was

86
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:17,010
on the East Coast he went out to

87
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:19,320
California to join the gold rush he

88
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,210
wanted to make his riches when he got

89
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:24,600
there it was very disillusioned with it

90
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,570
he had a lot of issues it wasn't able to

91
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:28,800
make a lot of money he'd actually left

92
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,630
his family as well to come out and

93
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:33,300
strike it rich and he became very

94
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:36,000
frustrated with wells fargo for whatever

95
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,690
reason he also was very well versed in

96
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:42,390
how they actually operated and from that

97
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:44,370
he was actually able to find a way to

98
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:47,370
actually get his gold he actually was a

99
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:49,200
mountaineer he will he knew how the

100
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,810
mountains he knew the terrain and Sookie

101
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:53,459
nua points where he could actually stop

102
00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:55,650
these stagecoaches and actually robbed

103
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:58,050
them of the gold why go in mind the gold

104
00:03:58,050 --> 00:03:59,160
when you can just steal from these

105
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:02,040
stagecoaches he was sort of an early

106
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,440
hacker in many respects because what he

107
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,630
would actually do is he was very nice to

108
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:08,670
the people that he was robbing he would

109
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:13,530
actually put gun barrels and bushes so

110
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:14,910
that the people would think that there's

111
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:16,200
additional people that were part of his

112
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:19,140
gang when in reality was just him so in

113
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:20,970
many respects this when we look at some

114
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:22,620
of these retail breaches this I believe

115
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:24,450
is just a continuation of this it's just

116
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:26,520
human instincts i believe it's human

117
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,320
nature particularly when money is

118
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,690
involved and I actually went back and I

119
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:32,430
looked at Wells Fargo they actually had

120
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:34,110
a corporate report where they actually

121
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:37,290
looked at the actual cost of these these

122
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:39,360
th code breaches so if we actually look

123
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,850
the actual total losses of theft were

124
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:43,470
around four hundred and fifteen thousand

125
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:45,600
dollars but if you actually look at the

126
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,400
actual rewards they paid which were a

127
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:51,050
percentage of the actual what was stolen

128
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:53,700
they had to pay a bounty for every one

129
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:55,020
of those so long and they didn't just

130
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:57,240
have a salary they actually got paid for

131
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,650
when they actually captured these guys

132
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:01,020
there were attorney fees other expenses

133
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:03,210
and oh there's also the salary of some

134
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:04,860
guards that they had that were up on the

135
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:07,979
stage coaches so the actual cost of you

136
00:05:07,979 --> 00:05:09,540
know going after these guys and in the

137
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:11,880
security was actually more than the

138
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,890
actual losses themselves does that sound

139
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:16,140
familiar if we look at retail right now

140
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:17,280
that was one of the driving forces

141
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,390
behind this

142
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:19,980
is that a lot of the retailer's they

143
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:21,720
didn't see that there was added value

144
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,460
and actually securing that information

145
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:26,130
and that created this sort of insecure

146
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:27,540
environment that allowed hackers to

147
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:30,270
thrive you'll see here that train

148
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:32,430
robberies were a little bit lower right

149
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:35,040
so they went from stagecoaches to trains

150
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,420
because that's what they started

151
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:37,950
migrating to as the railroad started

152
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:39,660
getting built they stop relying on stage

153
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:41,790
coaches it's a lot harder to rob a

154
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:43,800
moving train it's a lot harder to stop

155
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,800
it some people did but it was a lot more

156
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,810
dangerous we're talking about the ROI

157
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:50,880
increasing the ROI for the attacker

158
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,290
making it more difficult for them to

159
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:54,330
actually get at the good it's going to

160
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:56,070
be increased rigs there's more risk of

161
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:59,130
them getting caught killed or just

162
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:00,570
stopping the speeding trains pretty

163
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:02,130
difficult and it requires a large group

164
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:03,930
of people to do the more people are

165
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:05,400
involved the more likely you're going to

166
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:09,420
get caught so so now we look at some of

167
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:11,130
the retail retailers that were hit

168
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:13,530
recently and there's quite a few big

169
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:15,840
ones I mean we've all seen target home

170
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,790
depot a number of retailers were hit

171
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:20,040
from a big and small and it seems like

172
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,570
every month there's additional retailers

173
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:23,220
that are actually still getting hit so

174
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:24,540
how is this wouldn't we have learned

175
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:27,660
right these retailers got hit and you

176
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:28,830
know hey we're going to go change our

177
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:30,900
infrastructure unfortunately it's not so

178
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:33,600
easy a lot of these payment systems and

179
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,770
payment gateways that have been set up

180
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:37,110
require a massive financial resources

181
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:39,840
hardware refreshes and also a lot of

182
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,370
these retailers are actually focused now

183
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:43,920
on the envy conversion so that's a big

184
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:46,580
requirement unfortunately the EMV

185
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:48,780
requirement isn't going to make the

186
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:50,310
credit card situation go away it

187
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:52,950
actually doesn't decrease increase the

188
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:55,470
security in any way well I will show how

189
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:57,150
it decreases the demand for stolen

190
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:58,830
credit cards but it's not going to make

191
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:04,620
those credit cards more secure so we

192
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:06,660
even saw that the the DHS actually are

193
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:08,640
the US or actually sent out a number of

194
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:13,770
alerts to retailers and you know it's

195
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:15,090
really interesting when the US sir Sir

196
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:16,290
getting involved and they start actually

197
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:18,510
talking to these retailers that you need

198
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:21,960
to start securing your stuff the Secret

199
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,490
Service in particular has access to

200
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:25,680
information around fraudulent credit

201
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,170
cards they're able to actually detect

202
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:29,460
these breaches usually before the

203
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:32,160
retailers do and basically it's from

204
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,080
identifying patterns of fraud from the

205
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,460
transactions right they're able to

206
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:38,180
identify sort of the single point of

207
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:40,860
commonality of where these transactions

208
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,180
occurred and then they're able to

209
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:44,280
identify not only what retailer was hit

210
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,140
they can narrow down specifically to

211
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:48,030
what store and even in some cases what

212
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:49,980
specific system and I'll talk a little

213
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:51,510
bit about how that works further down

214
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:57,120
the road so we have PCI DSS right so

215
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,980
that's going to save us from all these

216
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:00,840
breaches unfortunately what we've

217
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:03,810
actually seen is even if PCI DSS comes

218
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:05,250
out with the different versions the

219
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:06,420
number of reaches are actually

220
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:09,590
increasing so a PCI DSS it's a check box

221
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:12,030
basically when we talk about compliance

222
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:14,400
that's something that we we have to do

223
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,170
whereas security is something that we

224
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:18,060
should do so there's a big

225
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:19,890
differentiator there unfortunately when

226
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:22,170
we talk to people that are executives or

227
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:24,180
people that are on boards you know the

228
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:25,950
first thing they say is like well we're

229
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:27,870
in compliance with PCI DSS what's the

230
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:30,180
problem why aren't we secure and that's

231
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:32,070
that's a real problem on finding

232
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:34,169
particularly with executives explaining

233
00:08:34,169 --> 00:08:36,539
them the difference between compliance

234
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:41,729
and security so MV is going to save us

235
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:46,110
right not quite here's actual sistex

236
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:47,760
around me MV when I was actually

237
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,820
deployed and in Europe sure when it was

238
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:53,400
adopted the amount of credit card fraud

239
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,530
went down however it increased because

240
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:57,630
the hackers found a way around it they

241
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:59,040
found that they could actually bring

242
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,630
steal these credit cards and they could

243
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:02,340
use them in different countries because

244
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:04,020
these cosmic countries didn't have EMV

245
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:05,970
and what happens when you don't when you

246
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:07,530
have a credit card that doesn't support

247
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:11,940
EMV goes back to the mag strip right so

248
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:14,250
they're able to do that and then the

249
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:16,260
credit card processor had to initiate

250
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:18,510
other things around fraud to try to

251
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:21,030
block some of that but still there they

252
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:22,440
have this sort of cat and mouse game

253
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,890
when it comes to the credit card fraud

254
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:26,880
what it's done is actually it's

255
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,680
decreased the actual value of the credit

256
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,260
cards but it hasn't necessarily

257
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:32,190
decreased the amount of credit cards

258
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:33,810
that are out there the types of credit

259
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:36,150
card fraud is very different they can't

260
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:37,980
go out and you create counterfeit cards

261
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:39,720
as easily requires a little extra work

262
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:42,000
however online fraud and things like

263
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,800
that that is still going to be up come a

264
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,910
problem

265
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:48,260
so sort of understanding the the

266
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:51,470
underlying sort of economy of how

267
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:54,770
hackers work so this is sort of a rough

268
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:57,170
example you know when the credit cards

269
00:09:57,170 --> 00:09:59,360
were stolen from target it's usually a

270
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,040
criminal syndicate or a group that's

271
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,240
specifically what they do they're

272
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,370
targeting credit cards they will then

273
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:07,790
sell those to a Carter so Carter's our

274
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:09,620
deal in there's forums there's a number

275
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:10,970
of these hidden services or hidden

276
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:13,399
markets on tour well they'll actually

277
00:10:13,399 --> 00:10:14,899
sell the credit card numbers to

278
00:10:14,899 --> 00:10:16,550
lower-level actors who are the Carters

279
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:19,250
the Carters what they'll do is they'll

280
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:21,440
try to turn those credit cards into for

281
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:25,029
example a prepaid prepaid credit card or

282
00:10:25,029 --> 00:10:27,920
then they'll transfer that into a amazon

283
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,750
gift card so why did they go through all

284
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:32,149
these different steps the reason is

285
00:10:32,149 --> 00:10:34,459
because it takes a long time for these

286
00:10:34,459 --> 00:10:36,740
credit card companies and people like

287
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:38,330
Amazon to catch up to what actually

288
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:40,339
happened by the time they've actually

289
00:10:40,339 --> 00:10:43,279
figured out that hey this prepaid credit

290
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:44,540
card was purchased with this stolen

291
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:46,160
credit card and then that went to this

292
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,959
Amazon there's a whole process that has

293
00:10:47,959 --> 00:10:50,330
to occur but it can be anywhere from

294
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:52,279
several weeks to several months before

295
00:10:52,279 --> 00:10:55,520
that time is actually unveiled so the

296
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,320
retailers like Amazon the guys are

297
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,850
missed on the prepaid credit cards they

298
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:00,680
actually lose a lot of money of course

299
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:03,070
it's all they get it back on insurance

300
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:05,510
those credit cards are then used to to

301
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:07,790
buy goods sold i buy them on Amazon

302
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:11,540
they'll then ship those to someone who's

303
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:14,360
sometimes a mule this is a whole other

304
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:17,540
realm of fraud where these fraudsters

305
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:19,550
will target may be a stay-at-home mom or

306
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:21,740
someone who wants to work from home all

307
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:22,970
you have to do is you're going to be

308
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:25,100
you're going to be a shipping associate

309
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,959
and what we're going to do is we're

310
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:28,670
going to send all these packages to you

311
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:30,380
and either they're going to send them

312
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:32,150
directly to another customer who's

313
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:33,200
already purchased them through an

314
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,990
underground market or they'll ship them

315
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:37,430
up into a big box and they're going to

316
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:38,959
ship off a bunch of stolen goods like

317
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:40,550
phones and things like that outside the

318
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:43,040
country in the problem with this too is

319
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,810
that you know the police they figure

320
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:47,450
this out they go to this house these

321
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:48,920
people basically they're committing

322
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:51,440
crimes that are not aware of it and

323
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,970
sometimes they can even have a felony

324
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:54,320
now on the record as a result of that

325
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,079
and that's just goes to show that this

326
00:11:57,079 --> 00:11:58,790
isn't just about stolen credit

327
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:00,560
arts there is an entire underlying

328
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,600
economy in a process that this all goes

329
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:05,480
through so if we actually look at some

330
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,160
of the underground markets you know

331
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:10,550
there's a lot of services and tools that

332
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:12,470
are actually available you have your

333
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:14,680
initial access tool so deliver payloads

334
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:17,360
automate exploitation you'll have

335
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,900
exploit kits in zero days black POS for

336
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:22,610
example was being sold for around two

337
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:24,230
thousand dollars before was sort of made

338
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:25,790
open source in the underground community

339
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:27,650
because there's a whole drama around

340
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:30,860
that and so there's there's also payload

341
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:33,380
parts and features so you can actually

342
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:35,090
pay people to customize that for a

343
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:37,400
specific environment so people think you

344
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,140
know the hacker so it's like one guy and

345
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:40,820
someone's basement no this is a very

346
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:43,400
organized criminal group they're they're

347
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,260
highly organized highly specialized if

348
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:47,360
anything they actually reflective a very

349
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:51,110
well run business in many respects so

350
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:53,630
you also will have people that have you

351
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:56,960
know a botnet or packers grip tears it's

352
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,910
not uncommon for them to run it's like a

353
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:00,680
denial of service attack against

354
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,480
infrastructure to distract an IT team

355
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,950
before they actually go in and target a

356
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:06,590
point-of-sale system for example you'll

357
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:08,210
also have additional payloads that'll

358
00:13:08,210 --> 00:13:10,760
have malicious behavior you know focus

359
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,140
on destruction denial degradation

360
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:14,900
deception there's a number of botnets

361
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:16,190
that are out there actually available

362
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:18,770
for lease or sale we've seen these used

363
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:20,540
by these groups for exfiltration of the

364
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:21,650
credit card data once they've actually

365
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:24,320
gotten it it's very difficult than for

366
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,380
law enforcement to trace where that went

367
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:28,700
so you know we're mostly stolen credit

368
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:31,850
cards go do you guys know what country

369
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:36,770
oh right you guys are good so so yeah

370
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:39,440
there's also enabling of services so

371
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,580
there's groups that will actually assist

372
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:41,870
in finding the targets finding

373
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:43,490
vulnerable hosts and what's really

374
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:44,780
important too is that there's groups

375
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:46,810
that they know how these systems operate

376
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:49,130
sometimes they may even enlist people

377
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:51,650
that worked an IT or asked someone that

378
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:53,090
works 19 some of these companies some

379
00:13:53,090 --> 00:13:54,520
questions about how they're structured

380
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,540
one thing I found to when I was doing

381
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:59,510
research is that some of these retailers

382
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:01,760
were doing case studies with very

383
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,200
well-known security vendors or

384
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,660
point-of-sale systems and then it would

385
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:07,700
be very easy to identify specifically

386
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:08,780
what systems they have in their

387
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:10,970
environments and it's I've even seen

388
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:12,230
some cases where they actually

389
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:14,060
full network architectural diagrams on

390
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:15,500
the case studies of how the network is

391
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,090
structured and how great this point of

392
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:20,630
sale system works that's a bad idea if

393
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:22,160
you work for a company and you have a

394
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,900
security vendor that wants to you to do

395
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:28,010
a case study be very suspect of that do

396
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:29,900
it anonymously or ensure that you know

397
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:31,910
your security team actually has a chance

398
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:34,190
to audit that document because you can

399
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:35,360
actually be exposing a lot of

400
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,760
information I work for a security

401
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,380
company and I see something I even

402
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:41,540
advised to our customers even sometimes

403
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:42,800
the marketing groups gets a little

404
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,800
excited about case study just given the

405
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,150
nature of our business I feel it's more

406
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:49,720
responsible to focus on their security

407
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,830
so when we actually look at the credit

408
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:54,980
cards a lot of these ones from target if

409
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:56,390
we look at like Brian Krebs you did a

410
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:58,490
lot of research on this it ended up in

411
00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:00,740
one specific market you're looking at

412
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:02,870
about 2.8 million credit card numbers at

413
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:05,450
about eight to twenty dollars each you

414
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:06,800
know and these credit cards have a half

415
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,110
life as soon as that been disclosed that

416
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:11,390
they're part of a breach the banks are

417
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:12,560
going to shut them down pretty quickly

418
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,620
so these guys have to operate rather

419
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:17,570
quickly I'm usually within two to three

420
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:19,070
weeks those credit cards are no longer

421
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:21,710
valid I also found a lot of other places

422
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:23,990
to buy credit cards not necessarily from

423
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:27,470
mega breaches and actually there's ones

424
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:30,350
that you can go and a lot of times in

425
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:32,390
restaurants sometimes a waiter he'll

426
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:34,700
have a little side business or sometimes

427
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,260
you'll see it may gas stations as well

428
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:38,810
with skimmers they'll actually store you

429
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:40,880
know a few hundred credit cards but then

430
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:41,900
they'll be able to sell those to people

431
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:44,210
on the black market they're not going to

432
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:46,070
become a millionaires but you know it's

433
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:48,680
a little extra money in your pocket it's

434
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,660
in so it's just something to be aware of

435
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:52,610
they'll also target some smaller

436
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:54,620
retailers particularly that we're

437
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:57,950
looking at remote desktop we actually

438
00:15:57,950 --> 00:16:00,010
saw in the northwest around Seattle

439
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:02,840
Dairy Queen was hit and it was through a

440
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,880
particular payment processor that wasn't

441
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,400
secure in their infrastructure properly

442
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:09,200
they want to every provide remote access

443
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,900
to the service provider and the some of

444
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:14,690
the IT folks in the organization but

445
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:16,100
they didn't provide two-factor

446
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,900
authentication and the password was

447
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:20,480
really easy to brute force um and I'll

448
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,840
kind of show some examples of that and

449
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,860
see if you want to look I mean there's

450
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:26,300
tons of onion site

451
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:27,650
out there where you can buy the stolen

452
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:30,020
credit card be careful about creating

453
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:32,030
some of these accounts if you're in the

454
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:33,380
security industry you know you can go

455
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:35,780
out to look at them but don't purchase

456
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:39,020
anything from these websites even if

457
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:41,150
you're tempted to there is a record of

458
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:42,740
that and you're basically are committing

459
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:47,150
a crime so when we actually look at some

460
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:49,490
of these underground markets you know

461
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:51,290
you have people that are sort of general

462
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:53,420
members sort of this pyramid you have

463
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:55,640
mules that can be you know they can be

464
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,740
aware that they're committing a crime or

465
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:59,930
unaware like with the the repacking

466
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:02,690
fraud for example and there's sort of

467
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:04,130
lower level and then you have sort of

468
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:05,839
the Brender the vendors and the broker

469
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:07,099
so people are they're actually the

470
00:17:07,099 --> 00:17:08,900
Carters are creating the forums they're

471
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:10,970
actually selling these credit cards and

472
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:12,200
then you have the people that are more

473
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,849
specialized they're writing the exploits

474
00:17:13,849 --> 00:17:16,130
the malware devs and what's really

475
00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:17,630
interesting about this is that you know

476
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:18,829
the further you move up the food chain

477
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:21,200
the more money is being made the further

478
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,250
you're getting away from the actual

479
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:24,650
crime so when we talk about a lot of the

480
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:26,359
stuff these guys are actually basically

481
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:28,760
operating you know with impunity in

482
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:31,340
Russia and Eastern Europe you know the

483
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:32,810
FBI and law enforcement have a lot of

484
00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:34,210
information they know who these guys are

485
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:36,140
but the problem is there's not a lot of

486
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:38,180
collaboration with with law enforcement

487
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:40,520
on the other side and that's sort of

488
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:46,730
helping to fuel this as well so you know

489
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:49,670
hackers have you know that there's a lot

490
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:52,030
of job security right now in insecurity

491
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:55,250
if you actually look at the the process

492
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:57,500
that we're actually implementing for for

493
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:00,140
EMV for example AMV we've we've already

494
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:01,760
past the deadline right so everybody has

495
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,320
their chip and pin right everyone's got

496
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:05,990
their chip and pin card right so it's

497
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:07,280
going to take it's going to take the

498
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,230
retailer's at least another two years I

499
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:10,490
believe before we're actually going to

500
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:15,530
have a chip and pin and Canada you know

501
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:17,900
Europe they've had this for years it's

502
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:19,460
really amazing how long it's really

503
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:23,360
taken us to get to get there and this is

504
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,120
actually helping to drive this as well

505
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:28,790
why why go target Europe whatever when

506
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:31,430
the u.s. is still an easy target so in

507
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:33,200
many respects we've made ourselves an

508
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:38,380
easy target I keep saying target sorry

509
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:41,479
so here's an actual photo of some

510
00:18:41,479 --> 00:18:43,489
machinery that was actually picked up

511
00:18:43,489 --> 00:18:45,259
from a group that was actually doing

512
00:18:45,259 --> 00:18:48,499
making fraudulent credit cards it's you

513
00:18:48,499 --> 00:18:50,299
know making the fraudulent credit cards

514
00:18:50,299 --> 00:18:52,309
it's not easy I'm actually requires a

515
00:18:52,309 --> 00:18:55,249
lot of machinery in a high level of

516
00:18:55,249 --> 00:18:57,289
sophistication you know people always

517
00:18:57,289 --> 00:18:58,789
think that oh these people they steal

518
00:18:58,789 --> 00:19:00,019
identities they're all tweakers and

519
00:19:00,019 --> 00:19:03,019
things like that not necessarily it's a

520
00:19:03,019 --> 00:19:05,239
very well organized group and the

521
00:19:05,239 --> 00:19:06,470
machines that they have at their

522
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:08,320
disposal are actually quite expensive

523
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:11,359
just to give you guys an example you

524
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:13,700
have your card encoder those aren't so

525
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:15,859
hard to get yeah I i buy them on Amazon

526
00:19:15,859 --> 00:19:17,599
I actually have one myself where we

527
00:19:17,599 --> 00:19:19,220
actually create a demo where we actually

528
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:21,200
do a ram scraping demo and I run it on

529
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,479
my computer you know getting a skimmer

530
00:19:23,479 --> 00:19:24,979
as well or an encoder that actually

531
00:19:24,979 --> 00:19:26,779
write the the information to the max

532
00:19:26,779 --> 00:19:28,999
trip the technology is incredibly old

533
00:19:28,999 --> 00:19:31,340
and there's machines out there that you

534
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:33,739
can do it just off your computer then

535
00:19:33,739 --> 00:19:35,059
you have the embossing machine and that

536
00:19:35,059 --> 00:19:37,429
makes the those those cars look a little

537
00:19:37,429 --> 00:19:40,549
bit more legitimate my credit union they

538
00:19:40,549 --> 00:19:43,429
have give me a new debit card I get a

539
00:19:43,429 --> 00:19:44,960
new card every three to six months just

540
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,210
because i'm paranoid but you know now

541
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:47,989
they've got to the point where they

542
00:19:47,989 --> 00:19:49,999
don't even emboss their cards there's

543
00:19:49,999 --> 00:19:51,859
just a flat card and it has a magic

544
00:19:51,859 --> 00:19:54,619
strip on it and that's it then you have

545
00:19:54,619 --> 00:19:55,729
the taping machine and those are a

546
00:19:55,729 --> 00:19:56,749
little expensive but that's what's

547
00:19:56,749 --> 00:19:58,070
actually going to put the nice little

548
00:19:58,070 --> 00:19:59,840
foil on it so if you're going to be in

549
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,090
the you know creating fraudulent credit

550
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:03,859
cards you really want to you know show

551
00:20:03,859 --> 00:20:06,559
your customers that's your your primo

552
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:08,720
make sure you get a tipping machine make

553
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:09,950
sure you have that magnetic foil and

554
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:11,739
there to really make it look realistic

555
00:20:11,739 --> 00:20:14,239
and again you can buy these credit card

556
00:20:14,239 --> 00:20:17,479
encoders on Amazon you can buy them even

557
00:20:17,479 --> 00:20:18,679
on other sites you know you get the

558
00:20:18,679 --> 00:20:22,729
encoders as well so you know you can get

559
00:20:22,729 --> 00:20:24,349
them for anywhere between ten dollars

560
00:20:24,349 --> 00:20:26,479
for a reader 150 bucks for an encoder

561
00:20:26,479 --> 00:20:29,359
and then if you look in undergrad

562
00:20:29,359 --> 00:20:30,799
markets too you'll find that there's a

563
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:32,629
lot of stolen goods that are out there

564
00:20:32,629 --> 00:20:34,789
really cheap they're brand new like a

565
00:20:34,789 --> 00:20:37,369
new iphone or an imac that maybe you

566
00:20:37,369 --> 00:20:38,989
want to get for someone for Christmas

567
00:20:38,989 --> 00:20:43,940
the holidays are coming up so there's

568
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:45,589
these carding stores and basically these

569
00:20:45,589 --> 00:20:46,789
are goods that have been acquired that

570
00:20:46,789 --> 00:20:48,259
process I was talking about where you

571
00:20:48,259 --> 00:20:50,140
get the prepaid cards

572
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:51,730
and then you get the amazon gift card

573
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:54,220
and then you know they get this the

574
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:56,680
goods that are then shipped overseas or

575
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,360
you know it could be shipped from

576
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:00,870
someone else's house as well in the US

577
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:03,070
but you can go and you can get an iphone

578
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:06,130
for half price it's brand new and this

579
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:08,590
again this is to help drive a lot of the

580
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:10,480
demand for these stolen credit cards so

581
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,680
people that are actually buying these

582
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,870
stolen goods there they're involved in

583
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:24,190
this process as well so it's interesting

584
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:25,720
is that you know we actually look at

585
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,220
some of these breaches it takes around

586
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:31,750
two hundred days before an actual

587
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:34,150
intrusion is detected if it's detected

588
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:36,850
at all a large number of the retailers

589
00:21:36,850 --> 00:21:39,070
that have been hit they didn't detect

590
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:40,810
that they were breached they were told

591
00:21:40,810 --> 00:21:42,190
that they were breached because the

592
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:43,690
credit card numbers were discovered

593
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:46,780
through the fraudulent transactions so

594
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:49,360
some cases they may discover it in two

595
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,040
hundred days but a lot can happen in two

596
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:53,590
hundred days there's a lot of fraud that

597
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:56,860
can be that can take place so you know

598
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:58,600
if you don't have the right tools in

599
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,910
place to actually detect a breach you

600
00:22:00,910 --> 00:22:01,660
know you're going to be in trouble

601
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:03,700
because what's going to happen is you're

602
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:05,400
going to be notified in one of two ways

603
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:11,170
um you're going to be a mr. Krebs well

604
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:14,590
he has a connection to a lot of bank

605
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:15,940
fraud managers that actually disclosed

606
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:17,890
some of this information when there is a

607
00:22:17,890 --> 00:22:19,840
breach there's there's a number of tools

608
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,660
out there and all there's a 1 i'll talk

609
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:25,930
about here in a bit that can provide our

610
00:22:25,930 --> 00:22:27,280
service provider that can actually tell

611
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,480
a retailer if they've been breached if

612
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,980
their credit card numbers are are out

613
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:32,290
there in the wild and also the secret

614
00:22:32,290 --> 00:22:34,210
service they have access to this

615
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:35,770
information they have a direct funnel

616
00:22:35,770 --> 00:22:37,180
from the banks and the transactions

617
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:40,240
where they can actually identify the the

618
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:43,240
fraudulent transactions so you know then

619
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:45,640
you know you you might find out that you

620
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:46,870
know you've been breached because the

621
00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:49,360
CEO calls you in and wants to know why

622
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,460
your company is on the front page of The

623
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:53,680
Wall Street Journal right that seems to

624
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,030
be when the exact is really seem to care

625
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:56,620
is when there is some sort of impact to

626
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:59,470
the brand and you know no one wants to

627
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:01,480
be in that situation when we see target

628
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,700
for example basically it was a complete

629
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:06,220
option of the entire c-suite people lost

630
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:09,120
their jobs right and now finally

631
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,779
executives and boards are actually

632
00:23:10,779 --> 00:23:12,669
paying attention to this retailers mega

633
00:23:12,669 --> 00:23:14,769
retailers in particular they're actually

634
00:23:14,769 --> 00:23:16,840
focusing a lot more on security but

635
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:18,190
unfortunately it takes mega breaches

636
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:20,760
like this for them to actually to move

637
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:23,230
so how do we actually detect you know

638
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:25,360
that there's a better breach if we don't

639
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,669
have if we don't have the tools in place

640
00:23:27,669 --> 00:23:29,019
we can't detect that there's been a

641
00:23:29,019 --> 00:23:31,059
breach in our environment so how is it's

642
00:23:31,059 --> 00:23:33,130
the secret service or bank fraud

643
00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:35,440
managers actually identify it that

644
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,750
there's been a compromise so normally

645
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:39,279
what happens is when there's there's

646
00:23:39,279 --> 00:23:41,950
around two percent of the credit cards

647
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:44,590
that are out there will actually be used

648
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:47,139
in a fraudulent transaction so people

649
00:23:47,139 --> 00:23:49,000
are shopping at you know your local

650
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,490
grocery store in general two percent of

651
00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:53,710
those transactions those credit card

652
00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:55,899
numbers we found at some point to be

653
00:23:55,899 --> 00:23:59,080
fraudulent so that's sort of the

654
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,519
background noise that's sort of where

655
00:24:00,519 --> 00:24:02,529
we've established our base line once

656
00:24:02,529 --> 00:24:04,630
they start to see that that number rises

657
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:12,760
to that's all right to like five percent

658
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:14,320
then things start to get a little

659
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,690
suspicious when it gets up to ten

660
00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:19,110
percent houston we have a problem

661
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:21,460
twenty-five percent we've been breached

662
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,409
something's happened here this is when

663
00:24:23,409 --> 00:24:24,519
you're going to get the call from the

664
00:24:24,519 --> 00:24:27,760
Secret Service or someone on creb side

665
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,919
he'll notify him that there's there's

666
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:31,539
some sort of anomalous activity

667
00:24:31,539 --> 00:24:34,720
happening here so the way this works is

668
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:37,690
if we look at a map I'm down here in the

669
00:24:37,690 --> 00:24:39,039
corner here let's say there's all these

670
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:40,929
transactions that are happening if all

671
00:24:40,929 --> 00:24:42,039
of a sudden they start to see that

672
00:24:42,039 --> 00:24:43,529
there's a lot of fraudulent transactions

673
00:24:43,529 --> 00:24:45,970
usually in another state or another area

674
00:24:45,970 --> 00:24:47,649
of the country you know those are all

675
00:24:47,649 --> 00:24:49,600
going to throw a bunch of red flags and

676
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:50,980
on this process can take anywhere from

677
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:53,440
you know a few weeks to several months

678
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:56,679
if we actually look at the actual credit

679
00:24:56,679 --> 00:24:58,539
card transactions fraudulent credit card

680
00:24:58,539 --> 00:25:00,880
transactions by region is a really great

681
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:03,760
map this was actually enemy by a group

682
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,260
called ripple shot and they actually

683
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:07,809
have access to this information they're

684
00:25:07,809 --> 00:25:10,090
actually able to identify you can

685
00:25:10,090 --> 00:25:11,440
actually as a retailer you can subscribe

686
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,570
to their service and they will actually

687
00:25:13,570 --> 00:25:16,510
tell you before the Secret Service does

688
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:16,900
recur

689
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:18,820
that yeah you guys have a problem we're

690
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:20,710
seeing stolen credit cards you know they

691
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:24,040
came from your store and you need to do

692
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,750
something about it would really need is

693
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:27,100
I got to look at some of their

694
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:28,660
technology not only are they able to

695
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:30,220
tell you specifically what retailer

696
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:31,900
they'll tell you what store even to what

697
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:33,670
system specifically was actually

698
00:25:33,670 --> 00:25:36,210
compromised so that can be a nice thing

699
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:38,380
you you've already been breached you

700
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:40,090
know maybe get you'll get a week or two

701
00:25:40,090 --> 00:25:42,730
ahead way before this actually gets

702
00:25:42,730 --> 00:25:47,920
announced out into the press so this is

703
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:52,510
a in actual losses associated with one

704
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:55,000
of the I won't say which one but one of

705
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,820
the mega retailer breaches before there

706
00:25:57,820 --> 00:25:59,860
was actually any indication that they

707
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:01,660
were a breach or any notification there

708
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:03,340
were roughly two billion dollars worth

709
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:04,690
of transactions that actually occurred

710
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:08,170
with those credit cards so yeah so who

711
00:26:08,170 --> 00:26:10,240
pays for that like two billion dollars

712
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,880
right they just write that off no we all

713
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,920
pay for that because we get increased

714
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:18,190
credit card fees and transactions the

715
00:26:18,190 --> 00:26:19,780
retailer's have to increase their their

716
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:22,090
prices as well so there's a lot of money

717
00:26:22,090 --> 00:26:23,980
that's being lost as a result of this

718
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:26,530
and you know we as taxpayers as well

719
00:26:26,530 --> 00:26:29,770
will pay for that so then we want to

720
00:26:29,770 --> 00:26:31,030
know you know how how are these

721
00:26:31,030 --> 00:26:33,310
retailers actually being hacked the

722
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:37,240
first one is rdp so remote desktop this

723
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:39,550
is this is low-hanging fruit for a lot

724
00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:41,980
of hackers I actually run a quick scan

725
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:46,420
and within about 10 seconds I found just

726
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:48,760
randomly about 1,200 systems with open

727
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:51,850
rdp ports and you can scan the entire

728
00:26:51,850 --> 00:26:53,470
internet within a few hours I turn this

729
00:26:53,470 --> 00:26:54,670
off quickly because I don't want to piss

730
00:26:54,670 --> 00:26:57,670
anyone off but everyone is basically

731
00:26:57,670 --> 00:26:59,080
being scanned all the time I mean we

732
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:01,300
know that if you anyone's has IDs you're

733
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:03,340
looking to your logs you know you put a

734
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:04,570
system up and you're immediately scanned

735
00:27:04,570 --> 00:27:06,940
you know within 10 minutes they're

736
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:08,320
always looking for open ports like this

737
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:11,920
and with rdp is really easy to do brute

738
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:15,310
force because there's some issues around

739
00:27:15,310 --> 00:27:18,550
that so bad passwords are really bad a

740
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:19,960
lot of the smaller retailers in

741
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:22,420
particular are very guilty of this they

742
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:25,120
won't have a good password they won't

743
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:25,750
have

744
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:27,640
count lockout it's not enabled by

745
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:31,720
default for for remote desktop it is an

746
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,430
option but most people don't have that

747
00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:36,130
enabled there's also two factor

748
00:27:36,130 --> 00:27:38,200
authentication it requires additional

749
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:40,660
third-party tools to actually implement

750
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:42,700
that again that's gonna be a cost it's

751
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:44,530
convenient convenience you know why

752
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:46,930
bother and then there's this tool here

753
00:27:46,930 --> 00:27:49,390
it's a it actually will brute force if

754
00:27:49,390 --> 00:27:51,070
you find it open rdp port it'll brute

755
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:53,890
force it it's pretty powerful actually

756
00:27:53,890 --> 00:27:56,680
we'll find a password rather quickly and

757
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,150
then I actually found when i was

758
00:27:58,150 --> 00:27:59,680
thinking around in these underground

759
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,510
market so i actually found a number of

760
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:03,100
rdp accounts that were actually for sale

761
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:05,410
in these underground markets so if

762
00:28:05,410 --> 00:28:07,480
you're you're lazy you don't want to do

763
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,770
the scans you don't want to do the brute

764
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:10,330
force yourself again their services you

765
00:28:10,330 --> 00:28:12,670
can go out and find that for and some of

766
00:28:12,670 --> 00:28:14,560
these guys will even do the work for you

767
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:15,970
they'll even tell you what specifically

768
00:28:15,970 --> 00:28:17,800
what retailer it is they'll gather all

769
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,420
the information for you and then

770
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:20,680
basically just hand you the keys of the

771
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:23,410
kingdom again you can then also hire

772
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:24,850
someone to write them out were for you

773
00:28:24,850 --> 00:28:27,070
to compromise those systems usually I

774
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:29,470
these rdp systems when we want people

775
00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:31,710
RDP into it they're going to be used for

776
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:34,330
command and control use them to be part

777
00:28:34,330 --> 00:28:36,460
of a botnet to do distributed not all

778
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:39,010
service attacks things like that but a

779
00:28:39,010 --> 00:28:40,270
lot of times they'll go in and they'll

780
00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:41,260
find that this is actually a

781
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:43,390
point-of-sale system and then it's just

782
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:47,500
a bonus at that point so then if we

783
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:48,970
actually look at the kill chain and

784
00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:51,190
actually how these how these uh these

785
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:54,100
criminals actually function from what I

786
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:56,020
found they do a lot of research on the

787
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:57,640
organization before they even touch the

788
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:00,160
network they do a lot of passive

789
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:02,830
reconnaissance I got permission from one

790
00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:04,180
customer to actually do something

791
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:07,660
similar where the whole thing was I'm

792
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:09,070
not allowed to touch the network at all

793
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:12,760
I started with infrastructure just not

794
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:15,130
doing some things for DNS things like

795
00:29:15,130 --> 00:29:17,620
that and then I got really creative and

796
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:19,890
I started mining social profiles

797
00:29:19,890 --> 00:29:23,080
linkedin is awesome if you want to know

798
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,990
what kind of technology a company has

799
00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:28,420
look at their their job postings mind

800
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:30,490
their LinkedIn profiles of their system

801
00:29:30,490 --> 00:29:32,320
administrators I was able to eat a lot

802
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,660
of information i actually gave them

803
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:36,280
about a 200-page report of all the

804
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:38,530
information i found and scared

805
00:29:38,530 --> 00:29:39,910
the crap out of them they're like well

806
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:41,650
how do you know this you we say you're

807
00:29:41,650 --> 00:29:42,910
not allowed to touch the network and I'm

808
00:29:42,910 --> 00:29:45,910
like well you you have a bunch of people

809
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:47,590
actually in your company that are

810
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:49,660
looking for jobs you know I didn't reach

811
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:52,420
out to them directly but I could get

812
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:54,880
more information from them but I was

813
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,080
able to go through their profiles and

814
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:58,840
identify what they specialize in and you

815
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:01,540
know it's very simple from there so they

816
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:03,850
do a lot of research not just on you

817
00:30:03,850 --> 00:30:04,900
know the employees and the

818
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:07,120
infrastructure they'll they'll do a lot

819
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,710
on understanding who your business

820
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:10,990
partners are some of these environments

821
00:30:10,990 --> 00:30:13,450
are very secure and so sometimes the

822
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:14,890
best way in is through a trusted partner

823
00:30:14,890 --> 00:30:17,650
we saw this with target right so through

824
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:19,660
their HVAC vendor no they didn't go into

825
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:21,670
the HVAC system not any sort of like a

826
00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:24,030
mission impossible thing through the

827
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:26,890
events what they did was they gave them

828
00:30:26,890 --> 00:30:30,190
access to a billing system and and it

829
00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:31,690
just happened to be that they didn't

830
00:30:31,690 --> 00:30:33,100
segment some of their network properly

831
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:36,700
so by the hackers actually getting

832
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:38,500
access to those credentials and logging

833
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:40,570
into the billing system they are able to

834
00:30:40,570 --> 00:30:42,280
get into the payment systems and the

835
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:45,520
point-of-sale devices as well so and

836
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,320
also they'll still rely on good ol

837
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:48,640
exploits so there's always

838
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:49,780
vulnerabilities within your

839
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:52,750
infrastructure you know we do a lot with

840
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:55,240
vulnerability management sometimes a lot

841
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:56,650
of companies even small companies they

842
00:30:56,650 --> 00:30:58,960
think yeah we ran our vulnerability scan

843
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,700
we were in Nessus about you know about

844
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:02,890
six months ago didn't find anything a

845
00:31:02,890 --> 00:31:05,620
lot changes in six months a lot changes

846
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:08,830
within two hours especially especially

847
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:10,780
nowadays when we start seeing zero-day

848
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:12,220
vulnerabilities like heartbleed things

849
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:14,290
like that and they're popping up pretty

850
00:31:14,290 --> 00:31:18,340
regularly sorry I show you got some

851
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:21,550
water so so always be on the lookout for

852
00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:24,370
that as well so once they actually get

853
00:31:24,370 --> 00:31:25,990
in you know it can be through remote

854
00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:27,430
desktop it can be through a fishing

855
00:31:27,430 --> 00:31:29,110
campaign through a trust business

856
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:31,570
partner or an exploit you know they're

857
00:31:31,570 --> 00:31:32,890
going to get inside and the first thing

858
00:31:32,890 --> 00:31:33,760
they're going to start doing is

859
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,440
identifying vulnerabilities within the

860
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:38,200
network a lot of times people focus a

861
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:40,420
lot on secure in their perimeter not so

862
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:42,580
much when they get in the inside it's

863
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:44,950
it's sort of like an orange it's like

864
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:46,180
maybe a little bit harder on the outside

865
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:47,530
but once you get inside it's nice and

866
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:50,260
soft and squishy they're gonna target

867
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:51,049
and they're going to look

868
00:31:51,049 --> 00:31:53,570
critical assets things they want to

869
00:31:53,570 --> 00:31:54,830
target or going to be active directory

870
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:57,679
any sort of network applications and

871
00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:01,279
then a patch server for example in some

872
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:02,299
of the breaches we've seen they've

873
00:32:02,299 --> 00:32:03,739
actually targeted the patch server that

874
00:32:03,739 --> 00:32:05,299
the point-of-sale systems were actually

875
00:32:05,299 --> 00:32:08,419
getting their firmware from so you don't

876
00:32:08,419 --> 00:32:10,279
need to go out and compromise each one

877
00:32:10,279 --> 00:32:11,389
of those individual point-of-sale

878
00:32:11,389 --> 00:32:13,249
systems all you need to do is compromise

879
00:32:13,249 --> 00:32:15,710
the patch system you get your firmware

880
00:32:15,710 --> 00:32:18,919
which went in there with some malware on

881
00:32:18,919 --> 00:32:20,989
it and you can easily quickly deploy

882
00:32:20,989 --> 00:32:22,850
that not just do a few point-of-sale

883
00:32:22,850 --> 00:32:24,440
systems a lot of these have a

884
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:26,600
centralized system where they'll have

885
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:29,239
one data center that all the stores will

886
00:32:29,239 --> 00:32:31,279
then go to and download the firmware to

887
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:34,159
a server on that's in the store and then

888
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:35,840
from there around two to three o'clock

889
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,580
in the morning then they obviously

890
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:39,919
deploy that out to the systems and this

891
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:42,889
whole process is automated so and

892
00:32:42,889 --> 00:32:44,539
there's there's some stuff around

893
00:32:44,539 --> 00:32:46,159
signatures and things like that but it's

894
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:48,499
breezy to spoof but there's no sort of

895
00:32:48,499 --> 00:32:50,149
manual process that's in there there's

896
00:32:50,149 --> 00:32:51,830
no one really observing that process as

897
00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:53,600
it occurs particularly around two of

898
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:56,029
three o'clock in the morning so that's

899
00:32:56,029 --> 00:32:57,139
what we've seen with some of these mega

900
00:32:57,139 --> 00:32:58,279
retailer breaches where they're actually

901
00:32:58,279 --> 00:33:00,649
able to very easily deploy their point

902
00:33:00,649 --> 00:33:03,350
of selling our to these devices from

903
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:05,720
there they're able to exfiltrate credit

904
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:07,190
card data depending on the type of

905
00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:09,200
malware I'll kind of go through and some

906
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:12,139
details here shortly but then they're

907
00:33:12,139 --> 00:33:14,480
able to exfiltrate those credit cards

908
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,730
they'll usually then load it to another

909
00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:18,230
service they've compromised in the

910
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:21,799
environment and then very carefully very

911
00:33:21,799 --> 00:33:23,739
carefully they will exfiltrate that out

912
00:33:23,739 --> 00:33:26,659
through a series of different servers to

913
00:33:26,659 --> 00:33:29,090
sort of hide their tracks and once this

914
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:30,679
happens once the cards of an actual

915
00:33:30,679 --> 00:33:32,509
trader from the organization that's the

916
00:33:32,509 --> 00:33:34,609
point of no return once they've left the

917
00:33:34,609 --> 00:33:37,519
building you've been breached and you

918
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:39,109
either didn't have the tools in place to

919
00:33:39,109 --> 00:33:41,379
detect that something was going wrong or

920
00:33:41,379 --> 00:33:43,460
you know you're going to hear about this

921
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:47,480
from the secret service or mr. Krebs so

922
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:49,279
we want to look at some attack vectors

923
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:53,210
for these point sale systems so even a

924
00:33:53,210 --> 00:33:55,220
system or an environment that's you know

925
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:56,989
fully compliant with PCI DSS they're

926
00:33:56,989 --> 00:33:58,850
still weak points so kind of going back

927
00:33:58,850 --> 00:34:00,830
to Black Bart right he knew how those

928
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:01,690
the

929
00:34:01,690 --> 00:34:04,090
the systems operated oh thank you so

930
00:34:04,090 --> 00:34:12,159
much just second sorry so he knew where

931
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:14,319
those systems operated and he knew where

932
00:34:14,319 --> 00:34:16,210
to stop those stagecoaches where he

933
00:34:16,210 --> 00:34:17,739
wouldn't get caught where they're

934
00:34:17,739 --> 00:34:19,569
isolated and alone and it's the same

935
00:34:19,569 --> 00:34:20,770
thing when we talk about hacking

936
00:34:20,770 --> 00:34:22,989
point-of-sale there's places within

937
00:34:22,989 --> 00:34:25,020
these environments where we can actually

938
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:27,480
get and grab credit card information

939
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:29,918
particularly because most of the

940
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:31,540
retailers in the u.s. haven't focused on

941
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:32,829
point to point encryption which I'll

942
00:34:32,829 --> 00:34:35,379
discuss a little bit later on with

943
00:34:35,379 --> 00:34:38,319
target the the US stores were hit you

944
00:34:38,319 --> 00:34:40,599
know there's also target in Canada and

945
00:34:40,599 --> 00:34:42,869
they weren't hit do you guys know why

946
00:34:42,869 --> 00:34:44,469
they had point to point encryption

947
00:34:44,469 --> 00:34:46,119
installed on those devices so the

948
00:34:46,119 --> 00:34:47,619
malware in that particular case wouldn't

949
00:34:47,619 --> 00:34:50,500
function properly so there's I'm not

950
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:51,849
saying you're going to be one hundred

951
00:34:51,849 --> 00:34:53,679
percent secure but you're again you're

952
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:55,810
going to increase the risk in the cost

953
00:34:55,810 --> 00:34:57,520
the attacker to go after that type of

954
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:00,160
environment so if we actually look

955
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:03,819
specifically the data in memory that's

956
00:35:03,819 --> 00:35:05,440
where the point-of-sale malware is

957
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,700
really targeted is where it's really

958
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:08,560
thrived in all these mega retail

959
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:10,810
breaches a lot of these organizations

960
00:35:10,810 --> 00:35:12,520
they will encrypt information between

961
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:14,859
you know the device and maybe a payment

962
00:35:14,859 --> 00:35:17,500
gateway a lot of times they actually

963
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:18,880
won't have the information encrypted

964
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:19,960
within the store and the environment

965
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:23,170
which I'll talk about as well but if

966
00:35:23,170 --> 00:35:24,760
they even if they are encrypting that

967
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:26,890
information you can still easily extract

968
00:35:26,890 --> 00:35:29,109
that out of ram and if we look at some

969
00:35:29,109 --> 00:35:31,480
of the versions of of the point-of-sale

970
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:33,280
malware there's a number of them out

971
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,290
there they've evolved they become more

972
00:35:35,290 --> 00:35:37,869
sophisticated over time you know the the

973
00:35:37,869 --> 00:35:41,069
most popular ones been black POS and

974
00:35:41,069 --> 00:35:44,740
there's even more sophisticated versions

975
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:47,589
like Lucy POS there's even versions that

976
00:35:47,589 --> 00:35:48,819
you know open up tour connections

977
00:35:48,819 --> 00:35:49,930
there's all sorts of really interesting

978
00:35:49,930 --> 00:35:51,369
things that they're actually doing with

979
00:35:51,369 --> 00:35:54,069
this malware sometimes I'm just sort of

980
00:35:54,069 --> 00:35:55,990
amazed at how technical some of these

981
00:35:55,990 --> 00:35:57,670
guys are it's pretty amazing some this

982
00:35:57,670 --> 00:36:01,210
malware that they've actually written so

983
00:36:01,210 --> 00:36:02,530
if we actually look at the point-of-sale

984
00:36:02,530 --> 00:36:04,569
the weak points the places we want to

985
00:36:04,569 --> 00:36:06,040
look for credit card information if

986
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:07,750
you're an attacker is going to be on the

987
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:10,180
network in RAM or on the disk those are

988
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:13,470
the three core places we want to look

989
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:16,410
so I find a lot of organizations well

990
00:36:16,410 --> 00:36:18,360
actually they won't encrypt the credit

991
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:19,980
card information within the organization

992
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:23,730
and PCI DSS did not require that what

993
00:36:23,730 --> 00:36:25,110
they required was you to encrypt the

994
00:36:25,110 --> 00:36:26,940
credit card information between the

995
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:28,230
merchant and the actual payment

996
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:30,690
processor within that environment you

997
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:32,250
can still not encrypt it have credit

998
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:34,290
cards in plain text and you're fully

999
00:36:34,290 --> 00:36:36,570
compliant so again compliance doesn't

1000
00:36:36,570 --> 00:36:38,910
mean security as an attacker it's very

1001
00:36:38,910 --> 00:36:40,290
easy to go in and sniff that network

1002
00:36:40,290 --> 00:36:42,120
traffic if I get in I don't even have to

1003
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:43,590
install malware there's a number of

1004
00:36:43,590 --> 00:36:45,720
tools I can actually get access to that

1005
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:47,640
are actually on some of these servers or

1006
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:48,780
I can actually sniff some of this

1007
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:50,700
information look for that credit card

1008
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:51,990
information and actual trade it very

1009
00:36:51,990 --> 00:36:54,660
easily there's a number of pieces of

1010
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:56,190
malware that will also look for that on

1011
00:36:56,190 --> 00:36:57,510
the network they'll look for any sort of

1012
00:36:57,510 --> 00:36:59,460
credit card anything that looks like a

1013
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:00,930
credit card information it'll write it

1014
00:37:00,930 --> 00:37:03,030
out to a file and then you know

1015
00:37:03,030 --> 00:37:04,550
exfiltrate that from the organization

1016
00:37:04,550 --> 00:37:06,150
but then we want to get more

1017
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:08,160
sophisticated right so some of these

1018
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,240
organizations they're actually

1019
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:12,720
encrypting that data so ram scraping is

1020
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:15,120
as the next way to go in the way it

1021
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,560
works is you know credit card gets

1022
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:17,910
swiped that credit card number is

1023
00:37:17,910 --> 00:37:19,500
actually put in memory before it's even

1024
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:21,840
transmitted or encrypted anywhere you

1025
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,700
can see here sorry it's kind of tiny but

1026
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:25,260
you can see what the actual credit card

1027
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:27,390
number is actually in there it's really

1028
00:37:27,390 --> 00:37:31,080
easy actually to grab and then we can go

1029
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:34,080
in and we can then download that to a

1030
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:38,160
file I've actually we did a demo where

1031
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:40,110
we actually have some sort of point of

1032
00:37:40,110 --> 00:37:42,240
sale malware we worked on in-house we

1033
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:44,490
have a demo if you guys are interested

1034
00:37:44,490 --> 00:37:45,780
I'm more than happy to share that with

1035
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:47,340
you I didn't put it up on a public

1036
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:50,610
website but we have one for looking at

1037
00:37:50,610 --> 00:37:53,220
credit cards in RAM a credit card on the

1038
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:55,350
network as well as on disk so they're

1039
00:37:55,350 --> 00:37:57,360
just a little utilities you can run on a

1040
00:37:57,360 --> 00:38:00,630
simulated point-of-sale device if anyone

1041
00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:02,070
works in retail and you want to scare

1042
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:04,170
the crap out of you know your boss your

1043
00:38:04,170 --> 00:38:06,780
executives to show how easy it is it's a

1044
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:08,850
really good way to do it sometimes just

1045
00:38:08,850 --> 00:38:10,530
actually showing the real demo and how

1046
00:38:10,530 --> 00:38:12,870
it works is something that kind of gets

1047
00:38:12,870 --> 00:38:14,880
your point across a little better than

1048
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,350
just simply saying you don't to be the

1049
00:38:16,350 --> 00:38:19,140
next target and then from there you know

1050
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:21,570
we want to exfiltrate the the the data

1051
00:38:21,570 --> 00:38:24,330
to a remote server so you know what can

1052
00:38:24,330 --> 00:38:27,180
we do to mitigate some of this some of

1053
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:27,840
these

1054
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:30,690
the point of sale malware so when we

1055
00:38:30,690 --> 00:38:32,850
look at security control responsibility

1056
00:38:32,850 --> 00:38:35,040
for PCI DSS you know a lot of it you

1057
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:37,710
know is with the merchant however you

1058
00:38:37,710 --> 00:38:38,910
know we actually look at things like

1059
00:38:38,910 --> 00:38:41,430
point-of-sale like the RAM scraping

1060
00:38:41,430 --> 00:38:44,340
malware in reality there wasn't really

1061
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:46,920
any way for retailers to identify that

1062
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:48,240
that was happening and so that really

1063
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:51,990
isn't covered under under PCI DSS sorry

1064
00:38:51,990 --> 00:38:53,670
it's really tiny can you guys read that

1065
00:38:53,670 --> 00:38:57,030
but i'll share my slides here but if you

1066
00:38:57,030 --> 00:38:58,830
actually look at data in transit the

1067
00:38:58,830 --> 00:39:00,480
local communication communication

1068
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:03,420
between the devices in the point of sale

1069
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:05,120
system you know these are not mandatory

1070
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:08,280
and then communication to processors you

1071
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:09,930
know there's a requirement to encrypt

1072
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:11,550
information between the store and then

1073
00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:12,810
the actual payment processor but not

1074
00:39:12,810 --> 00:39:14,550
within the store itself you know this is

1075
00:39:14,550 --> 00:39:16,410
evolving you know pci is trying to catch

1076
00:39:16,410 --> 00:39:18,360
up but it seems like every time you know

1077
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:19,800
for how long it takes to get you know

1078
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:22,320
new requirements around PCI the hackers

1079
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,850
are already like ten steps ahead you

1080
00:39:23,850 --> 00:39:26,670
know as we've seen as the PCI is evolved

1081
00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:28,110
we've actually seen an increase in in

1082
00:39:28,110 --> 00:39:30,720
retail breaches in though if we actually

1083
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:31,830
look at the environments when we

1084
00:39:31,830 --> 00:39:32,970
actually look at the kill chain like we

1085
00:39:32,970 --> 00:39:35,040
had before the first thing people should

1086
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,420
be doing is you know hardening your

1087
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:40,170
configurations you know XS SS your

1088
00:39:40,170 --> 00:39:42,000
perimeter for vulnerabilities again

1089
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,770
don't just run vulnerability scans you

1090
00:39:43,770 --> 00:39:45,360
actually need a full vulnerability

1091
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:47,610
management solution there's a number of

1092
00:39:47,610 --> 00:39:49,740
commercial products out there you can

1093
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:51,780
you know jerry-rig something using open

1094
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:53,610
source but it needs to be a continuous

1095
00:39:53,610 --> 00:39:54,420
process where you're constantly

1096
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:57,200
monitoring for those vulnerabilities

1097
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:59,820
identify and prioritize and remediate

1098
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:02,580
those vulnerabilities quickly that's a

1099
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:04,830
big problem for a lot of organizations

1100
00:40:04,830 --> 00:40:07,500
is actually the workflow around you know

1101
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:09,180
you know how to actually go out and

1102
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:11,580
remediate those vulnerabilities I see a

1103
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:13,110
number of organizations that get reports

1104
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:14,550
from a third party that they paid for

1105
00:40:14,550 --> 00:40:16,590
here's all the vulnerabilities go fix it

1106
00:40:16,590 --> 00:40:18,390
and you know they don't really know

1107
00:40:18,390 --> 00:40:20,760
which ones to fix first and then we want

1108
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:22,230
to go in through and continues to

1109
00:40:22,230 --> 00:40:24,090
monitor for file changes we want to

1110
00:40:24,090 --> 00:40:26,010
identify any sort of internal indicators

1111
00:40:26,010 --> 00:40:29,310
to compromise you know though there's

1112
00:40:29,310 --> 00:40:31,560
like file hashes things like that for

1113
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:34,350
malware usually if you start seeing that

1114
00:40:34,350 --> 00:40:36,480
you know your systems are communicating

1115
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:37,980
with an IP address as a communicate with

1116
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:40,320
before that might be some an indicator

1117
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:41,310
as well

1118
00:40:41,310 --> 00:40:42,780
if you actually start seeing credit

1119
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:44,460
cards in your environment you'd be

1120
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:45,720
sniffing for that if you actually see

1121
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:47,640
credit cards that are being transmitted

1122
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:49,320
across the network in plain text or

1123
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:51,480
otherwise you want to be able to

1124
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:53,550
identify that as well you also want to

1125
00:40:53,550 --> 00:40:55,830
look for sort of large files that are

1126
00:40:55,830 --> 00:40:58,980
being created on a server for example it

1127
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:01,470
may be a big encrypted blob that may be

1128
00:41:01,470 --> 00:41:02,700
the only thing that you see that's

1129
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:04,410
actually any sort of indicator that

1130
00:41:04,410 --> 00:41:06,270
you've been compromised something's

1131
00:41:06,270 --> 00:41:07,110
actually becoming more sophisticated

1132
00:41:07,110 --> 00:41:08,880
they're not just storing the credit

1133
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,620
cards in a plain text file on there

1134
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:12,450
actually encrypting it so that they're

1135
00:41:12,450 --> 00:41:15,560
trying to so they don't get detected

1136
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:18,900
another is to focus on the the network

1137
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:21,090
function and in segmentation of the

1138
00:41:21,090 --> 00:41:23,070
payment systems number of retailers

1139
00:41:23,070 --> 00:41:24,840
they'll actually have their payment

1140
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:27,000
systems on the same network as the rest

1141
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,820
of the business luckily most retailers

1142
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:31,380
have gotten smart now and they're there

1143
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:33,930
they're segmenting their networks but I

1144
00:41:33,930 --> 00:41:35,940
swear sometimes you find one system

1145
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:38,490
that's on both in you just slap your

1146
00:41:38,490 --> 00:41:43,290
forehead shake your head wonder why and

1147
00:41:43,290 --> 00:41:45,450
then of course the a good thing that

1148
00:41:45,450 --> 00:41:46,680
really focused on is point to point

1149
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:48,660
encryption this is very different from

1150
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:50,670
end to end encryption point to point

1151
00:41:50,670 --> 00:41:52,320
encryption will actually encrypt

1152
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:54,180
information the credit card data

1153
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:56,700
actually in memory so even if they do X

1154
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:57,630
we'll treat that with point install

1155
00:41:57,630 --> 00:41:59,220
malware they still don't have any use

1156
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:02,790
for it I'm am seeing a possibility for

1157
00:42:02,790 --> 00:42:04,860
some our to circumvent some of that but

1158
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:05,670
it's actually finding vulnerabilities

1159
00:42:05,670 --> 00:42:09,450
some in some of the point-to-point in

1160
00:42:09,450 --> 00:42:11,880
point software so it's not as easy to

1161
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:14,270
implement as some of the other attacks

1162
00:42:14,270 --> 00:42:16,890
so focusing more on the point to point

1163
00:42:16,890 --> 00:42:18,300
encryption I think is going to go a long

1164
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:19,530
ways and actually protecting these

1165
00:42:19,530 --> 00:42:21,330
organizations we're seeing a lot of

1166
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:22,560
retailers that are actually doing that

1167
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:24,300
but the problem with this is that

1168
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:26,880
there's a high cost to do this they have

1169
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:29,280
to rip out all the existing hardware but

1170
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,530
all the back and has to be overworked I

1171
00:42:31,530 --> 00:42:33,960
was thinking you know we have to change

1172
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:36,060
our hardware for EMV anyway so wouldn't

1173
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:37,800
be a good idea to sort of you know kill

1174
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:40,110
two birds with one stone unfortunately

1175
00:42:40,110 --> 00:42:41,910
not a lot of organizations are not savvy

1176
00:42:41,910 --> 00:42:44,820
there I'm going to do EMV first they're

1177
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:46,110
going to wait and see how that goes and

1178
00:42:46,110 --> 00:42:47,820
then they're going to look at actually

1179
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:50,010
deploying point to point encryption and

1180
00:42:50,010 --> 00:42:51,450
it's going to take a long time for us to

1181
00:42:51,450 --> 00:42:52,800
actually see that sort of migration

1182
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:56,130
actually occur also you know focus

1183
00:42:56,130 --> 00:42:58,350
better on n point monitoring as well as

1184
00:42:58,350 --> 00:43:00,150
what's happening on the network you want

1185
00:43:00,150 --> 00:43:01,350
to monitor for anything that looks like

1186
00:43:01,350 --> 00:43:03,330
a credit card on the file system or even

1187
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:06,240
encrypted blob you want to look for any

1188
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:07,530
new binaries or change configuration

1189
00:43:07,530 --> 00:43:10,680
files you know simple end point

1190
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:13,200
detection of detecting new binaries or

1191
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:15,120
configuration change that would have

1192
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:16,950
actually stopped a lot of these breaches

1193
00:43:16,950 --> 00:43:19,080
about a lot of these folks they weren't

1194
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:20,550
actually monitoring those point-of-sale

1195
00:43:20,550 --> 00:43:22,290
endpoints and that's been a challenge

1196
00:43:22,290 --> 00:43:24,210
because some of these systems they can't

1197
00:43:24,210 --> 00:43:27,630
really have a full-fledged agent that

1198
00:43:27,630 --> 00:43:29,060
are running on them because of system

1199
00:43:29,060 --> 00:43:32,280
requirements tripwire does have one just

1200
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:34,740
saying sorry they just paid for my trip

1201
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:37,860
here thanks so but uh there are other

1202
00:43:37,860 --> 00:43:39,750
tools out there that are focusing more

1203
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:41,910
on on the point of sale and they're

1204
00:43:41,910 --> 00:43:43,500
getting more sophisticated to not just

1205
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:44,730
monitoring things for change

1206
00:43:44,730 --> 00:43:46,350
configuration changes things like that

1207
00:43:46,350 --> 00:43:49,140
but actually looking at processes which

1208
00:43:49,140 --> 00:43:50,940
is really really slick and there's even

1209
00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:52,290
things will actually automate there's

1210
00:43:52,290 --> 00:43:53,730
something strange it'll automatically do

1211
00:43:53,730 --> 00:43:56,910
a dump of memory and you can send that

1212
00:43:56,910 --> 00:43:58,680
out to your incident response team so

1213
00:43:58,680 --> 00:43:59,640
the more you can automate that process

1214
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:01,760
and the monitoring of those endpoints

1215
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:06,090
the more secure going to be you know EMV

1216
00:44:06,090 --> 00:44:08,460
I think it's it's a great shift I think

1217
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:10,140
it's going to be a good thing for the

1218
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:11,760
industry but it's important to realize

1219
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:13,050
that it doesn't actually provide

1220
00:44:13,050 --> 00:44:14,220
security for any sort of online

1221
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:16,830
transactions so credit cards can still

1222
00:44:16,830 --> 00:44:19,380
be used fraudulently online luckily some

1223
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:20,550
of the fraud protections there are

1224
00:44:20,550 --> 00:44:22,200
becoming more sophisticated as well a

1225
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:24,050
lot of friends that are in the industry

1226
00:44:24,050 --> 00:44:27,210
you know EMV it does not actually still

1227
00:44:27,210 --> 00:44:29,100
require data encryption so it's still

1228
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:31,050
good to utilize the point to point

1229
00:44:31,050 --> 00:44:33,870
encryption in those environments EMV

1230
00:44:33,870 --> 00:44:35,160
cards they still have the magic strip

1231
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:37,470
for fallback processing so that could be

1232
00:44:37,470 --> 00:44:38,820
an attack to is like compromised the

1233
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:40,290
system so that the chip and pin doesn't

1234
00:44:40,290 --> 00:44:41,760
work and it defaults back to the max

1235
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:43,980
trip so they're not going to shut a

1236
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:45,210
store down because the chip and pin

1237
00:44:45,210 --> 00:44:46,620
doesn't work if they have to do max trip

1238
00:44:46,620 --> 00:44:48,720
they will so just something to think

1239
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:52,020
about if you're an attacker so the card

1240
00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:53,940
data can still be stolen EMV

1241
00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:55,200
vulnerabilities they're going to be

1242
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:56,940
exploited there have been some security

1243
00:44:56,940 --> 00:44:59,490
research around this already targeting

1244
00:44:59,490 --> 00:45:00,990
some of those systems again it's gonna

1245
00:45:00,990 --> 00:45:02,580
be more around vulnerabilities in the

1246
00:45:02,580 --> 00:45:05,070
end point software in particular but

1247
00:45:05,070 --> 00:45:07,440
just something to be aware of that

1248
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:08,520
you know even when you deploy these

1249
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:09,960
systems you still have to monitor those

1250
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:11,430
systems for vulnerabilities and ensure

1251
00:45:11,430 --> 00:45:12,660
that you have a patent system and

1252
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:16,410
process and in your processes it's going

1253
00:45:16,410 --> 00:45:17,910
to decrease the value of credit card

1254
00:45:17,910 --> 00:45:19,530
data it's going to decrease the demand

1255
00:45:19,530 --> 00:45:22,110
for it but it's not going to impact the

1256
00:45:22,110 --> 00:45:24,270
supply still going to be very easy to

1257
00:45:24,270 --> 00:45:25,440
still steal that credit card information

1258
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:26,580
particularly from some of these

1259
00:45:26,580 --> 00:45:28,220
organizations that aren't encrypting it

1260
00:45:28,220 --> 00:45:31,800
I did a joint webcast with my friend

1261
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:34,920
Slava gums in we've done a lot of stuff

1262
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:38,130
on retail a tripwire I actually was able

1263
00:45:38,130 --> 00:45:39,750
to get a sample chapter it's actually

1264
00:45:39,750 --> 00:45:41,220
the best chapter of the entire book it's

1265
00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:43,560
amazing it's a payment application

1266
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:45,780
architecture and vulnerabilities sorry

1267
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:47,910
about the tinyurl there's a QR code if

1268
00:45:47,910 --> 00:45:51,810
you trust me but so feel free to

1269
00:45:51,810 --> 00:45:53,610
download that sorry you have to fill out

1270
00:45:53,610 --> 00:45:54,900
like a lead form put gibberish

1271
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:56,310
information in there don't tell

1272
00:45:56,310 --> 00:45:58,710
marketing I said that but you'll

1273
00:45:58,710 --> 00:46:00,060
download that and it's a really good

1274
00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:02,250
intro to some of the challenges of

1275
00:46:02,250 --> 00:46:03,960
secure in these environments and what

1276
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:05,400
retailers can do to actually protect

1277
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:08,640
themselves and with that I guess I have

1278
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:10,100
a little bit of time for questions but

1279
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:13,230
I'm sure if you guys have any I'm also

1280
00:46:13,230 --> 00:46:14,430
going to be here for the next few days

1281
00:46:14,430 --> 00:46:16,170
so if you want come and talk to me we're

1282
00:46:16,170 --> 00:46:18,830
happy to yeah

1283
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:36,029
yeah that's like a whole nother

1284
00:46:36,029 --> 00:46:38,849
presentation but so I used to work for a

1285
00:46:38,849 --> 00:46:40,049
company called occupation and that's

1286
00:46:40,049 --> 00:46:42,059
what they they focused on and a lot of

1287
00:46:42,059 --> 00:46:43,739
that was you know a lot of this gets put

1288
00:46:43,739 --> 00:46:45,989
on the merchants themselves and so they

1289
00:46:45,989 --> 00:46:47,969
they actually lose a lot of money from

1290
00:46:47,969 --> 00:46:49,799
that and so they actually have this

1291
00:46:49,799 --> 00:46:51,359
really intelligent system where they do

1292
00:46:51,359 --> 00:46:53,459
like device identification they're able

1293
00:46:53,459 --> 00:46:55,349
to see that hey this system has been

1294
00:46:55,349 --> 00:46:57,779
known to you know deal in crystal and

1295
00:46:57,779 --> 00:47:00,239
credit cards things like that it was

1296
00:47:00,239 --> 00:47:02,279
actually just an issue with vistaprint

1297
00:47:02,279 --> 00:47:03,269
I'm not sure if you guys are familiar

1298
00:47:03,269 --> 00:47:05,430
with that there was a bunch of like wire

1299
00:47:05,430 --> 00:47:06,900
fraud scams were coming out of it

1300
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:08,609
because they were offering like a free

1301
00:47:08,609 --> 00:47:10,680
month of service a free website so you

1302
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:12,329
could register a domain you get a free

1303
00:47:12,329 --> 00:47:15,180
website for email and so people were

1304
00:47:15,180 --> 00:47:17,069
registering similar domains to other

1305
00:47:17,069 --> 00:47:18,449
companies and then they'd be sending

1306
00:47:18,449 --> 00:47:20,190
this very sophisticated fishing phishing

1307
00:47:20,190 --> 00:47:22,349
emails to the hey this is Julie from

1308
00:47:22,349 --> 00:47:23,999
accounting can you wire this money to

1309
00:47:23,999 --> 00:47:25,469
this account for you know paying this

1310
00:47:25,469 --> 00:47:27,599
bill and it was all using stolen credit

1311
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:30,569
cards and it was because vistaprint was

1312
00:47:30,569 --> 00:47:32,999
not requiring the security code and they

1313
00:47:32,999 --> 00:47:34,519
weren't even at requiring the expiration

1314
00:47:34,519 --> 00:47:36,569
so these guys would get like basically

1315
00:47:36,569 --> 00:47:38,309
30 days you know before they would even

1316
00:47:38,309 --> 00:47:39,509
figure out that it was a stolen credit

1317
00:47:39,509 --> 00:47:41,219
card you already sell the domain

1318
00:47:41,219 --> 00:47:42,839
registered so you still have the domain

1319
00:47:42,839 --> 00:47:44,969
for another two months so you can do

1320
00:47:44,969 --> 00:47:46,799
this whole sophisticated scam but once

1321
00:47:46,799 --> 00:47:47,969
they actually started getting this fraud

1322
00:47:47,969 --> 00:47:49,259
then they actually implemented some of

1323
00:47:49,259 --> 00:47:51,390
those security controls but still there

1324
00:47:51,390 --> 00:47:53,459
still people are still using that free

1325
00:47:53,459 --> 00:47:56,670
30-day window just it's not as easy but

1326
00:47:56,670 --> 00:47:58,199
there's all sorts of scams like that but

1327
00:47:58,199 --> 00:47:59,640
it's usually going to be more on the the

1328
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:01,859
retailer themselves that are going to be

1329
00:48:01,859 --> 00:48:03,089
implementing some of these fraud

1330
00:48:03,089 --> 00:48:05,430
protection technologies I see a lot of

1331
00:48:05,430 --> 00:48:07,859
times for stolen credit cards too you

1332
00:48:07,859 --> 00:48:09,150
know these guys that are selling the

1333
00:48:09,150 --> 00:48:10,589
stolen credit cards are really focused

1334
00:48:10,589 --> 00:48:12,630
on customer service they want you to

1335
00:48:12,630 --> 00:48:15,029
succeed in your fraud and so what

1336
00:48:15,029 --> 00:48:16,680
they'll do is they'll actually give you

1337
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:19,079
proxies as well so you know a lot of

1338
00:48:19,079 --> 00:48:20,940
fraud detection they'll actually say hey

1339
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:22,499
that credit card number you know you

1340
00:48:22,499 --> 00:48:24,569
you're not in Oregon and so will

1341
00:48:24,569 --> 00:48:25,890
actually give you is like this credit

1342
00:48:25,890 --> 00:48:27,209
card belonged to someone that was stolen

1343
00:48:27,209 --> 00:48:28,739
in Oregon here's their address and

1344
00:48:28,739 --> 00:48:30,660
here's a proxy in Oregon so that it

1345
00:48:30,660 --> 00:48:31,769
looks like you're actually doing that

1346
00:48:31,769 --> 00:48:34,019
transaction from Oregon and if that

1347
00:48:34,019 --> 00:48:35,510
credit card doesn't work you know

1348
00:48:35,510 --> 00:48:36,680
they're going to give you a new credit

1349
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:38,600
card number with another proxy so

1350
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:39,380
they're going to make sure that you

1351
00:48:39,380 --> 00:48:41,060
succeed so customer service is number

1352
00:48:41,060 --> 00:48:45,080
one and underground markets yeah in the

1353
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:54,170
back there is both so I've seen it in

1354
00:48:54,170 --> 00:48:58,460
both cases so I the initial versions are

1355
00:48:58,460 --> 00:49:00,530
it does have a pioneering it does have a

1356
00:49:00,530 --> 00:49:03,070
signature and it does modify some of the

1357
00:49:03,070 --> 00:49:06,110
system configurations but I am starting

1358
00:49:06,110 --> 00:49:07,670
to see some that runs directly in RAM

1359
00:49:07,670 --> 00:49:10,040
and actually just the other day I talked

1360
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:12,230
to a security researcher group and they

1361
00:49:12,230 --> 00:49:14,720
were actually creating malware on the

1362
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:17,570
fly from existing code that's running on

1363
00:49:17,570 --> 00:49:21,110
the system so you know these guys are

1364
00:49:21,110 --> 00:49:22,790
brilliant they're out of university of

1365
00:49:22,790 --> 00:49:25,880
texas really smart guys so i'm guessing

1366
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:27,320
that we'll see this in the criminal

1367
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:28,880
underground you know probably within the

1368
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:30,950
next year or so so the tools you

1369
00:49:30,950 --> 00:49:32,480
actually have deployed think about what

1370
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:34,130
access they have if they're running as

1371
00:49:34,130 --> 00:49:36,590
root stew sadman things like that even

1372
00:49:36,590 --> 00:49:38,120
security tools themselves will become

1373
00:49:38,120 --> 00:49:40,610
targets for some of this malware so just

1374
00:49:40,610 --> 00:49:51,290
something to consider yes not so much i

1375
00:49:51,290 --> 00:49:52,850
think you know i haven't seen any Mao

1376
00:49:52,850 --> 00:49:54,200
has been targeting them it's Pickler

1377
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:56,120
like like muscles are running on iPads

1378
00:49:56,120 --> 00:49:58,280
things like that I haven't really seen

1379
00:49:58,280 --> 00:50:00,560
too many the scams I have seen are

1380
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:01,850
people that are running those off of

1381
00:50:01,850 --> 00:50:03,640
separate skimmers a little store the

1382
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:07,580
card numbers you know on you know on a

1383
00:50:07,580 --> 00:50:09,590
file system or something like that but

1384
00:50:09,590 --> 00:50:11,840
that's usually a smaller type of scam

1385
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:13,340
it's very similar to what you'll see in

1386
00:50:13,340 --> 00:50:15,050
a restaurant when the waiter takes the

1387
00:50:15,050 --> 00:50:16,520
car and he goes and swipes it on his own

1388
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:19,310
his skimmer but those are the long types

1389
00:50:19,310 --> 00:50:20,900
of systems I've actually seen that on so

1390
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:22,790
far but I don't know if anyone else has

1391
00:50:22,790 --> 00:50:24,620
seen anything like that I be be happy to

1392
00:50:24,620 --> 00:50:26,000
talk to you I'd be curious about that

1393
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,290
yeah in the back

1394
00:50:33,340 --> 00:50:36,560
you talked about like dark sites and

1395
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:40,070
tour how much information are the the

1396
00:50:40,070 --> 00:50:41,900
people that steal the information giving

1397
00:50:41,900 --> 00:50:43,910
like are they giving away IP addresses

1398
00:50:43,910 --> 00:50:46,490
blocks or company names for free and can

1399
00:50:46,490 --> 00:50:48,200
you just start scraping those over have

1400
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:49,850
you seen companies scraping those and

1401
00:50:49,850 --> 00:50:53,900
trying to fix things before yeah it uh

1402
00:50:53,900 --> 00:50:56,180
it varies most the time is going to be

1403
00:50:56,180 --> 00:50:59,000
bulk data but there are specialized guys

1404
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,280
you can actually go to where you know

1405
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:02,450
it's sort of like how you can get fulls

1406
00:51:02,450 --> 00:51:04,040
you know guys what fools are like when

1407
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:05,690
you get the full identity of someone not

1408
00:51:05,690 --> 00:51:06,920
just credit card number also their

1409
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:08,510
address things like that it can be also

1410
00:51:08,510 --> 00:51:09,920
the same thing for a company where

1411
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:12,680
there's all sorts of data that's out

1412
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:13,730
there that's been breached in these

1413
00:51:13,730 --> 00:51:15,440
underground markets and some of these

1414
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:16,670
guys would be sort of brokers in the

1415
00:51:16,670 --> 00:51:18,620
logo and say yeah we're targeting this

1416
00:51:18,620 --> 00:51:21,140
one company hey or this IP range do you

1417
00:51:21,140 --> 00:51:22,610
have any can you go out and find this

1418
00:51:22,610 --> 00:51:24,950
information for us so this sort of like

1419
00:51:24,950 --> 00:51:27,200
a sort of like the research librarian

1420
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:28,400
that you have like in college things

1421
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:29,630
like that to help you do your research

1422
00:51:29,630 --> 00:51:31,790
there's groups and of people that'll

1423
00:51:31,790 --> 00:51:32,930
actually help you conduct that

1424
00:51:32,930 --> 00:51:34,670
reconnaissance and then provide those

1425
00:51:34,670 --> 00:51:44,810
reports for you a lot of so a lot of the

1426
00:51:44,810 --> 00:51:47,330
bank fraud managers are actually buying

1427
00:51:47,330 --> 00:51:48,890
stolen credit cards and some of these

1428
00:51:48,890 --> 00:51:51,530
underground markets they'll buy them in

1429
00:51:51,530 --> 00:51:53,420
batches and just to see you know what

1430
00:51:53,420 --> 00:51:55,610
store that's coming from so they are you

1431
00:51:55,610 --> 00:51:57,230
know they're they're not buying a lot of

1432
00:51:57,230 --> 00:51:58,580
them but they're buying enough to get a

1433
00:51:58,580 --> 00:52:01,400
sample to identify a potential breach

1434
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:03,590
and they are getting more savvy and they

1435
00:52:03,590 --> 00:52:05,320
are monitoring some of these groups

1436
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:08,000
Secret Service as well and they're

1437
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,530
looking for some of that information but

1438
00:52:09,530 --> 00:52:11,570
the problem with that is that you know

1439
00:52:11,570 --> 00:52:13,790
these services get spun up they know

1440
00:52:13,790 --> 00:52:16,280
they come down the average life for some

1441
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:18,230
of these marketplaces anywhere from you

1442
00:52:18,230 --> 00:52:20,800
know a couple of months to a few weeks

1443
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:26,260
so yes

1444
00:52:33,979 --> 00:52:36,779
so that's a political battle with some

1445
00:52:36,779 --> 00:52:39,359
of the retailers and yeah the chip and

1446
00:52:39,359 --> 00:52:40,589
signature doesn't do a whole heck of a

1447
00:52:40,589 --> 00:52:42,180
lot the pin actually helps with the

1448
00:52:42,180 --> 00:52:43,440
encryption especially if you're looking

1449
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:45,989
at point to point encryption it's sort

1450
00:52:45,989 --> 00:52:47,880
of similar how to like the pins codes

1451
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:50,489
work for your ATM card or using your

1452
00:52:50,489 --> 00:52:53,519
debit card and that's sort of a battle

1453
00:52:53,519 --> 00:52:55,109
is happening within the industry versus

1454
00:52:55,109 --> 00:52:57,119
the banks right now you know I think

1455
00:52:57,119 --> 00:52:58,829
they're doing chip and signature to

1456
00:52:58,829 --> 00:53:01,229
start but it's it's really frustrating

1457
00:53:01,229 --> 00:53:03,119
it's like if you're going to do Chip and

1458
00:53:03,119 --> 00:53:05,609
PIN do Chip and PIN don't do this this

1459
00:53:05,609 --> 00:53:07,109
half-assed thing and that's why we keep

1460
00:53:07,109 --> 00:53:08,609
running these sorts of hurdles in these

1461
00:53:08,609 --> 00:53:10,380
troubles with you know getting

1462
00:53:10,380 --> 00:53:12,660
compromised hackers are aware of that

1463
00:53:12,660 --> 00:53:13,589
they're going to find vulnerabilities

1464
00:53:13,589 --> 00:53:14,910
are going to find ways of taking

1465
00:53:14,910 --> 00:53:17,309
advantage of it so right now it's a

1466
00:53:17,309 --> 00:53:22,200
