1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,330
so this presentation is titled defending

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:07,319
election campaigns from cyberspace feel

3
00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:10,830
free to ask questions bug me and just

4
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:13,740
have a good time throughout this was

5
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:16,920
from myself Josh Franklin and my father

6
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,510
Kevin Franklin who ended up getting a

7
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:20,880
little bit sick and couldn't make it so

8
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:26,510
I'm gonna be speaking um so this site is

9
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:30,210
for a guy named John Lewis he was

10
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:34,350
running in 2014 he's a Democrat but if

11
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:36,570
you don't look at the small text you

12
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:39,360
might actually think that this is this

13
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,360
is a pro John Lewis site if you click

14
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,329
donate their that money is actually not

15
00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:47,520
going to John Lewis it's actually going

16
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,129
to the National Republican Congressional

17
00:00:49,129 --> 00:00:53,449
Committee there as you can see down here

18
00:00:53,449 --> 00:00:56,219
and we found stuff like this on both the

19
00:00:56,219 --> 00:00:58,109
sides this just happens to be how I'm

20
00:00:58,109 --> 00:01:01,020
starting it but um so this is the kind

21
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:02,850
of stuff that actually interests me and

22
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:06,330
I wanted to see the scope of this how

23
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:08,010
much of this is actually going on out

24
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:11,549
there and we found 12 pages basically

25
00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:14,130
exactly like this using just different

26
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:17,520
bootstrap templates and using different

27
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,869
images so today I'm going to talk about

28
00:01:21,869 --> 00:01:24,750
Who I am some previous work introduce my

29
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:28,409
election scanning tool election Buster

30
00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:31,650
will dig into some of my results files

31
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:35,220
look how we can apply these concepts to

32
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:36,869
other areas and then we'll have fun with

33
00:01:36,869 --> 00:01:39,930
some 2016 presidential hopefuls and then

34
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:42,020
we'll discuss some recommendations and

35
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:45,149
conclusions just a big note on this this

36
00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:47,820
is party agnostic for nearly every

37
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:50,250
single for nearly every single egg

38
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:53,159
sample i have from I have something from

39
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:55,170
either party if I don't have something

40
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:58,200
if I don't have two of something it's

41
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,350
purely because I didn't have an egg an

42
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:05,100
egg sample from the other party but yeah

43
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:09,360
this is not pro r or pro d and this is

44
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,629
and I am NOT representing my employer

45
00:02:12,629 --> 00:02:13,970
either they got a little bit

46
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:16,140
uncomfortable when I started saying I'm

47
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:17,450
going to be showing pictures of real

48
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:21,330
presidential candidates and so uh yeah

49
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:24,000
so my name is Josh about 10 years

50
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,880
experience in the election technology

51
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:30,150
field I've helped run elections at

52
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,990
bothell the local and state level I've

53
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:35,850
certified voting systems at the federal

54
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:38,580
level and I've written have helped write

55
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:42,780
the voting standards that are voluntary

56
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:46,500
and the US I have a ms and infosec from

57
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,690
George Mason my father is supposed to be

58
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:53,390
here 15 years I expertise in big data

59
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:58,170
and he has an MS and computer science so

60
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:01,650
in 2012 some friends and I decided we

61
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:05,010
would find if there's any really

62
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:06,900
interesting election cybercrime going on

63
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,880
out there was a very manual and arduous

64
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:11,130
process we had to you know substitute

65
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:14,910
ohs four zeros and l's for eyes inside

66
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:18,450
of main domains for candidates and that

67
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:22,350
was really a really tiresome and boring

68
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:26,190
and so um but we did that in 2012 and we

69
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:28,890
found a bunch of really cool examples of

70
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:31,860
people basically doing cybercrime on on

71
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:35,459
the internet and here's just one example

72
00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:39,180
this was a fake Democratic National

73
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:42,510
Committee site this is a DNC dot org and

74
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:45,120
if you if you click that make a donation

75
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,760
button there that money is not going to

76
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,459
the DNC I promise you this doesn't even

77
00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:53,450
look like a legit website almost I mean

78
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:55,620
yeah this was Democratic National

79
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:58,170
Committee dot org hosted on the same

80
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:00,299
server was a Republican National

81
00:04:00,299 --> 00:04:03,630
Committee dot org taking money in the

82
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:07,290
name of the Republican Party and they're

83
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:11,340
both hosted on a server in Oregon but

84
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:13,200
today we're going to talk about the 2014

85
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,359
election um this was not a presidential

86
00:04:15,359 --> 00:04:17,339
election year which meant in terms of

87
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:19,680
elections is a little bit boring my

88
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,450
thought was I'll get my tools going now

89
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:23,340
and then I can do it at scale for the

90
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:26,640
2016 election which sounded fun so

91
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,450
there's

92
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:29,130
one third of the Senate was up for

93
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:31,860
re-election in 2014 that's just how our

94
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:34,920
electoral system works every two years

95
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:37,860
every single house every single house

96
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:40,530
rep is up for re-election and then there

97
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:44,450
are many many local and state elections

98
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:46,650
nationwide there's over 10,000 different

99
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:49,080
election jurisdictions in the u.s. there

100
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,240
is literally an election somewhere in

101
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:55,230
the US every seven days so um yeah so

102
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:56,790
it's just there was a lot of elections

103
00:04:56,790 --> 00:05:00,600
going on and um there's pretty it so

104
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,760
this was a pretty small potatoes

105
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,560
election though um in terms of

106
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,350
methodology I was looking for fake

107
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:10,880
campaign sites and other malfeasance

108
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,020
basically I really wanted candidates

109
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:14,910
stealing traffic from each each each

110
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:18,000
other and then candidates stealing money

111
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,500
from each other that was what I was

112
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,060
really looking for was money where is

113
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:24,690
them the money going I wrote tools with

114
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:28,320
my father to basically scan every single

115
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,730
candidate running for the Senate and

116
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:34,230
House in 2014 we also scanned some

117
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:38,850
mayors and some governors and so that

118
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:40,650
was and this was every single candidate

119
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:42,030
this isn't just everyone who actually

120
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:44,370
won right i mean sometimes there's four

121
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:47,010
or five people running for a single

122
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:49,260
office this is a crap ton of people

123
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:52,230
within wrote tools to take screenshots

124
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:55,800
of you know of each of our hits if you

125
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:59,310
if you will and then we collected the

126
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:02,160
Whois information as well let me comb

127
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,130
through data to actually find anything

128
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:08,430
that was malicious the timeline of scans

129
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:12,960
generally were from february2014 to i

130
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:16,320
want to say november 2014 but then last

131
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:19,080
week I decided to scan some of the 2016

132
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:22,770
presidential hopefuls and so I just made

133
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:27,290
the the timeline of scans to October

134
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:32,520
yeah workflow this is our crazy process

135
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:35,520
we had a candidate list that I built

136
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,930
from ballotpedia org then we would feed

137
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:40,940
those into a

138
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:44,960
Shin Buster once once we started finding

139
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,880
things we would then iterate on election

140
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,250
Buster over and over again to make the

141
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:52,040
tool smarter better faster stronger and

142
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:55,730
then election Buster outputs results

143
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:56,990
files which is what we really really

144
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:59,060
wanted we would take those results files

145
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:01,150
we would shoot them through some scripts

146
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:05,030
basically using Phantom Jas and some

147
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:09,260
Firefox extensions down them all and

148
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:11,420
then we would get both of those pieces

149
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:14,570
of information and then we would perform

150
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:17,420
manual review which is slow and arduous

151
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:21,140
and tiresome and it was awful basically

152
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:23,180
me just going through screenshots on my

153
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:24,860
iPad just looking is this look

154
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:26,090
interesting is this interesting is this

155
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:29,510
interesting and if something was fun we

156
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:31,520
then we would you know celebrate and we

157
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,770
will put it into our let's talk about it

158
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:36,020
at the presentation category and if not

159
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:38,030
we just threw it on the big ol pile and

160
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:40,940
just kept on going so let's talk about

161
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:43,850
election buster it's a Python open

162
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:47,450
source tool it requires five different

163
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:49,190
inputs first name last name type of

164
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:52,010
election home state and year of the

165
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:57,380
election yeah it requests every single

166
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:59,450
combination of characters for a domain

167
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:03,410
and so um you know if there's a you know

168
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:07,580
it would try Barack Obama for president

169
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:11,240
but it would put an a in every single

170
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,340
spot and then a B and every single

171
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:15,590
character spot see and they would just

172
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:17,870
try every single domain so we're

173
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:20,830
literally trying millions of domains

174
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:22,910
this is what it looks like when you're

175
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:24,770
actually running it just a really simple

176
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:29,419
script but what does it do it will

177
00:08:29,419 --> 00:08:31,490
quickly identify a candidate's real

178
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:34,219
domains where you know Hillary Clinton

179
00:08:34,219 --> 00:08:36,289
lives on the internet it will quickly

180
00:08:36,289 --> 00:08:38,900
identify typos squatters someone trying

181
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:42,200
to put up a fake site for someone it

182
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:45,410
will help real candidates identify where

183
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:48,110
they should be defensively purchasing or

184
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:51,500
acquiring domains and so on I'm going to

185
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:54,050
show but a big list at the end of where

186
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:54,830
I think

187
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:57,650
nowadays any candidate should probably

188
00:08:57,650 --> 00:09:01,490
buy these 10 or 12 sites and then really

189
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:03,530
cool it'll actually predict if someone's

190
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:05,780
thinking about running because if you um

191
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:10,610
in 2014 I i scanned Hillary for 2016

192
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:12,950
what you end up seeing is this really

193
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:16,090
methodical Hillary Clinton you know.com

194
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:21,650
org me dot us chris Christie org me dot

195
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:25,250
us and so someone has very methodically

196
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:27,470
gone gone through and purchase each of

197
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:30,230
these domains of course we can't get a

198
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:31,520
hundred percent certainty on if that's

199
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,530
actually Haley you know Hillary Clinton

200
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:37,160
or chris Christie's actual campaign but

201
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:40,220
um you can get a rough I dia if anyone

202
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:41,720
wants to mess with it it's right there

203
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:44,690
on github please go play with it for kit

204
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:47,780
make it better um break it on if you

205
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:52,670
break it please email my dad not me uh

206
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:56,560
issues with it it is slow we're talking

207
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,860
unconscionably slow we're requesting

208
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:04,730
millions of domains so when I started

209
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:08,810
doing this I was on my 2008 macbook pro

210
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:11,630
over Wi-Fi took about eight to 12 hours

211
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:14,600
to scan one candidate which basically

212
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:18,230
meant um you're actually coding it up

213
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:20,780
and testing my code was really awful

214
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:23,300
because it would go for 11 hours and

215
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:25,850
then you know it would have some sort of

216
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:31,490
fault or air um but then i wised up and

217
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:36,140
i put it up on amazon ec2 and takes five

218
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:38,600
to 15 minutes per candidate now much

219
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,550
much better which means you can do it at

220
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:41,990
scale which means you can make these

221
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:45,200
giant lists and just script scanning a

222
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,930
whole election in like three or four

223
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:50,180
days like every single person thousands

224
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:53,780
of folks issues I mean your typical

225
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:56,630
input validation issues I handle most of

226
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:58,070
the things but there are some things

227
00:10:58,070 --> 00:11:00,710
that don't quite work well so O'Malley

228
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:02,540
you just I just made it so you have to

229
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:06,320
take out the the the special character

230
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,510
there and if you have something like

231
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:11,270
West Virginia put it in as West Virginia

232
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:14,900
as a single word but yeah let's get to

233
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:16,610
the actual thing okay so you're going to

234
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:19,340
see where you know what party and what

235
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:21,020
candidate where they're from on the top

236
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:23,480
right for most of these so you can

237
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,280
quickly know what I'm talking about on

238
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:28,760
the left here you see a sample scan this

239
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:31,160
like these are actual hits this is Al

240
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:34,490
Franken dot-com Al Franken dot net if

241
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:36,380
you get nothing it just looks like you

242
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:39,740
know it's basically just a HTTP error on

243
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:42,500
the right here you get um after millions

244
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,840
of these errors basically you get out

245
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,940
Frank whatever and these are the actual

246
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:49,760
positive results you see your input and

247
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,430
how long it took to perform that scan

248
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:55,700
which is cool the same thing here this

249
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:59,060
is uh this is a red a candidate Cory

250
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:01,790
Gardner um and the same thing you can

251
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:04,640
see he had a lot less output and we're

252
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,950
talking I'm scanning millions and upon

253
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:10,370
millions and we have 15 positive results

254
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:13,640
here so as a lot of things that it makes

255
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:16,790
a lot of incorrect guesses um like I

256
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:18,950
said this is a multi-year project lots

257
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:21,980
of log files lots of screenshots thanks

258
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:25,940
to Google for hosting that um we got

259
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:28,520
lots of false positives and parked

260
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:31,040
domains we're talking ninety percent of

261
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,410
the screenshots we got were just go

262
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:35,720
daddy like it's basically just go daddy

263
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:38,030
everything's go daddy it seemed I

264
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:40,820
expected a lot more domains out there

265
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:42,980
that would be through other registrar's

266
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:45,110
um we didn't find a lot of malicious

267
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:47,480
activity in 2014 found a lot more in

268
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:51,530
2012 actually done mostly slanderous

269
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:53,990
sites and we don't have any statistical

270
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:55,700
analysis on this at this point in time

271
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:58,210
something I'm building into it for 2016

272
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:00,980
should be cool let's take a look at some

273
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:03,470
of the positive things here the positive

274
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:06,080
results the slender sites we just call

275
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,840
that muckraking it's where you someone

276
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:11,090
purchases it someone purchases a domain

277
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:14,630
that people are likely to visit like Jeb

278
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:18,680
Bush with two H's someone might

279
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:20,000
accidentally typed that and they would

280
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,160
put up a anti

281
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:28,040
Jeb Bush ad or a a Bernie Sanders with

282
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,560
no II and it would you know put up an

283
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,589
anti Bernie Sanders ad um these sites

284
00:13:33,589 --> 00:13:36,529
could be from blogs from citizens or

285
00:13:36,529 --> 00:13:38,209
sites set up by their opponent doesn't

286
00:13:38,209 --> 00:13:39,800
really matter it's kind of interesting

287
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,269
though to see what people put up there

288
00:13:41,269 --> 00:13:43,610
this is probably legal right there is an

289
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:47,269
anti type of squatting law in the US but

290
00:13:47,269 --> 00:13:49,399
I'm fairly certain this this this falls

291
00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:51,019
under the First Amendment that pesky

292
00:13:51,019 --> 00:13:53,899
First Amendment and we found a lot of

293
00:13:53,899 --> 00:13:56,680
these muck muckraking sites as the most

294
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,970
thing that we found here here's mark

295
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:01,759
Udall the site was actually marks you

296
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:03,170
doll you can see in the bottom left-hand

297
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:06,139
corner um kind of interesting you know

298
00:14:06,139 --> 00:14:08,660
there's a fairly decent graphic designer

299
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:12,350
behind this you know well done um kind

300
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:15,139
of a cool site um right here you have

301
00:14:15,139 --> 00:14:18,439
the real Cory Gardner and that's what it

302
00:14:18,439 --> 00:14:22,310
is real Cory Gardner calm and well this

303
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:24,379
is part of the development of election

304
00:14:24,379 --> 00:14:28,370
Buster when I found a site such as real

305
00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:30,800
Cory Gardner my tool probably wouldn't

306
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,990
have caught that and so once i saw that

307
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:36,380
i put that in to my tool as a template

308
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:39,500
and so I you know I now try real first

309
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:42,889
name last name Kaka Norcom me us info

310
00:14:42,889 --> 00:14:45,410
whatever and that's just how the tool

311
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:48,860
iterated this is another interesting one

312
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:51,889
Shelly cupido just hypocrite and coward

313
00:14:51,889 --> 00:14:55,430
but they're missing an e in shelley down

314
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:58,660
al in the left-hand corner you can see

315
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:01,850
another slanderous site here this is for

316
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:05,120
a Democrat a me bell guard I'm actually

317
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,100
learned a lot about all these candidates

318
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:08,959
that I'd never heard of before you have

319
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:10,699
to go visit the way their wikipedia page

320
00:15:10,699 --> 00:15:14,149
right yeah and uh someone didn't like

321
00:15:14,149 --> 00:15:16,759
her and they put up a you know Amy is

322
00:15:16,759 --> 00:15:19,519
not cool website and she actually didn't

323
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:24,019
win so identifying typo squatters this

324
00:15:24,019 --> 00:15:25,850
one's cool because this was the biggest

325
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:29,750
race in 2014 the biggest race at least

326
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:32,029
in my opinion was the secretary of state

327
00:15:32,029 --> 00:15:34,810
of Kentucky vs

328
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:38,680
McConnell who is in the the the US

329
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:42,279
Senate and he's I think he's the he's

330
00:15:42,279 --> 00:15:44,950
the he's not the juniors he's the senior

331
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:48,310
senator yeah and so Alison Grimes was

332
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:51,460
really challenging him and so what you

333
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:54,339
see here is you go to Mitch McConnell

334
00:15:54,339 --> 00:15:59,260
dot org and ends up going to Alison for

335
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:03,640
KY which is Kentucky and so I have no

336
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:06,279
idea if Alison Grimes actually did this

337
00:16:06,279 --> 00:16:10,360
I doubt it but who knows that's the

338
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,680
whole thing about this you know on the

339
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,170
Internet in general if someone attacks

340
00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:16,810
you attribution is difficult right you

341
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:19,510
can check the who is but most of the

342
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:23,740
time that's redacted so yeah so we saw a

343
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:26,980
fair amount of typos squatters there and

344
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:29,350
then the predicting who will run this

345
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:33,220
was done in 2014 I promise I have no way

346
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:36,190
to prove to you that but um this game

347
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:38,680
was done in 24 14 these are just some of

348
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:41,050
the domains that I saw for chris

349
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:42,850
Christie at that point in time people

350
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:44,070
were talking about him being the

351
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:47,140
Republican front runner so I you know I

352
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:48,760
paid a lot of attention to him at that

353
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:51,250
point in time and so I just set it up

354
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:54,550
for Chris Christie New Jersey president

355
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:56,910
2016 and this is what pops out there's

356
00:16:56,910 --> 00:17:00,370
many many more and then same thing for

357
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:02,980
Hillary this is yeah this is Hillary I

358
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:05,349
know whether to call Hillary Arkansas or

359
00:17:05,349 --> 00:17:09,640
New York so I put in in in why and the

360
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,679
top right so whatever if I'm if I'm

361
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:13,869
wrong and again what you're seeing here

362
00:17:13,869 --> 00:17:16,089
is a very methodical person going

363
00:17:16,089 --> 00:17:17,980
through and purchasing all these domains

364
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:19,720
which really should make someone think

365
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,790
it's probably someone doing that because

366
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:25,270
a lot of the a lot of the scans didn't

367
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:28,119
have this many recent results most

368
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:31,050
people returned five or six domains max

369
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:34,120
and so then I think Hillary returned

370
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:40,330
like 180 or something um malware so this

371
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:42,160
happened a couple times and it taught me

372
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,290
a good lesson of doing this on my

373
00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:47,679
personal box don't do it not in a vm as

374
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:48,700
I was stupid

375
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:51,450
um got to blow away my whole computer

376
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:54,730
but I found her this is phil gingrey

377
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:58,030
he's from Georgia um went there and he's

378
00:17:58,030 --> 00:17:59,710
a drive-by download and some nice

379
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:03,580
malware hit my hit my box I so we

380
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:07,210
alerted the candidate via Twitter the

381
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:09,490
guy never got got back with me I don't

382
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:13,420
know what what gives I don't know but

383
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:14,710
yeah it's kind of it was kind of

384
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:15,610
interesting we saw a couple different

385
00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:20,740
instances of that and last in 2012 just

386
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:24,130
just off the top of my head in 2012 we

387
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:26,770
found a number of candidates who were

388
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:31,080
actually accidentally hosting of viagra

389
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:34,420
stores on their own they're really old

390
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:37,390
website so you know like Obama still had

391
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:40,270
like a Obama 2008 site um you know and

392
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:42,730
it his wasn't one of those but a lot of

393
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:44,470
candidates just kind of let their old

394
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:48,300
sites die but they just kept him up and

395
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:50,770
there's left him unmaintained a lot of

396
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:53,830
them got penetrated and yeah it's kind

397
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:55,900
of interesting future updates to

398
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:58,390
election Buster on make it faster I

399
00:18:58,390 --> 00:19:00,970
think I can do that through some dns

400
00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:04,150
tricks statistical analysis I want to

401
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:06,580
put that in there I here are is a cool

402
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:08,530
programming language just for that I've

403
00:19:08,530 --> 00:19:10,960
never done it sounds like a fun

404
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,140
challenge I want to use computer vision

405
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:16,750
to automatically pull out the parked

406
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:20,440
domains um seems pretty easy because

407
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:23,230
every single godaddy site has that giant

408
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:25,420
godaddy logo in the exact same spot um

409
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:28,050
frankly I probably just parse the HTML

410
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:30,400
using you know pythons beautifulsoup

411
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:34,330
library but I want to make a fun yeah so

412
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:36,220
I want to pull those out to make to

413
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:38,800
reduce my total screenshots that I have

414
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:42,430
to review from millions to you know a

415
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:44,230
couple hundred hopefully something I can

416
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:46,690
sit down with a giant pizza and two

417
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:48,400
liter of Code Red you know and just

418
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,300
finish it um piping into who is lots of

419
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:54,310
dump domains which is really really cool

420
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:56,770
that we find all these crazy domains

421
00:19:56,770 --> 00:20:00,850
let's throw them through um who is let's

422
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:02,680
pull down that information and

423
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:04,300
a parse that in fact that that

424
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:05,950
information out I wrote a quick little

425
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:08,440
script to read election Buster output

426
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:11,350
files and put that information all into

427
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:13,360
a single dock for you and then it scans

428
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:16,660
it for Gmail Hotmail you know whatever

429
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:19,300
gov and it just has and it just kind of

430
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:21,070
puts that out and says hey here's a

431
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:25,090
couple email addresses um here is Alison

432
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:28,230
Grimes again her um her husband

433
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:32,920
registered a domain for her and he used

434
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:35,230
his real first name last name and then

435
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:36,880
he's real address if you look it up on

436
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,460
google maps you can totally see it and

437
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:41,440
he used a real phone number to totally

438
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,780
wanted to call that phone number but i

439
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:49,530
didn't um wink now um then the PA House

440
00:20:49,530 --> 00:20:51,460
Republicans was kind of interesting

441
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:54,310
instead of using whois privacy from like

442
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:58,000
GoDaddy or wherever um they just use the

443
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,910
gmail address PA House Republicans @

444
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:04,570
gmail.com we're just kind of cool and

445
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:06,310
you know there's three that happen to be

446
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:07,870
using it but it was literally like it

447
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:11,560
was was it I think was like 50-something

448
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:16,330
people so I wanted to apply this to

449
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:18,670
other areas you got state and county

450
00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:21,160
election sites right you got super PACs

451
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:23,320
you got special interest groups why

452
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:25,300
can't this concept be done in other

453
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:27,730
areas act blue is something that just

454
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:29,410
kept popping up again and again and

455
00:21:29,410 --> 00:21:32,440
again and act blue was actually it's

456
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:35,020
like a um when you push donate on it on

457
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:37,530
a Democrat site except for Hillary um

458
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:40,480
you're probably using act blues tech

459
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,150
it's just you know like a like a portal

460
00:21:43,150 --> 00:21:47,050
to receive money and I was like oh man

461
00:21:47,050 --> 00:21:48,460
it's gonna be so cool it's gonna be all

462
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:51,580
these fake act blue sites no there was a

463
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:54,550
bunch of a bunch of parked domains with

464
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:56,470
very similar names but no one's actually

465
00:21:56,470 --> 00:21:59,830
using them so those two were the real

466
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:01,390
sites everything else was just a false

467
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:04,150
alarm I thought I'd be interesting just

468
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:06,820
to scan the our country deserves better

469
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:09,550
pac and you know when you get to these

470
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:12,520
long domains like our country deserves

471
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:16,010
better calm election Buster takes so

472
00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:18,260
long because it runs through every

473
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:19,850
single possible combination a through z

474
00:22:19,850 --> 00:22:23,690
1 through 0 through 9 and this thing ran

475
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:26,810
for like a day or so now I fur for yet

476
00:22:26,810 --> 00:22:30,250
but it only returned one which was very

477
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:33,500
anti-climactic this was kind of cool I

478
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,780
was just cruisin on a Maryland State

479
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:38,180
Board of Elections website like you do

480
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:41,030
and i saw this really interesting note

481
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:42,860
that says potential fishing alert

482
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:44,630
legitimate emails from the State Board

483
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:48,460
of Elections end with Maryland gov

484
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:50,960
there's some other information there and

485
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,880
so I thought oh man i'm totally scanning

486
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:56,000
that it's gonna be awesome i scanned it

487
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:01,280
ended up being really weird so you can

488
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:04,100
see all these typos that returned or

489
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:08,120
real site and not exactly sure what's

490
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:11,210
going on with it everyone wants to help

491

492
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:16,310
contacted them they're not exactly sure

493
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:18,740
what's going on either but basically

494
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:22,010
anything I think someone bought md org

495
00:23:22,010 --> 00:23:25,430
and indeed calm and I think there are

496
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:28,520
they are just re re turning a splash

497
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:31,460
page for that sub domain I'm not sure

498
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:35,120
it's really shady looking though so yeah

499
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,940
that was kind of cool um 2016

500
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:40,420
presidential hopefuls this was awesome

501
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:42,550
you can't have anything without

502
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:44,810
anonymous right at a security conference

503
00:23:44,810 --> 00:23:51,050

505
00:23:57,230 --> 00:24:00,560

506
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:03,200

513
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,580
attribution is difficult who knows is

514
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:27,020
actually an anonymous um yeah so here's

515
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:29,030
some more Trump pages I didn't drop in

516
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:29,840
the URL

517
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:33,320
but they're all various typos um my

518
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:37,070
favorite is Ronald Trump 2616 I'm

519
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:40,130
digging that one um Trump make America

520
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:43,789
great again that's that's like a pro

521
00:24:43,789 --> 00:24:47,779
Trump site um here uh you know don't be

522
00:24:47,779 --> 00:24:49,340
an idiot are you seriously considering

523
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:51,470
voting for Trump are you Anna whatever

524
00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:53,659
um a lot that you can't really see it

525
00:24:53,659 --> 00:24:55,429
because of the projector but it's a cat

526
00:24:55,429 --> 00:24:57,860
with Donald Trump hair and this is

527
00:24:57,860 --> 00:25:00,679
another cat I don't know why someone

528
00:25:00,679 --> 00:25:04,610
else also had a bunch of chickadees like

529
00:25:04,610 --> 00:25:07,909
tiny ducks or whatever with tiny toupees

530
00:25:07,909 --> 00:25:10,640
on that was really cute I just kept that

531
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:13,909
one from my own usage um yeah and uh

532
00:25:13,909 --> 00:25:15,770
Donald Trump I should did a really good

533
00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:19,340
job of defending his name space if you

534
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:22,220
will um he purchased a lot of the really

535
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:25,010
reasonable don't domains that one would

536
00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:28,970
need to purchase um and uh there was a

537
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:32,779
lot less um you know anti Donald Trump

538
00:25:32,779 --> 00:25:35,659
muck raking stuff than I thought that

539
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:36,620
there would be I figure there was gonna

540
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:39,649
be all it he's a very he's a candidate

541
00:25:39,649 --> 00:25:42,320
who gets people excited one way or the

542
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:43,610
other so I figure there's going to be a

543
00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:45,110
lot of interesting things there and I'm

544
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:47,539
a little less than I thought um I will

545
00:25:47,539 --> 00:25:50,899
say that Donald a Donald Trump redirects

546
00:25:50,899 --> 00:25:53,570
to a Jeb Bush sucks facebook site um

547
00:25:53,570 --> 00:25:56,809
don't know why um yeah and then there's

548
00:25:56,809 --> 00:26:00,080
a lot of redirects from his name space

549
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:04,039
to Bernie Sanders um his act blue page I

550
00:26:04,039 --> 00:26:07,270
don't know why I just what I found um

551
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:10,309
this is interesting ah this is Carly

552
00:26:10,309 --> 00:26:13,360
Fiorina can ever say her name right um

553
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:17,090
shoes she did some controversial things

554
00:26:17,090 --> 00:26:18,169
I'm just assuming no one knows anything

555
00:26:18,169 --> 00:26:20,149
about politics whatever she did some

556
00:26:20,149 --> 00:26:22,580
some really interesting things in terms

557
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:26,779
of um she she fired a lot of people made

558
00:26:26,779 --> 00:26:29,720
a lot of people angry and so I found

559
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:31,789
this site it's Carly Fiorina or get

560
00:26:31,789 --> 00:26:33,950

for you yeah it's kind of just kind of

576
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:24,750
interesting um I found in terms of

577
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:27,330
Hillary I got notes here um so there was

578
00:27:27,330 --> 00:27:30,930
lots of Hillary's going to run in twenty

579
00:27:30,930 --> 00:27:33,900
sixteen pages it's not like Hillary's

580
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:36,390
running right now it relies of like

581
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:39,060
Hillary is going to run pages I have no

582
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:42,180
idea why I was like what they all said

583
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:43,590
you know Hillary is going to be running

584
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:47,850
get get ready um I didn't find many

585
00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:49,680
slanderous sites against Hillary I was

586
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:53,250
surprised by that um yeah I think I have

587
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:56,610
one more photo here's Bernie um yeah

588
00:27:56,610 --> 00:27:59,190
Bernie for prez org this is a pro hem

589
00:27:59,190 --> 00:28:01,500
site I didn't find many folks do an anti

590
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:04,620
Bernie sites either in a matter of fact

591
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:06,960
I mean if you look hard enough you see

592
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,640
the guy from Back to the Future in the

593
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:12,750
bottom right hand corner but yeah this

594
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:15,510
is a site from someone else who just

595
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:18,660
happens to be named Sanders um he

596
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:19,920
doesn't look like Doc from Back to the

597
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:24,150
Future gosh okay fine um but yeah there

598
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:26,250
wasn't too many anti Bernie pages I

599
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:29,850
expected there to be going a little

600
00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:32,150
faster than I expected odds and ends

601
00:28:32,150 --> 00:28:35,430
political domain registrars there's some

602
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:39,060
political web names here the that's the

603
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:42,300
company this freaking site shows up

604
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:44,730
everywhere like they bought a lot of my

605
00:28:44,730 --> 00:28:47,760
templates and so then I set some of my

606
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,460
templates I based it off of their info

607
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:52,800
and so I figured they knew what they

608
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,929
were talking about and I didn't include

609
00:28:54,929 --> 00:28:55,990
them unless I had a real

610
00:28:55,990 --> 00:28:59,300
example but I mean this guy's just Joel

611
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:01,450
here is given out his cell phone number

612
00:29:01,450 --> 00:29:05,630
for you doll 2016 but then he's not even

613
00:29:05,630 --> 00:29:06,740
talking about you doll that much he's

614
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:09,800
talking mostly Clinton um yeah kind of

615
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:12,410
odd and then you get a cool Ronald

616
00:29:12,410 --> 00:29:15,590
Reagan come by this it's a bunch of

617
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:18,260
different domains so there's like I most

618
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:19,820
of these domains people are selling them

619
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:23,750
for like $2,000 I've no I no idea if

620
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:25,910
that's a real market value but they're

621
00:29:25,910 --> 00:29:27,170
trying to sell them for thousands of

622
00:29:27,170 --> 00:29:29,450
dollars and now with my current

623
00:29:29,450 --> 00:29:30,950
knowledge of how this stuff works you

624
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:32,120
can bet I'm gonna be trying to make some

625
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:35,300
money in 2016 so we'll see how that

626
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:39,560
works out this is my award for the most

627
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:41,960
American domain you get a quote from

628
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:44,270
Patrick Henry you get a gun you get ammo

629
00:29:44,270 --> 00:29:48,050
you get the Constitution you know I have

630
00:29:48,050 --> 00:29:50,180
no idea what the sites even about it

631
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:53,930
just showed up I mean and this is this

632
00:29:53,930 --> 00:29:56,420
is par for the course here I I did I

633
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:58,160
didn't think I'd have time to show a lot

634
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:00,340
of crazy domains but now I wish I did um

635
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:04,520
but yeah we found just so many crazy

636
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:06,710
things I saw people trying to sell blood

637
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:09,170
right I mean just like vials of blood

638
00:30:09,170 --> 00:30:11,720
and it's got all these Russian Cyrillic

639
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:14,690
alphabet there lots of porn for some

640
00:30:14,690 --> 00:30:19,070
reason and it was mostly Japanese um I

641
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:23,210
don't quite know why there was trying to

642
00:30:23,210 --> 00:30:26,030
think lots of parked don't domains and

643
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:30,200
then lots of student elections people

644
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,910
are putting up their own student

645
00:30:31,910 --> 00:30:35,900
election page like like every there was

646
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:38,060
just so many student elections i found

647
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:40,330
that a lot of the candidates ended up um

648
00:30:40,330 --> 00:30:42,770
really ended up leaving up their old

649
00:30:42,770 --> 00:30:44,870
pages from from past years i think i

650
00:30:44,870 --> 00:30:46,610
talked about that a little bit but um

651
00:30:46,610 --> 00:30:50,300
and they just let those pages go into

652
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:52,720
dis just disorder and some of these

653
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,800
candidates in the House and Senate have

654
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,570
been you know in the House and Senate

655
00:30:56,570 --> 00:30:59,390
for you know over at a decade and so is

656
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:01,280
those folks in the house some of them

657
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:03,770
have a page every two years for their

658
00:31:03,770 --> 00:31:05,330
new election and you can like actually

659
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:07,160
look at it it's cool because you can see

660
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,610
how web

661
00:31:08,610 --> 00:31:11,940
design changed every two years which is

662
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:15,360
kind of interesting um his

663
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,460
recommendations and conclusions here

664
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:20,460
here's my common templates list um I

665
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:22,950
mean anyone running nowadays I think

666
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:25,980
should really purchase these L name + F

667
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:29,280
name right um el name hyphen F name

668
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:32,640
fname plus year fname plus last name

669
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:37,770
plus year vote I get a hit every single

670
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:40,740
time with vote it almost I mean even if

671
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:43,799
it's just like even if it's just the

672
00:31:43,799 --> 00:31:46,620
wrong site I still will get something

673
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:49,950
for a vote + first name a team plus

674
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:52,620
first name I think Mitch McConnell

675
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:55,890
started that in 2012 maybe but now it's

676
00:31:55,890 --> 00:31:57,870
super super popular like everyone's

677
00:31:57,870 --> 00:32:00,080
having their own team something or other

678
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:04,260
fname for position so like Josh for

679
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:07,740
president and hint um that would be a

680
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:10,470
fairly popular that would be a fairly

681
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:16,950
popular domain and then if candidates

682
00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:19,110
are going to do this that's just the

683
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:21,330
actual you know a text of the domain

684
00:32:21,330 --> 00:32:22,880
that has nothing to do with the actual

685
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:27,419
TLD and so I found a lot of comm net org

686
00:32:27,419 --> 00:32:30,240
me us and info I should have put info

687
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,790
there as some of you know there was just

688
00:32:32,790 --> 00:32:36,230
like huge amounts of domains like new

689
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:39,990
TLDs that word a beaut um because I was

690
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:43,530
kind of getting into this I was on I saw

691
00:32:43,530 --> 00:32:45,120
right when that happened and I was like

692
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:47,520
oh I'm gonna buy cyber ninja it's gonna

693
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:49,590
be awesome and I bought that for like

694
00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:52,830
two hundred dollars and um then I was

695
00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:53,880
like I'm gonna sell this for twenty

696
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,740
thousand dollars and then they ended up

697
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:57,960
taking it away from me then selling it

698
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:01,230
does it to someone else but uh anyway I

699
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:04,080
was very unhappy about that um and then

700
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:07,440
our tool does suggest domains you should

701
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,750
purchase like you should purchase the

702
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:12,390
moment it gets used and so like when you

703
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:14,100
actually push enter the first thing it

704
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:16,350
does it says okay with your inputs here

705
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:19,860
are the top you know 12 that you should

706
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:21,750
use you should go ahead and buy

707
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:27,900
these um so for 2014 it was just um so

708
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:29,880
there wasn't a lot I was I knew there

709
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,350
wasn't going to be a lot I thought there

710
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:32,640
was going to be more than what I found

711
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:35,790
um with the 2012 not even really trying

712
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:39,510
I found so much stuff so many people

713
00:33:39,510 --> 00:33:40,980
stealing traffic from each other

714
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:46,320
stealing money all these fake sites but

715
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:49,500
I really didn't find that and I I didn't

716
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:52,500
find that in the 2014 um and as you can

717
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:55,500
see with some of those 2016 hopefuls the

718
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:56,790
presidential election is where you start

719
00:33:56,790 --> 00:33:59,850
seeing on actual cybercrime and so my

720
00:33:59,850 --> 00:34:02,820
goal is now I can take scans every month

721
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:04,170
I'm going to do them on the first of

722
00:34:04,170 --> 00:34:06,030
every single month and then I'm going to

723
00:34:06,030 --> 00:34:08,850
make some statistical analysis tools and

724
00:34:08,850 --> 00:34:11,010
AH but you don't be able to actually

725
00:34:11,010 --> 00:34:12,629
measure how much of this is actually

726
00:34:12,629 --> 00:34:14,909
going on and that will be cool to

727
00:34:14,909 --> 00:34:18,179
actually get numbers on this yeah our

728
00:34:18,179 --> 00:34:20,310
tools can be used by any candidate and

729
00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:22,679
I'm kind of hoping some candidate will

730
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:24,060
actually use it I don't know how they'll

731
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:26,639
figure out I'll a post on Twitter and

732
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:30,360
stuff but I mean you know a really you

733
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:33,300
know dog catcher style candidate someone

734
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:35,370
is at the local level they can they can

735
00:34:35,370 --> 00:34:37,949
use this and they can protect their

736
00:34:37,949 --> 00:34:41,699
brand which is kind of cool and so

737
00:34:41,699 --> 00:34:43,710
candidates should basically purchase

738
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:46,580
these these domains in my opinion um

739
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:48,750
cannon should not put personal

740
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:51,418
information into the Whois data base i

741
00:34:51,418 --> 00:34:52,850
know i'm speaking to the choir here

742
00:34:52,850 --> 00:34:56,610
except for that guy um and look twice

743
00:34:56,610 --> 00:34:58,140
before you donate make sure it's

744
00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:00,570
actually who you know make sure that the

745
00:35:00,570 --> 00:35:02,160
money is actually going to who you think

746
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:04,470
and if you want a copy of our data just

747
00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:05,850
ask i'm going to put all this up on my

748
00:35:05,850 --> 00:35:08,910
personal website um and if anyone wants

749
00:35:08,910 --> 00:35:11,310
that information that links probably

750
00:35:11,310 --> 00:35:13,130
going to be active in a couple hours um

751
00:35:13,130 --> 00:35:19,580
yeah so that's my talk and any questions

752
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:30,480
yes sir um no I did not he is a very he

753
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:34,350
is a very divisive Canada radio so

754
00:35:34,350 --> 00:35:35,040
another

755
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:38,870
who really excites people um and so um I

756
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:41,700
didn't show anything from rick santorum

757
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:47,670
because it was definitely not PG um yes

758
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:58,440
sir once more I'm sorry URL crazy I'm

759
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:00,450
unfamiliar with it sir please enlighten

760
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:20,390
me that have been awesome to know about

761
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:39,320
oh cool nice nice no that's really

762
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,580
really cool I hadn't even thought about

763
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:43,130
um yeah yeah going through let it so it

764
00:36:43,130 --> 00:36:45,740
is actually looking into a registrar the

765
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:49,430
tool from a registrar okay no no it's

766
00:36:49,430 --> 00:36:55,880
totally cool love it love it yeah I mean

767
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:58,850
um and that's part of the that's part of

768
00:36:58,850 --> 00:37:01,190
the process of making the tool more

769
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:03,140
streamlined right if I can take out a

770
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:06,410
couple million bad guesses it can be a

771
00:37:06,410 --> 00:37:09,920
much better tool and work faster yeah

772
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:12,440
cool thank you any other any other

773
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:18,460
questions yes sir

774
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:41,630
can you a example me that's a great

775
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:43,910
point I never thought to look at that

776
00:37:43,910 --> 00:37:46,300
off the top of my head i will say that

777
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:48,830
whenever i found like a slanderous or a

778
00:37:48,830 --> 00:37:50,990
muckraking site i really didn't see

779
00:37:50,990 --> 00:37:54,710
those but yeah it's something that's

780
00:37:54,710 --> 00:37:56,810
fairly easy maybe that um maybe that'll

781
00:37:56,810 --> 00:37:58,610
go with the whole computer vision thing

782
00:37:58,610 --> 00:38:01,310
you know I can look for a box at the

783
00:38:01,310 --> 00:38:03,140
bottom of the website that would be a

784
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:04,520
good little indicator this is a

785
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:06,860
legitimate site think it's a cool idea

786
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:20,320
idea hmm yes oh yes sir yeah

787
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:33,760
I found 12 into 2014 and they're all for

788
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:38,050
house candidates um and yeah

789
00:38:38,050 --> 00:38:40,780
unfortunately I only found those on one

790
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:46,599
side of the coin there um but that's

791
00:38:46,599 --> 00:38:48,160
that's what I was really looking for

792
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:49,690
right with those types of things that's

793
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:55,480
what I want um so I don't haven't really

794
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:57,309
done much because I work for the federal

795
00:38:57,309 --> 00:39:00,099
government and I am I didn't really

796
00:39:00,099 --> 00:39:03,400
wanna I didn't really want to make too

797
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:05,980
many waves when I when I saw things that

798
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:07,359
were you know obviously bad like malware

799
00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:11,170
I I alerted the candidate ASAP but I am

800
00:39:11,170 --> 00:39:14,710
definitely hesitant in calling a site um

801
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:20,530
a site you know a crime in general I

802
00:39:20,530 --> 00:39:25,240
mean we can see that uh yeah I can show

803
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:26,829
some more examples of those if you want

804
00:39:26,829 --> 00:39:30,819
but if you read the first thing there I

805
00:39:30,819 --> 00:39:33,280
mean there's a case to be made that this

806
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:35,260
is a legitimate site and that's kind of

807
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:37,990
the issue um it's it's a there's a

808
00:39:37,990 --> 00:39:40,420
serious shade of gray because I mean the

809
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:43,089
small text is John Lewis is tired of

810
00:39:43,089 --> 00:39:44,950
sitting on the sidelines watching his

811
00:39:44,950 --> 00:39:46,900
boss long time liberal Crusader Max

812
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:49,930
Baucus it means that you know John Lewis

813
00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:53,619
is bad form on Montana right I mean so I

814
00:39:53,619 --> 00:39:56,290
can see a case to be made that this is

815
00:39:56,290 --> 00:40:00,369
just a user hurriedly going through and

816
00:40:00,369 --> 00:40:04,150
clicking donate at the same time I could

817
00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:06,790
see there being you know this is it's

818
00:40:06,790 --> 00:40:08,619
kind of a vulnerability if you will I

819
00:40:08,619 --> 00:40:10,359
mean this is like this is like a UI

820
00:40:10,359 --> 00:40:12,520
issue it's like you know you I trickery

821
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:18,609
um yeah yeah almost yeah um yeah so then

822
00:40:18,609 --> 00:40:20,619
I love these ones because there was just

823
00:40:20,619 --> 00:40:23,619
they were they're all out there I'm easy

824
00:40:23,619 --> 00:40:26,020
to find my tool found them quickly and

825
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:29,589
um yeah and they were just so gray I

826
00:40:29,589 --> 00:40:32,109
couldn't figure out who did who who was

827
00:40:32,109 --> 00:40:34,630
actually at fault there and the who is

828
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:36,849
information for this was not a you know

829
00:40:36,849 --> 00:40:40,569
a scared at all I think these are

830
00:40:40,569 --> 00:40:41,140
actually

831
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:42,940
out there if you want to take a look at

832
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:47,740
them any other questions we got lots of

833
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:51,099
time folks so sorry for going short yes

834
00:40:51,099 --> 00:41:06,099
sir maybe that would be interesting to

835
00:41:06,099 --> 00:41:09,150
know again a good idea for a future

836
00:41:09,150 --> 00:41:13,599
seriously for a future thing to add I I

837
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:15,579
just didn't to be honest I just didn't

838
00:41:15,579 --> 00:41:19,059
think to do that I love it yeah why

839
00:41:19,059 --> 00:41:21,700
wouldn't that happen yeah love it yes

840
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:23,879
ma'am

841
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:59,329
that's pretty love it no no that's a

842
00:41:59,329 --> 00:42:01,569
cool idea

843
00:42:08,790 --> 00:42:12,730
yeah I love it yeah I hadn't thought to

844
00:42:12,730 --> 00:42:14,500
do that but it's a fairly simple thing

845
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:17,290
you know I just gotta hit the wikipedia

846
00:42:17,290 --> 00:42:19,510
page for a given candidate and then um

847
00:42:19,510 --> 00:42:24,310
you know run another scan yeah I was a

848
00:42:24,310 --> 00:42:26,590
bow no no what's the name my lives hey

849
00:42:26,590 --> 00:42:30,160
Misbah okay now I'm kind of curious

850
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:31,930
gonna does anyone know if there's a bow

851
00:42:31,930 --> 00:42:36,010
for president site um yeah yeah I like

852
00:42:36,010 --> 00:42:39,760
that um yeah the only issue to not do

853
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:43,300
that would be um be another set of log

854
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:45,910
files and scans to a store but I mean

855
00:42:45,910 --> 00:42:47,560
it's not too big of a deal I mean

856
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:50,410
whatever i'm paying for like 60 gig of

857
00:42:50,410 --> 00:42:55,300
google storage i'm picking up what

858
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:58,240
you're putting down totally agreed

859
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:06,370
agreed yes sir no no i didn't i didn't

860
00:43:06,370 --> 00:43:08,710
really have anything that was a crazy

861
00:43:08,710 --> 00:43:10,900
cool in 2014 so I didn't really track it

862
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:13,030
track it down that much I mean this one

863
00:43:13,030 --> 00:43:14,980
was someone was taking credit for this

864
00:43:14,980 --> 00:43:17,050
site right for these you know these were

865
00:43:17,050 --> 00:43:21,520
the 12 smoking smoking guns for 2014 but

866
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:25,570
in 2012 yeah we did that sort of stuff

867
00:43:25,570 --> 00:43:31,240
yeah and that's how we found those fake

868
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:34,110
DNC and RNC pages you know and then

869
00:43:34,110 --> 00:43:36,730
someone might have scanned those sites

870
00:43:36,730 --> 00:43:40,150
as well you know see what they're

871
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:42,130
running a top of and things of that

872
00:43:42,130 --> 00:43:46,570
nature um any other questions 10 more

873
00:43:46,570 --> 00:43:49,260
min yes sir

874
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:55,780
haughton did I see candidates

875
00:43:55,780 --> 00:44:00,040
sporadically squatting oh okay see ya

876
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:02,560
Trump did a great job of that Trump did

877
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:06,599
a really great job um trying to think uh

878
00:44:06,599 --> 00:44:09,520
frankly it was it kind of correlated

879
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:12,460
with the larger the candidate was

880
00:44:12,460 --> 00:44:15,160
because my guess is that they actually

881
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:16,800
have someone who understands technology

882
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:20,830
behind them right um and that that would

883
00:44:20,830 --> 00:44:23,290
make sense right I didn't include it

884
00:44:23,290 --> 00:44:28,740
right but you can see mm-hmm here like

885
00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:31,869
there was a fun little Hillary one due

886
00:44:31,869 --> 00:44:34,660
to two ah man where's the hell everyone

887
00:44:34,660 --> 00:44:36,910
if you uh if you looked at the actual

888
00:44:36,910 --> 00:44:40,060
HTH tml of oh this was a good he'll

889
00:44:40,060 --> 00:44:47,680
everyone I was interested yeah totally

890
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:50,290
wasn't just doing my slides oh this is a

891
00:44:50,290 --> 00:44:56,380
good one Hillary Klingon um yeah like

892
00:44:56,380 --> 00:44:57,910
actually Hillary didn't do a very good

893
00:44:57,910 --> 00:45:02,290
job of squatting but if you look at her

894
00:45:02,290 --> 00:45:04,450
you know at the HTML behind her page

895
00:45:04,450 --> 00:45:07,660
actually she has her logo in a ski and

896
00:45:07,660 --> 00:45:08,589
it says you know if you want to come

897
00:45:08,589 --> 00:45:10,990
work for the hillary campaign you know

898
00:45:10,990 --> 00:45:13,359
click this link we just kind of let's

899
00:45:13,359 --> 00:45:14,589
get that's kind of interesting actually

900
00:45:14,589 --> 00:45:20,500
I think 222 oh yeah oh yeah oh I mean

901
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:22,660
those were that those were the domains

902
00:45:22,660 --> 00:45:25,630
that return that's positive reason

903
00:45:25,630 --> 00:45:27,790
reason reason results but a good number

904
00:45:27,790 --> 00:45:29,619
of those are just parked don't don't

905
00:45:29,619 --> 00:45:31,990
domains that I couldn't figure out if it

906
00:45:31,990 --> 00:45:35,070
was actually anyone which stinks like um

907
00:45:35,070 --> 00:45:38,970
so here's results file from Hillary um

908
00:45:38,970 --> 00:45:43,810
this is all me just making slides but

909
00:45:43,810 --> 00:45:47,230
okay cool so this is like really what a

910
00:45:47,230 --> 00:45:49,180
election buster results file looks like

911
00:45:49,180 --> 00:45:50,830
I mean you get all this information

912
00:45:50,830 --> 00:45:54,880
about it um just kind of goes on due to

913
00:45:54,880 --> 00:46:00,550
do and here are the positive results 177

914
00:46:00,550 --> 00:46:01,920
is what Hillary had as

915
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:05,880
of Thursday yeah and so I have to go

916
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:09,210
through through all these and most of

917
00:46:09,210 --> 00:46:11,579
them are just go daddy and I hate my

918
00:46:11,579 --> 00:46:23,460
life the whole time yes sir I didn't but

919
00:46:23,460 --> 00:46:25,530
it's a really reasonable feature yeah

920
00:46:25,530 --> 00:46:28,049
actually I I'll probably build build

921
00:46:28,049 --> 00:46:29,819
that in as someone could you know

922
00:46:29,819 --> 00:46:31,770
optionally include that command line

923
00:46:31,770 --> 00:46:34,799
argument because why not i mean the the

924
00:46:34,799 --> 00:46:37,380
biggest reason again to say no is that i

925
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:39,690
might get a lot of extra garbage but you

926
00:46:39,690 --> 00:46:42,569
know i can get something cool and it's

927
00:46:42,569 --> 00:46:43,799
going to make it run slower because

928
00:46:43,799 --> 00:46:45,599
you're adding like six or seven letters

929
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:48,089
and so it's like six or seven letters to

930
00:46:48,089 --> 00:46:50,520
the your total character set so like a

931
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:52,890
through z 0 through 9 which is going to

932
00:46:52,890 --> 00:46:54,450
add that on and that's going to be you

933
00:46:54,450 --> 00:46:55,770
know it's going to add a lot more but

934
00:46:55,770 --> 00:46:58,230
still um why not yeah love it yes ma'am

935
00:46:58,230 --> 00:47:00,500
Oh

936
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:26,670
okay r yeah that makes sense interesting

937
00:47:28,790 --> 00:47:32,840
i love it i will totally test that

938
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:35,360
theory out cuz yeah why not use the

939
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:37,970
candidates initials in there i mean that

940
00:47:37,970 --> 00:47:41,270
that's super sorry yeah yeah yeah yeah

941
00:47:41,270 --> 00:47:45,560
yeah yeah yeah I mean now that that

942
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:46,910
would be a really cool that that's all

943
00:47:46,910 --> 00:47:48,140
that's that's another awesome aye aye

944
00:47:48,140 --> 00:47:52,790
aye d and it's super simple to try thank

945
00:47:52,790 --> 00:47:54,800
you someone else raised their hand I

946
00:47:54,800 --> 00:48:05,260
didn't see them yes sir no I did not

947
00:48:05,260 --> 00:48:09,830

948
00:48:09,830 --> 00:48:11,690
videotaped I'm not going to answer you

00:48:25,550 --> 00:48:29,840
um there were a lot more for female

955
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:32,990
candidates unfortunately um like a lot

956
00:48:32,990 --> 00:48:37,820
more um yeah but most of the

957
00:48:37,820 --> 00:48:39,340
pornographic sites were just like random

958
00:48:39,340 --> 00:48:42,050
just porn sites I'm like ah you know and

959

like so that means i can't do anything

960
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:46,550
like on the metro right because someone

961

Canadian I don't know why um you know

991
00:50:40,310 --> 00:50:42,630
yeah does that answer your question I

992
00:50:42,630 --> 00:50:44,010
mean sometimes they were they were in

993
00:50:44,010 --> 00:50:47,040
there sometimes they go they weren't I

994
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:50,370
mean I assume as long as they're as long

995
00:50:50,370 --> 00:50:52,380
as they don't have robots dot dot text

996

in there they will be indexed by Google

997
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:56,010
but then you know their whole algorithm

998
00:50:56,010 --> 00:50:58,400
is going to make sites that people go to

999
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:02,150
more often appear towards the front so

1000
