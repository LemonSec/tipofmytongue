1
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:03,040
all right i think we're going to get

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:06,319
started a couple minutes earlier uh so

3
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:08,800
got too many slides and uh actually

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,440
trying to fit in live demo if everything

5
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:12,799
works

6
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:15,759
as well uh well hopefully everybody had

7
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:17,119
a good lunch

8
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:19,039
um and uh

9
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:21,840
i would not uh think of uh

10
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,000
anything else to do on sunday afternoon

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
uh besides being here so thank you very

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,920
much

13
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,119
my name is alex holden i

14
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:33,920
i work for a company called security

15
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,200
we

16
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,840
do lots of fun different things

17
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:38,640
but

18
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,040
what we are probably most known we are

19
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,040
tracking the biggest breaches in the

20
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,640
world

21
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,640
if you heard of adobe bridge target

22
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,680
bridge or jpmorgan chase bridge these

23
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,719
are all findings of my company

24
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:56,000
and we know a lot about hackers

25
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,120
at the same time we have uh normal daily

26
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,039
stuff we do auditing we do a whole bunch

27
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:02,960
of other things the coolest thing that

28
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,240
uh we found this year in vulnerability

29
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,479
testing for one of our clients is a way

30
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:11,760
to exfortrate uh the data uh via

31
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,159
vulnerability in that uh software that

32
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,520
delivers faxes so we were able to do

33
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,600
remove file inclusion

34
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,680
um on um

35
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,920
the way that

36
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,680
the fax is being delivered and we can

37
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,439
ask for uh the server to access any file

38
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:30,960
from a server

39
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,360
it's really fun it's it works it gave us

40
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,400
lots of configuration files my fax bill

41
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,680
was

42
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,600
very very high

43
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,799
but i thought that was very very cool

44
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:46,000
um it's taking the old technology and

45
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,960
using the newest methods you can steal

46
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,640
data however uh hackers they

47
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,479
don't go for that they go for the

48
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:58,640
easiest way to steal the information

49
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,520
i started my career uh about 20 years

50
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:05,360
ago on help desk and uh with help desk i

51
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,720
had a lot of fun stories in the mid 90s

52
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,120
where computers were not as prevalent i

53
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,239
had

54
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:13,599
one person

55
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:16,959
call in and read me an error message

56
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:18,879
i was on autopilot i said

57
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:21,520
go ahead and close the window and will

58
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,120
get started

59
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,920
the person actually got up closed

60
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,840
the window he was very confused why i

61
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,840
asked him to do it but

62
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,160
definitely

63
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,000
not very familiar technology we had

64
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,879
another person who called in uh he did

65
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:39,200
not have computer at all he just wanted

66
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,760
to have an experience he want to learn

67
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,800
and

68
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,040
you know computer or absence of one

69
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,920
didn't stop him from spending an hour on

70
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,040
the phone

71
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,440
with a help desk

72
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,959
well

73
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:54,959
just last week we have

74
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:57,200
been tracking a hacker who does not have

75
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,959
a computer

76
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:00,959
he doesn't even have a phone

77
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:02,400
he

78
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,319
wanders from france house to friend's

79
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:08,400
house and logs in just uh on uh uh

80
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,760
really uh tablet that he uses only for

81
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,280
chats and he trades on data

82
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,400
and

83
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,480
he's buying information in one place and

84
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,159
they're reselling it immediately before

85
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,560
even the transaction completes the way

86
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,440
he talks and he the way he thinks is

87
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,080
definitely malicious he's trading tons

88
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,560
of information he is selling at

89
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,680
um a huge database of stolen uh credit

90
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,280
cards for only two thousand dollars and

91
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,319
he's reselling it for about uh

92
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:41,840
20 000

93
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,640
without ever having a computer hackers

94
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,480
are evolving they're different and

95
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,560
they're completely not what we think

96
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,440
about this is kind of my idea who the

97
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,879
hacker can be who um you know how they

98
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:56,640
think and you know

99
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,239
their masterminds but in many cases um

100
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,319
they're not brains they're not even

101
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:03,519
pinkies in

102
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:06,080
uh their set of mind

103
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,080
let's take a look and see who they are

104
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,480
and um who can can they be

105
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,480
they can be very scary they can be

106
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,599
working for an enemy state uh they can

107
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:18,000
be corporate sponsored having infinite

108
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,279
resources and really seeing uh their

109
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:23,520
what they do as a job the way to get

110
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,720
paid to feed their families and not

111
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,600
having

112
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,000
any afterthoughts about victims we got

113
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,360
hacktivists

114
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,320
the people

115
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,759
who hacked

116
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:35,919
ashley madison they didn't ask for money

117
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:37,680
they asked for recognition

118
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,000
isis

119
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,800
syrian electronic army and others they

120
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,199
make political statements or are they

121
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:47,600
driven by social agendas but for the

122
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,880
most part the hackers are profit seekers

123
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,840
it's a very easy way to get

124
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:54,880
rich

125
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,919
not doing much but using other people's

126
00:04:57,919 --> 00:04:59,040
gains

127
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,800
they're not particularly stupid in doing

128
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,680
that but

129
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,840
they're only hell bent on

130
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,880
making money there's a good amount of

131
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,800
people who do malicious things on

132
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,479
computers for revenge

133
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:12,960
and then we also have that weakest link

134
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,759
the employees your friends your family

135
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:17,759
uh you know the hackers call them

136
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:19,199
meatware

137
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:20,080
but

138
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:23,360
these people knowingly or not may cause

139
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,680
a lot of damage

140
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,400
so besides showing you pictures of uh

141
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,440
masterminds when i think about hackers

142
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,160
nowadays i sometimes think about

143
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,280
a young man like this sitting apparently

144
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,199
without pants

145
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:42,479
in a lobby of a hotel room hacking an

146
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:44,800
atm machine

147
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,080
from

148
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:50,400
the main perspective hackers

149
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,880
different from us they

150
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,240
look at

151
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,759
things that you don't usually look at

152
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:59,919
when they go to a website

153
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:00,960
they

154
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,880
don't read the privacy statement of

155
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,639
terms of service

156
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:08,160
they don't understand if you have a pci

157
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,520
compliance statement on your website

158
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:15,919
or if your site has been tested by

159
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:18,880
symantec and certified to be secure

160
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,720
for the most part they don't even speak

161
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,680
english so they won't understand this

162
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,680
even if they care to read it they're

163
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,520
semi-educated they're smart enough to do

164
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,880
certain things but they're not smart

165
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,080
enough to create a huge

166
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,840
web of uh

167
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,720
crimes for the most part because uh what

168
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,800
happens right now is that you don't have

169
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,800
a single person who is really good at

170
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,960
doing 20 30 different things compared to

171
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:47,039
militarization ability to get into

172
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:50,160
various systems and being able to do

173
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,560
something really really good

174
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,400
comes up with specialization of hackers

175
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,360
and

176
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,639
each one of them

177
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,400
wants to do something really good in a

178
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,840
small domain

179
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,840
some of them can steal credit cards

180
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,479
it says

181
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:10,800
does it speak english it says in russian

182
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:14,560
that's exactly the point

183
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,840
um but

184
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,720
exactly

185
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:24,160
um

186
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,599
the hackers are semi-educated they're

187
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:27,440
smart enough to do the crimes but that

188
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,000
they're not uh smart enough to come up

189
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,319
with a big uh idea they're lazy they

190
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:37,199
don't try to do something uh new if they

191
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:39,840
can use an old method to steal

192
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,960
information they're also all about money

193
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,720
they're driven for the most part by

194
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,520
something and money usually one of their

195
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,000
uh major drivers

196
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,560
addictions drugs alcohol gambling you

197
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,960
name it

198
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,120
the modern hackers

199
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,000
also failed quite a bit

200
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,120
about a year ago we monitored a hacker

201
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,599
who broke into us a

202
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:07,919
retail chain

203
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:12,000
pos server he was able to dump 1.5

204
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,720
gigabytes of financial data some of them

205
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,639
were unencrypted credit card numbers for

206
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:17,840
some reason

207
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,479
he was uh asking

208
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:21,280
the

209
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,879
informer he was communicating he was

210
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:25,199
asking questions very simple questions

211
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,680
what does this sequel server how do i

212
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,680
get the data out of it

213
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,919
what do i do with the credit card at the

214
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:32,799
end

215
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:35,440
at the very end of his journey he was

216
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,240
able to create a dump file 1.5 gigabytes

217
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,880
in size of that sql server millions of

218
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,640
financial records

219
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,040
last statement on this uh on uh that

220
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,880
forum that he made is he said you know

221
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:47,680
what

222
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,920
my flash drive only has half a gigabyte

223
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,480
free space i'm not going to download it

224
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,680
he closed his connection he left

225
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,959
so

226
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:58,800
looking at the crime like that

227
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,920
it's uh really comical what's not funny

228
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,800
is the plight of that company

229
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,440
if a system administrator finds a data

230
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,760
dump of entire database

231
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,720
they see definitely the tracks left by

232
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,720
an amateur

233
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,120
they have to declare disaster

234
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,519
and often at the

235
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:21,440
because they don't have a way to prove

236
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,040
that the data was never transferred from

237
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,279
a server they definitely don't know the

238
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:27,920
size of the guy's flash drive

239
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:28,959
but

240
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:32,160
when they get to that investigation they

241
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,560
have to declare a total loss they have

242
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,720
to notify the victims they have to go

243
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,200
through remediation and that's all for

244
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,600
not because we know for sure this guy

245
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,000
stopped that in its tracks

246
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,399
so what hackers do and uh

247
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:48,880
where they fail sometimes it causes

248
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,640
immeasurable amount of pain for the

249
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,959
companies the hackers also running away

250
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:55,200
from the law even though they may be

251
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,839
outside of a jurisdiction of

252
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:01,440
the countries that they

253
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,839
violate versus the old

254
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:05,920
they still on the run from the local law

255
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,079
because sometimes they infringe on the

256
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:10,560
laws of local countries

257
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,959
and they're extremely scared they run

258
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:15,120
from competition successful hackers

259
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,120
unknown in the community and they try to

260
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,040
keep their dentists hidden because

261
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,519
they've been number of uh incidents

262
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:22,399
where

263
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:24,240
uh the virtual crime

264
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,360
uh and competitors led to physical

265
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,000
violence between the hackers themselves

266
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,600
and then also they're afraid of street

267
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,560
gangs in some countries like in eastern

268
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,120
europe it's really a good thing to steal

269
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,959
from a thief because they consider it to

270
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:41,519
be not a crime street gangs know that

271
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:43,839
hackers can steal much more money

272
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:46,399
virtually than they can do physically

273
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,480
and they just find these people they

274
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,279
blackmail them they beat them up quite

275
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:53,920
severely to get them to work

276
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,959
usually give making them give

277
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:58,640
the three games hundred percent of the

278
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,600
ill gains so these hackers on the mo for

279
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,519
the most part are scared and they're

280
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:06,959
scared for good reason

281
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:09,600
here's an example for of this young man

282
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,399
who's uh solely responsible for writing

283
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:16,000
malware that uh caused so much pain with

284
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,399
a target

285
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,959
this young man got into hacking for one

286
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:24,640
reason he got in to meet women

287
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,640
so what lots of people do

288
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,760
get into hacking for various things uh

289
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,240
he is more or less unique what he

290
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,200
figured out being an awkward

291
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,000
teenager was a funky hairdo

292
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,440
he

293
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,440
found out that

294
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,640
approaching girls in public is difficult

295
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,560
and the girls online don't like didn't

296
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,880
like him either so he decided to use his

297
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,440
i.t skills to help

298
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,360
the girls break into accounts of their

299
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,040
significant others

300
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:58,800
he used his significant skills to break

301
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,079
into

302
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:02,720
russian involvement of facebook into

303
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,880
email systems

304
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,040
providing the ladies with

305
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,680
dirt on their significant others he got

306
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,959
lots of attention from the opposite sex

307
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:14,720
unfortunately as soon as the girls got

308
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,880
what they wanted they turned a cold

309
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:17,839
shoulder

310
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:19,920
by the time he figured out that that was

311
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,839
a losing proposition for him

312
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:23,920
he was already well connected to the

313
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:27,680
hacker community he was recruited

314
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,880
almost full time to work on this target

315
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,320
project

316
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,279
writing more he was more interested in

317
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:37,279
writing exceptions and making sure that

318
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:39,120
his software works across all the

319
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,480
terminals that it does not crash the

320
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,720
exits gracefully even if there is a

321
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,200
problem then actually about stealing the

322
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,399
money

323
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:51,600
he uh tried to find a job a normal job

324
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,519
based on his uh posting on freelance at

325
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:56,560
that through his salary requirement was

326
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,560
only 12 bucks an hour

327
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,880
he didn't find a job but he caused quite

328
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,959
a bit of grief

329
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:04,639
we're dealing with

330
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:08,720
not only um enemies who try to get rich

331
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:12,800
they also see us as cultural enemies

332
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:16,399
and they see it um completely opposite

333
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:18,000
this person is an

334
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,040
fbi's most wanted a cyber criminal list

335
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,760
in the private conversation back in 2010

336
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,240
he actually admits that he sees

337
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,000
americans and

338
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,800
western europeans as cultural enemies he

339
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,920
absolutely hates us because he thinks

340
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:36,000
that we all drive rolls royces and live

341
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,160
a million dollar houses

342
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:41,120
but at the same time he would not uh go

343
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,680
against polish uh bank because he

344
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:47,120
considers the his brothers the slavs uh

345
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:50,480
to be righteous in that fight so this

346
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:54,399
ideological war led him being uh

347
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:56,560
to being a part of a gang that stole

348
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:01,519
over 220 million dollars from the west

349
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:04,480
but i'm here to give you uh this kind of

350
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,560
rundown of hackers uh fall fashions for

351
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:10,560
2015. what's cool what's not

352
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,079
why is it interesting why is it

353
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:13,040
difficult

354
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,360
i did put this uh presentation uh

355
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,079
together in the last couple days uh just

356
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:20,880
uh for the most uh important reason to

357
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,440
show you things that are relevant you

358
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,160
will see the dates on some of those uh

359
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,480
these uh screenshots that you'll see

360
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,360
next

361
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,839
as a couple hours ago a couple of days

362
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:36,480
ago this is all real this is all

363
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,440
very scary some of the data was altered

364
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,240
to protect the innocent so

365
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,440
as you take

366
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,040
pictures if you do

367
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,240
be very

368
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,480
cognizant that some information may

369
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,040
belong to the victims uh but i'm going

370
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,880
to talk about a couple different

371
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,839
directions of the hackers what they do

372
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:59,680
what pace and how they get around it

373
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,000
carding is not as a

374
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,360
big deal

375
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,519
right now

376
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:07,839
after the target breach after uh home

377
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:10,320
depot breach we have a number of

378
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,480
different individuals

379
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,560
who

380
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,120
stole a lot of credit cards and banks

381
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,760
got smarter the credit cards are much

382
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,839
better protected the bank accounts are

383
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:23,680
much better protected there is a big

384
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,680
scrutiny if 10 years ago you can steal

385
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,320
10 credit cards you can max out most of

386
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,279
them within minutes to the limit

387
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:34,639
and you can possibly get cash out of it

388
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:36,800
nowadays you cannot get

389
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,920
much these credit cards uh i believe the

390
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,959
this number is about 60 600 000 credit

391
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:45,279
cards that being offered for sale

392
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:47,040
um only go

393
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,519
between one and five dollars not that

394
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:52,160
much because the market is over

395
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,959
over saturated with stolen credit cards

396
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:56,880
and these stone credit cards being

397
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:00,240
flagged by banks almost immediately

398
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,720
hackers know that if they try to steal

399
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,519
uh

400
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:06,240
a thousand credit cards

401
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,240
and and let's say each credit card has a

402
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,079
limit of thousand dollars it's not that

403
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:12,480
they stole a million dollars if they're

404
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,440
lucky they will be able to cash them out

405
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,959
at the tune of a thousand or two

406
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:18,320
thousand dollars

407
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,360
and paying a one dollar per card is not

408
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,600
really a good business proposition for

409
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,560
them

410
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,360
and

411
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,360
we are winning on that war

412
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,839
uh we are winning in this mass abuse of

413
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:31,360
credit cards because credit cards

414
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,120
stepped up to the plate

415
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,399
but

416
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:37,279
individual scams people buying one or

417
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:38,959
two credit cards they still can go on

418
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:41,680
the radar because they can understand

419
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,920
whose credit card they stole they can

420
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,240
mimic the behavior and they can most

421
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,240
likely steal all the money from that

422
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,959
credit card not directly they can't

423
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:54,240
get cash out but can they buy goods and

424
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,199
services around it some of the banks

425
00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:00,320
still allow changes of the address so

426
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,519
the hackers go in and

427
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:06,319
try to compromise those accounts they

428
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:08,319
try to steal enough information to

429
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,319
change address change the phone number

430
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:11,599
and then when there is confirmation

431
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:13,520
coming from credit card or bank it

432
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,439
actually goes to the source

433
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:19,359
carding is not out completely it still

434
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:21,520
um causes a lot of headache but mass

435
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,919
exportation of credit cards is rapidly

436
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:25,839
on decline

437
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:28,720
something else that's been on and off

438
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,520
for a while is identity theft identity

439
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,600
theft is always

440
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,880
been a big deal because individuals feel

441
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,559
completely violated when their

442
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:41,440
information is stolen at the same time

443
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,679
the hackers actually ask for information

444
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:46,880
they try to steal information as much as

445
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:50,400
possible about the people so from

446
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,720
my perspective evolution of identity

447
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,480
theft is being

448
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,480
automated to a degree that you wouldn't

449
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,120
believe they finally developing apis for

450
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,480
identity theft

451
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,160
they have services that allows hackers

452
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,679
other hackers to do

453
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,720
normal queries into the database along

454
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,280
with the payment information along with

455
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,160
specific information and they can get

456
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,320
information like social security numbers

457
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,640
date of birth sometimes

458
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,799
credit reports we

459
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:25,360
standard

460
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,480
query via api it can be automated that

461
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,160
density theft

462
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,720
is getting much easier

463
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,320
there is another

464
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,880
concept in the credit card theft you can

465
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,360
do it virtually you can do it physically

466
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,760
you can steal credit card information

467
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,559
installing schemers on

468
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:45,280
the

469
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,679
bank machines atms

470
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:49,120
payment terminals

471
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,240
and

472
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,960
the hackers go around and they try to

473
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,240
get

474
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,039
the actual scheming devices installed

475
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:59,760
where do they go well they go to a shop

476
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,240
they go online and

477
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,559
fill up their shopping cart with

478
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:06,080
skimming devices

479
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,360
and

480
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,440
shipping is free

481
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:14,080
they deliver via fedex ups usps and dhl

482
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,760
right to your house

483
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,919
um they don't accept credit cards as

484
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:19,120
payment

485
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,439
um

486
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:24,640
but at this at the same time they

487
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,640
actually accept uh western union

488
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,039
bitcoins web money perfect money and

489
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:31,440
whole bunch of other uh things it's

490
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,799
really uh scheming made easy

491
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:37,200
in my practice um you know personally

492
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,160
when i go uh to any terminals uh you

493
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,720
know when i insert my card i kind of try

494
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,559
to wiggle that uh terminal see if it

495
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:45,679
comes off

496
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:46,960
you know i'm always

497
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,120
kind of self-conscious about that but

498
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,640
then um

499
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,520
about a month ago i saw this video uh

500
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,320
this is actually a scheming machine and

501
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,280
uh

502
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:00,080
uh it really scared me so um let me see

503
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,039
if

504
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:03,440
she plays the video

505
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,120
so this is a

506
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,840
insert that hackers put inside of those

507
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,039
terminals

508
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:12,400
that actually sits inside of the

509
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,640
atm terminal or

510
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,880
a payment terminal and as you can see

511
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,799
it's actually allowing us to insert the

512
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:21,760
card and it schemes on the inside of the

513
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:24,960
atm it steals uh

514
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,320
all the information

515
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:29,039
it shows how easy the card will go and

516
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:31,679
going out without any type of

517
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:32,960
interaction

518
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,200
it would steal the credit card

519
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,320
information

520
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:39,039
and at the end you would see

521
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:40,240
that

522
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,640
hackers can really seamlessly move

523
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,720
around

524
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:45,600
and

525
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,400
insert these type of devices and remove

526
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,320
them uh toward the end so when i saw

527
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,159
this video i realized that i'm

528
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:54,880
you know it's uh

529
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,120
there is no easy way to protect yourself

530
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,360
against the skimmers because they're so

531
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,840
good and they're so advanced this is how

532
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,080
easy it is to take it out and it's so

533
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:07,840
small it's uh really invisible so um the

534
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,640
scheming is on the rise and it's been

535
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,480
made very easy

536
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,080
um

537
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,840
one of the ways to deal with stone

538
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:19,200
crackers is really to uh buy something

539
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,480
get it shipped to you and uh enjoy the

540
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,480
goods so you know really it's up that

541
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,919
you want to buy the credit cards uh from

542
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:29,440
these uh

543
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,440
type of operations you know you can go

544
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,039
on amazon and

545
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:35,440
use american credit card and

546
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,000
get delivery to a middle of november

547
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,200
moldova

548
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,960
just you can't

549
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,159
but

550
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:44,080
the hacker is getting smarter they

551
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,080
employ people

552
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,960
uh in united states uh to receive the

553
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:52,159
goods from amazon from other stores and

554
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:54,480
they actually allow this delivery to

555
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,760
these people

556
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:58,240
um these people

557
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:02,000
get labels printed from usps by fedex by

558
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,600
ups and uh they reattach a label on

559
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,159
the uh the box and since then they send

560
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:09,600
them abroad

561
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,559
hackers have fun with this this is a

562
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:15,120
screenshot of a forum

563
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:18,320
it's a guadiary gladiators arena they

564
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,720
actually consider themselves

565
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:24,080
a royalty they consider themselves

566
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:27,039
people who being entertained by

567
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:29,760
these gladiators uh people who reship

568
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,679
stuff and they compete with each other

569
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:33,440
who can ship

570
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,440
more using these gladiators which

571
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,000
gladiator will survive longer

572
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,120
and keep

573
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:42,400
these operations um going from one

574
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,400
perspective it's sad that they actually

575
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,640
using human beings and they preying on

576
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,200
the interest at the same time they

577
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,080
actually turn this into a game

578
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,400
and if uh gladiator is not fun enough

579
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,559
they also have shops like this this is a

580
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:58,640
russian shop not gonna translate

581
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,159
everything but they actually consider

582
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:01,039
their

583
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:04,559
uh drops the reshippers uh they put i

584
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:07,760
know homer simpson on their profile so

585
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:10,320
you know from gladiators to uh homer

586
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:13,520
simpson uh they have fun they actually

587
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:16,720
steal information and they um they use

588
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:19,600
uh people's gullibility and uh if

589
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,000
anything these individuals who reship

590
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,280
the infamy

591
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,320
the goods

592
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,520
are the ones maybe found liable for

593
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:30,080
being complacent in the crime

594
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,919
the crime is also going in mass

595
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:34,320
production we look we are living in age

596
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:37,280
of max exploitation

597
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,320
hackers

598
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,000
break into

599
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,640
the web development applications like

600
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:45,760
wordpress and joomla in bulk

601
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:50,000
we recently seen a list of 6.5 million

602
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,480
wordpress sites that being targeted and

603
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:55,360
successfully exploited at least 33

604
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,200
usernames for some kind of vulnerability

605
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,919
but also likely to steal passwords this

606
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:03,120
size of mass exploitation is easy

607
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,919
so these uh signs being converted into

608
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:08,240
pansies uh on the right uh

609
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,880
you can see a list of uh shells the

610
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:14,159
backend connections uh that these guys

611
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:16,720
uh selling or even distributing for free

612
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:19,120
on sites like facebook

613
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:22,559
the hackers are auditing the internet

614
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:25,600
they are trying to steal

615
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,400
weak passwords across

616
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:32,000
every single ip out there they put in uh

617
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,960
automated rdp or ssh testers and they

618
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:38,559
find thousands of um vulnerable machines

619
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:40,080
sometimes they find passwords that i

620
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,320
don't didn't think were possible but

621
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,760
their

622
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,120
brute forcing

623
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,440
systems are very good

624
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,880
hackers actually

625
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:51,600
enjoy reward programs they found out a

626
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,039
while ago that

627
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:55,279
hackers can

628
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:57,679
move my

629
00:24:57,679 --> 00:24:58,840
frequent flyer

630
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:02,159
miles or car rental points

631
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:05,039
and they can sell it to legitimate users

632
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:09,440
so if i want to take a flight uh to

633
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,760
let's say australia and the ticket costs

634
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,240
one thousand dollars each way it may be

635
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,840
very expensive hackers can steal

636
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,520
somebody else's points and they don't

637
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,360
take much they may take a thousand

638
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,440
points from each account so people won't

639
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,679
even notice anything missing but then

640
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:26,240
they can buy this ticket using points

641
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,679
and sell it to me for five hundred

642
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:28,799
dollars

643
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:30,799
for an entire ticket yes they're taking

644
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:32,240
a huge loss

645
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,320
um but it's not their money they're

646
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,679
gambling with

647
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:37,760
then you know if uh the reward program

648
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:41,200
actually noticed that uh

649
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,440
something was uh done fraudulently

650
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,039
they're gonna take away the ticket of a

651
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:46,799
person who wants to buy who bought that

652
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:48,640
ticket so they may show up at the

653
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,279
airport but they won't have a flight um

654
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:53,520
or sit on a plane at the same time the

655
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:57,600
hacker already has information of that

656
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,240
poor sub who gave them their credit card

657
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,240
number that was legitimately billed for

658
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,400
500 but now they can use that credit

659
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,640
card or sell it in black market

660
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,320
the reward program is getting in

661
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:12,240
ridiculous space apparently uh subway

662
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,799
restaurants in uk has a program

663
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:17,520
as you spend more dollars on at subway

664
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,720
you can

665
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:19,520
get

666
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,840
with i think three thousand all so

667
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,880
points a free sub six inch sub for free

668
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:27,039
hackers sell those coupons on the

669
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:29,840
internet yes hackers like my mom do clip

670
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:32,400
coupons but at the same time they sell

671
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:35,200
free sub cubans with

672
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,840
10 to 50 cents a piece on the black

673
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,760
market and somebody's buying them

674
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,520
because they're saying that they sold

675
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,279
over 10 000

676
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:45,520
coupons like that

677
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,840
the amount the size of uh crime or

678
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,320
criminal activity is varied and

679
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:53,039
it always surprises me hackers break

680
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:55,679
into paypal or ebay accounts they

681
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:57,840
establish uh something fraudulently and

682
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:00,240
they have manuals uh to go through this

683
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:03,200
they're very simple to use uh

684
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,480
manuals translating the application uh

685
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:10,240
word for word uh to paypal on ebay

686
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,240
because uh apparently these sites now

687
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:15,440
detect uh switching languages so they

688
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,360
would walk out your account faster if

689
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:21,360
you use something other than english

690
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,080
so

691
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,799
they're getting smarter they go around

692
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:28,240
systems and then also this brute forcing

693
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,080
hackers buy

694
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,159
thousands or millions of user id and

695
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:35,039
passwords and they try against various

696
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:37,360
sites where they think they can profit

697
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,840
they do more and more with

698
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,440
same type of resources because

699
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,760
technology is very easy

700
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:46,000
i want to spend like

701
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,799
30 seconds talking about the ugly

702
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:49,679
uh

703
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:52,240
crimes of drug trafficking

704
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,159
you have a website

705
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:56,320
actually operated in russia

706
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,520
and

707
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:00,720
it's offering based on your locale

708
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,799
ability to buy drugs that have been

709
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:06,000
stored by uh this dealers

710
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,240
inside of um

711
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,159
just normal everyday location so what

712
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:13,039
you go do is go on this website you pick

713
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:15,520
your physical location your neighborhood

714
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,919
and then you pay

715
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:20,559
the fee which is uh rather reasonable

716
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:22,399
and all you get is a picture like the

717
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:23,840
one on the right

718
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:26,559
it basically gives you a geographical

719
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:29,039
address a picture where the drugs are

720
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:31,279
hidden and they offer money back if for

721
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:34,799
some reason this is not it's not there

722
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:37,200
the ratings are pretty much uh along the

723
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,840
signs of anxious list

724
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:43,200
the drug dealers being

725
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,720
really um rated based on how good they

726
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:49,600
are how honest they are and how much

727
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:52,640
information how often the people find

728
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:55,840
their loads and uh how good the drugs

729
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:58,320
are so this is very simple and it's um

730
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,640
you know this is example in russia where

731
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,880
they try to sell sex and drugs at the

732
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,320
same time

733
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:07,039
but these sites exist all over the world

734
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:08,960
and the dealers never exposing

735
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,679
themselves to the buyers just putting

736
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:14,799
these things on the deep web and selling

737
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:16,799
it in the store

738
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:19,039
uh there are even instructions on how to

739
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:22,080
buy uh and where to pay for these things

740
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:25,039
um in russia they have kiwi which is uh

741
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:26,640
their local

742
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,520
electronic payment system so you can

743
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,279
actually go pay your bills and buy your

744
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:34,320
drugs in the same place

745
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,360
i want to spend

746
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,840
some time talking about botnets

747
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:43,840
botnets are things that really

748
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:47,520
steal more information today than any

749
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:50,880
anywhere else viruses that been built by

750
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,559
hackers

751
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:53,440
still

752
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,279
find the home and

753
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:57,600
many people get infected with

754
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:58,960
on their computers

755
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:01,440
uh these botnets or viruses are

756
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,600
responsible for the biggest breaches of

757
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,720
our time

758
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:07,279
including target

759
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:09,200
but hackers are getting smarter they're

760
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,360
building better wires as they build

761
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,279
building better botnets this is a

762
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:15,039
screenshot probably very difficult to

763
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:16,480
see but uh

764
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:19,679
uh this this is basically a service

765
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:22,080
to uh encrypt

766
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,480
your virus so it's not being recognized

767
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,279
by

768
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:28,080
antivirus program and

769
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,520
place it in

770
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:32,080
different locations so the

771
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,720
victim machines can download it faster

772
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:37,600
from their geographical locale

773
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:40,240
you pay based on that type of encryption

774
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:43,760
and a number of downloads so

775
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:46,399
this is basically encrypting service

776
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:48,480
what hackers are doing right now

777
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:51,120
with viruses is that they don't really

778
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,720
care about the antivirus programs

779
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,320
because antivirus programs if they only

780
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,799
matching on the signature

781
00:30:56,799 --> 00:31:00,880
the hackers are faster than antiviruses

782
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,880
they take their militia software and

783
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:06,159
they check against 20 30 40 different

784
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:08,960
antivirus software every single minute

785
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,880
they check if the signature is

786
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,559
detectable

787
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:14,480
if it is detectable because it will be

788
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,919
eventually

789
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:18,080
they don't have to upload anything else

790
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:19,840
because they have another version of the

791
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,840
virus with a different signature already

792
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,360
sitting on that

793
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,279
victim's computer and all they have to

794
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:28,720
do is to send a signal switch

795
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,000
and

796
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,440
when that happens

797
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:35,279
it's very easy there are also sleepers

798
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:37,840
you have backup and you have backup to

799
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:41,120
backup that knows that if it's

800
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,919
does not get communications from its

801
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:45,360
main

802
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:47,440
operators it will switch

803
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,799
itself

804
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:51,519
on every 24 hours and just double check

805
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:52,399
if

806
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:55,200
the wires have been removed so

807
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,120
they don't really the hackers no longer

808
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,279
disable antiviruses in some cases

809
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:01,600
one hacker said that they're so much

810
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,760
faster than antivirus

811
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,600
why turn off good piece of software that

812
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:08,159
will prevent that allows

813
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:10,480
them to filter for the competition

814
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,840
so the information they steal is unique

815
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:15,679
on people's computers

816
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:19,039
mobile botnets um this is a

817
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:21,120
screenshot of uh

818
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:24,399
infection uh rates uh from

819
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:27,279
well everything up to to date uh today

820
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:30,559
um i think uh several loads that being

821
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:33,200
um hidden as apks

822
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,360
uh for android platform being

823
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:36,880
distributed through

824
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:40,000
uh some kind of mower campaign in amount

825
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,440
of infections

826
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,120
is just staggering

827
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,320
they have

828
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,640
basically easy grasps for the hackers

829
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,960
themselves to monitor that progress

830
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,200
their gains they steal anything else

831
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,600
that you can imagine from

832
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,600
a phone not only

833
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,559
your

834
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:58,720
payment information but sometimes your

835
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:01,360
text messages sometimes it's application

836
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:04,000
data sometimes it's your friends list

837
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,760
they control

838
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:08,320
horizontal and vertical

839
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:11,039
they can turn on your front camera back

840
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:14,240
camera uh make volume louder so they can

841
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,000
hear your conversation and it's all

842
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,240
automated you can do it on a

843
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:21,840
much bigger scale

844
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:22,720
so

845
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,960
let me try some to do something i have

846
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:27,200
done this couple times before with

847
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,120
various degrees of success i'm going to

848
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:31,360
show you a live botnet

849
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,559
so i'm going to

850
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:36,720
try to switch over here

851
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:40,320
obviously

852
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:48,200
oh here we go

853
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:58,080
so we're looking through life.net here

854
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:00,159
it's location

855
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:04,240
and other information is being hidden to

856
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:06,640
avoid any kind of recognition

857
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:10,159
um it's a botnet that was able to steal

858
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:13,599
21 million records from about 3 000

859
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:15,040
computers

860
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:17,520
it gives very friendly very nice

861
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:20,320
statistics for the end users it shows

862
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,639
you how many new

863
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:24,399
computers been infected

864
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:26,239
their locale

865
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:28,000
most of this coming from russia and

866
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,520
ukraine

867
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,760
it gives you very easy

868
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:34,159
statistics allowing you to break it down

869
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:36,719
even by a

870
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:40,560
different botnet that's being operated

871
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:43,199
you can look at infection rates by

872
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:46,000
operating system

873
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,599
looking at windows 7 and xp still

874
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:52,399
bigger victims but windows 8 i don't see

875
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:53,679
windows 10

876
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:55,839
here but i also see a couple servers

877
00:34:55,839 --> 00:34:59,279
being affected as well

878
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:03,280
you can look at what kind of uh bots are

879
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,800
out there

880
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,720
what computers being affected

881
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:09,520
you can search you can re do

882
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,680
a fair amount of research so for example

883
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:15,879
if i'm going to look for servers

884
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,680
i'm going to see a number of computers

885
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,680
that have a server in their name i can

886
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:22,240
look for pos

887
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,560
register or something like that and now

888
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:27,920
i have something to research

889
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:33,119
i can uh use scripts that's where i was

890
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:36,480
talking about updates and uh special uh

891
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:41,119
combinations of uh applications and uh

892
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:42,640
what you would be uploading what you're

893
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,480
gonna be exporting for if you will be

894
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,640
stealing information uh directly from

895
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,640
the computer or if you would be using it

896
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:51,200
uh for some kind of attacks you can set

897
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:55,280
up uh url uh triggers so and uh that

898
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:57,760
will be delivered to you instantly via a

899
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:00,079
jabber via

900
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:01,040
sucks

901
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:04,160
or you can even pop up in your uh remote

902
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,839
session so you set up

903
00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:08,240
basically wild cards this one mostly

904
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:11,280
around australia italy canada

905
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:14,880
uh and walmart um but uh as information

906
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,960
is being stolen is being delivered real

907
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:19,359
time to the hackers no matter where

908
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:21,680
these guys are

909
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:25,040
and then there is an easier quick way to

910
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,400
search information

911
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,720
you can search based on already

912
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:32,640
created reports cookies http https

913
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:36,480
if you can find ftp logins pop3 smtp

914
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:39,440
credentials vnc connections ready to use

915
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,680
and so on and

916
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:44,320
so on and so forth it's very simple it's

917
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,160
user friendly

918
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:48,000
it's been in development for a number of

919
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,119
years and it makes it easy

920
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:54,800
to show you that the data is real

921
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:58,079
i'm going to do a quick search here for

922
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:00,720
a little bit of time

923
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:03,040
this account is actually disabled

924
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,079
the one that

925
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:07,359
will come up but i can put

926
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:10,880
a search term for example like facebook

927
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,960
and when i do a search

928
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:15,200
it comes up almost immediately with

929
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:18,480
information that uh had been stolen

930
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:21,839
it shows you the date it shows you uh

931
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:24,880
information about uh

932
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:27,680
the exploited machine it shows what's

933
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,200
being accessed

934
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,680
you can look at the user input you can

935
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:33,599
look at what's being sent via the

936
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:34,720
browser

937
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,400
at the end you can get

938
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:39,040
all kinds of information including user

939
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:42,000
ids and passwords of people who actually

940
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,040
act

941
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,960
submit this information

942
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,720
it's user friendly

943
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:49,520
it's uh completely

944
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:52,000
removed from

945
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,240
the users but at the same time when you

946
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,920
look at this data you can see everything

947
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:58,320
that's been stolen from that machine you

948
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,920
can do more and more research you can

949
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:02,800
see where this machine had been

950
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,800
on our side on the good guy side where

951
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,400
we get this information we can actually

952
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,480
tell the company exactly oh individuals

953
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,640
what had been stolen from them bit by

954
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:13,200
bit and we can do one better we can

955
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,440
tell them that not only it was stolen

956
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,520
but we can also tell them that

957
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:20,320
if a hacker ever actually looked at this

958
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:23,200
type of data

959
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:30,839
see

960
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,320
yes

961
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,440
how can you verify that the hacker

962
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:42,720
didn't look at the data

963
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,240
there is a report you can generate was

964
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,920
this information ever

965
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:50,400
been seen in the report was it triggered

966
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:54,480
or was it uh ever downloaded so um every

967
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,599
single

968
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:57,040
bit of this information is sitting in

969
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,160
the database

970
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:01,760
and the database actually had has a flag

971
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,920
seen or not seen retrieved or not

972
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:06,000
retrieved it's done so the hackers can

973
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,920
actually share the data so they don't

974
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,839
attack the same account over and over

975
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:12,320
but at the same time it actually gives

976
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:14,640
us an idea that if somebody's actually

977
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,160
consciously

978
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:18,800
seen this data or was it just a stone so

979
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:21,760
it's very interesting way to quantify it

980
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:25,000
as well

981
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,480
so that was more or less good demo

982
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,320
uh i want to talk about defenses i want

983
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,240
to talk about uh what you know with all

984
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:35,599
these scariest things that hackers are

985
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:38,079
doing what can we do as security

986
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:40,800
professionals to prevent

987
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,640
these activities and we have technology

988
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:44,880
on our side we have lots of technology

989
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:47,520
that do different things and uh if used

990
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,839
correctly it's going to make these bad

991
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:54,160
guys job extremely difficult we have uh

992
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:56,960
like never before uh created so many

993
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:00,079
tools that almost uh certainly would

994
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:02,400
stop cybercrime we just don't throw them

995
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,000
out in the right places at the right

996
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,640
time we don't always

997
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:07,839
look at the information that they

998
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:10,480
collect and in some cases we are so

999
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,800
afraid to break our business processes

1000
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,960
that we don't apply them at all

1001
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:17,680
then the next line of defense we have

1002
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:19,200
people

1003
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:22,560
we have everybody now

1004
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:24,800
watching the news understanding what's

1005
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:27,440
going on and trying to see uh what they

1006
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:29,040
can do to

1007
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:32,160
not be in the news

1008
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:36,240
if cybercrime happens at the same time

1009
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:39,040
the awareness of cyber security is high

1010
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,720
um but

1011
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,800
the hackers are still succeeding

1012
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:45,200
i think the last line of defense is our

1013
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,280
compliance programs

1014
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,280
we got laws we got regulations we have

1015
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:52,160
rules and we are improving our ability

1016
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:54,079
to

1017
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:58,160
set rules for good computing

1018
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:00,960
practices like never before

1019
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:01,760
from

1020
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:04,880
the top 10 list of things that we should

1021
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:07,440
be watching looking out for because a

1022
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,680
number of different uh cyber crimes that

1023
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:11,760
i didn't mention because uh

1024
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:14,400
they're so prevalent but not as popular

1025
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:15,760
as others

1026
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:19,359
uh if we try to minimize viruses reuse

1027
00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:20,880
or

1028
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:23,200
theft of credentials if we patch our

1029
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,119
systems and

1030
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:28,240
create some kind of uh safe zones

1031
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:31,359
for uh service providers who have our

1032
00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:34,560
data to our customers who give us their

1033
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,800
data we would be significantly better

1034
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:39,520
off and this is quite a bit of

1035
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:41,440
undertaking a lot of companies that i

1036
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,680
talked to say that yes we have

1037
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:48,400
antivirus program that get catches 99 of

1038
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:51,520
the viruses and these customers have

1039
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:54,160
tens of thousands computers if you

1040
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:57,280
factor what 99 means it means that

1041
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:59,040
they have may have hundreds of computers

1042
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:01,359
who still don't have up-to-date

1043
00:42:01,359 --> 00:42:03,520
antiviruses they may still have these

1044
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:05,920
viruses that can operate with antivirus

1045
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:08,000
running without ever

1046
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,839
detecting it

1047
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:12,160
so we see a lot of things that you know

1048
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:14,960
when we focus on things we focus on

1049
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:17,680
different pain of the day but

1050
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:19,440
believe me when i tell you that these

1051
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:20,800
four things

1052
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:23,520
lead to more breaches than anything else

1053
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:25,359
i want you to start looking at the

1054
00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:27,839
quantitative analysis i understand that

1055
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:30,880
most people deal with uh log aggregators

1056
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,000
and

1057
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,280
a lot large amounts of quantitative data

1058
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:39,280
analysis but uh from my perspective

1059
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:41,680
if you look at adobe systems sony

1060
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:44,480
pictures uh ashley madison breach

1061
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:46,560
these companies supposedly lost all

1062
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:49,599
their data every single bit of data that

1063
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:51,599
the hackers found to be important they

1064
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:53,839
were able to access without any problems

1065
00:42:53,839 --> 00:42:55,040
not only that they were able to

1066
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:58,960
exfortrate it uh from there the company

1067
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:01,280
so you know if you equate it to kind of

1068
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:04,079
a security of a building

1069
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:06,079
you you can imagine that somebody can

1070
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:08,720
break into your garage without much

1071
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:11,839
problem without ever being

1072
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:12,560
it

1073
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:14,960
at the same time when you look at the

1074
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:16,800
uh if amount of information was stolen

1075
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:18,400
from these companies it sounds like you

1076
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:19,119
know

1077
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:21,440
while everybody was in the house

1078
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:23,359
the bad guys managed to steal grand

1079
00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:25,520
piano and take it out from the front

1080
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:28,079
door without anybody ever noticing and

1081
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:29,920
that's very alarming

1082
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:32,079
figure out statistics what's normal for

1083
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:34,640
you what's that investigate it because

1084
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:36,480
uh in many cases when you're dealing

1085
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:39,040
with very sophisticated enemies

1086
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:42,560
like in case of a anthem breach

1087
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:44,240
the information that was extradited

1088
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:47,280
maybe completely seamlessly

1089
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:50,079
because the hackers were very

1090
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:52,720
very sophisticated but at the same time

1091
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:55,280
they couldn't full network statistics

1092
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:57,760
there would be still spikes with large

1093
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:00,560
amounts of information

1094
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:04,160
showing up in some logs so

1095
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:05,760
become a friend

1096
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:08,319
of statistics understand it embrace it

1097
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:09,119
because

1098
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:11,520
even if you can stop the crime you can

1099
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:14,960
identify it fast enough and fix it the

1100
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:18,079
other good hint is

1101
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:20,400
start embracing the honey pots and honey

1102
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:22,720
pots maybe not the systems that

1103
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:25,760
just attract hackers build honeypots

1104
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:28,240
within your components of website if

1105
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:29,680
your website

1106
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:32,079
has a sql database behind it and you

1107
00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:34,000
audit it make sure that there's no sql

1108
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,119
injection

1109
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:37,119
you probably should put a sql injection

1110
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:38,880
a vulnerability there not a very simple

1111
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:41,359
one but rather complicated and you watch

1112
00:44:41,359 --> 00:44:43,200
if somebody finds it

1113
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:45,119
make sure that it doesn't expirate the

1114
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:47,760
data from your system but make sure that

1115
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:50,000
it's uh it will trigger something but

1116
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,560
that somebody is looking at your website

1117
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:54,400
trying to steal information and when

1118
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:55,920
they find something you can learn about

1119
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:57,920
their techniques and you can proactively

1120
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:00,079
defend your database against those ip

1121
00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:02,960
addresses against those techniques

1122
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:05,119
if you don't have anything and just

1123
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:06,640
think that your database is completely

1124
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:07,680
secure

1125
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:09,760
you may be in for a big surprise

1126
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:12,079
credential honeypots

1127
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:14,240
you guys may have large databases that

1128
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:16,400
have uh hundreds of thousands or

1129
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:19,040
millions of credentials put in a couple

1130
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:21,359
credentials that only you guys know

1131
00:45:21,359 --> 00:45:23,680
about make sure they're valid and they

1132
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:26,480
lead nowhere that way if somebody steals

1133
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:28,560
that data and ever uses those

1134
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,839
credentials you know your data been

1135
00:45:30,839 --> 00:45:33,839
stolen put these type of credentials

1136
00:45:33,839 --> 00:45:35,599
different type different credentials

1137
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:38,160
obviously the ones in the batches that

1138
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:41,040
you give to your vendors so when you see

1139
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:43,440
a specific account set up for honeypot

1140
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:46,079
being exploited with your vendor that

1141
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:48,400
you gave to your vendor you definitely

1142
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:50,800
know what's going on some of our clients

1143
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:53,359
create one email account a day

1144
00:45:53,359 --> 00:45:55,760
on their system so they know exactly

1145
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:57,520
when the data was stolen because in some

1146
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:59,760
cases you won't see it

1147
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:01,920
even basic features like cross-site

1148
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:04,480
scripting you can control and

1149
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:07,359
artificially insert on your systems

1150
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:09,119
and you can see if somebody's trying to

1151
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:11,680
exploit them we've seen

1152
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:13,440
one company building cross-site

1153
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:16,560
scripting honeypot where it worked very

1154
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:18,560
well for anybody who's trying to build a

1155
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:20,240
cross-site scripting attempt but it

1156
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:21,680
doesn't work for anybody else from

1157
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:23,839
different ipads hackers were

1158
00:46:23,839 --> 00:46:27,040
flabbergasted when they sent out their

1159
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:30,319
exploitation phishing email and uh it

1160
00:46:30,319 --> 00:46:32,480
only worked uh for on their test

1161
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:34,400
machines it didn't for any users because

1162
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:37,280
uh it couldn't work only it worked for

1163
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:38,960
the hackers

1164
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:40,720
very simple hands very simple to

1165
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:43,119
implement but at the same time it's

1166
00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:45,440
actually helps quite a bit

1167
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:48,640
also look at your culture this chart

1168
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:50,640
here showing maturity level of your

1169
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:53,119
security program was not designed in

1170
00:46:53,119 --> 00:46:56,800
last 10 years in fact it was designed

1171
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:59,760
back in 1977 i believe in carnegie

1172
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:01,839
mellon

1173
00:47:01,839 --> 00:47:04,560
this concept still stands where you go

1174
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:07,440
from basic level of security to control

1175
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:10,000
standardized optimized and now you can

1176
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,640
start innovations it's very interesting

1177
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:15,440
that when you ask a lot of stakeholders

1178
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:17,599
where you are in the security process

1179
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:19,200
they're going to point you toward the

1180
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:20,319
right

1181
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:22,400
some of the technical people will point

1182
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:24,640
you toward the left figuring out where

1183
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:26,960
you are would help you actually create a

1184
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:30,720
vision of where you want to be

1185
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:33,440
speaking of vision you have to actually

1186
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:34,400
try to

1187
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:37,599
see who the bad guys are we spend

1188
00:47:37,599 --> 00:47:39,440
a good portion of this presentation

1189
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:42,240
looking at their gains their systems are

1190
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:45,119
sophisticated they spend a lot of time

1191
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:46,000
and

1192
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:49,040
resources building those systems they

1193
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:52,800
have i.t departments they have

1194
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:55,599
marketing people they have

1195
00:47:55,599 --> 00:47:58,800
anything even graphic artists they have

1196
00:47:58,800 --> 00:47:59,680
to

1197
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:02,720
help them to sell their services to a

1198
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:04,800
full number of people

1199
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:06,240
understand the landscape understand

1200
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:07,680
what's pertinent

1201
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:11,119
right now who is attacking you and why

1202
00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:13,359
why would definitely help you to defend

1203
00:48:13,359 --> 00:48:15,520
your infrastructure much better go for

1204
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:18,480
simplicity hackers though hackers

1205
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:20,640
for the most part would go for something

1206
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:21,599
simple

1207
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:24,319
and if you can detect that simple you

1208
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:27,200
can defend yourself against the the most

1209
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:29,839
sophisticated exploits that will follow

1210
00:48:29,839 --> 00:48:31,839
i'd like to use word for enemies in my

1211
00:48:31,839 --> 00:48:33,440
presentation not because

1212
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:36,720
lindsay lohan coined that term but also

1213
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:38,960
uh because frenemies are very important

1214
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:39,920
we have

1215
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:42,240
everybody in our environment who tries

1216
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:45,599
to attach pieces of data uh all over

1217
00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:47,839
it's uh our i.t departments it's our

1218
00:48:47,839 --> 00:48:50,720
marketing it's our research it's uh

1219
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:54,400
vendors partners customers

1220
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:57,440
and our perimeter is so big

1221
00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:00,720
don't 100 trust all these treat them as

1222
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:04,160
free enemies because a lot of breaches

1223
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:06,400
a lot of hacker activities are being

1224
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:07,359
helped

1225
00:49:07,359 --> 00:49:08,880
sometimes

1226
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:11,920
without knowing by your friends

1227
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:13,839
people who have access

1228
00:49:13,839 --> 00:49:16,480
to your system take control over

1229
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:20,319
systems that you have try to proactively

1230
00:49:20,319 --> 00:49:22,400
defend and lastly look at feasible

1231
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:24,800
solutions most likely you have a lot of

1232
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:27,040
tools already within your infrastructure

1233
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:28,640
help you

1234
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:30,480
build some of these defenses to catch

1235
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:32,400
some of these things some of them not

1236
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:34,160
being used to their full potential

1237
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:37,280
because of various reasons but we find

1238
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:39,280
that when the company looks at their

1239
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:40,559
infrastructure

1240
00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:41,359
they

1241
00:49:41,359 --> 00:49:43,440
if they come up with a good feasible way

1242
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:46,400
to combat things they actually show

1243
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:48,880
results we see a lot of security

1244
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:50,160
becoming

1245
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:53,760
a way to recover the losses it's uh

1246
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:56,079
in some cases in large organizations

1247
00:49:56,079 --> 00:49:58,400
they have a keep

1248
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:00,720
spending money but security saving money

1249
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:03,760
and actually producing roi

1250
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:05,680
that's all i had to share with you today

1251
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:07,440
hopefully this was useful

1252
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:10,760
any questions

1253
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:19,119
is there uh

1254
00:50:19,119 --> 00:50:22,160
do you see any mechanisms for these

1255
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:24,880
actives authenticating

1256
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:27,200
their

1257
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
absolutely some of those

1258
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
places that

1259
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,800
hackers operate they restrict you by ip

1260
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:43,359
address they require you to have a

1261
00:50:43,359 --> 00:50:45,680
browser certificate for example

1262
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:47,839
and even when you have a browser

1263
00:50:47,839 --> 00:50:50,559
certificate you can bypass ip

1264
00:50:50,559 --> 00:50:53,200
restrictions it asks you not only for

1265
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:55,760
your username and password it also gives

1266
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:57,680
you a passphrase that only you would

1267
00:50:57,680 --> 00:51:00,640
remember and it will like uh you know 20

1268
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:02,319
years ago when you buy a video game it

1269
00:51:02,319 --> 00:51:04,800
would say open to page five give me the

1270
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:07,119
first letter of the second word

1271
00:51:07,119 --> 00:51:10,480
so they put a lot of things uh that make

1272
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:12,000
extremely difficult for security

1273
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,319
researchers to follow them and that's

1274
00:51:14,319 --> 00:51:16,480
always an ongoing battle hackers are

1275
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:18,960
very sophisticated if we go to a forum

1276
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:22,079
and they have uh patterns of how a

1277
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:24,640
person goes through a forum if we try to

1278
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:26,160
download all the data from the forum

1279
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:28,079
that's the last time i use that account

1280
00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:30,800
because the hackers actually detect the

1281
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:33,040
human behavior versus machine behavior

1282
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:36,559
that tries to download the data

1283
00:51:36,559 --> 00:51:38,319
how big is fishing

1284
00:51:38,319 --> 00:51:40,640
in your presentation

1285
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:43,040
we saw going after credit cards we saw

1286
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:45,359
going after identity

1287
00:51:45,359 --> 00:51:46,800
but

1288
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:49,200
are they

1289
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:53,040
they want it to be easy

1290
00:51:53,599 --> 00:51:56,559
their work to be easy so

1291
00:51:56,559 --> 00:51:58,800
are they is there only a small sect

1292
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:02,240
that's not fishing or is it the games

1293
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:04,079
the

1294
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:06,480
a lot of information being gathered from

1295
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:07,520
fishing

1296
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:09,680
fishing usually how the viruses get a

1297
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:12,559
new system uh besides a false web

1298
00:52:12,559 --> 00:52:15,839
advertising phishing is number one um

1299
00:52:15,839 --> 00:52:18,319
way for these viruses to distribute

1300
00:52:18,319 --> 00:52:22,240
themselves uh so that mobile botnet that

1301
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:23,119
had

1302
00:52:23,119 --> 00:52:26,559
up to 18 000 infections in a single day

1303
00:52:26,559 --> 00:52:27,839
it's actually

1304
00:52:27,839 --> 00:52:30,640
all done for phishing so it's a huge

1305
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:33,280
vehicle for hackers still to infect

1306
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:35,599
people

1307
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:39,359
i need to be the last question

1308
00:52:39,359 --> 00:52:41,359
in defenses you didn't mention white

1309
00:52:41,359 --> 00:52:43,680
listing of applications at all or if you

1310
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:45,200
did that i was looking at the camera

1311
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:47,040
when you did what would you like to talk

1312
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:49,920
about that is the last question

1313
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:52,720
white listing is a difficult task it

1314
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:55,440
works for pos quite easily if you have a

1315
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:57,440
point of sale system and it only does

1316
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:00,160
pos you can definitely write list

1317
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:02,720
everything in very dynamic environment

1318
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:05,280
it's rather difficult at the same time

1319
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:08,079
you have to have a lot of vehicles to

1320
00:53:08,079 --> 00:53:10,480
whitelist you have to whitelist email

1321
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:13,599
websites you have to might list

1322
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:16,559
browser plugins you have to white list

1323
00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:19,440
applications hackers find the easiest

1324
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:21,920
way the one that works and white listing

1325
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:22,960
works

1326
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:24,800
it's just such a difficult task

1327
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:26,880
especially for a larger company

1328
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:29,839
thank you
