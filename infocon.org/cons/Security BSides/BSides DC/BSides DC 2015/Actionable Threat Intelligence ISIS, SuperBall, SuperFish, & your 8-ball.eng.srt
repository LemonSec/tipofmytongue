1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,370
and I want in and the National

2
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:11,280
techniques why am I here I am supposedly

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,190
a hacker at least according to the

4
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:19,880
ticker oh my my beautifully and i work

5
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:23,220
40 box where I have this I whatever of

6
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:26,400
vice president period which means I

7
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,240
still to whether I want to do not take

8
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:38,640
into I got I know it's possible he's

9
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,020
look at the conference later of it and

10
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:47,370
in my history I used to have hair and do

11
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:49,800
security from a very young age this is

12
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,710
from my army days back of the idea in

13
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:56,300
Israel where I had various different

14
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:59,940
stupid roles i'm not i'm not really the

15
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:03,059
type that works well in a rigid

16
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:07,860
environment I don't know why so I ended

17
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:10,830
up getting passed around a lot of places

18
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:13,760
but it's great exposure experience and

19
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,680
the latest stuff that I did there when

20
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,409
still do there is a rather red team on

21
00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:22,400
the Israeli Air Force Cyber Command

22
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:27,330
start running living on wallet and I'm a

23
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:30,290
parameter for pro long time I mean

24
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:33,420
experience wise i'm now at a stage dog

25
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:36,500
saying i have over 15 years experience

26
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:40,350
this is horrible and and most of it was

27
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,210
from the offensive side from the great

28
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:44,490
inside so you're probably ask yourself

29
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:47,640
doing here in the blue team room well

30
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:51,720
most of the writing work is geared so

31
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:54,390
that we can actually fix stuff on the

32
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:55,500
losing side

33
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:58,140
for a resume you're not doing that by

34
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:01,800
yourself all right before I do it by any

35
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:08,149
chance you become a client and but in

36
00:02:08,149 --> 00:02:10,590
through my years of Terrence I've

37
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:12,660
learned that in order to implement

38
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:17,100
proper blue team processes you need to

39
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:19,490
do things right and there's no magic

40
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:23,820
silver gold and and that becomes really

41
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:25,320
really apparent when you start talking

42
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,750
about Freddy talents that you signed our

43
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:29,760
thing and we thought we've got fruit

44
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:34,860
cloud and big data and apt and ng

45
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:37,739
whatever any word for their crimes you

46
00:02:37,739 --> 00:02:40,110
generation this concerning that so the

47
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:44,100
latest thing at least as of last RSA is

48
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,900
credit Alice you can buy threat

49
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:49,709
intelligence a box or e or something

50
00:02:49,709 --> 00:02:51,600
that costs a lot of money it makes me

51
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,459
feel good because you spend on my own

52
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:56,130
then you must buzzes thing and the thing

53
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:58,800
it is you can't just buy credit balance

54
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,560
and like everything else in the blue

55
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:04,019
team you need to have proper structure

56
00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:07,200
in understanding of what is the context

57
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,840
the context for any blue team work

58
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,870
especially for friend intelligence is

59
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:17,160
threat model okay a beretta model is one

60
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:19,560
of the truly magical things that the

61
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:23,850
needle will enable us as defenders to

62
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:28,049
say I don't care about that right you

63
00:03:28,049 --> 00:03:29,549
know for me I don't hear about that

64
00:03:29,549 --> 00:03:31,110
these are the magic words that a

65
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:33,210
defender that I see so at risk

66
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:37,500
CEO needs to be able to say when faced

67
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,840
with something that he doesn't really

68
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,420
care about right I am NOT Cisco all

69
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:44,850
right I don't care about Cisco's friends

70
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:48,570
I am NOT target I don't care about

71
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:50,520
targets threats all right I have a

72
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:53,160
different kind of business and you're

73
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:55,470
the only that I have in your pocket Fred

74
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:58,050
mom let's spend a few minutes talking

75
00:03:58,050 --> 00:03:59,820
about friend hold for removal to

76
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:01,200
threaten thousands because otherwise

77
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,710
we'll be like lost and how to cancel but

78
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:07,020
how did you build up on front tells us

79
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:09,030
if you've done the prophetic so a few

80
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:11,820
schools of a threat modeling exist is

81
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:17,430
this too too loud it's just no because

82
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:19,500
I'm sitting under speak of the greater

83
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,680
okay just making sure a three-week

84
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,570
spools of thread modeling attacker

85
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:30,990
centric asset centric and in software

86
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:34,590
center almost forgot that's your Forks

87
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:40,830
and so three main schools will talk

88
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:42,360
briefly about a personal attack

89
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,180
eccentric is where you focus on your

90
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:48,050
threats your actual credit actors and

91
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:51,870
you search for that by identifying who's

92
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:53,820
out there together alright that's evenly

93
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,920
the questions that should ask your CEO

94
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,200
coo that people will actually run the

95
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:01,800
business don't ask the IT guys don't ask

96
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,960
even not the sea so which is one of

97
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:06,240
those technical seasons that only cares

98
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,710
about building firewalls it's kind of

99
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:09,900
bugging you with whoever it is giving

100
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:13,380
idea and ask the people who actually run

101
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:15,300
the business invasive as its problems

102
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:18,000
what keeps you up at night right what

103
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,380
kind of credit

104
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:22,110
you know this is how are you going to

105
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:24,750
get in jail under what circumstance and

106
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:28,260
from that I build on so I have those

107
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:30,540
actors and that's how the effective on

108
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:35,190
over software centric and this is these

109
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:36,900
are probably the models that convert

110
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:39,990
most amount of deacon came from rd or

111
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:42,000
very software or technical centric

112
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,970
practice and you'll probably remember

113
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:48,180
words by dread and stride and all those

114
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:51,210
fancy software threat oddly told their

115
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:53,490
rate if you're a party there are almost

116
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:56,360
useless if you're running a business and

117
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,650
especially if you're trying to figure

118
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:01,320
out a threat intelligence because some

119
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:06,660
horror as much as we'd like to make very

120
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:09,270
glamorous and this is this is everything

121
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:13,260
don't care up it's not right it's really

122
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:15,990
not it's just softly and so let's put

123
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:18,270
that aside and let already deal with

124
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:21,570
that last one is necessary which is kind

125
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:25,320
of the flipside of press Enter key for a

126
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,660
following to start with the assets right

127
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:30,270
and with the flip side questions to the

128
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:35,000
CEO CEO CFO are how do we make money

129
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,240
okay how am I campaign how are you

130
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:42,030
getting paid learn all those God options

131
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:44,490
coming in from all right what is it a

132
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:47,220
business what is the business dude order

133
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:50,160
organization to what what more need to

134
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,890
protect and when I say assets again dawn

135
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:56,250
don't open to that the fall of the IT

136
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:58,080
guys going to tell you how we have those

137
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,700
assets in that are like routers and

138
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,860
firewalls and servers horse agents like

139
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:04,560
no these are not assets you know

140
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,280
visitors

141
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,460
these are technical supplements to

142
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:10,889
support it stop that you do with an

143
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:12,990
assets to make money with the business

144
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:14,460
okay so don't confuse those two

145
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:17,130
different things assets in a threat

146
00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:20,760
model is something that's less tangible

147
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:24,870
right then I server or invaders so let's

148
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:27,570
focus on the two and two three public

149
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:29,760
schools that are is it we ask eccentric

150
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:32,550
an attacker century and start working

151
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:34,350
from there because that's that's where

152
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:38,340
we need that or pretty doesn't really

153
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:40,890
come into play in terms of showing value

154
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:44,970
and helping you as a defender get better

155
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:47,460
alright in minimize the risk minimize

156
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:51,030
the threat I saw the practical tools

157
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:54,300
that I like using and that i know of our

158
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:58,260
off dating and it's a little sister

159
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:02,190
octave s for smaller businesses it's

160
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:04,620
great threat modeling responding tools

161
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:07,889
as well as beta if a ir factor analysis

162
00:08:07,889 --> 00:08:10,919
and information risk and i'm sure that

163
00:08:10,919 --> 00:08:13,800
there are others out there find one that

164
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:17,220
you are comfortable with find one that

165
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:20,520
your customers might be using all right

166
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,320
and learn how to use that language learn

167
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:25,110
how to use that threat modeling language

168
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:26,880
and capabilities in order to map out

169
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:29,130
what is it that you're actually

170
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:32,039
defending and that bites always an

171
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:33,539
interesting practice because a lot of

172
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:35,760
companies don't have that and in the end

173
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,309
of the day you're like so what what do

174
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:38,880
they have

175
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,700
listening tools over here where I'm not

176
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:45,510
actually effective so let's talk a

177
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:48,540
little bit about the threat actors what

178
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:52,350
how do i what might do with them in the

179
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:54,240
threat model and because that's where

180
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,630
I'm going to derive or target most of my

181
00:08:57,630 --> 00:09:00,990
threat intelligence is to identify how r

182
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:03,800
by factors affecting me and how can i

183
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:08,490
prepare it eventually so the tractors

184
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:10,530
can be everything from you know crazy

185
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:14,180
Russian hackers to Chinese hackers to

186
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:18,660
internal threats of your CEO or the

187
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:21,180
nerve or relative you have to identify

188
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:24,090
it again talk to the people who actually

189
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:28,290
love the business and identify who are

190
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:30,930
those groups follow me the threat

191
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:32,730
communities or threat aphids if they're

192
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:34,500
a little more specific or those

193
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:38,430
communities are actors that you as a

194
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:42,480
person who runs business on Sunday are

195
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,900
afraid up right who has been known to

196
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:48,360
attack as two approaches and when you do

197
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:51,620
that you're going to start mapping out

198
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:55,020
basic elements of those crackers right

199
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:57,930
who are they weatherly our capabilities

200
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:00,240
from technology perspective on

201
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,160
accessibility perspective Buster

202
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:06,360
motivation to the lab girls okay that's

203
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:10,890
all going to the threat model the next

204
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:13,500
thing that you want to start factoring

205
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:16,860
in as I said are the assets so you map

206
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:20,430
out your attackers potential threats now

207
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:22,560
figure out the water pipe protection and

208
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,290
again now they have create a model that

209
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:28,590
you can update on an ongoing basis that

210
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:30,570
reflects how the business operates

211
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:32,510
because obviously does

212
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:34,580
living document all right the business

213
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:37,220
does not standing on its ask keep

214
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:39,740
changing but the products you invest in

215
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:44,090
hardy you do have a days you have you

216
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:46,790
bet on money and for a certain already

217
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:48,380
know that's what they think whatever it

218
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:50,180
is you do it keeps changing that's

219
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:52,160
that's quite a business makes money so

220
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,710
map those assets and the 74 assets not

221
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:57,430
necessarily a server may be a tease and

222
00:10:57,430 --> 00:11:00,410
map the supporting elements around

223
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:02,930
that's where the technology kicks in

224
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:06,260
that's where the controls kick in all

225
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:08,060
right so i might have an asset that

226
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:10,730
stored inside of database that database

227
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:14,840
is protected by a firewall a navy this

228
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:18,020
and that it might be protecting also by

229
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:21,560
a process of validating input-output

230
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:24,620
that might not be technology there might

231
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:26,660
be some hopefully going hope this is

232
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:30,080
wrong part of the transaction part of

233
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,140
the process but a financial transaction

234
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:35,630
my cupcake algae on that might be an old

235
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:38,390
lady Sansa that's not an approved vendor

236
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:41,630
it's not a life but handwritten list

237
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:45,050
that's an awesome control we call that a

238
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:47,960
mitigated control and risk language and

239
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:50,510
you know I thought it works so I don't

240
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:52,970
need your fancy ecology might have been

241
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:55,760
mitigated control to reduce the risk of

242
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,700
making transaction with better because I

243
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:00,350
have Lucy she's been doing this for 30

244
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:04,790
years hope and I just send you money on

245
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:08,560
one thing controlling other transactions

246
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,150
so now that we haven't run off again

247
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:13,490
happier threat actors communities you

248
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:15,860
have your assets now al processes around

249
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:18,020
the people that are molding process the

250
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:20,800
two facets the control that have a

251
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:25,790
mitigating risk assets have you again

252
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:28,380
bilities that I'll use everything is

253
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:32,010
fine that can start enriching that model

254
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:34,350
with threat intelligence threat

255
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:36,120
intelligence is basically the stuff that

256
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:40,070
makes that threat model live from the

257
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:43,019
non-asset help all right so he said we

258
00:12:43,019 --> 00:12:45,089
know how to how to keep the acid

259
00:12:45,089 --> 00:12:47,279
elements alive because we are running

260
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:49,320
the business aren't we're inside you can

261
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:52,290
know if an acid changes or even control

262
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:55,560
change threat intelligence comes in into

263
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:59,399
play on the threat actor side to tell us

264
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:01,440
more about how do they affect or

265
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,230
potentially factor hassles so before we

266
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:05,910
talk about threatening intelligence we

267
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:09,480
need to talk about a collection right

268
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,890
thread collection our intelligence

269
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:14,700
collection how do I collect intelligence

270
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:17,700
or data turning into your topics in what

271
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:21,600
way notice one so asker's are person

272
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,779
first of all just by saying no to some

273
00:13:24,779 --> 00:13:26,820
of the stuff we kind of clear out the

274
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:29,940
way and threat intelligence or threat

275
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:33,839
data is not in defines its not ashes of

276
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:37,380
malware it's not IP addresses of URLs or

277
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:39,209
whatever the the threat Intel

278
00:13:39,209 --> 00:13:42,990
vendors are talking and mask all right

279
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:45,810
you should be saying why isn't that

280
00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:49,110
already p you into my firewall your

281
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:51,870
uploader AV whatever other patrol to I

282
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:54,000
have why do i need to buy an extra fee

283
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,630
of signatures and give it to my

284
00:13:57,630 --> 00:14:00,060
signature engine right that is not

285
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:03,050
threaded cultures the second question is

286
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:05,910
why is that relevant or how is that

287
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:08,279
relevant to meet my business to my

288
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:12,029
thread bottom okay so that is enough

289
00:14:12,029 --> 00:14:14,220
credit countries that's just signatures

290
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:16,350
put that aside get someone else to with

291
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:18,320
that and get it for free don't

292
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:22,890
sorry members and let's talk about what

293
00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:25,890
do I collect so first of all again go

294
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:28,110
back to the tripod look at your threat

295
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:31,620
actors focus on them if your threat

296
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:35,160
actor is China and like the PLA well

297
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:39,840
first we have a problem but that's what

298
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,760
you should be focusing on in terms of

299
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,810
understanding how do I reach my

300
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:48,270
understanding of what they can do how

301
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:49,950
they do it what's their accessibility

302
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:53,370
who do they hire what's learning their

303
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:55,920
tools and so on so forth is my friend

304
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:59,940
actor is a competitor okay that's

305
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:02,550
something different I start collecting

306
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:05,430
intelligence on my competitor up to your

307
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:08,040
business intelligence not all right how

308
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,230
did they operate cops do they sell to

309
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:12,930
who or your suppliers their partners

310
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:17,420
whether they use in our to get attacks

311
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:20,010
get ahead sort of accommodation right

312
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:22,740
that's my thread etheridge we're about

313
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:25,440
that install and so forth the second

314
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,980
element is industry all right i am not

315
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:31,110
as funny access was hopefully in my

316
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:33,480
industry but there are any other like me

317
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:38,340
just a little different and we are all

318
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:41,480
as an industry whatever that industry is

319
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:44,640
probably experiencing some similarities

320
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:48,960
in terms of boost afros right if i'm in

321
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:53,670
the oil and gas industry probably you

322
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:55,320
know there are a few companies and the

323
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,030
oil gas industry that experience the

324
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:59,400
same kind of threat actors going after

325
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,960
it right green these could be one of

326
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:04,080
them did you eat could be another one of

327
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:07,650
them whoever it is we're experiencing

328
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:10,610
similar attacks so look at

329
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:13,310
history and say huh my competitor gallon

330
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:15,560
hat or my partner whatever it is what

331
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:18,800
can I learn from that because I might be

332
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:22,070
the next one ok so we're brought up a

333
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:24,529
little bit as far as the spectrum goes

334
00:16:24,529 --> 00:16:28,279
up what were you look for and look for

335
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:30,500
those and last but not least we're

336
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:34,370
getting into m5 in lolcat they the more

337
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:36,459
general Freddie columns right

338
00:16:36,459 --> 00:16:38,990
understanding that i have people in my

339
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:40,670
organization of corporate people are

340
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:43,670
usually became a security problem right

341
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:46,550
and people get affected by the more

342
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:50,660
general stuff if if there's a final four

343
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:54,140
or chaos an NBA kind of big event going

344
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:59,240
on a lot of the random casual threat

345
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:01,670
actors that I've not before are going to

346
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:03,980
go after a lot of people enhanced trying

347
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:07,730
to target fish or get them to click on

348
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:12,650
the the fantasy sport people don't do

349
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:18,650
sport that's football things yeah so

350
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:20,150
there's an optician going around there

351
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:22,250
there's you know big names on a bolt out

352
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:25,429
scams obviously that can affect mine

353
00:17:25,429 --> 00:17:27,410
please alright because there are

354
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:29,900
Americans and their up the pole in their

355
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:32,900
old like I know I have my email in my

356
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:35,600
opening out it has filter on it now it

357
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:39,080
just goes to don't care and I'm sure

358
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,580
that other other people do care and

359
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:41,830
click on

360
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:44,960
so that's it that's kind of general

361
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,840
threading talk in terms of

362
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,200
characteristic statutes be more in

363
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:53,649
periodical again sports things and

364
00:17:53,649 --> 00:17:59,029
bigger Matt and debates and questions

365
00:17:59,029 --> 00:18:02,239
and World News whatever matters that's

366
00:18:02,239 --> 00:18:05,029
bubbling you can usually get from those

367
00:18:05,029 --> 00:18:07,039
protocol vendors okay because they're

368
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:08,899
much more generic and they don't

369
00:18:08,899 --> 00:18:11,299
necessarily apply to you as an industry

370
00:18:11,299 --> 00:18:15,049
or other business next question because

371
00:18:15,049 --> 00:18:18,950
every everything so far has been get

372
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:22,129
they'd up get intelligence so this is

373
00:18:22,129 --> 00:18:27,019
how and first of all posing a lot of

374
00:18:27,019 --> 00:18:29,269
stuff you can get for free all right

375
00:18:29,269 --> 00:18:32,989
there are a lot of resources that came

376
00:18:32,989 --> 00:18:35,330
to can get very specific to be more

377
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:39,649
industry that you can get for free ok

378
00:18:39,649 --> 00:18:41,389
I'm going to be able to talk about those

379
00:18:41,389 --> 00:18:44,299
incurred a lot of practices out there a

380
00:18:44,299 --> 00:18:47,059
lot of blogs popping out now by a lot of

381
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:49,519
my friends and colleagues about posting

382
00:18:49,519 --> 00:18:53,539
practices and really picked out that I'm

383
00:18:53,539 --> 00:18:55,190
greedy too to the practice itself I'm

384
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:59,029
veteran a few lakes here in my bedroom

385
00:18:59,029 --> 00:19:02,960
posted posting links some pdfs some some

386
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,729
links to websites that explain how to do

387
00:19:04,729 --> 00:19:07,099
that basically what you're looking at is

388
00:19:07,099 --> 00:19:11,899
the ability to zero down on a geography

389
00:19:11,899 --> 00:19:15,049
on language on an industry and get as

390
00:19:15,049 --> 00:19:17,539
much news there was much information

391
00:19:17,539 --> 00:19:21,129
from forums from blogs whatever it is

392
00:19:21,129 --> 00:19:24,769
for that specific area alright and that

393
00:19:24,769 --> 00:19:27,559
area had been covered more industry that

394
00:19:27,559 --> 00:19:28,410
area

395
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:30,300
your thread actors and communities

396
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:31,590
that's where you want to start getting

397
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:35,040
data to turn it into into intelligence

398
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:39,330
and look for pitfalls when you when you

399
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:41,370
look for very specific threat accurate

400
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:43,470
stuff and that's where you easily have

401
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:46,320
to involve humans as we call it in the

402
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,420
intelligence community to human

403
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:51,180
intelligence a lot of the data sources

404
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:53,460
will require someone to log into a

405
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:56,010
forward all right some of those forums

406
00:19:56,010 --> 00:19:58,440
are not just public searchable you have

407
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,720
to be a member sometimes you have to be

408
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,910
dead in order to be better than you have

409
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:06,510
to be active in the whatever that for

410
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:09,990
was doing okay and it gets very tricky

411
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:12,060
to collect intelligence from those you

412
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:14,550
can't just go like google hacking and

413
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:16,770
give me everything from that far it's

414
00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:19,230
not going to work it's you know the deep

415
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:20,790
with a daughter but whatever it is and

416
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:24,300
you will need human actors getting

417
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:25,770
involved in club without intelligence

418
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:28,320
again depending on your friend tells of

419
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,640
practice we didn't want to do that

420
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:33,090
in-house or again find someone who

421
00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:35,640
specializes after you've identified

422
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:38,160
these are the threat actors specializes

423
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,140
in those threat actors and have that

424
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:42,510
human capabilities that speak Chinese

425
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:43,680
Russian

426
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:48,540
in Portuguese whatever it is that can

427
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:51,090
actually interact and get intelligence

428
00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:54,210
into this form so again feel free to

429
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:55,860
check out the link i promise personal

430
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:58,050
our there unless I'm booked on website

431
00:20:58,050 --> 00:21:03,930
and destroyed it and remember that you

432
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:05,910
will get a lot of unstructured data

433
00:21:05,910 --> 00:21:09,480
again we're not talking hashes and I

434
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:12,110
gather signora you're talking about

435
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:15,300
freeform data and you can have keywords

436
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:18,950
you can have I canvases to have whatever

437
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:22,050
so start looking at tools that are good

438
00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:24,630
with processing free form data Splunk is

439
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:27,960
your best friend in those cases some I

440
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,970
phone hacking to this little keywords

441
00:21:29,970 --> 00:21:31,710
and poorly ate up between different

442
00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:35,820
sources and before you again from you

443
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:39,240
buy into some threads into a platform

444
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:42,060
try to try to see if you can do by

445
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:45,000
yourself easier cheaper and usually more

446
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,070
effective because it's for you all right

447
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:51,510
it's not for everyone it's for you and

448
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:53,640
finally we're getting to thread

449
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,800
intelligence so it's kind of almost 20

450
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:58,260
minutes talking about for getting

451
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:01,380
different elements we're getting here so

452
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:02,880
turning that data that you've collected

453
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:06,930
all right into intelligence is by itself

454
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:10,710
a practice all right the process of

455
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:12,030
turning data to intelligence is

456
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:14,850
basically putting context around it and

457
00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:17,250
it's more projects right that's word of

458
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:20,610
all 15 minutes of threat modeling and

459
00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:22,470
thread actors and assets coming to play

460
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:25,980
all right data that is does not fit your

461
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:29,340
context irrelevant or at least not

462
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:31,320
immediately relevant for you it's not

463
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:34,650
going to Freddy tolerance and so let's

464
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:37,980
see how others define actual print comes

465
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:39,470
so this

466
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:44,900
profile research and we provision so

467
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:46,580
that's how they define out of the

468
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:48,919
Freddie called perry made from data

469
00:22:48,919 --> 00:22:51,799
which is just data all right you have to

470
00:22:51,799 --> 00:22:54,470
decide what do we use with that how is

471
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:59,030
that don't use it and provided data that

472
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:02,150
that or analysis of data again that's

473
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:03,500
that's where I'm going to the content to

474
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:06,890
say or beta means ABC but again it's

475
00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:08,630
usually in the generic context about

476
00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:11,390
served for you if you find it useful

477
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:14,840
great you don't screw it and the top of

478
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,340
the period is basically providing

479
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:20,419
contextual data to your environment and

480
00:23:20,419 --> 00:23:22,580
that's what we will this is a real

481
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:24,830
credit or practice where you can say

482
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:28,520
this is relevant for me alright and

483
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:30,350
that's where it becomes accessible

484
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:34,100
because generic kind of low caste and

485
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:37,669
then devise and the Euro focus on block

486
00:23:37,669 --> 00:23:39,860
out a contribution it's not targeting me

487
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:43,970
I can start everyone and that one is the

488
00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:46,610
one that would try to get you and that

489
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:48,380
leads us to a problem because this is

490
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:50,659
the Dodger threat intelligence at least

491
00:23:50,659 --> 00:23:54,530
according to surveys which are biased or

492
00:23:54,530 --> 00:23:56,750
live or where our research content is

493
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:59,360
like how are you subtract out 60 forcing

494
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,280
using for intelligence missing those

495
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:04,970
jimmy kimmel street interviews yeah so

496
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:07,669
time like that politically they taught

497
00:24:07,669 --> 00:24:09,440
us and they afforded to make all I think

498
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:13,820
the Hillary businesses like oh really so

499
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:15,980
services again taken with a pinch of

500
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:20,000
salt and we're not seeing huge adoption

501
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,919
and the reason is that we're not really

502
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:24,590
getting to that top of the pyramid where

503
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:26,929
it becomes actionable and I can say I

504
00:24:26,929 --> 00:24:30,650
actually uses I managed to reduce my

505
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:32,929
rest from point A to point B using

506
00:24:32,929 --> 00:24:35,179
threat intelligence how many times have

507
00:24:35,179 --> 00:24:37,320
you here to see so Laura Freddie tell

508
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:40,399
customers say that on the TI vendor

509
00:24:40,399 --> 00:24:44,009
apparently not so much and this is why I

510
00:24:44,009 --> 00:24:46,529
became angry and gravity and from the

511
00:24:46,529 --> 00:24:50,509
trans and came up with this talk so

512
00:24:50,509 --> 00:24:53,700
mostly almost all my started with

513
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:56,880
this is what do people do the better

514
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:03,630
okay I'll tell so we know what we know

515
00:25:03,630 --> 00:25:06,000
what we want and what we don't want and

516
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,509
let's focus on what can we do with that

517
00:25:09,509 --> 00:25:12,509
all right so how do I use that threading

518
00:25:12,509 --> 00:25:14,940
tool which is still kind of fuzzy in

519
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:16,740
terms of the data that I collected X

520
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:18,539
relevant for my context based on my

521
00:25:18,539 --> 00:25:21,389
thread actors and asses how they turn it

522
00:25:21,389 --> 00:25:24,720
into something actionable alright so as

523
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,389
a classic like Mildred from Persia we

524
00:25:27,389 --> 00:25:30,049
divided into three parts pretty empty

525
00:25:30,049 --> 00:25:33,539
reactive at home bored so preempted I

526
00:25:33,539 --> 00:25:37,559
know sheets govern okay it's not burning

527
00:25:37,559 --> 00:25:39,990
yet but I know something's gonna burn

528
00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:43,350
and this is like the holy grail for

529
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:47,279
intelligence this is the incoming it's

530
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:50,429
not hitting us yet but I know it's gonna

531
00:25:50,429 --> 00:25:52,740
hit us all right and I know where I know

532
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:54,809
where it's going to hurt now we're

533
00:25:54,809 --> 00:26:00,210
talking fun okay and the characteristics

534
00:26:00,210 --> 00:26:02,129
of that Freddy tell is that it has a

535
00:26:02,129 --> 00:26:04,950
very very well-defined start late like

536
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:07,230
it's honey it's going to hit in 10 days

537
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:09,870
three days whatever it is and if Arizona

538
00:26:09,870 --> 00:26:12,960
find anything alright because it's a

539
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:15,509
similar attack it's not like a tsunami

540
00:26:15,509 --> 00:26:20,639
of attacks that are just endless it's

541
00:26:20,639 --> 00:26:22,769
again very specific it's usually very

542
00:26:22,769 --> 00:26:26,429
very contextual to me as a defender and

543
00:26:26,429 --> 00:26:27,260
tomorrow

544
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:32,830
you need a good general examples of

545
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:35,600
things that I know I need to protect fun

546
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:39,010
are things like I mentioned before again

547
00:26:39,010 --> 00:26:42,860
big media advance right I know that

548
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:46,130
because if our essays coming up in what

549
00:26:46,130 --> 00:26:49,130
is now february's oh my god i'm sending

550
00:26:49,130 --> 00:26:52,820
a lot of my executives to one legal

551
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:55,040
patients access to war again black that

552
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,480
is a good time I'm sending tons of

553
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,760
executives to black cap and so I know

554
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:00,980
I'm gonna get a lot of fishing before

555
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:04,160
that with all the party invites okay and

556
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,830
I'm now I'm going to get a lot of

557
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:08,480
connections friend connections on and

558
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,790
requests on linkedin because everyone

559
00:27:10,790 --> 00:27:13,340
like candy cart pierre de Provence you

560
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:16,160
throw this group roads and eventually

561
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:18,640
they dykin linkedin so as an attacker

562
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:21,890
right and again this is one and two I'm

563
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:24,260
been there this is a classic time to

564
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:26,840
craft a very very specific skirmishing

565
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:31,490
cap for everyone went to black so yeah I

566
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:33,200
have a designated time I know that

567
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,910
stuff's going to have it I think start

568
00:27:34,910 --> 00:27:37,310
putting up walls the walls could be

569
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:39,410
things their executive you're going to

570
00:27:39,410 --> 00:27:42,260
base it's not openly fauna games it's

571
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:43,490
your first black out that from whatever

572
00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:46,100
it is here's what to expect here's what

573
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:48,320
to look up all right you can start to

574
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:51,110
that it can end with Perry's mr.

575
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:54,080
executive your new phone use that in

576
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:56,860
Vegas all right into the special phone

577
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:59,270
don't bring your iPhone

578
00:27:59,270 --> 00:28:01,940
it connects you to work it can do

579
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:03,950
whatever you do visually it's just a

580
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:06,980
little more secure it's it's fine for

581
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:08,890
that one time event as long as you keep

582
00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:11,840
fulfilling your basic needs or five mile

583
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:17,060
for and so again it's taking actions to

584
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:20,450
three and a half like that the second

585
00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:24,650
category is reactive who should have it

586
00:28:24,650 --> 00:28:27,260
now you have to deal with it right good

587
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:29,750
examples I'm drawing it all dating guess

588
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:32,120
what's going to happen all right come on

589
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:33,920
spring it out superfood shell-shocked

590
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:37,850
Hartley oldest pasta are reacting threat

591
00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:39,260
intelligence now you need to deal with

592
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:42,500
it all right characteristics very well

593
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:45,260
find start date it happened like pink

594
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:48,200
cloud let's go three days ago people

595
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:50,720
start patching block chip it's not like

596
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:55,820
long and long tail of someone steal

597
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:58,790
scanning for heart bleeds someone's

598
00:28:58,790 --> 00:29:01,850
still looking for shell shock and on the

599
00:29:01,850 --> 00:29:04,430
internet people are a lot of my good

600
00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:06,140
friends are still scanning and looking

601
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:09,080
for cash who's not asked who released a

602
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:14,090
new product we can all build that is not

603
00:29:14,090 --> 00:29:15,850
patched and it happened

604
00:29:15,850 --> 00:29:18,700
crazy people don't care about security

605
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:23,200
and so again thats that's the second

606
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,700
kind of threat talk and its

607
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:26,320
characteristics that we need to look at

608
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:28,990
in pay attention and be back door threat

609
00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:31,900
model the last one is the on board all

610
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:33,820
right it's your beautiful kind of

611
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:36,700
generic or more general thread

612
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:38,919
communities that are just always out of

613
00:29:38,919 --> 00:29:40,900
it always honor to get you looking for

614
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:44,650
the next opportunity the hackers all

615
00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:47,500
right economist it Isis is a new example

616
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:49,450
all right they're not going away anytime

617
00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:52,480
soon unless optics really bowl left just

618
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:57,909
like that's how I am so these are the

619
00:29:57,909 --> 00:30:01,929
kind of ongoing threats that I think

620
00:30:01,929 --> 00:30:07,480
some of the twees should have gravity

621
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:11,650
see your face talk to you later I

622
00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:13,809
barracks on you know I have years of

623
00:30:13,809 --> 00:30:19,659
experience so the other growing phrase

624
00:30:19,659 --> 00:30:22,090
that just need to monitor on constant

625
00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:26,380
basis and tune what you know about them

626
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:29,679
as far as again ecology star using

627
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:32,200
common attack vectors accessibility

628
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:34,750
again Isis is a great example they're

629
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:37,720
looking at a recruiting pretty big thing

630
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:41,559
on social media forums their ability

631
00:30:41,559 --> 00:30:42,370
headaches because of the

632
00:30:42,370 --> 00:30:45,580
english-speaking individuals so you know

633
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:47,830
what what the threat is gotta look

634
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:50,500
know where they're going to approach

635
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:52,899
your communities so you can start tuning

636
00:30:52,899 --> 00:30:57,000
how you deal with that homewood basis

637
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:01,419
which leads us to the actionable part so

638
00:31:01,419 --> 00:31:03,399
how do I get all these nicely

639
00:31:03,399 --> 00:31:05,740
categorized elements threat intelligence

640
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:08,740
and all those you speedin oh my god this

641
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:11,049
is what happen what are we doing that

642
00:31:11,049 --> 00:31:14,230
now all right I know where we want to be

643
00:31:14,230 --> 00:31:18,630
like this that's like silent partner and

644
00:31:18,630 --> 00:31:22,120
and some solutions make it look like

645
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:26,799
it's going to be like this and this is

646
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:28,659
probably the only solution that actually

647
00:31:28,659 --> 00:31:31,899
delivers all right I know that I have a

648
00:31:31,899 --> 00:31:37,419
customer okay it's worse and but you

649
00:31:37,419 --> 00:31:39,820
really want to turn it into something

650
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:41,679
that or from a natural ability

651
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:43,960
perspective you want to create some some

652
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:46,630
form of alert an alert that's going to

653
00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:50,350
say something very specific all right in

654
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:53,289
terms of an action what do I do now all

655
00:31:53,289 --> 00:31:55,809
right and who do I tell it to do is it

656
00:31:55,809 --> 00:31:59,260
that horrible happen is it HR is it

657
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:03,100
legal right is it marketing do I need to

658
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:05,590
change something and alert is not

659
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:08,649
necessarily all right some similar that

660
00:32:08,649 --> 00:32:10,750
pops up and says close that working

661
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:13,830
partner right if I get part of it I

662
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:16,019
threaten toddler to be a little more

663
00:32:16,019 --> 00:32:18,190
involved in should have a little more

664
00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:22,299
information in it and so first of all

665
00:32:22,299 --> 00:32:24,789
from another perspective we want to get

666
00:32:24,789 --> 00:32:28,029
the distance how far is this event from

667
00:32:28,029 --> 00:32:31,899
me all right this isn't being time 10

668
00:32:31,899 --> 00:32:34,690
minutes 15 minutes to hours five days a

669
00:32:34,690 --> 00:32:38,980
year it can be physical distance all

670
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:40,750
right people are marching down the

671
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:42,970
street I've dealt with foreign

672
00:32:42,970 --> 00:32:45,669
intelligence that translated to they are

673
00:32:45,669 --> 00:32:47,409
crossing the bridge and I would like

674
00:32:47,409 --> 00:32:49,690
across the bridge sitting in the NOC and

675
00:32:49,690 --> 00:32:53,230
going and that's Fred

676
00:32:53,230 --> 00:32:54,909
intelligence that can actually translate

677
00:32:54,909 --> 00:32:58,029
something physical distance would be

678
00:32:58,029 --> 00:33:00,820
logical one all right there five walks

679
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:04,320
away on the intertubes all right someone

680
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:07,870
crank one of those tubes and divergence

681
00:33:07,870 --> 00:33:10,029
on whatever somewhere else right so

682
00:33:10,029 --> 00:33:11,980
first of all distance you wanting to

683
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:14,080
find that in your alert and your

684
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:18,179
threaded collar if the second one is

685
00:33:18,179 --> 00:33:21,010
what go to the TTP's all right tools

686
00:33:21,010 --> 00:33:24,250
techniques costs procedures what are

687
00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:26,350
they going to use or water diffusing

688
00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:29,559
against us all right is it low orbit I

689
00:33:29,559 --> 00:33:34,990
cannon from from a novice guys is it APD

690
00:33:34,990 --> 00:33:40,149
from ambient is it you know sequel

691
00:33:40,149 --> 00:33:43,720
injection of some sort or a very very or

692
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:46,120
like an all-day that yeah we're going to

693
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:49,330
drop the OD it's important to understand

694
00:33:49,330 --> 00:33:51,700
again what's the context how should I

695
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:53,889
react to enter the rations are going to

696
00:33:53,889 --> 00:33:55,630
be completely different right between

697
00:33:55,630 --> 00:33:57,429
all those different examples that should

698
00:33:57,429 --> 00:33:59,649
be exciting part of your Freddie Taylor

699
00:33:59,649 --> 00:34:05,139
and last but not least and that's the

700
00:34:05,139 --> 00:34:07,299
better it gets really tricky you get to

701
00:34:07,299 --> 00:34:09,190
that question you know you're between

702
00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:13,599
something right as a response to the

703
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:15,929
alert alright I'm going to take a nap

704
00:34:15,929 --> 00:34:19,418
how is that action going to affect my

705
00:34:19,418 --> 00:34:22,599
attacker okay we're getting to like

706
00:34:22,599 --> 00:34:25,899
world war two enigma ethical questions

707
00:34:25,899 --> 00:34:28,119
one way to win that Freddy telligence

708
00:34:28,119 --> 00:34:30,790
down that's a real that's when you know

709
00:34:30,790 --> 00:34:31,429
you have

710
00:34:31,429 --> 00:34:34,879
Fred intel on your hands when you go if

711
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:37,309
I stop this attack they're going to go

712
00:34:37,309 --> 00:34:41,780
that I know something about and yes when

713
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:44,359
you get that point give yourself like

714
00:34:44,359 --> 00:34:46,639
two awesome points and and start

715
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:48,829
thinking about help you carry on that

716
00:34:48,829 --> 00:34:53,000
game on the long run and take some

717
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,889
casualties on the short run you know

718
00:34:54,889 --> 00:34:57,650
show that you can go on the neck server

719
00:34:57,650 --> 00:35:01,730
it's like week and not responding but

720
00:35:01,730 --> 00:35:03,880
I'll give you a couple of those kind of

721
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:07,460
pawns but if you're not going to get my

722
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:11,690
news okay and still not get out a path

723
00:35:11,690 --> 00:35:14,000
that I knew this was coming all right

724
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,500
and I parted the forward you don't have

725
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:18,190
to shut down to the identities doing it

726
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:20,950
for 10 minutes or day whatever I can

727
00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:25,280
take it as a business so that one really

728
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,290
definitely that the last test the last

729
00:35:27,290 --> 00:35:30,260
element of a TI alert is what is the

730
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:32,960
effect from an actionable perspective

731
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:37,220
online Katherine couple of examples on

732
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:41,299
what youtube or on the actionability of

733
00:35:41,299 --> 00:35:44,960
it threatening to alert one i follow

734
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,940
this pre-emptive in certain spots and

735
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:48,200
this is a good example that I've

736
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:51,440
actually experienced on the old health

737
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:54,020
building and Freddie full capacity with

738
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:55,400
one of our top part of my customers

739
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:57,710
really going to have to wrap up

740
00:35:57,710 --> 00:36:00,950
something and God would want where we

741
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:03,410
were able to say we've got an ekat

742
00:36:03,410 --> 00:36:07,010
coming in 16 minutes all right we know

743
00:36:07,010 --> 00:36:09,859
what's the target out of thousands of

744
00:36:09,859 --> 00:36:13,970
online assets that we have and for that

745
00:36:13,970 --> 00:36:16,040
customer online assets or gases like

746
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:18,349
we're very public happy out there and

747
00:36:18,349 --> 00:36:21,049
show that your Prime strong I'm gonna

748
00:36:21,049 --> 00:36:24,619
hide and I'm still standing and out of

749
00:36:24,619 --> 00:36:26,420
thousands of all my assets we knew

750
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:28,579
civically water to government be

751
00:36:28,579 --> 00:36:29,509
targeted

752
00:36:29,509 --> 00:36:32,989
GPZ we had a chance to see the tool and

753
00:36:32,989 --> 00:36:35,299
quickly review the source code seem like

754
00:36:35,299 --> 00:36:38,419
oh that's day this is not this is how

755
00:36:38,419 --> 00:36:39,499
it's going to look like I can actually

756
00:36:39,499 --> 00:36:43,999
stick mature this okay and it's gonna be

757
00:36:43,999 --> 00:36:46,519
like a big deal or whatever it is and I

758
00:36:46,519 --> 00:36:49,609
knew how many participants estimated are

759
00:36:49,609 --> 00:36:52,819
going to be involved in that attack and

760
00:36:52,819 --> 00:36:55,880
that's the case it was the vetoes and I

761
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:58,489
had 16 minutes to prepare it worked what

762
00:36:58,489 --> 00:37:02,659
do you do you start I are right now you

763
00:37:02,659 --> 00:37:04,999
start inserting response before the

764
00:37:04,999 --> 00:37:07,639
incident and have everyone that's going

765
00:37:07,639 --> 00:37:10,119
to be involved in that incident response

766
00:37:10,119 --> 00:37:13,579
respond to it and seeing how well do

767
00:37:13,579 --> 00:37:15,679
they do and go through the different

768
00:37:15,679 --> 00:37:19,299
layers of different parts of that map

769
00:37:19,299 --> 00:37:24,169
practice it learn one point in fix up

770
00:37:24,169 --> 00:37:26,179
this one wasn't ready this one was

771
00:37:26,179 --> 00:37:27,709
already they didn't know about this

772
00:37:27,709 --> 00:37:31,309
solution procedure although and get to a

773
00:37:31,309 --> 00:37:33,769
point work when they attack actually

774
00:37:33,769 --> 00:37:37,759
happens you just sit back and you go go

775
00:37:37,759 --> 00:37:41,869
through the same town as you just

776
00:37:41,869 --> 00:37:44,959
practiced all right so it's right on

777
00:37:44,959 --> 00:37:47,989
before the web blog is one of the great

778
00:37:47,989 --> 00:37:49,459
examples of how do you actually use

779
00:37:49,459 --> 00:37:53,209
credit elders another example and this

780
00:37:53,209 --> 00:37:54,469
is a little more gas this was around

781
00:37:54,469 --> 00:37:58,159
basic got older we know what to prepare

782
00:37:58,159 --> 00:37:59,869
for we know the one are going to be the

783
00:37:59,869 --> 00:38:02,119
pockets I can kind of strengthen make

784
00:38:02,119 --> 00:38:05,029
sure that these are okay and practices

785
00:38:05,029 --> 00:38:09,440
and another example of practicing

786
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,240
incredible correctly is

787
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:13,160
counterintelligence you won't get to

788
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:16,670
those points where you build a good

789
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:18,950
enough practice internally that you're

790
00:38:18,950 --> 00:38:21,230
able to start manipulating or

791
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:23,990
participating or call it pushing the

792
00:38:23,990 --> 00:38:26,780
engagement line further around out of

793
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:30,950
your bone field towards impactors and

794
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:32,230
that's where it gets interesting

795
00:38:32,230 --> 00:38:35,150
counterintelligence how do I mess or

796
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:37,910
alter or minimize whatever legally

797
00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:41,390
feasible acceptable water we can find we

798
00:38:41,390 --> 00:38:44,000
might have to minimize my exposure and

799
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,450
so good example again from my palette of

800
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:50,930
practicing Freddie tell and putting it

801
00:38:50,930 --> 00:38:53,900
to good use I hope was identifying

802
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:57,440
before were my friend you know my

803
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:00,619
customers own thread of community or

804
00:39:00,619 --> 00:39:02,780
actors we're getting their tools

805
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:06,760
Commission build whatever it is and and

806
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:09,619
see that someone again get really

807
00:39:09,619 --> 00:39:13,280
involved humans into that form and get

808
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:15,800
to one word someone is releasing a new

809
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:20,450
version of a tool of a rat and knowing

810
00:39:20,450 --> 00:39:23,349
that I have I can't do something with it

811
00:39:23,349 --> 00:39:28,790
and in fact the tool with itself because

812
00:39:28,790 --> 00:39:30,680
but i was downloading this

813
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:33,620
another on for vauxhall his number one

814
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:38,270
box cannot it's a virus so this

815
00:39:38,270 --> 00:39:39,800
is going to be infected with a virus but

816
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:42,860
it's really infected with itself and its

817
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:45,430
popping a shell from the hacker back to

818
00:39:45,430 --> 00:39:49,520
some random place where I can know that

819
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,440
some of these running it so that's a

820
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:54,530
great indication Oh who's using that

821
00:39:54,530 --> 00:39:58,250
tool when they're obviously again if you

822
00:39:58,250 --> 00:40:01,010
target it narrowly enough you know that

823
00:40:01,010 --> 00:40:02,960
these are bad guys alright this is not

824
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,850
some ready to go to the pool three

825
00:40:04,850 --> 00:40:08,450
sophomores nope this is from specific

826
00:40:08,450 --> 00:40:10,700
forum in specific language used for

827
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:13,130
specific people that I know just again I

828
00:40:13,130 --> 00:40:15,530
pull that the intelligence arm sore

829
00:40:15,530 --> 00:40:18,290
today uncorrelated into the context that

830
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:21,170
makes intelligence for me so that's a

831
00:40:21,170 --> 00:40:24,020
great example of getting an alert that

832
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:26,780
says but someone just downloaded this

833
00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:31,790
from there on ask your lawyer all right

834
00:40:31,790 --> 00:40:35,360
a little here in heaven find a way to

835
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:40,610
use this opportunity and to the right

836
00:40:40,610 --> 00:40:42,560
everyone again you'll get it too

837
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:46,070
definitely my thing of I'm glad fat for

838
00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:49,040
it what how do i act without alerting my

839
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:49,680
attacker

840
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,569
I know what they're doing and so on so

841
00:40:51,569 --> 00:40:54,960
forth critical alright this is not a

842
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:58,349
one-shot game as I alluded to in the

843
00:40:58,349 --> 00:41:00,750
beginning threat Intel comes into play

844
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:04,309
to provide feedback to enrich your

845
00:41:04,309 --> 00:41:07,410
thread pod I on time boring we're

846
00:41:07,410 --> 00:41:08,940
talking threat models and not some fancy

847
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:11,819
that's what book your home but I

848
00:41:11,819 --> 00:41:15,410
actually something that show the value

849
00:41:15,410 --> 00:41:19,319
in a defensive practice of how you are

850
00:41:19,319 --> 00:41:21,809
increasing your resilience how you're

851
00:41:21,809 --> 00:41:24,000
reducing your risk so the feedback loop

852
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,700
is critical after every event after

853
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:31,319
every alert after every step of the way

854
00:41:31,319 --> 00:41:35,010
of practicing threat intelligence you

855
00:41:35,010 --> 00:41:36,210
need to make sure that we have that

856
00:41:36,210 --> 00:41:38,250
feedback loop that could enrich and

857
00:41:38,250 --> 00:41:40,260
actually change your threat model

858
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:41,940
because that's going to change the way

859
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:44,880
of how you collect intelligence and how

860
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,559
you handle is it them how you adapted

861
00:41:46,559 --> 00:41:50,160
back to your specific context they make

862
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:51,630
sure that you have it don't have

863
00:41:51,630 --> 00:41:54,390
something like this all right where you

864
00:41:54,390 --> 00:41:57,410
start good for a bottle collection

865
00:41:57,410 --> 00:41:59,609
analysis and dissemination and then

866
00:41:59,609 --> 00:42:03,089
alerts and actives and you don't have

867
00:42:03,089 --> 00:42:06,990
those two red lines you map your process

868
00:42:06,990 --> 00:42:09,299
you're not doing anything good I mean

869
00:42:09,299 --> 00:42:11,099
you're just staying at that same point

870
00:42:11,099 --> 00:42:14,839
you're not you're not getting any better

871
00:42:14,839 --> 00:42:17,609
so the attackers by definition we're

872
00:42:17,609 --> 00:42:19,799
getting ahead of you in the running into

873
00:42:19,799 --> 00:42:20,880
you and that something's going to go

874
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:24,180
like in why aren't we getting better I

875
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:25,589
mean the first couple months with knives

876
00:42:25,589 --> 00:42:27,430
but I think

877
00:42:27,430 --> 00:42:30,200
our relationships were really going and

878
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:32,029
so you need to make sure that that

879
00:42:32,029 --> 00:42:35,329
feedback loop exists in order to retain

880
00:42:35,329 --> 00:42:38,809
that job hunting threat intelligence it

881
00:42:38,809 --> 00:42:41,329
could way to do that is to again get a

882
00:42:41,329 --> 00:42:46,400
system of men during my expected versus

883
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:49,640
observe all right this is where your

884
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:51,650
Freddie pilkinton all right I expect

885
00:42:51,650 --> 00:42:58,059
something to happen right an attack by X

886
00:42:58,269 --> 00:43:02,480
with a knife in the library but actually

887
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:08,119
it was by Y with a knife in the kitchen

888
00:43:08,119 --> 00:43:11,029
all right what is that a difference why

889
00:43:11,029 --> 00:43:13,609
did I get that perfect world everything

890
00:43:13,609 --> 00:43:15,499
you feel about bag online all right

891
00:43:15,499 --> 00:43:18,619
expected and observed would be snap-on

892
00:43:18,619 --> 00:43:21,859
together everything's fine right the

893
00:43:21,859 --> 00:43:25,130
green and the red our difference is

894
00:43:25,130 --> 00:43:26,660
between what I expected and what

895
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:30,499
actually happened analyze those products

896
00:43:30,499 --> 00:43:34,279
and what makes this again all right what

897
00:43:34,279 --> 00:43:37,130
did I do wrong and it's not really wrong

898
00:43:37,130 --> 00:43:39,559
or how can I do better that's time to

899
00:43:39,559 --> 00:43:42,819
minimize this all right and have the

900
00:43:42,819 --> 00:43:45,710
expected closer to what actually is

901
00:43:45,710 --> 00:43:48,619
being observed again create the tools

902
00:43:48,619 --> 00:43:53,029
and the measures to show that to show

903
00:43:53,029 --> 00:43:56,720
and two allies that over time if you're

904
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:58,579
not showing programs in terms of

905
00:43:58,579 --> 00:44:00,140
minimizing or getting those points

906
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:02,329
closer again you're not doing your life

907
00:44:02,329 --> 00:44:05,100
to make sure that these processes aren't

908
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:08,850
if you have st. the language the metrics

909
00:44:08,850 --> 00:44:10,650
whatever frameworks want to put around

910
00:44:10,650 --> 00:44:14,580
this measurements in in place so that

911
00:44:14,580 --> 00:44:17,910
you can fix your Freddie told practice

912
00:44:17,910 --> 00:44:21,930
later life and so quickly summarize what

913
00:44:21,930 --> 00:44:24,300
we went to resolve over time where's my

914
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:28,980
calendar still good for a minute I'm lot

915
00:44:28,980 --> 00:44:32,130
of time so first of all kinda fun all

916
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:35,580
right yeah it's true it's very tempting

917
00:44:35,580 --> 00:44:38,010
to go to any conferences yo freddie tell

918
00:44:38,010 --> 00:44:40,950
and they get free stuff and it was

919
00:44:40,950 --> 00:44:45,240
speaking in weird languages and they all

920
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:49,280
seem very professional athlete Bradford

921
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:53,520
birdies cut about a talk about how how

922
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:57,210
do you help me do my job it's a it's not

923
00:44:57,210 --> 00:45:00,570
really hard question all right and a lot

924
00:45:00,570 --> 00:45:02,480
of people are going to be stopped like

925
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:04,950
what do you paint provide threat

926
00:45:04,950 --> 00:45:07,700
intelligence you need running counselors

927
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:10,500
okay I'll ask again how does that help

928
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:14,790
me each other and the second question is

929
00:45:14,790 --> 00:45:18,330
is really how is that actionable what do

930
00:45:18,330 --> 00:45:21,360
I do with this alright if the answer is

931
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:24,870
no you plug into your firewall or sin or

932
00:45:24,870 --> 00:45:26,790
you're welcome to that oh you mean

933
00:45:26,790 --> 00:45:29,340
you're a signature provider that you

934
00:45:29,340 --> 00:45:31,260
talk oh you know what here's the phone

935
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:33,000
is the phone number for checkpoint and

936
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,640
not talk to them all right into the

937
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:36,990
signature so that when I use the

938
00:45:36,990 --> 00:45:39,180
products they're really now I'm doing

939
00:45:39,180 --> 00:45:41,790
again what do I do with this if it's not

940
00:45:41,790 --> 00:45:44,250
actionable it's not great intelligence

941
00:45:44,250 --> 00:45:46,420
all right I don't just want to

942
00:45:46,420 --> 00:45:50,440
about or not I love the example off

943
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:54,040
everyone freaked out after it due to we

944
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:55,930
have a signature for doing two weren't

945
00:45:55,930 --> 00:45:57,790
the first ones and have signatures

946
00:45:57,790 --> 00:46:00,339
particular to do you not even do the two

947
00:46:00,339 --> 00:46:08,710
targets they want though it's very scary

948
00:46:08,710 --> 00:46:10,990
lights the second version of doom to

949
00:46:10,990 --> 00:46:15,670
gluten targets as first it targets ad

950
00:46:15,670 --> 00:46:18,819
companies all right I don't give a

951
00:46:18,819 --> 00:46:21,190
about like great for you can have

952
00:46:21,190 --> 00:46:24,839
signature I don't need it all right if

953
00:46:24,839 --> 00:46:28,270
me is this all business he's concerned

954
00:46:28,270 --> 00:46:30,280
about do gluten I have bigger problems

955
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:33,339
that I think all right I'm not running

956
00:46:33,339 --> 00:46:34,809
though I don't need to deal with the

957
00:46:34,809 --> 00:46:39,190
birth mother and so again cuttlebug get

958
00:46:39,190 --> 00:46:42,790
action build yourself you know it's not

959
00:46:42,790 --> 00:46:46,059
a snot really rocket salad is one of my

960
00:46:46,059 --> 00:46:50,020
favorite twitter friend safe and but you

961
00:46:50,020 --> 00:46:53,290
do have to actually do work again I know

962
00:46:53,290 --> 00:46:55,270
it's kind of weird in our our world

963
00:46:55,270 --> 00:46:57,700
everything is notable and clickable

964
00:46:57,700 --> 00:47:00,160
there's nothing to naturally water and

965
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:02,530
that's why I spend a lot of time going

966
00:47:02,530 --> 00:47:05,079
through building a threat model in

967
00:47:05,079 --> 00:47:07,210
bridging it building a practice of I

968
00:47:07,210 --> 00:47:09,250
think intelligence analyzing and using

969
00:47:09,250 --> 00:47:12,309
pimp your own tools there is lots of

970
00:47:12,309 --> 00:47:15,579
free stuff very very usable they made

971
00:47:15,579 --> 00:47:17,380
all the shortcuts for you you just need

972
00:47:17,380 --> 00:47:19,690
to kind of assemble it together for your

973
00:47:19,690 --> 00:47:22,900
specific situation all right they told

974
00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:25,270
that's being sold and mass to a luck to

975
00:47:25,270 --> 00:47:27,910
everyone in every industry is probably

976
00:47:27,910 --> 00:47:31,270
not the perfect fit for you right unless

977
00:47:31,270 --> 00:47:32,130
it's a train

978
00:47:32,130 --> 00:47:34,890
you can adapt and use for you don't just

979
00:47:34,890 --> 00:47:38,460
apply to use and when you do and you

980
00:47:38,460 --> 00:47:41,970
want you identify an opportunity off I

981
00:47:41,970 --> 00:47:44,220
don't want to do this and I found a

982
00:47:44,220 --> 00:47:46,830
bender who can that's where you can

983
00:47:46,830 --> 00:47:48,720
start throwing Anya all right not

984
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:51,750
negating any blinky lights to say if I

985
00:47:51,750 --> 00:47:54,600
think oh I need a big screen in our soft

986
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:59,070
rock whatever days ago all right

987
00:47:59,070 --> 00:48:01,200
identified opportunity to throw iowa

988
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:03,090
where you need it it's like I don't want

989
00:48:03,090 --> 00:48:05,760
to hire more people to do this these

990
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:09,630
guys do it and get it for cheaper that's

991
00:48:09,630 --> 00:48:10,740
where you throw on this love business

992
00:48:10,740 --> 00:48:13,920
one of them I'm sorry forfor bringing

993
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:18,720
the business people that's about it hey

994
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:21,210
I think we covered everything this if

995
00:48:21,210 --> 00:48:23,700
there's anything any slight as you see

996
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:26,880
with you from from this 48 minutes of

997
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:29,550
blabbering is this is making sure that

998
00:48:29,550 --> 00:48:31,700
you've got it agreeing one of those

999
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:35,490
boxes checked okay you know a lot of us

1000
00:48:35,490 --> 00:48:37,710
especially federal science already loves

1001
00:48:37,710 --> 00:48:40,080
a love to check boxes to check all the

1002
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:43,890
boxes make sure it we're connected and

1003
00:48:43,890 --> 00:48:46,440
then we should be fine and we have a

1004
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:47,910
couple minutes for questions if you have

1005
00:48:47,910 --> 00:48:55,680
any communist a true yes sir in that

1006
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:59,509
you're going to be really shout out

1007
00:49:21,690 --> 00:49:26,000
so the question is how do I measure the

1008
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,900
effects of different attackers in

1009
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:32,420
different organizations or in a group

1010
00:49:34,670 --> 00:49:42,180
the model is simple guess why are we not

1011
00:49:42,180 --> 00:49:46,940
using models that are simple enough work

1012
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:52,500
I'm trying not to be too jaded

1013
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:56,100
depressing guy that says you know I

1014
00:49:56,100 --> 00:49:58,380
talked to Jack anthem all right jack is

1015
00:49:58,380 --> 00:50:01,170
got a phenomenal talk right well Sam

1016
00:50:01,170 --> 00:50:02,790
much all those openings for sick time to

1017
00:50:02,790 --> 00:50:06,120
calm down let me give you a hint most of

1018
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:07,950
the ship we're dealing with now has been

1019
00:50:07,950 --> 00:50:11,820
stalled 30 years ago why are we not

1020
00:50:11,820 --> 00:50:13,860
doing it I don't know we keep learning

1021
00:50:13,860 --> 00:50:16,710
and keep teaching ourselves I go Oscar

1022
00:50:16,710 --> 00:50:19,110
started working with my college students

1023
00:50:19,110 --> 00:50:22,530
and one like the resolving problems that

1024
00:50:22,530 --> 00:50:25,140
we have that I sold as a college student

1025
00:50:25,140 --> 00:50:28,290
all right there I'm seeing master's

1026
00:50:28,290 --> 00:50:32,430
thesis on problems that I would solve

1027
00:50:32,430 --> 00:50:35,700
and provided code for five years ago

1028
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:38,870
we're not really good that this whole

1029
00:50:38,870 --> 00:50:43,260
intelligence that yes I don't know I

1030
00:50:43,260 --> 00:50:45,300
don't have an answer for you I really

1031
00:50:45,300 --> 00:50:47,970
don't mind I'm trying to be positive

1032
00:50:47,970 --> 00:50:50,330
here

1033
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:53,640
it's not selling its practicing it's

1034
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:56,520
practicing again it's and the problem is

1035
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:58,350
I think a lot of times people are

1036
00:50:58,350 --> 00:51:00,660
looking for that who's going to sell me

1037
00:51:00,660 --> 00:51:04,080
that all right it's the easy check box

1038
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:07,830
approach of booby threading to who do i

1039
00:51:07,830 --> 00:51:10,110
buy that for any more fun I think that's

1040
00:51:10,110 --> 00:51:14,580
the root of the problems but we can we

1041
00:51:14,580 --> 00:51:18,030
just meet up for drinks anyone else one

1042
00:51:18,030 --> 00:51:22,730
of our dreams yes you're the bike rack

1043
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,610
is there a significant impact and threat

1044
00:51:33,610 --> 00:51:36,660
prevention from industry best practice

1045
00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:40,930
and I think we're slowly getting away

1046
00:51:40,930 --> 00:51:44,860
again this is the optimist in and we're

1047
00:51:44,860 --> 00:51:47,350
seeing standards such as V test which

1048
00:51:47,350 --> 00:51:49,510
again unjaded I'm biased because I

1049
00:51:49,510 --> 00:51:52,990
loaded get an adoptive into PCI who

1050
00:51:52,990 --> 00:51:55,300
would have thought pci we have something

1051
00:51:55,300 --> 00:51:58,510
relevant person here so we're getting

1052
00:51:58,510 --> 00:52:00,640
there you know we're forcing people to

1053
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:03,190
adopt the best practices i hate the word

1054
00:52:03,190 --> 00:52:05,310
best practices because they're not best

1055
00:52:05,310 --> 00:52:08,610
for you all right their best or like

1056
00:52:08,610 --> 00:52:12,970
john toes and everyone else alright so

1057
00:52:12,970 --> 00:52:15,810
that's time that you need to get this hi

1058
00:52:15,810 --> 00:52:19,300
alright to ride the eCos that thing so

1059
00:52:19,300 --> 00:52:20,800
that's the best practice you want to

1060
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:23,230
really practice cardiello little better

1061
00:52:23,230 --> 00:52:26,440
but again it's getting us past those

1062
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:30,250
stupid hurdles and so we're not just

1063
00:52:30,250 --> 00:52:33,630
just completely failing you know kind of

1064
00:52:33,630 --> 00:52:40,720
the nights with no hands and so we're

1065
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:43,380
gonna got out of that falls

1066
00:52:43,380 --> 00:52:46,360
unfortunately again best practices are

1067
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:52,320
not really conference yeah

1068
00:52:57,960 --> 00:53:04,900
and if so it pretty much and are not

1069
00:53:04,900 --> 00:53:06,579
going to awkward the question was are

1070
00:53:06,579 --> 00:53:10,079
threatening competitors basically

1071
00:53:10,079 --> 00:53:12,970
perpetuating the problem a dancer is

1072
00:53:12,970 --> 00:53:18,369
actually kind of yes right they we as an

1073
00:53:18,369 --> 00:53:20,859
industry and founded new topic to deal

1074
00:53:20,859 --> 00:53:25,029
with and as a nurse myself included like

1075
00:53:25,029 --> 00:53:26,980
oh I can have a great product in this

1076
00:53:26,980 --> 00:53:29,829
line of business and how tangible holder

1077
00:53:29,829 --> 00:53:33,579
and I am and yes they've done that and

1078
00:53:33,579 --> 00:53:35,380
they're like oh I'm everything to lie

1079
00:53:35,380 --> 00:53:37,680
are threaded on they're all but

1080
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:41,109
recently and I just posted like a link

1081
00:53:41,109 --> 00:53:44,019
on twitter this morning you can see them

1082
00:53:44,019 --> 00:53:46,869
starting to understand that if they're

1083
00:53:46,869 --> 00:53:50,319
not in your specific context they're not

1084
00:53:50,319 --> 00:53:52,720
really relevant and we're starting to

1085
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:56,759
adopt this kind of way of thinking and

1086
00:53:56,759 --> 00:53:58,989
methodology on the same practice and

1087
00:53:58,989 --> 00:54:01,930
saying you know this is how we can fit

1088
00:54:01,930 --> 00:54:04,630
into your threat model gradually same

1089
00:54:04,630 --> 00:54:07,059
print model under saying failure again

1090
00:54:07,059 --> 00:54:09,849
which is one of my favorite Fred oddly

1091
00:54:09,849 --> 00:54:12,640
frameworks inter saying this is how we

1092
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:18,190
can enrich very specifically elements of

1093
00:54:18,190 --> 00:54:21,519
your thread Bob fair headlock is famous

1094
00:54:21,519 --> 00:54:24,160
tree of how they factor in Brisbane is a

1095
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:27,160
visit this and that can enrich by our

1096
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:28,989
friend Calvin so they're getting their

1097
00:54:28,989 --> 00:54:31,660
first outcomes man met about

1098
00:54:31,660 --> 00:54:33,609
four or five of our research adoption

1099
00:54:33,609 --> 00:54:36,549
chart they're realizing they're not

1100
00:54:36,549 --> 00:54:38,280
really selling as well

1101
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:40,110
now maybe they sorted out to do

1102
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:44,340
something more actual rock it up all

1103
00:54:44,340 --> 00:54:49,080
right thank you for one second st yes

1104
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:51,529
thank you
