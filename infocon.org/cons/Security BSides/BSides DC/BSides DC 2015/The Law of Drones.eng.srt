1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:04,640
good afternoon everybody over there

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:07,710
finance my cashier go by the present I

3
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:10,889
Diego and talk to you about trouble what

4
00:00:10,889 --> 00:00:13,200
is wrong mama who knows there's really

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,759
no there's really very little

6
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:17,100
developments in this area yet it's

7
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,289
coming and it's coming real soon and so

8
00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:21,359
I'm going to talk to you about a little

9
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:23,250
bit about drones from the perspective

10
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:25,980
from the legal perspective we'll talk a

11
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:29,039
little bit about what drones are being

12
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:31,349
used for now what they are anticipated

13
00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:33,600
to be used for and how the government's

14
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,760
trying to get involved all sorts of

15
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,120
issues to be interesting to remember so

16
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,200
let's say a little bit about myself I

17
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,789
spent nine years the United States Navy

18
00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:47,160
as a naval flight officer doing

19
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,829
electronic communications and jamming

20
00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:53,730
you to give me a 60 powder you ever go

21
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:55,739
to an airshow probably going to air show

22
00:00:55,739 --> 00:00:57,989
you get to climb in flames see something

23
00:00:57,989 --> 00:00:59,730
that's yellow and black like this handle

24
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:04,549
on the top of my head don't pull that

25
00:01:04,549 --> 00:01:07,290
that's an ejection handle instead of

26
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:09,360
sitting in a rocket-powered ejection

27
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,369
seat and the kit and then in this

28
00:01:11,369 --> 00:01:13,409
aircraft if I pulled that handle the

29
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:15,030
canopy doesn't go away I go through the

30
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:20,759
campaign so abhinav a fourth-year TV

31
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:21,990
wall student at the University of

32
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:25,200
Maryland he graduated in May and I

33
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,159
currently work full-time for

34
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:28,359
joking contractor for Booz Allen

35
00:01:28,359 --> 00:01:34,119
Hamilton so that's my credentials and

36
00:01:34,119 --> 00:01:36,759
next time I tell you about why you

37
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:38,549
should be skeptical of the things I said

38
00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:41,439
this is a slide that I really try to

39
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:44,109
include all the time when I talk because

40
00:01:44,109 --> 00:01:45,520
I think I know what I'm talking about

41
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,909
but maybe I don't maybe maybe you in one

42
00:01:48,909 --> 00:01:50,679
area of one thing that I talked about

43
00:01:50,679 --> 00:01:52,659
maybe you know more than me so call me

44
00:01:52,659 --> 00:01:55,000
on it or look at the original research

45
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,849
and come to your own conclusions first

46
00:01:57,849 --> 00:02:00,189
of all I'm not aware yet I don't

47
00:02:00,189 --> 00:02:04,840
graduate till May and even then doesn't

48
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:07,000
mean I'm an expert on drone law but I

49
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,649
think I know a little bit about it so I

50
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:17,739
want to talk about terminology you'll

51
00:02:17,739 --> 00:02:19,780
hear lots of different terms for for

52
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:21,700
what we were what I'm going to refer to

53
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:22,989
as drones for the purposes of this

54
00:02:22,989 --> 00:02:25,930
presentation I use drones but really

55
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:27,609
these are terms that people have

56
00:02:27,609 --> 00:02:30,209
proposed or people have talked about

57
00:02:30,209 --> 00:02:33,400
through what to call drones and even

58
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,319
within the drone community people

59
00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:39,430
there's a this ongoing long long held

60
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:42,639
fight about what to call drones and the

61
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:44,230
first one is drone and a lot of people

62
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:45,669
don't like it because when you think of

63
00:02:45,669 --> 00:02:47,349
drones you're thinking of some

64
00:02:47,349 --> 00:02:50,590
terrorists in Yemen being hit by a drone

65
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:53,200
strike by the CIA or something like that

66
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,329
and so that's it has a negative

67
00:02:55,329 --> 00:02:57,099
connotation associated to it so when

68
00:02:57,099 --> 00:02:58,870
people think I don't want to call this a

69
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:00,609
drone because it has that negative

70
00:03:00,609 --> 00:03:03,790
accommodation all of these are things

71
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:06,190
that people might call them Kron like

72
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:09,690
commercial drone that's just dumb

73
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:12,220
unmanned aerial vehicle unmanned aerial

74
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:15,579
system small unmanned aerial system

75
00:03:15,579 --> 00:03:18,400
quadcopter multicopter remote piloted

76
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,040
aircraft a remote piloted vehicle remote

77
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,079
piloted aircraft system unmanned

78
00:03:23,079 --> 00:03:26,410
aircraft model aircraft robot and Skynet

79
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:28,269
well nobody calls it Skynet but i just

80
00:03:28,269 --> 00:03:31,419
added that because it's kind of for the

81
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:33,370
purposes of this presentation i'm going

82
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:35,019
to call it a drone but if you want to

83
00:03:35,019 --> 00:03:37,600
call it something else go for it the FAA

84
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,030
typically uses unmanned aerial system or

85
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:41,140
small and material

86
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:42,910
system but the European Union engine

87
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:45,400
uses remote piloted aircraft so I mean

88
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:48,670
everybody has their own terms and some

89
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:50,050
of them encompass more things than the

90
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:54,819
others but so there you go I want to

91
00:03:54,819 --> 00:03:56,800
talk a little bit about history because

92
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,650
the history on development of aviation

93
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:01,690
law is really important to the history

94
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:04,330
or to the current development of drones

95
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:06,239
and I know what you're all thinking

96
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:08,530
somewhere in this slides am I going to

97
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:10,030
talk about if there's a drone flying

98
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:11,739
over your backyard can you shoot it down

99
00:04:11,739 --> 00:04:15,640
I will answer that question for you but

100
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:21,608
not quite yet so there's an old common

101
00:04:21,608 --> 00:04:23,800
law doctrine called odd Coulomb it's

102
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,260
there's the latin phrase and it

103
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:28,600
translates to who's ever in the soil it

104
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,370
is there's all the way to the heaven and

105
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:32,169
all the way to hell and what this meant

106
00:04:32,169 --> 00:04:35,020
was if you owned land if there was

107
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:36,910
something under the land like minerals

108
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:39,700
or oil or whatever that was you're right

109
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:44,020
so if you live in Pennsylvania and the

110
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:45,790
Marcellus Shale is underneath you and

111
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:46,919
there's a whole lot of natural gas

112
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:49,240
someone can't come in to you and just

113
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,430
take the natural gas out of the ground

114
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:54,250
they have to sign up you own it you own

115
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:56,500
the rights to that so you can sign a

116
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,120
contract so that they can take the

117
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:02,229
natural gas out of the ground and up

118
00:05:02,229 --> 00:05:04,419
until the development of aviation this

119
00:05:04,419 --> 00:05:05,740
meant the other the opposite was true

120
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:07,810
everything above your property belonged

121
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:10,330
to you well of course until this started

122
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:12,610
happening at the turn of the 18th

123
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:15,370
century people started flying hot air

124
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:17,440
balloons so you could fly above someone

125
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,390
else's property and then at the turn of

126
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:21,580
the 19th or the 20th century people

127
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:23,260
started flying and again now you could

128
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:25,330
have controlled aircraft above someone's

129
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:27,340
property so this idea that you owned

130
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:29,260
everything above and below your property

131
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:31,120
really started to come in conflict with

132
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,070
eight with with aviation and the

133
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:37,960
burgeoning industry there is one famous

134
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:41,260
case that dealt with this that went to

135
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:44,440
the Supreme Court this is in right after

136
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,940
World War two but it was the case that

137
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:48,220
came out of World War two there's a guy

138
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:50,050
named Cosby he know the chicken farm in

139
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:52,240
North Carolina and write it right

140
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,120
adjacent to his property was an

141
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,080
the airfield and they were doing

142
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,600
training flights all the time and so

143
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,240
they were flying low there every time

144
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,560
they're coming into land or take off

145
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,970
their flying right over this guy's

146
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:04,860
chicken farm and you can imagine you

147
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:07,199
have a chicken farm loud all these

148
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,360
airplanes taking off his chickens did

149
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,430
not take too lightly so these aircraft

150
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:13,650
flying over so he sued the United States

151
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:15,810
government then basically said you are

152
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:18,470
violating my property by flying over it

153
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:21,210
so the Supreme Court referring to the ad

154
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:23,220
colum doctrine said well that doctrine

155
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:24,870
has no place in the modern world they're

156
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:27,090
sort of acknowledging the fact that you

157
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:28,770
can't just Pro can't prohibit people

158
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:31,560
from flying over your property but they

159
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:35,130
did say that they were flying solo 83

160
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:37,410
feet over his property that they were

161
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:39,419
essentially taking his property so the

162
00:06:39,419 --> 00:06:40,740
government had to compensate him for

163
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:44,070
doing this and the theory that came out

164
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:46,949
of this case was called the enveloping

165
00:06:46,949 --> 00:06:49,010
atmosphere and what this means is that

166
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:51,570
you have the right to the airspace above

167
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:53,970
your property to the extent that you

168
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:57,630
actively use it so for example if you

169
00:06:57,630 --> 00:07:00,570
have a two-story home and maybe you have

170
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:04,169
a 20-foot antenna on your roof that's

171
00:07:04,169 --> 00:07:06,030
that's essentially the extent of the

172
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:09,050
property the airspace that you're using

173
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:13,139
so if someone wants to fly a police

174
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:15,210
helicopter at 500 feet over your

175
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:16,889
property they can probably do that

176
00:07:16,889 --> 00:07:18,570
without violating your property rights

177
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:22,919
or a blimp or a drone or whatever don't

178
00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:24,810
get caught up on the 83 feet that's the

179
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:27,060
number in this case but the idea is the

180
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:29,490
atmosphere or the airspace that you're

181
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:33,479
able to use on an active basis and I

182
00:07:33,479 --> 00:07:34,680
know what you're all thinking well if I

183
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,300
just put a huge tower up in my backyard

184
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:39,090
500 feet tall then nobody will be able

185
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:41,910
to fly 500 feet oh you there's probably

186
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:47,340
other problems with that too or hmm what

187
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:49,440
if I make a daily drone flight to 500

188
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,090
feet over the extent all the four

189
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:52,320
corners of my property then i'm using

190
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:55,229
maybe maybe nobody really knows the

191
00:07:55,229 --> 00:07:56,550
answers to these questions yet because

192
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:57,960
they haven't been litigated and we'll

193
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,229
get to that

194
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:05,630
there you go he said what he said is you

195
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:06,800
know send up a weather balloon with a

196
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,750
camera surveillance of your property 500

197
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:11,540
feet again who knows whether you can do

198
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:15,320
it and get away but I don't know so very

199
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:18,290
brief history of aviation and and the

200
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:20,330
airspace over your property and airspace

201
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:22,700
I want to talk about the National

202
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:25,810
Airspace System that is run by the FAA

203
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:28,040
obviously this is focused on the United

204
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,750
States but other countries will have

205
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:32,120
similar authorities and similar laws and

206
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:35,809
restrictions so the airspace in the

207
00:08:35,809 --> 00:08:38,059
United States is broken up into various

208
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:41,270
classes and the ones that we want to

209
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:44,720
concentrate on today our class b which

210
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,280
is the big yellow one looks like an

211
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,620
upside-down wedding cake and when you

212
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:50,990
think of Class B airspace think busy

213
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:56,720
airports so Dulles bwi Reagan National

214
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,850
all the busy airports around the country

215
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:02,240
will have some variation of this Class B

216
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,300
airspace and essentially what it means

217
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:08,450
is right around the airport up to a

218
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:10,310
certain distance and out to a certain

219
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:12,620
distance everything within that yellow

220
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:14,839
birthday cake or wedding cake is

221
00:09:14,839 --> 00:09:16,940
controlled airspace if you're flying in

222
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:18,290
it you got to be talking to somebody on

223
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:21,589
the radio smaller airports might have

224
00:09:21,589 --> 00:09:24,110
class c or class d airspace and then

225
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:27,110
everything over 18,000 feet is class a

226
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:28,430
airspace and that's where all your

227
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:30,440
airlines are flying they're usually

228
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:35,410
flying 35 35,000 feet if you are in

229
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:38,690
Class G airspace which is generally up

230
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:40,130
to about 500 feet above the ground

231
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:43,820
that's uncontrolled so you can do pretty

232
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:45,230
much whatever you want in that airspace

233
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:48,740
you'll see test aircraft people but that

234
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:50,390
build their own aircraft flying in those

235
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:53,870
altitudes not a lot going on other than

236
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:56,360
transitions so the important thing to

237
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:58,550
remember from this slide is when you're

238
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:00,470
in the area of an airport or within a

239
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:02,240
certain distance from an airport you

240
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,620
can't just do whatever you want

241
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:09,490
so where is it where does the authority

242
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:12,880
of the FAA go how high to how low well

243
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,800
the FAA would say it go there their

244
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,890
authority goes all the way to the ground

245
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:23,649
so if I want to fly this guy just

246
00:10:23,649 --> 00:10:25,180
doesn't have a camera on but it is a

247
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:28,839
drone it flies the FAA says that they

248
00:10:28,839 --> 00:10:30,370
would have the authority to regulate me

249
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:37,480
doing that maybe so just as an example

250
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:41,110
i'm going to show you this is a flying

251
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:42,550
chart and i'm going to show you the air

252
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:44,740
an example of what the airspace looks

253
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:47,350
like over bwi airport which is where i

254
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:50,110
live so you see the airport in the top

255
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:58,810
left there and the numbers inside the

256
00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:01,690
concentric circles will show you what

257
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:04,390
the airspace restrictions are so in the

258
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:07,450
innermost circle surface at you see 100

259
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:11,459
and then a line and then sfc right here

260
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,829
that means from the surface to 10,000

261
00:11:14,829 --> 00:11:18,459
feet is controlled and then then 10,000

262
00:11:18,459 --> 00:11:22,270
feet or 1,500 feet to a thousand 2,500

263
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:26,079
to 10,000 3500 to 10,000 so as you get

264
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,270
further away from the airport the lower

265
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:30,040
air space is free because there's no

266
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,750
there's nobody using that airspace

267
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:34,350
control

268
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:44,900
so after 911 so you can see the BW iris

269
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:50,150
there are three major airports in this

270
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:53,090
area Dulles Reagan National and bwi and

271
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:57,500
after 911 the FAA established a the DC

272
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,300
area flight restricted zone this is a

273
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:03,500
temporary flight restriction for 14

274
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:08,720
years and anything that's inside the red

275
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,300
line is inside the flight restricted

276
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:14,200
zone and you cannot fly there without

277
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:18,020
permit out permission or talking to

278
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:20,140
someone on the radio from the FAA and

279
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:26,000
that goes out I think 25 miles so it's a

280
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,150
pretty big area so I live in south of

281
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:31,790
Baltimore and I live under this area so

282
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:34,820
theoretically by the letter of the law I

283
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:36,530
can't fly a drone at my house because I

284
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:38,600
might be a threat to the White House or

285
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:41,210
something I don't know this is the

286
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:43,040
current picture I mean this is what it

287
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:47,290
looks like we'll talk more about this I

288
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:51,290
want to talk now about the current state

289
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:53,210
of the law so what we talked a little

290
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:55,280
bit about the history we talked about

291
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,470
the development of aviation law and how

292
00:12:57,470 --> 00:12:59,990
that impacts what we're doing we talked

293
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:04,940
about what the airspace system look

294
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:06,560
likes so let's talk about the

295
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,690
integration of drones into the National

296
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:13,310
Airspace System so in 2012.the the

297
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:14,900
congress passed what's called the effort

298
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:18,700
at faa modernization and reform act and

299
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:21,760
the law actually had a section it about

300
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,100
drones which they refer to as unmanned

301
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:29,450
aerial systems and they put in a place

302
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:31,220
of temporary rules which are in place

303
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:33,380
now and the temporary rules are

304
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:36,260
essentially this if you want to fly a

305
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:40,160
drone for Hobby purposes you can do it

306
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,530
there's some guidelines which I'll show

307
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:46,070
you in a second but you can do it if you

308
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:47,690
want to fly a drone for commercial

309
00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:49,460
purposes like say you're a real estate

310
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:51,080
agent and you want to show you want to

311
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,400
use your drone to get video of the

312
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,570
property

313
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:55,220
or let's say that you're a wedding

314
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:57,560
photographer or let's say that you get

315
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,480
hired by a golf course to do flyovers to

316
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,070
the holes so that you can so they'll

317
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:03,140
have to hire a helicopter all those are

318
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:05,090
commercial uses and those are prohibited

319
00:14:05,090 --> 00:14:08,000
without with without an exception from

320
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,890
the FAA so that's what the law says and

321
00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:16,280
so the FAA put out a circular in 1981

322
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:18,590
this is before drones but this is mamata

323
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:20,330
this applied to model aircraft and they

324
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:22,010
consider drones to be very similar to

325
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:24,650
model aircraft and they said if these

326
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:26,420
these are the rules but these were the

327
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:29,530
rules from 1981 until about a month ago

328
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:32,240
if you're doing it for hobby or

329
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,960
recreational use you stand or 400 feet

330
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,950
notify a tower when you're operating

331
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:39,100
within three miles of the airport

332
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:42,170
important to note notify the tower not

333
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:43,550
you don't have to get permission you

334
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:45,950
just have to notify them and then you

335
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:47,870
have to follow community based God

336
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:50,360
safety guidelines and there's at the AMA

337
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,830
and there's some organizations out there

338
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:54,500
for from model aircraft and drone pilots

339
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,340
that have come up with their own

340
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:57,140
guidelines about how you should fly and

341
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:59,570
this is so this is what the FAA says you

342
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:01,490
should do if you want to be a hobby

343
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:06,290
drone user so about a month ago they

344
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:09,500
revised the circular and that the only

345
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:12,230
thing really that they did was they

346
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:14,270
changed it from three miles 25 miles and

347
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:19,220
then they stressed in the in a circular

348
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:22,220
that even though we kind of let you do

349
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:24,530
whatever you want if you if you fly in a

350
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:26,480
dangerous manner the FAA can still bring

351
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,790
an enforcement action in it enforcement

352
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:32,750
action against you and to date there's

353
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:34,910
really only one significant case that

354
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:36,650
I'll talk about where the FAA brought an

355
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:38,570
enforcement action against somebody for

356
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:39,860
flying a drone and we'll talk about that

357
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:42,950
in a few slides this is the current

358
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:46,310
state of the law for drones hobby or

359
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:48,260
recreational use under four feet within

360
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:52,850
five miles safety guidelines when the

361
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:55,670
government salute the government we

362
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:57,650
talked about how the commercial use was

363
00:15:57,650 --> 00:16:00,230
a temporary thing that's in place and

364
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:02,150
that's temporary until the government

365
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:04,070
comes out with a rule when the

366
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:05,540
government wants to make a rule they

367
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:07,279
have to do a proposed rule

368
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:09,319
and so they publish it on regulations

369
00:16:09,319 --> 00:16:12,889
gov and then people you me anybody can

370
00:16:12,889 --> 00:16:14,680
go and make comments on the rule and

371
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:17,149
many of these new regulations now get

372
00:16:17,149 --> 00:16:21,139
thousands of comments and they it closed

373
00:16:21,139 --> 00:16:23,629
in April but the rule with the summary

374
00:16:23,629 --> 00:16:26,300
of the rule was this it only applied to

375
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:28,730
commercial uses so the again the Hobby

376
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:33,740
drone use was okay the current rules

377
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:36,319
before this proposed rule was to fly a

378
00:16:36,319 --> 00:16:38,089
drone for commercial uses you had to

379
00:16:38,089 --> 00:16:40,129
have a private pilot's license seems a

380
00:16:40,129 --> 00:16:43,910
little odd the proposed rule would

381
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:45,559
require that you don't have to have a

382
00:16:45,559 --> 00:16:46,999
private pilot's license but you would

383
00:16:46,999 --> 00:16:48,769
have to do pass like a written test

384
00:16:48,769 --> 00:16:50,689
about learning about the airspace and

385
00:16:50,689 --> 00:16:54,319
things like that under 500 feet and 100

386
00:16:54,319 --> 00:16:56,389
miles an hour line of sight and only

387
00:16:56,389 --> 00:16:58,160
during the day and you can see someone

388
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,660
like Amazon coms gonna have a lot of

389
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:01,399
problems with this right they want to

390
00:17:01,399 --> 00:17:03,410
use drones to deliver packages to your

391
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:05,390
house well they can't do that with line

392
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:07,039
of sight and daytime restrictions it's

393
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:08,809
just not going to work for them so

394
00:17:08,809 --> 00:17:10,939
Amazon and other companies or about

395
00:17:10,939 --> 00:17:12,020
doing most of their drone testing

396
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:13,640
outside of the United States because of

397
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:17,299
the current regulatory environment so

398
00:17:17,299 --> 00:17:18,799
this is the proposed rule would probably

399
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:20,689
come out sometime next year as a final

400
00:17:20,689 --> 00:17:22,730
rule and then when it's published in the

401
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:26,140
Federal Register it will be the rule I

402
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:29,110
mentioned a few minutes ago about

403
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:32,929
there's really just one case that's been

404
00:17:32,929 --> 00:17:36,830
litigated and there's a guy named

405
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:38,600
Raphael pirker he was hired by the

406
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,570
university of virginia i believe to fly

407
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:42,919
a drone over their campus and take

408
00:17:42,919 --> 00:17:45,440
pictures and videos for their for one of

409
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,700
their publications or something like

410
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:51,380
that and he was flying over the campus

411
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:53,780
and at some point he either flu too low

412
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:55,490
or he scared somebody I don't know

413
00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:58,010
whatever happened so somebody complained

414
00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:02,870
and the case really came down to whether

415
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:04,909
is drone is an aircraft and the reason

416
00:18:04,909 --> 00:18:07,630
this is important is because the FAA

417
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:09,919
defines what aircraft is and if

418
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:11,659
someone's not something is not an

419
00:18:11,659 --> 00:18:13,100
aircraft then the FAA doesn't have

420
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:17,570
authority or jurisdiction over it so my

421
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:19,399
mouse is not an aircraft so the FAA

422
00:18:19,399 --> 00:18:21,620
cannot just regulate mouse

423
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:23,480
mice because they want to they had can

424
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:27,770
only regulate aircraft so the FAA

425
00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:29,360
brought an enforcement action against

426
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,750
him and they ruled against him and then

427
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:34,700
he appealed it and the case goes to an

428
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:36,290
administrative law judge within the FAA

429
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:38,780
and they reversed the case and then the

430
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:40,160
National Transportation Safety Board

431
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,480
which is the next level of Appeal

432
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:43,670
reverse the case again against him and

433
00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:47,720
then before going to an actual article 3

434
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:51,230
court the case was settled so they tried

435
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:52,340
to make him pay of ten thousand dollar

436
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:53,480
fine he ended up paying a

437
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:56,390
thousand-dollar fine the important thing

438
00:18:56,390 --> 00:18:59,600
to remember here is that all of this

439
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,000
took place within the administrative law

440
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,030
context so no this case never actually

441
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:07,550
reached an article 3 court when I say

442
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:10,370
article 3 chord I mean a judicial branch

443
00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:13,490
court federal court or state court or

444
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:17,030
whatever so this case is interesting but

445
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:18,890
whether this is certainly not the final

446
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:21,200
word on whether a drone is an aircraft

447
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,059
but this is really the only significant

448
00:19:23,059 --> 00:19:28,250
case that's been brought so far and i

449
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,340
had my presentation done until yesterday

450
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:34,490
I read about this and it sounds like the

451
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:36,620
department of transportation which is

452
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:40,160
overhead of the FAA is proposing a and

453
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,240
they'll probably come out with this on

454
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,760
Monday this with the rumor in national

455
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,670
drone registry which whereas when you

456
00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:48,290
buy a drone you're going to have to

457
00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:49,640
register with the federal government

458
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:54,860
which seems a little much maybe register

459
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:58,030
your drone with the federal government

460
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,809
obviously they don't they're probably

461
00:19:59,809 --> 00:20:02,809
don't care about toys but if you have

462
00:20:02,809 --> 00:20:05,390
like a larger drone like a DJI phantom

463
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:07,700
which I have then they're going to want

464
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:09,740
those registered so keep in mind that

465
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:12,130
even though the FAA has authority over

466
00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:14,570
automobiles automobiles aren't

467
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:15,890
registered at the national level the

468
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:18,920
registered at the state level all sorts

469
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,240
of things are not registered at the

470
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,300
state law at the federal level yet the

471
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:25,280
FAA or the and the department

472
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,660
transportation is going to propose this

473
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:28,370
so this be really interesting I think

474
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:30,910
there's gonna be a lot of pushback

475
00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:33,350
against this rule and when it comes out

476
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:35,070
on if it comes out on Monday I think

477
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:38,429
see a lot of pushback I will be one of

478
00:20:38,429 --> 00:20:45,720
those pushing back yeah I'm so there

479
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,429
will be some kind of registration fee of

480
00:20:47,429 --> 00:20:52,860
course and you know so I want to talk

481
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:54,240
about some of the things you may have

482
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:58,700
seen in the news recently on drones and

483
00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:01,590
talk about their applicability and then

484
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:08,039
we'll just this is a DJI phantom the one

485
00:21:08,039 --> 00:21:09,509
that crossed on the white I crashed on

486
00:21:09,509 --> 00:21:12,110
the White House lawn in the spring so

487
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:13,950
most of you have heard of this case

488
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:17,850
probably so a guy goes to a party the

489
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:19,350
guy is a government employee by the way

490
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:25,019
goes to a party he's drunk and it's not

491
00:21:25,019 --> 00:21:26,850
his drone is it's his buddies drone and

492
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:28,590
he says hey man could I fly a drone of

493
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:29,730
course and it's one of those you know

494
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:32,460
hey watch this you know or hold my beer

495
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:37,889
you know flies the drone around

496
00:21:37,889 --> 00:21:40,440
Washington DC not to feel about three

497
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:42,769
ball three or four blocks from here and

498
00:21:42,769 --> 00:21:47,629
somehow loses control of the drone and

499
00:21:47,629 --> 00:21:50,519
doesn't think anything of it wakes up

500
00:21:50,519 --> 00:21:52,230
the next morning and sees that someone

501
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:53,429
crashed a drone on the White House lawn

502
00:21:53,429 --> 00:21:58,529
and so he owns up to it he said I think

503
00:21:58,529 --> 00:22:03,360
that might have been me and so yeah that

504
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,919
put a lot of spotlight on the drone in

505
00:22:04,919 --> 00:22:07,440
the drone community that probably we

506
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,629
didn't want because if you can imagine

507
00:22:09,629 --> 00:22:11,850
this is not quite the worst thing that

508
00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:13,799
could happen but it's pretty bad because

509
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:16,409
now the federal government is like well

510
00:22:16,409 --> 00:22:18,750
and and everybody wants to know how can

511
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:20,190
we stop these things how can we control

512
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:21,929
them how can we register them you know

513
00:22:21,929 --> 00:22:23,549
the secret service now is doing testing

514
00:22:23,549 --> 00:22:25,950
on how what happens when the next person

515
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:28,139
brings it brings a drone with explosives

516
00:22:28,139 --> 00:22:32,059
or you know whatever you know who knows

517
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:34,879
maybe they'll use a drone to carry drugs

518
00:22:34,879 --> 00:22:38,289
yes they've tried that

519
00:22:38,289 --> 00:22:41,299
this happens this happens like every few

520
00:22:41,299 --> 00:22:43,249
months now somebody try to smuggle drugs

521
00:22:43,249 --> 00:22:46,879
across the border using a drone and so

522
00:22:46,879 --> 00:22:48,859
this I mean I can just tell from looking

523
00:22:48,859 --> 00:22:50,989
at this they've tried to put far too

524
00:22:50,989 --> 00:22:55,009
many drugs on this drug I mean there's

525
00:22:55,009 --> 00:22:56,809
like several packs on the ground if you

526
00:22:56,809 --> 00:22:58,820
just did like they were getting greedy

527
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:02,289
do one or two and it'll probably work

528
00:23:03,849 --> 00:23:06,830
there was a case in just a few lot of

529
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:08,539
case but it was in the news a few just a

530
00:23:08,539 --> 00:23:10,039
few weeks ago or a month or two ago

531
00:23:10,039 --> 00:23:12,109
you've seen people try to smuggle things

532
00:23:12,109 --> 00:23:13,849
into prison with drones cell phones

533
00:23:13,849 --> 00:23:16,549
drugs all kinds of things somehow they

534
00:23:16,549 --> 00:23:22,369
always crash amazon and other companies

535
00:23:22,369 --> 00:23:23,959
are looking at drones for commercial

536
00:23:23,959 --> 00:23:25,849
purposes like i said they can't they

537
00:23:25,849 --> 00:23:27,320
can't really test what they want to do

538
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:28,789
in the united states so they're going to

539
00:23:28,789 --> 00:23:29,989
Europe and other countries where the

540
00:23:29,989 --> 00:23:31,429
regulatory environment is not so bad

541
00:23:31,429 --> 00:23:34,099
because they can't do like they can't

542
00:23:34,099 --> 00:23:36,289
they're their delivery system is going

543
00:23:36,289 --> 00:23:38,209
to require them to fly outside of the

544
00:23:38,209 --> 00:23:41,450
line of sight so whether or not the the

545
00:23:41,450 --> 00:23:43,309
rule makes some kind of exception for

546
00:23:43,309 --> 00:23:45,079
this we don't know so this may or may

547
00:23:45,079 --> 00:23:46,909
not happen if the rule comes out the way

548
00:23:46,909 --> 00:23:48,829
that the FAA wants it to come out it's

549
00:23:48,829 --> 00:23:51,169
going to kill this this potential option

550
00:23:51,169 --> 00:23:57,799
I read about this case in this is from

551
00:23:57,799 --> 00:23:59,719
Lebanon but they're also doing this in

552
00:23:59,719 --> 00:24:01,309
Australia and a few other places on

553
00:24:01,309 --> 00:24:03,709
beaches where they this is called The

554
00:24:03,709 --> 00:24:05,299
Guardian where they just put a life

555
00:24:05,299 --> 00:24:07,669
preserver on and then when someone's out

556
00:24:07,669 --> 00:24:10,219
in the water drowning or is in trouble

557
00:24:10,219 --> 00:24:12,379
they just fly the drone out and drop the

558
00:24:12,379 --> 00:24:13,879
life preserver before the lifeguard has

559
00:24:13,879 --> 00:24:16,249
a chance to even get there so this is

560
00:24:16,249 --> 00:24:17,749
one of those cases where like this is a

561
00:24:17,749 --> 00:24:20,539
pretty cool thing right i mean if you

562
00:24:20,539 --> 00:24:21,739
got somebody who's you know a

563
00:24:21,739 --> 00:24:23,269
quarter-mile out and they're struggling

564
00:24:23,269 --> 00:24:24,559
it's going to take the lifeguard a while

565
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:26,450
to get out there if you can just get

566
00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:30,349
them something to hang on to people have

567
00:24:30,349 --> 00:24:32,570
also done testing with Aedes and other

568
00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:34,909
medical devices and ways to get using

569
00:24:34,909 --> 00:24:37,609
drones to get things to people real fast

570
00:24:37,609 --> 00:24:42,049
when they may not be available so the

571
00:24:42,049 --> 00:24:43,489
point of showing these things are to

572
00:24:43,489 --> 00:24:44,989
show you there's a lot of cool things

573
00:24:44,989 --> 00:24:46,849
that people are developing uses for

574
00:24:46,849 --> 00:24:48,589
drones and then there's the government

575
00:24:48,589 --> 00:24:50,990
regulatory side and we have to find

576
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:52,550
where we can operate within those

577
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:54,770
guidelines but still be able to do cool

578
00:24:54,770 --> 00:24:59,120
things this is a circular put out by the

579
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,920
Forest Service you may have read a few

580
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,929
of these incidents in California where

581
00:25:02,929 --> 00:25:04,940
there's like a forest fire somebody's

582
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:06,620
trying to fly their drone over it and

583
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:08,210
then they have to ground the aircraft

584
00:25:08,210 --> 00:25:10,580
and it's a big mess and they're a couple

585
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:11,929
of cases where that this has happened

586
00:25:11,929 --> 00:25:14,350
and a couple other cases were

587
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:16,870
surprisingly and shockingly

588
00:25:16,870 --> 00:25:19,910
misinterpreted by the media so in one

589
00:25:19,910 --> 00:25:22,880
particular case there was a there was a

590
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:26,150
fire going on and it just happened to be

591
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:29,330
that the area that a lot of the locals

592
00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:31,640
fly their drones was somewhat close to

593
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,890
that area so it wasn't like they said

594
00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:35,480
hey there's a fire let's go fire drone

595
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,400
over it it was more of like the fire

596
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,870
just happened to be in an area where

597
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:41,450
people normally fly drones so but of

598
00:25:41,450 --> 00:25:42,590
course that you know how the media is

599
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:45,020
and they want to make it a story so but

600
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:46,910
it isn't it is an issue I mean you have

601
00:25:46,910 --> 00:25:49,880
to think about this idea of you know

602
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:52,580
interfering with with firefighting

603
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:53,990
efforts these people they're out there

604
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:55,370
working hard trying to save people's

605
00:25:55,370 --> 00:25:57,290
homes and people are flying drones in

606
00:25:57,290 --> 00:25:59,420
that area so it's it's not something you

607
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:06,080
could just easily dismiss somebody want

608
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,910
a million dollars for this one it was

609
00:26:07,910 --> 00:26:10,280
like at a one of those prize things and

610
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:12,440
it's it's basically a drone that has

611
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:15,380
this like flexible structure around it

612
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:16,880
so when it crashes into something it

613
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:19,250
just bounces off so it's a crash-proof

614
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:26,780
drone there there's drone film festivals

615
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:29,330
now this is like totally if you think

616
00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:30,890
about it it's kind of interesting

617
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:33,350
because it's it's not really about the

618
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:35,330
drone it's the drone is just getting you

619
00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:36,700
into position to take really cool

620
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:39,559
photographs but they have this is one in

621
00:26:39,559 --> 00:26:41,630
New York City that they have and if you

622
00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:42,800
look at some of the videos they're

623
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,360
pretty cool I mean there they just look

624
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:47,090
like you know really cool documentaries

625
00:26:47,090 --> 00:26:49,340
you may have also seen I don't know if

626
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:51,559
my wife watches like HDTV and all those

627
00:26:51,559 --> 00:26:53,960
like how Center shows and you may see a

628
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,580
lot of shots in those shows where you

629
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:59,270
see like sort of photography of the home

630
00:26:59,270 --> 00:27:01,309
from the outside and it's pretty obvious

631
00:27:01,309 --> 00:27:02,840
when you fly drones and you watch those

632
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:04,400
shows you'll see like you'll really

633
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,159
notice that

634
00:27:05,159 --> 00:27:07,739
the use of drones for photography for

635
00:27:07,739 --> 00:27:16,739
those types of shows so another thing

636
00:27:16,739 --> 00:27:18,269
that's been in the news that I want to

637
00:27:18,269 --> 00:27:20,899
talk about our privacy issues and of

638
00:27:20,899 --> 00:27:23,159
this psych think came out of Colorado

639
00:27:23,159 --> 00:27:25,200
and then we're going to the town is

640
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,460
going to issue like drone hunting

641
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:29,359
permits to their citizens

642
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:45,020
I have no words for this guy but so how

643
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:47,900
many how many of you own a go pro or a

644
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:50,330
similar type of camera fair amount of

645
00:27:50,330 --> 00:27:54,260
you few of you what can I mean so a

646
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:56,330
GoPro camera which is the sort of the

647
00:27:56,330 --> 00:27:58,100
most common type of camera that you'll

648
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:00,260
see on a drone it's a wide angle lens

649
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:02,780
right so the idea is to get as much sky

650
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:05,750
as much view as possible at the expense

651
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:10,610
of I mean there's no zoom obviously so

652
00:28:10,610 --> 00:28:12,470
I'll show you some videos but the

653
00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:14,030
privacy issues here I think are probably

654
00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:16,580
overblown a little bit the reason being

655
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:19,400
is a GoPro cameras about the worst

656
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,930
possible thing you would want if you

657
00:28:20,930 --> 00:28:22,610
wanted to spy on somebody with a drone I

658
00:28:22,610 --> 00:28:26,110
mean it's not like as a telephoto lens

659
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:27,890
there are other things that you're going

660
00:28:27,890 --> 00:28:29,570
to for people who fly drones you're

661
00:28:29,570 --> 00:28:32,480
going to have eventually you're going to

662
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,680
have some kind of interaction with law

663
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:36,470
enforcement or government officials most

664
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:38,210
of mine have been relatively positive

665
00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:40,520
this is an interesting photo because

666
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:44,200
it's was taken by one of my friends and

667
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:49,580
the the police they they saw him flying

668
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:53,030
the drone and they kind of he was

669
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:54,530
standing right on the sidewalk and they

670
00:28:54,530 --> 00:28:55,790
just stuck their head out the window and

671
00:28:55,790 --> 00:28:57,380
they challenged him to land it on the

672
00:28:57,380 --> 00:29:00,320
car and he declined which was a smart

673
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:03,920
idea but for the most part the people

674
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,330
that I have talked to having done an

675
00:29:05,330 --> 00:29:06,740
informal survey most people's

676
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:08,210
interactions with law enforcement and

677
00:29:08,210 --> 00:29:10,220
government officials have been generally

678
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:15,230
positive most most people if they're if

679
00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:16,970
they're reasonable they think it's kind

680
00:29:16,970 --> 00:29:19,250
of cool and as long as you're not doing

681
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:21,050
anything dangerous there for the most

682
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:22,190
part they're going to let you do what

683
00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:24,440
you want to do unless it's like in New

684
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:27,260
York City and then your terrorist but

685
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:29,800
you know

686
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:36,810
I will talk about that I will talk about

687
00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:42,750
that I have a slide for it so we talked

688
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:46,320
about the government sort of backdrop in

689
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,970
the government regulatory environment we

690
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:50,760
talked about all these this is just

691
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:52,890
scratching the surface of uses of drones

692
00:29:52,890 --> 00:29:56,550
I want to talk about what are the issues

693
00:29:56,550 --> 00:29:58,320
that come when we try to put these two

694
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:01,830
pieces together so first of all what i

695
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:04,970
would call patchwork lawmaking right so

696
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:08,480
we have federal law right so Congress

697
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:11,670
passed this bill the FAA is putting out

698
00:30:11,670 --> 00:30:13,560
rules so there's federal laws we have to

699
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:18,030
be aware about state law states or

700
00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:20,940
passing laws about drones in some states

701
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:22,320
have passed laws that for example you

702
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,600
can't use drones to aid in hunting or

703
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:27,690
something like that maryland where i

704
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:29,310
live just passed the law that says only

705
00:30:29,310 --> 00:30:31,650
the state can pass drone laws the local

706
00:30:31,650 --> 00:30:33,450
governments can't pass their own drone

707
00:30:33,450 --> 00:30:36,480
laws then you have city county regional

708
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,910
government authorities i was flying in a

709
00:30:38,910 --> 00:30:40,950
state park area in a county park and

710
00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:43,140
they have some rule against flying model

711
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:45,360
aircraft in the park so they told me to

712
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,670
stop so but you would not know that

713
00:30:47,670 --> 00:30:49,620
unless you knew exactly every where

714
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:50,790
you're going so that you have this

715
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:53,550
patchwork laws if you wanted to go right

716
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:55,200
outside the hotel here and fly like how

717
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,610
do you know if you could fly it or not

718
00:30:56,610 --> 00:30:59,460
who knows well we're in DC so you really

719
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:07,890
can't but there was the case in up in

720
00:31:07,890 --> 00:31:10,560
Connecticut earlier this year there was

721
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:13,290
a traffic accident and there was a guy

722
00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:15,270
who lived right nearby and he happened

723
00:31:15,270 --> 00:31:18,120
to be a news photographer for he was a

724
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:20,790
stringer for a new station so he flew

725
00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:24,090
his drone up over the over the site of

726
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:27,780
the accident and they asked him to stop

727
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:30,150
flying and eventually they ended up

728
00:31:30,150 --> 00:31:33,660
arresting him and he ended up losing his

729
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:36,270
job because of it so he sued the police

730
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:40,050
officer for for arresting him because he

731
00:31:40,050 --> 00:31:41,310
said it was a fair this First Amendment

732
00:31:41,310 --> 00:31:42,840
right to fly the drone

733
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:45,960
this case came down so I don't want to

734
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:47,130
get into the whole thing but there's an

735
00:31:47,130 --> 00:31:48,960
issue with immunity so police officers

736
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,550
essentially have qualified immunity when

737
00:31:50,550 --> 00:31:52,590
they're doing their job so he did win

738
00:31:52,590 --> 00:31:54,750
the case it doesn't mean there's not a

739
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:56,400
First Amendment right to fly drones but

740
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,110
it's just it's one of those cases that's

741
00:31:58,110 --> 00:32:04,920
out there we talked about so we talked

742
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:07,650
about regulations statutory laws now

743
00:32:07,650 --> 00:32:08,790
we're talking we're getting into

744
00:32:08,790 --> 00:32:10,440
constitutional issues right for First

745
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:12,420
Amendment we've got the Fourth Amendment

746
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:15,090
issues with you know can I fly a drone

747
00:32:15,090 --> 00:32:17,310
into my neighbor's backyard to peer into

748
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:22,140
the window or to you know whatever and

749
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:25,380
so you see that there's there's a lot of

750
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:28,050
stuff going on here and what would be a

751
00:32:28,050 --> 00:32:31,370
drone presentation without some video so

752
00:32:31,370 --> 00:32:33,930
the reason I chose these videos because

753
00:32:33,930 --> 00:32:36,300
they fit the theme of what I'm trying to

754
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:40,290
show so this is a really quick one I

755
00:32:40,290 --> 00:32:42,300
won't show the whole thing but this is

756
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:44,760
just something example of something you

757
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:48,240
can do this is the Annapolis field

758
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:50,970
annapolis mall and I planned a route on

759
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:53,640
it Google Maps essentially plotted

760
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,980
waypoints and said fly here do this at

761
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:59,460
this altitude turn here etc completely

762
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:01,500
automated upload the routes of the drone

763
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:04,380
this is flying at about 200 feet so I'm

764
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:06,060
just to give you the idea of what a

765
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:08,490
GoPro camera looks like it from 200 feet

766
00:33:08,490 --> 00:33:10,440
so what you can see and what you can't

767
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:17,840
see and I pray that this works and

768
00:33:27,610 --> 00:33:30,240
No

769
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:44,890
always have a backup so I'm just going

770
00:33:44,890 --> 00:33:48,720
to show real quick a little bit of this

771
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:51,760
so I'm in the parking garage on the top

772
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,679
of the parking garage and I just hit the

773
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:55,480
drone just took off and it's just going

774
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:57,250
to fly around the outside of the mall

775
00:33:57,250 --> 00:34:00,820
around the parking lot it's flying at

776
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:04,980
about 10 miles an hour and it's gone oh

777
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:09,240
hey it would be helpful

778
00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:27,340
so this is flying at about 200 feet with

779
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:29,080
a GoPro so you can end in the cameras

780
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:33,810
angle that about 45 45 degrees down so

781
00:34:33,810 --> 00:34:36,129
just to give you a sense of what 200

782
00:34:36,129 --> 00:34:37,659
feet would look like from a drone I mean

783
00:34:37,659 --> 00:34:39,489
you're not really going to be spying on

784
00:34:39,489 --> 00:34:42,610
anybody from here I mean it's just sort

785
00:34:42,610 --> 00:34:45,668
of the nature of what you're doing but

786
00:34:45,668 --> 00:34:48,580
it's pretty cool this was the first time

787
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:50,560
that I had programmed a route and hoping

788
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:56,020
and praying that it came back cuz it's

789
00:34:56,020 --> 00:35:02,860
not cheap you know okay but that's just

790
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:10,200
to give you an idea okay

791
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:15,410
so the battery life 20 minutes that

792
00:35:15,410 --> 00:35:16,880
route was about it ended up being about

793
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:22,390
12 minutes or something like that okay

794
00:35:22,390 --> 00:35:24,290
there's another one I want to show you

795
00:35:24,290 --> 00:35:27,740
here and this is sort of an example of

796
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:31,250
why as a as a drone pilot you might want

797
00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:32,810
to have a little bit of knowledge of

798
00:35:32,810 --> 00:35:38,170
what you're doing so

799
00:35:46,339 --> 00:35:49,059
so this is a guy flying his drone and

800
00:35:49,059 --> 00:35:52,670
obviously and he's done he's he's

801
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:54,349
starting to come down he's descending so

802
00:35:54,349 --> 00:35:56,890
he's pulling the throttle back and

803
00:35:56,890 --> 00:36:01,239
things don't go well

804
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:09,920
he calls it the wobble of death and

805
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,690
that's not really a scientific term but

806
00:36:11,690 --> 00:36:15,530
I'll explain it his drone is starting to

807
00:36:15,530 --> 00:36:17,540
do this so he and he's falling out of

808
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:19,580
the sky so he puts full power on to it

809
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:24,800
and the camera is actually pretty stable

810
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,090
the drone is actually moving around

811
00:36:26,090 --> 00:36:29,920
quite a bit you can see the propeller

812
00:36:49,690 --> 00:36:52,690
anyway it didn't end well he ended up

813
00:36:52,690 --> 00:36:56,500
crashing the reason I show you this is

814
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:58,560
because

815
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:10,470
just do this much easier so there's a

816
00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:12,240
thing called vortex ring state any we

817
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:16,500
have any helicopter pilots no so there's

818
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:18,150
a thing called vortex ring state and the

819
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:20,520
idea is that when your fly when you

820
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:22,860
start descending in a helicopter or a

821
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:26,340
drone the prop wash from your propellers

822
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:30,600
it gets recirculated into the above your

823
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,880
propellers where your try your blades

824
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,740
where you're getting lift so you get

825
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:37,830
this circulation of dirty air and you're

826
00:37:37,830 --> 00:37:39,690
essentially have no lift and when you

827
00:37:39,690 --> 00:37:42,300
add full power like he did you're just

828
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:45,750
you're feeding the problem right so this

829
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:48,000
actually happened in on the bin Laden

830
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,680
raid in Afghanistan one of the

831
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,930
helicopters crashed it's because of this

832
00:37:51,930 --> 00:37:53,610
this is what happened they were trying

833
00:37:53,610 --> 00:37:56,460
to land in a courtyard so the prop wash

834
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:58,170
was coming down hitting the walls of the

835
00:37:58,170 --> 00:37:59,730
courtyard and then coming back up and

836
00:37:59,730 --> 00:38:03,960
that's what happened so going up is

837
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:05,880
almost always a safe way to get out of

838
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:08,010
the drone incident but this guy did in

839
00:38:08,010 --> 00:38:09,750
the one time when you can't add full

840
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:11,040
power what you have to do is move

841
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,780
laterally out of the out of the air that

842
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:16,010
you're in and get into some clean air

843
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:53,150
this is a guy flying over a half of a

844
00:38:53,150 --> 00:39:00,319
fire an active fire with his drone think

845
00:39:00,319 --> 00:39:03,009
this will work out

846
00:39:28,089 --> 00:39:31,089
so

847
00:39:36,339 --> 00:39:39,940
just you know

848
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:47,900
now

849
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:51,029
you

850
00:39:52,839 --> 00:39:56,140
this man was this is the K this was that

851
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:59,589
of Kentucky a few months ago guy was

852
00:39:59,589 --> 00:40:01,390
flat there was a drone flying over his

853
00:40:01,390 --> 00:40:05,229
property and he shot it down with a

854
00:40:05,229 --> 00:40:09,369
shotgun and he was arrested so just to

855
00:40:09,369 --> 00:40:11,349
give you a sense of they actually I

856
00:40:11,349 --> 00:40:12,700
won't show it because I'm running a

857
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:14,140
little bit short on time there's a good

858
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:15,880
video from the drone that got shot down

859
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:19,630
he was flying at 200 feet so as high as

860
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:21,940
I was flying over the mall that's how

861
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:24,190
high the guy with the drone was flying

862
00:40:24,190 --> 00:40:26,049
over this guy's property claimed it was

863
00:40:26,049 --> 00:40:29,489
like 20 feet above his house it was not

864
00:40:29,489 --> 00:40:32,289
so he shot it down so and he got

865
00:40:32,289 --> 00:40:35,229
arrested so what this really comes down

866
00:40:35,229 --> 00:40:37,239
to you probably is not going to have

867
00:40:37,239 --> 00:40:39,160
anything to do with the drone this is

868
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:40,239
coming this is going to come down to

869
00:40:40,239 --> 00:40:43,059
firing and take shooting a firearm into

870
00:40:43,059 --> 00:40:46,089
the air is essentially reckless

871
00:40:46,089 --> 00:40:48,039
endangerment and you're going to get

872
00:40:48,039 --> 00:40:49,569
that regardless whether you're shooting

873
00:40:49,569 --> 00:40:52,660
at a drone or a blimp or something else

874
00:40:52,660 --> 00:41:02,680
so yeah you have a question so he's

875
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:04,210
asking about the hose that the

876
00:41:04,210 --> 00:41:07,839
firefighters you know it that Kate

877
00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:10,569
there's no case there right now with the

878
00:41:10,569 --> 00:41:12,130
guy with the firefighters shooting the

879
00:41:12,130 --> 00:41:16,569
water it whether whether you can do

880
00:41:16,569 --> 00:41:19,059
something like that that you can try and

881
00:41:19,059 --> 00:41:20,469
if you want to go to court and try to

882
00:41:20,469 --> 00:41:22,839
prove it but it's again like I said

883
00:41:22,839 --> 00:41:24,819
these areas haven't been litigated in

884
00:41:24,819 --> 00:41:26,170
the courts so whether or not you can do

885
00:41:26,170 --> 00:41:28,559
it who knows

886
00:41:33,850 --> 00:41:37,089
like that

887
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:41,780
again who knows so here's what I would

888
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:43,730
say I'm not a lawyer here's what I would

889
00:41:43,730 --> 00:41:45,980
say from my perspective if this device

890
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:48,620
is sort of violating FCC regulations for

891
00:41:48,620 --> 00:42:02,000
what it's doing maybe you right so right

892
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,150
so you the best so you guys are coming

893
00:42:05,150 --> 00:42:07,160
down to the critical issues here it's it

894
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:09,350
really doesn't matter about the drone it

895
00:42:09,350 --> 00:42:12,320
matters about how you're doing it so if

896
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:14,600
this is operating within the ham band

897
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:17,060
and you're using your call sign and you

898
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:18,860
the drone just happens to be where your

899
00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:21,410
you know maybe you can get away with it

900
00:42:21,410 --> 00:42:23,420
but I don't know I think that even this

901
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:27,350
is probably getting a little oh we also

902
00:42:27,350 --> 00:42:36,770
have the anti drone drone so I want to

903
00:42:36,770 --> 00:42:38,780
close with a few slides just like I

904
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:40,790
talked about how do you know what to do

905
00:42:40,790 --> 00:42:43,310
the FAA just came out with an app called

906
00:42:43,310 --> 00:42:46,130
before you fly and because it's the

907
00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:47,690
government they only let a thousand

908
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:50,390
people into the beta and so unless you

909
00:42:50,390 --> 00:42:51,650
are one of those thousand people you

910
00:42:51,650 --> 00:42:54,110
can't use it but basically what it does

911
00:42:54,110 --> 00:42:56,420
is when you turn it on it will locate

912
00:42:56,420 --> 00:42:57,890
you on the map and then it will alert

913
00:42:57,890 --> 00:43:02,600
you to airports heliports aviation area

914
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:04,130
things that are around where you're at

915
00:43:04,130 --> 00:43:07,480
so whether or not you can fly or not

916
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:14,090
just federal just federal so you have a

917
00:43:14,090 --> 00:43:16,480
question too

918
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:21,739
it's the first people first thousand

919
00:43:21,739 --> 00:43:23,359
people who signed up for the beta got it

920
00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:30,529
and it's already closed so there is a

921
00:43:30,529 --> 00:43:34,369
website called air mapped i/o and you

922
00:43:34,369 --> 00:43:36,619
can oh you can click on whether or not

923
00:43:36,619 --> 00:43:38,779
you want to do commercial use and then

924
00:43:38,779 --> 00:43:41,959
it will have generally federal airspace

925
00:43:41,959 --> 00:43:45,380
regulations but it will show you what's

926
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:47,329
around you it's it's a different version

927
00:43:47,329 --> 00:43:50,660
of the FAA website there's a website

928
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:53,299
called no-fly zone org where you can

929
00:43:53,299 --> 00:43:55,729
register your house and then supposedly

930
00:43:55,729 --> 00:43:59,329
people won't fly over it it's probably a

931
00:43:59,329 --> 00:44:03,199
waste of time the idea of this site is

932
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:06,709
that you register with this site and

933
00:44:06,709 --> 00:44:08,329
then drone manufacturers would use the

934
00:44:08,329 --> 00:44:10,789
database to program like geofence areas

935
00:44:10,789 --> 00:44:13,519
where you can't fly so for example after

936
00:44:13,519 --> 00:44:16,219
the White House incident DJ I pushed

937
00:44:16,219 --> 00:44:19,249
firmware to their drones to that you if

938
00:44:19,249 --> 00:44:21,049
you if you try to take off by the White

939
00:44:21,049 --> 00:44:23,509
House if you won't it won't take off so

940
00:44:23,509 --> 00:44:29,229
don't update the firmware I have a

941
00:44:29,229 --> 00:44:31,880
Facebook page called the law of drones

942
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:34,009
just post interesting interesting

943
00:44:34,009 --> 00:44:36,469
stories about drones commercial use

944
00:44:36,469 --> 00:44:38,959
hobby use laws regulations a lot of the

945
00:44:38,959 --> 00:44:40,849
stuff that I've talked about here so if

946
00:44:40,849 --> 00:44:41,900
you're interested you can look at that

947
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:45,859
and I will open it up for questions but

948
00:44:45,859 --> 00:44:48,380
before I do that I'm going to this will

949
00:44:48,380 --> 00:44:49,519
just totally distract you from asking

950
00:44:49,519 --> 00:44:51,619
questions but I'm going to play it

951
00:44:51,619 --> 00:44:54,979
anyway because it will be you enjoy it I

952
00:44:54,979 --> 00:44:57,489
think

953
00:45:22,530 --> 00:45:26,630
so I've got about seven minutes and

954
00:45:26,630 --> 00:45:29,630
questions

955
00:45:38,210 --> 00:45:49,950
not really so what you're likely to see

956
00:45:49,950 --> 00:45:53,160
in the cases of drones falling on

957
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:55,020
property or maybe causing damage is

958
00:45:55,020 --> 00:45:57,030
probably going to be the same kind of

959
00:45:57,030 --> 00:45:58,530
case that you have like a car accident

960
00:45:58,530 --> 00:46:01,800
right if your drone falls into someone's

961
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:04,470
house and causes damage it's sort of

962
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:09,020
just the simple insurance torque thing I

963
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:11,910
told I told you this would distract you

964
00:46:11,910 --> 00:46:17,359
from asking questions yes

965
00:46:30,150 --> 00:46:32,210
you

966
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:43,640
right

967
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:58,960
right

968
00:47:02,450 --> 00:47:06,630
right it everywhere is different this is

969
00:47:06,630 --> 00:47:09,480
this is part of the problem this is part

970
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:10,619
of the problem of what I talked about

971
00:47:10,619 --> 00:47:13,080
this patchwork law making its depending

972
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:14,400
upon where you live there's different

973
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:16,200
laws that apply and most people are

974
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:17,760
going to open these drones that they get

975
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:19,290
for Christmas and they have no they're

976
00:47:19,290 --> 00:47:20,609
going to not going to have any idea what

977
00:47:20,609 --> 00:47:24,060
they should do or can't do or can do so

978
00:47:24,060 --> 00:47:26,369
States will try if they if they don't

979
00:47:26,369 --> 00:47:27,660
like drones they're going to try to

980
00:47:27,660 --> 00:47:31,350
apply laws that they have to to prevent

981
00:47:31,350 --> 00:47:46,339
you from doing things right sure I mean

982
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:50,460
right right so the question is what can

983
00:47:50,460 --> 00:47:51,960
you do if someone's like Stolte like

984
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:53,220
someone's essentially invading your

985
00:47:53,220 --> 00:47:56,040
privacy with the drone we have laws for

986
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:58,170
invasion of privacy there torque things

987
00:47:58,170 --> 00:48:00,420
you can do that really don't involve the

988
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:03,570
drone it involves the invasiveness of

989
00:48:03,570 --> 00:48:06,030
what you're what they're doing so pretty

990
00:48:06,030 --> 00:48:07,560
much everything that you could do with

991
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:10,350
the drone pretty much everything you

992
00:48:10,350 --> 00:48:11,400
could do with a drone there's already

993
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:13,920
laws out there to protect people against

994
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:16,140
that yes you can't maybe shoot it down

995
00:48:16,140 --> 00:48:18,540
right then but you could elite you can

996
00:48:18,540 --> 00:48:20,940
call the police and explain what

997
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:22,770
happened and maybe you have some kind of

998
00:48:22,770 --> 00:48:28,410
the case against them that's true it's

999
00:48:28,410 --> 00:48:30,680
true

1000
00:48:32,059 --> 00:48:34,499
that's true but that you know what

1001
00:48:34,499 --> 00:48:35,880
that's going to happen with any piece of

1002
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:39,019
technology I mean you get any any all

1003
00:48:39,019 --> 00:48:41,579
every hacker tool in the world has a bad

1004
00:48:41,579 --> 00:48:44,400
use right I mean so the question is

1005
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:46,920
what's where to draw the line and what's

1006
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:48,900
going to happen is in the next year

1007
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:51,839
upcoming years it's it's going to be the

1008
00:48:51,839 --> 00:48:53,039
government is going to push the line

1009
00:48:53,039 --> 00:48:55,980
this way and consumers and advocates are

1010
00:48:55,980 --> 00:48:57,269
going to push the line the other way and

1011
00:48:57,269 --> 00:48:58,890
where we meet in the middle and nobody

1012
00:48:58,890 --> 00:49:04,879
knows right now any other questions yeah

1013
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:21,329
right

1014
00:49:22,060 --> 00:49:24,940
so his question was how do you reconcile

1015
00:49:24,940 --> 00:49:27,400
the DC no-fly zone with your ability to

1016
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:29,620
fly in the area that you control in your

1017
00:49:29,620 --> 00:49:32,620
yard over your property nobody knows

1018
00:49:32,620 --> 00:49:36,580
because nope I hate I hate if I gave you

1019
00:49:36,580 --> 00:49:37,810
an answer it would be wrong because

1020
00:49:37,810 --> 00:49:40,000
there is no answer it's going to take

1021
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,310
someone flying over their yard and then

1022
00:49:42,310 --> 00:49:44,290
getting arrested for getting an

1023
00:49:44,290 --> 00:49:46,000
enforcement action for violating that

1024
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,340
and then taking it to court because

1025
00:49:48,340 --> 00:49:50,260
they're there haven't been there just

1026
00:49:50,260 --> 00:49:51,820
haven't been enough cases for anybody to

1027
00:49:51,820 --> 00:49:57,520
know what's going on that's not going to

1028
00:49:57,520 --> 00:49:59,730
end well

1029
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:13,170
they're usually in like 2.4 gigahertz or

1030
00:50:13,170 --> 00:50:16,700
yeah so I mean you

1031
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:28,880
right i mean all of these things that

1032
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:30,200
you guys are thinking about as hackers

1033
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:32,600
it's the same stuff you know everyone's

1034
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:34,430
thinking that we're thinking about and

1035
00:50:34,430 --> 00:50:37,250
it's a matter of can you do it and and

1036
00:50:37,250 --> 00:50:39,620
who knows if you can do it you know I

1037
00:50:39,620 --> 00:50:43,790
don't know right and and I can't tell

1038
00:50:43,790 --> 00:50:45,530
you to go to you can try it if you want

1039
00:50:45,530 --> 00:50:47,570
I'm not telling you to because maybe the

1040
00:50:47,570 --> 00:50:49,400
FAA will make you the guy they come

1041
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:54,590
after but what's so interesting about

1042
00:50:54,590 --> 00:50:56,210
this field and I'll just close with this

1043
00:50:56,210 --> 00:51:00,610
is that we this is sort of

1044
00:51:13,270 --> 00:51:16,160
how could I not end on that one by the

1045
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:18,890
way that was his just give you an idea

1046
00:51:18,890 --> 00:51:20,840
of why it happened that was his first

1047
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:23,450
flight with the DJI phantom so that

1048
00:51:23,450 --> 00:51:24,650
you're talking another twelve hundred

1049
00:51:24,650 --> 00:51:28,970
dollars and and he lost if you lose

1050
00:51:28,970 --> 00:51:30,500
communication from your controller to

1051
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:32,780
the drone it will it will automatically

1052
00:51:32,780 --> 00:51:35,090
go back to the GPS coordinates where you

1053
00:51:35,090 --> 00:51:37,580
took off and apparently he took off very

1054
00:51:37,580 --> 00:51:40,040
close to that canal and so he did save

1055
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:44,450
it but yeah what I wanted to close with

1056
00:51:44,450 --> 00:51:50,120
was this is a really even if you're just

1057
00:51:50,120 --> 00:51:51,350
even if you don't care about the law

1058
00:51:51,350 --> 00:51:53,390
part this is really exciting time for

1059
00:51:53,390 --> 00:51:55,700
drones because it's it's a nascent

1060
00:51:55,700 --> 00:51:58,610
industry in terms of the government and

1061
00:51:58,610 --> 00:51:59,900
how the government is going to deal with

1062
00:51:59,900 --> 00:52:02,390
it and like I said there's so much that

1063
00:52:02,390 --> 00:52:04,310
is so much is going to be done in the

1064
00:52:04,310 --> 00:52:06,110
next few years it should be really

1065
00:52:06,110 --> 00:52:07,520
interesting to watch thank you for your

1066
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:10,870
questions and thank you for coming today
