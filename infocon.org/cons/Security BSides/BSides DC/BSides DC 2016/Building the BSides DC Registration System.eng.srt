the truth

8
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:58,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so i'm also scheduled to talk about</font>

9
00:01:55,159 --> 00:02:03,320
I sia stata stuff this afternoon so but

10
00:01:58,190 --> 00:02:05,990
I like to build things my name's Jim

11
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:07,729
<font color="#CCCCCC">gilson I'm a electrical engineer by</font>

12
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:11,359
trade so I kind of stumbled it a

13
00:02:07,729 --> 00:02:19,030
cybersecurity a few years ago probably

14
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:22,340
go on 15 at this point and we suffered

15
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:25,519
quite a bit of issues with<font color="#CCCCCC"> our red</font>

16
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:31,400
system the last couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of years for the</font>

17
00:02:25,519 --> 00:02:35,300
con so we decided there had to be a

18
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:39,010
better<font color="#E5E5E5"> way and I took it upon myself to</font>

19
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:43,640
make something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that would work we have</font>

20
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:47,798
we use busy crop which is a site that

21
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:52,458
helps conferences to execute reg systems

22
00:02:47,799 --> 00:02:56,000
and we so we send out the<font color="#CCCCCC"> bar codes with</font>

23
00:02:52,459 --> 00:03:00,290
that and that ends up giving us a flat

24
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,900
text file for<font color="#E5E5E5"> our database of like</font>

25
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:05,660
registered attendees in there it's just

26
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:08,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">three fields it's one for the code</font>

27
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:12,500
itself long<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the email and then one</font>

28
00:03:08,299 --> 00:03:14,329
for a field that describes what what

29
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:17,959
they are so in our database we've got a

30
00:03:14,329 --> 00:03:21,560
speaker attendee and we've got one like

31
00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:24,100
I identifiers for each class or

32
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:24,100
different things

33
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:35,060
so it figure out a way to work with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

34
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:37,250
we have been<font color="#CCCCCC"> using</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the con q our system</font>

35
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:39,440
that dirty Tom<font color="#E5E5E5"> uses so the way dirty</font>

00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:43,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">Connor has it set up is they have a</font>

37
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:45,620
separate<font color="#CCCCCC"> life lines a network and they</font>

38
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:47,390
basically have phones just<font color="#E5E5E5"> linked into</font>

39
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:50,620
that Wi-Fi network and use the QR reader

40
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:55,010
that's on the phone we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have had problems</font>

41
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:58,520
with that Wi-Fi linking to the reg

42
00:03:55,010 --> 00:04:00,109
system previously the last two years<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

43
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:02,720
basically had it buried just<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

44
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:04,640
crapped out we couldn't do anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

45
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:09,709
we ended up deciding that we wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

46
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:12,410
do a fully wired system and because i

47
00:04:09,709 --> 00:04:13,970
love cheaper and rama things<font color="#CCCCCC"> i had a</font>

48
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:17,690
whole bunch of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Raspberry Pi the poem</font>

49
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:20,358
I had had no<font color="#E5E5E5"> I purpose to do with them I</font>

50
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:26,630
said let's try and do a Raspberry Pi for

51
00:04:20,358 --> 00:04:30,380
us so this that may be seen this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

52
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:36,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">actual box here inside there's a</font>

53
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:43,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">brethren 53 and basically what i have on</font>

54
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:43,930
here is the pie hat so<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you actually</font>

55
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:53,000
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use the pie hat which is</font>

56
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:56,060
up top here and I knew these would be

57
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,770
poked around quite a bit or<font color="#CCCCCC"> just the</font>

58
00:04:56,060 --> 00:05:00,080
possibility of some of the anything on

59
00:04:57,770 --> 00:05:01,820
it or even just sitting in storage

60
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,740
they'll get bumped around everything so

61
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:06,380
I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to actually solder buyers to it</font>

62
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:08,630
instead of just<font color="#CCCCCC"> using the little jumper</font>

63
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:11,090
cables that you use on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the proto cords</font>

64
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:12,710
so I actually started on to the proto<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

65
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:15,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">to the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> PI had just so I had something</font>

66
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:18,979
nice and solid from there I'm just<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

67
00:05:15,169 --> 00:05:21,500
to four of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the GPIO pins general purpose</font>

68
00:05:18,979 --> 00:05:24,260
are economical that is and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I use it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

69
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:28,610
basically light of these lights so the

70
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:36,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">way the way it all works is I actually</font>

71
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:39,260
have the pipe<font color="#CCCCCC"> here on board and the pike</font>

72
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:40,969
county board is set up to do motion

73
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:43,190
detection so the pie is set<font color="#CCCCCC"> up with</font>

74
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:45,680
motion detection and what it will do is

75
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:48,020
every it takes him two frames a second

76
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:52,760
if it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a text motion it will actually</font>

77
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:56,330
go and save that off to a file in a

78
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:58,219
particular directory what am I my Python

79
00:05:56,330 --> 00:06:00,370
code just sits there and says is there<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

80
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:03,169
new file in<font color="#CCCCCC"> that directory if it is I</font>

81
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:06,680
automatically shut that off to the QR

82
00:06:03,169 --> 00:06:09,109
reader code there's Python like

83
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:11,419
available downloadable code for QR

84
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:14,110
reader stuff it's actually built ian is

85
00:06:11,419 --> 00:06:17,060
just sooo dope it installed QR code

86
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:18,530
it'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> do processing of the QR codes you</font>

87
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:22,160
need a good generation or even

88
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:26,059
processing<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them and so I just do that</font>

89
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:28,849
now what I found is that the for the

90
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:30,989
camera the focal length for the camera

91
00:06:28,849 --> 00:06:34,229
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the raspberry PI's is actually about</font>

92
00:06:30,989 --> 00:06:38,558
in order to get the focus properly at

93
00:06:34,229 --> 00:06:40,599
around eight inches you need to use a

94
00:06:38,559 --> 00:06:47,409
lens of some sort the cheapest easiest

95
00:06:40,599 --> 00:06:49,569
lens is walmart<font color="#E5E5E5"> three blesses so it</font>

96
00:06:47,409 --> 00:06:50,949
works and<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually I found</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

97
00:06:49,569 --> 00:06:53,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">people doing that online it's just</font>

98
00:06:50,949 --> 00:06:55,269
really simple they're like a dollar or

99
00:06:53,229 --> 00:06:57,459
actually these are I think these are a

100
00:06:55,269 --> 00:06:59,379
lot of work but<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's just like they're</font>

101
00:06:57,459 --> 00:07:01,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">plastic lenses you can drill</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it them you</font>

102
00:06:59,379 --> 00:07:05,799
have to worry about shattering stuff so

103
00:07:01,589 --> 00:07:08,439
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a plus</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> three lens on it</font>

104
00:07:05,799 --> 00:07:12,669
to get it and that focuses really<font color="#CCCCCC"> nicely</font>

105
00:07:08,439 --> 00:07:15,519
at around eight inches so from that I

106
00:07:12,669 --> 00:07:20,438
get a nice clean image process it

107
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:23,860
through the QR code in Python I get I

108
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:26,679
just submit that QR code to the conch

109
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:29,019
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> our server the QR</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cert the server</font>

110
00:07:26,679 --> 00:07:33,998
itself is set up to basically act as a

111
00:07:29,019 --> 00:07:36,969
<font color="#CCCCCC">TMS master for the system so whatever</font>

112
00:07:33,999 --> 00:07:39,459
code whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS it gets it</font>

113
00:07:36,969 --> 00:07:41,379
automatically just processes that into

114
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:44,409
the system so it doesn't it doesn't

115
00:07:41,379 --> 00:07:46,149
actually care what the HTTP portion of

116
00:07:44,409 --> 00:07:49,509
it is just looking for a few our code

117
00:07:46,149 --> 00:07:56,259
that's submitted as part of that so it

118
00:07:49,509 --> 00:08:02,319
could be food blind doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> care but it</font>

119
00:07:56,259 --> 00:08:06,699
crosses a QR code inside the server it

120
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:09,369
goes and looks for it in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> actual</font>

121
00:08:06,699 --> 00:08:11,409
server in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> flat text file if it finds</font>

122
00:08:09,369 --> 00:08:14,649
it it then<font color="#E5E5E5"> writes it out to a registered</font>

123
00:08:11,409 --> 00:08:17,949
file<font color="#CCCCCC"> writes that code into a registered</font>

124
00:08:14,649 --> 00:08:19,389
file that way just<font color="#E5E5E5"> in case you're</font>

125
00:08:17,949 --> 00:08:21,219
getting multiple people at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

126
00:08:19,389 --> 00:08:22,989
have a way because it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> development</font>

127
00:08:21,219 --> 00:08:25,329
code I mean even<font color="#CCCCCC"> though it's been out</font>

128
00:08:22,989 --> 00:08:27,099
<font color="#CCCCCC">there for a while and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> derbies been using</font>

129
00:08:25,329 --> 00:08:31,119
it it's still development code so it

130
00:08:27,099 --> 00:08:32,620
crashes occasionally<font color="#E5E5E5"> but you got a bit</font>

131
00:08:31,119 --> 00:08:34,000
you got a way to back it up it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not all</font>

132
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:36,490
just in memory in a database or

133
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,219
something like that so and then what it

134
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:44,379
does is it sends<font color="#CCCCCC"> back an HTML response</font>

135
00:08:39,219 --> 00:08:47,509
on the on the return the

137

138
00:08:50,389 --> 00:08:54,709
it's not even sending back a fully like

139
00:08:52,459 --> 00:08:56,779
qualified HTML response it's actually

140
00:08:54,709 --> 00:09:00,378
just sending back a text string using

141
00:08:56,779 --> 00:09:05,089
HTTP we actually tweaked it so<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's sent</font>

00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:20,959
it's a duplicate or it's unknown from

147
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:23,779
that I get the response back from the

148
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:29,599
server this guy what it does<font color="#CCCCCC"> is it goes</font>

149
00:09:23,779 --> 00:09:34,040
and reads that interprets the text field

150
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:38,749
and then it will flip on the LEDs so the

151
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:41,929
one side of the LEDs let's see it is

152
00:09:38,749 --> 00:09:44,119
this this right side here that actually

153
00:09:41,929 --> 00:09:46,220
is what you were seeing when you'd walk

154
00:09:44,119 --> 00:09:47,749
up it was a blue it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was just a blue</font>

155
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:50,149
light<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was telling me the systems up</font>

156
00:09:47,749 --> 00:09:52,279
and running it's good to go the when

157
00:09:50,149 --> 00:09:55,069
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> one went green it was saying it got</font>

158
00:09:52,279 --> 00:09:58,309
a good QR code and it was sending<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

159
00:09:55,069 --> 00:10:01,040
signal to the server<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other side of</font>

160
00:09:58,309 --> 00:10:04,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">the red or green one that was actually</font>

161
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:08,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">saying whether it was a good code is</font>

162
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:10,490
green a bad code was or duplicate code

163
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:12,439
was red and we actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> had a couple</font>

164
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:15,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">times where it came back is unknown and</font>

165
00:10:12,439 --> 00:10:17,868
that was the doin that was given a

166
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:20,720
yellow LED but it was actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a</font>

167
00:10:17,869 --> 00:10:26,959
way for us to kind of give a visual and

168
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:28,670
then I<font color="#E5E5E5"> also have I also have the little</font>

169
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:30,498
monitor that you saw<font color="#E5E5E5"> next to it I</font>

170
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:33,290
actually give a visual representation on

171
00:10:30,499 --> 00:10:35,809
that monitor as well for the same thing

172
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:38,929
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I actually have the image that's</font>

173
00:10:35,809 --> 00:10:41,929
being shown here I display<font color="#E5E5E5"> that using a</font>

174
00:10:38,929 --> 00:10:46,339
PI game and then I also<font color="#E5E5E5"> overlay on top</font>

175
00:10:41,929 --> 00:10:49,790
of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little box that shows the code</font>

176
00:10:46,339 --> 00:10:53,990
and gives me an indication of whether

177
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:56,420
it's good bad or unknown so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

178
00:10:53,990 --> 00:11:01,190
that's generation<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

179
00:10:56,420 --> 00:11:06,250
this and as I<font color="#CCCCCC"> said Alex said I already</font>

180
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:09,290
have the code up on github and uh the

181
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:11,209
i'll put the design plans basically

182
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:14,180
these pictures<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then a blog article</font>

183
00:11:11,209 --> 00:11:17,569
as well up on github as well and then

184
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:20,329
will publicize it out any change that we

185
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:22,040
made to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> con q our server stuff we're</font>

186
00:11:20,329 --> 00:11:24,138
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to actually send them back to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Dave</font>

187
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:25,519
<font color="#CCCCCC">Kennedy and the guys at Derby con so</font>

188
00:11:24,139 --> 00:11:27,889
they can roll it into their system

189
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:29,480
because that was actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> in I started</font>

190
00:11:27,889 --> 00:11:32,930
like looking through their code for con

191
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:36,290
QR and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the like to do add better HTML</font>

192
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:38,120
response so they they were looking for

193
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:39,319
help anyway and so we figured to help

194
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:41,810
the community out we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to just</font>

195
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:43,850
continue<font color="#CCCCCC"> to roll this through so one of</font>

196
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:46,010
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> actual things that we found on this</font>

197
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:48,380
for this year<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we want to improve is</font>

198
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:52,040
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had had some LEDs on the</font>

199
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:53,779
bottom here to help<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> figured it</font>

200
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:54,680
would be dark or did I didn't want to

201
00:11:53,779 --> 00:11:56,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">have to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> worry about the lighting</font>

202
00:11:54,680 --> 00:12:00,079
situation it turned out they were too

203
00:11:56,779 --> 00:12:01,730
bright for any phone pretty much they

204
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:03,469
reflected off the surface and what would

205
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:05,449
happen is the QR code would get<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

206
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:08,510
bright white spot and it would actually

207
00:12:05,449 --> 00:12:11,089
mess up the QR code reader so what I

208
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:12,620
actually did just temporarily<font color="#E5E5E5"> this year</font>

209
00:12:11,089 --> 00:12:14,660
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just taped over with electrical tape</font>

210
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:16,699
actually what I'm going to do for for

211
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:20,060
future version is put a little manual

212
00:12:16,699 --> 00:12:21,709
switch on it for cuz paper codes they

213
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:23,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually need more light and so we were</font>

214
00:12:21,709 --> 00:12:24,709
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> sitting there with a flashlight and</font>

215
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:26,449
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of lighting them up or like taking</font>

216
00:12:24,709 --> 00:12:27,739
the tape off or just so we could get a

217
00:12:26,449 --> 00:12:31,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">little bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more light in there so we'll</font>

218
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:32,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">just have a manual switch there was</font>

219
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:34,459
thought to try and do some sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

220
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:36,589
automated oh I'm detecting a spot or

221
00:12:34,459 --> 00:12:38,119
something and it's it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> got</font>

222
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:41,600
people standing<font color="#E5E5E5"> up there anyway</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so just</font>

223
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:44,600
hit a manual switch and then improving

224
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:46,790
on the server response so the the little

225
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:51,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">screen that pops up instead of just</font>

226
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:54,139
giving an indication of what they are

227
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:56,149
registered<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that they are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> registered</font>

228
00:12:54,139 --> 00:12:58,279
or not registered things like that we

229
00:12:56,149 --> 00:13:01,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually wanted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to put an indication of</font>

230
00:12:58,279 --> 00:13:03,620
what they're registered for so are they

231
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:06,949
a speaker if they are put bigger if

232
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:09,199
they're registering for bro then put the

233
00:13:06,949 --> 00:13:10,250
bro class or if they're registered for

234
00:13:09,199 --> 00:13:12,620
this class or

235
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:14,900
at class or their<font color="#E5E5E5"> ninth ND or they're a</font>

236
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:16,760
sponsor we can put all<font color="#E5E5E5"> those kind of</font>

237
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:18,699
indications in there since we have it in

238
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:21,110
the database for the con q our server

239
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:23,990
will literally just<font color="#E5E5E5"> have that additional</font>

240
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:28,850
field that we actually process along the

241
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:32,630
way so it was actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> a pretty fun</font>

242
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:34,940
project I<font color="#E5E5E5"> did the first one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I built</font>

243
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:37,280
took me probably a couple months to get

244
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:40,880
kind of up and running and debugged at

245
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:45,079
least to a stable point and then turned

246
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:48,080
in terms of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the hardware itself so</font>

247
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:51,980
you may notice that this looks rather

248
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:54,740
like a letter this this white portion

249
00:13:51,980 --> 00:14:00,140
here is actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> from joann fabrics it's</font>

250
00:13:54,740 --> 00:14:02,030
a craft j and then this of course is

251
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:03,020
just an electrical box but one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

252
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:05,180
big things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i was probably too</font>

253
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:07,220
worried<font color="#CCCCCC"> about was non-conductive so I</font>

254
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:08,959
first actually what happened was I was

255
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:10,640
originally<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking for just a wooden</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> box</font>

256
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:12,110
to put the Raspberry Pi in about the

257
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:13,910
right size and<font color="#CCCCCC"> everything and it turned</font>

258
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:15,950
out that actually the electrical box

259
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:18,170
from home depot<font color="#E5E5E5"> was probably the easiest</font>

260
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:19,880
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use and then while I happen to</font>

261
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:22,010
be wandering through the aisles looking

262
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:24,560
for ideas of stuff I happen to see these

263
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:26,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">days</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I just happened to walk down that</font>

264
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:28,160
particular I'll and I said you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know what</font>

265
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:30,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">I was already thinking about having a</font>

266
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:31,400
gooseneck from a lamp or trying to

267
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:33,140
figure out some way I could do it<font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font>

268
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:35,270
then I didn't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have it conductive</font>

269
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:37,160
so i couldn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> figure out</font>

270
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:39,829
some way to do it<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just I</font>

271
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:41,420
happen to stumble past this set of

272
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:45,650
letters and it was the perfect size and

273
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:47,540
perfect shape<font color="#E5E5E5"> and everything so it was</font>

274
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:49,790
an interesting project I had a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

275
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:51,170
fun with<font color="#CCCCCC"> it too until once I had that</font>

276
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:53,000
once I had sort of the design and

277
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:56,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">everything built it only took</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me about</font>

278
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:59,060
six hours to replicate for the others

279
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:01,310
but that was like when I had the

280
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:03,319
soldering iron up and hot and I was like

281
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:06,140
ready<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go and had all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my tools out and</font>

282
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:11,110
everything but as I said it was a kind

283
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:11,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">of a fun project yeah</font>

284
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:22,280
yea big because the this because we have

285
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:26,600
this locked into a particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> size it's</font>

286
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:30,110
only got a certain amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of vocal space</font>

287
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:32,710
on it so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea would be yeah we could</font>

288
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:35,810
have one where we<font color="#E5E5E5"> could maybe move it to</font>

289
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:39,020
that's that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe a possibility of how</font>

290
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:41,510
we could adjust it we also had actually

291
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:44,270
over<font color="#E5E5E5"> the speaker sponsor area they're</font>

292
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:47,210
check-in we had a little tablet<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so</font>

293
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:50,569
that that's another thing to actually so

294
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:53,410
with these<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't have it here but</font>

295
00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:56,120
since<font color="#E5E5E5"> we were dealing a hardwired system</font>

296
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:58,459
we were<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to figure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out ways to get</font>

297
00:15:56,120 --> 00:16:01,400
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> else that we could</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use and we</font>

298
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:07,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually had a little um Alex brought</font>

299
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:07,780
his little Nexus tablet us a nexus 7 and

300
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:14,060
from<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there's a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little USB or like a</font>

301
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:17,270
micro USB to ethernet adapter that you

302
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:20,180
can get and so we had that and that has

303
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:22,910
the normal regular camera that it can

304
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:24,800
use in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Google designed actual QR</font>

305
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:27,589
reader so it's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stable than</font>

306
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:28,790
this is and from from that you could

307
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:30,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually like hold it up to a higher</font>

308
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:32,810
distance so that's another possibility

309
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:36,280
for how we can do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it for the future to</font>

310
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:38,869
we can have more than one of those or a

311
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:41,150
at least one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of those sitting around for</font>

312
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:44,300
that kind of case since we're dealing

313
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:48,410
which is a flat<font color="#E5E5E5"> text file to we were</font>

314
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:51,800
able to at least register people by by

315
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:54,560
hand looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the text file right now</font>

316
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:58,099
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually had to manually copy that</font>

317
00:16:54,560 --> 00:17:00,829
code into<font color="#CCCCCC"> a separate registration file</font>

318
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:04,160
to make sure we so when we<font color="#E5E5E5"> were actually</font>

319
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:06,410
sitting there basically if you had

320
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:08,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">troubled you or forgot your code</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

321
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:10,190
basically came over to where I was

322
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:12,800
sitting with the monitor<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I was able</font>

323
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:15,070
to actually look people up and so I was

324
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:17,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">just looking up people in that in that</font>

325
00:17:15,069 --> 00:17:20,869
flat text file just doing a big just

326
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:23,290
doing a grip on them and then what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was</font>

327
00:17:20,869 --> 00:17:25,040
doing is I was copying their code into a

328
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:27,770
separate just man

329
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:29,930
txt file so after the con we're probably

330
00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:32,900
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go and make sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we didn't</font>

331
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:34,960
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> too many duplicates in there but</font>

332
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:40,160
it's just kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> like looking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in that</font>

333
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:44,150
extra file for it but the idea of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the QR</font>

334
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:46,640
code being too big we just probably have

335
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:48,230
to figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out just another method and I</font>

336
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:51,410
think the the tablet seemed to work out

337
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:52,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay for that or taking a picture of it</font>

338
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:59,330
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> just using it on your phone that way</font>

339
00:17:52,670 --> 00:18:01,010
too so<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah no problem I was kind of</font>

340
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:04,100
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking to people about it anyway</font>

341
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:06,020
and so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> figured but but yeah I plan on</font>

342
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:08,060
putting out a full like article about it

343
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:13,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">and instructions and everything and</font>

344
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:13,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">we'll we'll tweet</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it out and and all so</font>

345
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:22,879
ok so the server we actually set up with

346
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:24,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">DHCP first with that so it's got a dhcp</font>

347
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:28,130
server running so these guys can just

348
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:32,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">plug in so the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dns a way that works</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

349
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:35,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">con QR i'm not fully sure but it's sort</font>

350
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:40,520
of setup to automatically redirect any

351
00:18:35,770 --> 00:18:42,530
DNS<font color="#E5E5E5"> requests to this server and so it</font>

352
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:44,780
doesn't care what the<font color="#CCCCCC"> address you're</font>

353
00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:48,440
looking for is so that the first part

354
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:51,980
the HDTV / something / and then you've

355
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:53,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">got your QR code equals this so if you</font>

356
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:57,140
actually like if you have your if you

357
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:59,659
have your code with you take<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and</font>

358
00:18:57,140 --> 00:19:02,210
run it like take<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and run it through a</font>

359
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:06,860
QR scanner and what you'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> see is you'll</font>

360
00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:09,830
see HTTP b-sides DC I think it's besides

361
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:13,219
DC reg and there's no like dot org or

362
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:17,659
anything like that it's just slash ? QR

363
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:21,380
code equals this so it strips all that

364
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:24,410
out and just set and it only really uses

365
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:26,840
that QR code equals this value so it

366
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:29,450
doesn't care it could be as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said it</font>

367
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:32,419
could be food blah and it doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> care</font>

368
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:35,330
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just looking at any requests</font>

369
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:38,900
to DNS it's redirecting that to the con

370
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:43,100
q our server<font color="#E5E5E5"> Python code and saying</font>

371
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:45,130
process this as a QR code yeah no

372
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:45,129
problem

373
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:53,240
there's no<font color="#E5E5E5"> other questions of come on up</font>
