little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit easier and part of the</font>

11
00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:56,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">problem is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we rely a lot on</font>

12
00:00:50,969 --> 00:01:00,059
passwords so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I read a Miss posting for</font>

863 moving past<font color="#E5E5E5"> passwords so really</font>

14
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:04,860
getting rid of passwords all together

15
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:07,260
because generally most people use the

16
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:11,150
passwords their dog or something it's

17
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:14,310
pretty easy to guess or<font color="#CCCCCC"> even you have a</font>

18
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:16,530
multi-factor authentication there's a

19
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:18,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">difference between multi-factor</font>

20
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:21,270
authentication and two factor

21
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:22,889
authentication<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright because when</font>

22
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:25,320
you're looking at the different factors

23
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:27,509
is something you know something you are

24
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:29,460
and something you have if it's two

25
00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:32,189
things you know that it's multi-factor

26
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:34,860
ones to factor something you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

27
00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:37,699
something you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font>

28
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:42,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">research in grad school they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> proposed</font>

29
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:44,540
some ultra secure system and what was

30
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:47,610
the best<font color="#E5E5E5"> way to secure we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> had the</font>

31
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:50,520
architected so why don't we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just used</font>

32
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:52,710
three factor authentication something

33
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:53,970
you know something you haven't something

34
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:55,559
you are

35
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:58,200
you know a password something that's

36
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:01,200
biometric and some sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of token why not</font>

37
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:04,200
an ultra-secure environments and also

38
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:08,250
when we were talking to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> horizon</font>

39
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:10,619
folks they were saying that in every

40
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:14,880
instance in every breach<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they had</font>

41
00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:16,980
investigated when to factor also<font color="#CCCCCC"> an if</font>

42
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:19,710
two-factor authentication had been used

43
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:21,899
properly it would have stopped every

44
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:24,570
breach of day investigate not that

45
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:26,550
that's there's no silver bullet but if

46
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:29,340
you do that it makes it much much harder

47
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:30,630
there were some instances where folks it

48
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:34,650
I can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> believe this happened even</font>

49
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:37,350
though I had some type of multi-factor

50
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:38,700
two-factor authentication the things

51
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:41,400
that they had an implemented correctly

52
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:43,980
so you have to implement it correctly

53
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:46,860
otherwise we can catch them some issues

54
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:48,780
a lot of browsers store passwords how

55
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:54,510
many people have experts in their

56
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:56,190
browsers no ends down<font color="#CCCCCC"> us or password</font>

57
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:58,679
managers and we saw a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> weeks ago</font>

58
00:02:56,190 --> 00:03:01,230
that password managers and can also get

59
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:02,850
breach so what's what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the best thing</font>

60
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:06,630
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do password it's really really tough</font>

61
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:09,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">I read an article someone saying that</font>

62
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:11,280
they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to have some crazy</font>

63
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:12,840
randomized password and they're not

64
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">going to remember</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on purpose every time</font>

65
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:17,940
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> login something the use of</font>

66
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:20,250
password reset feature so yeah okay that

67
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:21,840
might work with us kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of annoying and</font>

68
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:24,150
getting texts and kind of doing a lot of

69
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:26,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but they have identity access</font>

70
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:29,040
systems and password system so you can

71
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:31,260
try to use a single sign-on but

72
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:35,100
personally it does become pretty

73
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:37,260
challenging so how<font color="#E5E5E5"> much how much does</font>

74
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:40,410
breach cuts and this is something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

75
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:41,730
gets talked about a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> and people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

76
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:43,560
going in and doing different types of

77
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:46,470
value assessments and there are

78
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:50,130
different ways of looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the pointy</font>

79
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:54,709
mom is saying that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's seven on average</font>

80
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:54,709
seven million dollars per breach

81
00:03:54,760 --> 00:04:00,548
about half a million dollars this isn't

82
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:04,030
just an average and 221 dollars per

83
00:04:00,549 --> 00:04:05,920
record but then verizon says it you know

84
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:09,129
it's a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit of a sliding scale you</font>

85
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:11,109
get economies of scale as it reaches

86
00:04:09,129 --> 00:04:13,690
bigger than you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> do some different</font>

87
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:17,289
things so they have some ideas<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are</font>

88
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:19,750
going from you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know on the average</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> offer</font>

89
00:04:17,289 --> 00:04:22,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">for 100 records about three hundred and</font>

90
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:26,380
fifty seven dollars<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going all the</font>

91
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:28,270
way down to nobody 100 100 million

92
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:30,400
records and start things to start to get

93
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:34,330
cheap other factors<font color="#CCCCCC"> that i would</font>

94
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:37,388
consider is have you done a tabletop SS

95
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:39,609
do you have an<font color="#E5E5E5"> instant response plan</font>

96
00:04:37,389 --> 00:04:41,830
view plates how are<font color="#CCCCCC"> you going to handle</font>

97
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:43,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">key are some things that kind of a</font>

98
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:45,490
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> outside of security that can</font>

99
00:04:43,539 --> 00:04:48,820
help reduce<font color="#E5E5E5"> the cost because you know</font>

100
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:51,160
exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> what to do who called good</font>

101
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:53,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">content that you have instant response</font>

102
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:55,479
on retainer even better that<font color="#E5E5E5"> way you</font>

103
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:59,260
won't have to wait you can bring them in

104
00:04:55,479 --> 00:05:01,900
and get to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> rooftops and all this</font>

105
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:05,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">traces back because you know advanced</font>

106
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:07,630
threats are really<font color="#E5E5E5"> really hard to define</font>

107
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:10,150
so this is from the mandiant report on

108
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:13,409
the right side every breach that they

109
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:17,948
investigated valid credentials were used

110
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:19,389
they were we have a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> time the bad</font>

111
00:05:17,949 --> 00:05:22,990
guys<font color="#CCCCCC"> right there for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a really really</font>

112
00:05:19,389 --> 00:05:25,330
long time so it's a huge gap in in

113
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:28,300
detection and most of the time

114
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:29,979
sixty-seven percent in this study it's

115
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:31,810
not you saying oh my<font color="#CCCCCC"> god we've got to</font>

116
00:05:29,979 --> 00:05:33,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">reach some three-letter agencies</font>

117
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:36,910
knocking on the door and saying you're

118
00:05:33,789 --> 00:05:39,940
David I've is on some Eastern European

119
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:43,510
serve Russia needs to be anywhere<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

120
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:45,940
but external entities are<font color="#E5E5E5"> note are</font>

121
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:48,969
notifying you that your data is out

122
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:50,820
there somewhere<font color="#CCCCCC"> and this is coming from</font>

123
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:53,130
your cyber criminals

124
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:56,340
are looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make a buck off of your</font>

125
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:57,810
data nation-states this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

126
00:05:56,340 --> 00:06:00,210
it's a little bit part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to</font>

127
00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:02,610
embarrass the country or embarrass the

128
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:04,950
organization for political reasons and

129
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:10,260
then insider threats which are just

130
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:13,289
really really hard to detect so that's

131
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:17,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">what we run this it's kind of a workshop</font>

132
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:20,640
where we traced back through through a

133
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:24,210
kill chain and what's happening is an

134
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:27,960
attacker is a brute forcing a website

135
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:30,750
steals a legitimate PDF he attaches

136
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:34,710
malware to the PDF<font color="#E5E5E5"> spear fishes and</font>

137
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:37,740
employee the repeated actually has the

138
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:41,460
notion of obfuscation so we can spawn

139
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:44,490
multiple processes so it's a PDF<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a</font>

140
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:48,770
vulnerable application the PDF is going

00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:51,270
on Hal<font color="#E5E5E5"> EMC which spawns an svchost.exe</font>

145
00:06:56,490 --> 00:07:02,190
you really get in there oh but the way

146
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:05,940
that we trace it back is because the

147
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:08,460
svchost.exe reaches out to known bad

148
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:10,290
command control so we catch it with

149
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:11,849
threat intelligence and if you didn't

150
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:14,790
know any better way to say hey let's

151
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:16,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">just go ahead and wipe that machine but</font>

152
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:18,240
if you're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get really high</font>

153
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:20,880
fidelity information from of your

154
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:23,370
systems you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can get down to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> root also</font>

155
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:25,350
get the example we use a free tool from

156
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:28,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">Microsoft</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's called microsoft</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> system</font>

157
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:33,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">on which is a pretty neat because it's</font>

158
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:36,300
able to<font color="#CCCCCC"> map the network communication to</font>

159
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:39,020
a process ID and then it's also able to

160
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:41,910
detect parent child and grandchild

161
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:45,299
processes or who's on in what so we

162
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:46,920
catch the perpetrator on no valid threat

163
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:49,620
intelligence and we trace it back

164
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:52,229
through the syslog data and

165
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:56,430
do it on this one we trace it back<font color="#E5E5E5"> when</font>

166
00:07:52,229 --> 00:07:59,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">we say hey we know that svchost.exe on</font>

167
00:07:56,430 --> 00:08:01,830
the communication that's going out to

168
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:06,000
see two and then we looked at me see

169
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:09,719
that svchost.exe was created from kalka

170
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:13,380
exe and cobb emc was created from the

171
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:15,930
PDF from the PDF we look across that

172
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:17,909
individual and we are simply also have

173
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:21,150
his email data we're able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see hey</font>

174
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:24,180
this came into an email we trace it back

175
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:26,969
to the mail server and we see that five

176
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:29,370
other people also receive an email with

177
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:31,380
the same attachment with the same

178
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:33,750
information inside but they haven't

179
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:35,640
opened it yet so we can go to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> mail</font>

180
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:38,669
server and delete that email before

181
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:40,468
these other systems get infected so

182
00:08:38,669 --> 00:08:42,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're this is kind of a power of being</font>

183
00:08:40,469 --> 00:08:44,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">able to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to root cause and then we</font>

184
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:46,610
look for that file we see that it's also

185
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:49,200
on your server and we see that some

186
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:50,730
suspicious information on multiple

187
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,320
requests coming into a server and that's

188
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:53,880
how you can trace it back but just the

189
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,550
importance of having the right data and

190
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:59,640
being able to get all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the way back</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

191
00:08:56,550 --> 00:09:01,589
the root cause and this is why kind of

192
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:03,800
everybody talks about the kill chain but

193
00:09:01,589 --> 00:09:06,170
when you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> through that process</font>

194
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:08,550
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> going through delivery</font>

195
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:11,099
exploitation and installation usually

196
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:12,959
it's coming from some sort of human

197
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:15,870
interaction in this example it's a PDF

198
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:18,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">it could be a browser exploit because</font>

199
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:21,060
you're running an old version<font color="#E5E5E5"> of chrome</font>

200
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:26,130
firefox and explorer so are you name all

201
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:28,979
the exploits of running an<font color="#E5E5E5"> older job and</font>

202
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:30,900
then your attacker is going to not just

203
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:34,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">get in there but also establish some</font>

204
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:35,939
tools building some back doors and then

205
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:37,890
start to move laterally<font color="#CCCCCC"> within the</font>

206
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:40,050
environment which usually most

207
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:42,689
organizations have a hard exterior shell

208
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:45,420
and soft<font color="#E5E5E5"> and warm and gushy on the</font>

209
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:47,520
inside and then you can get hop around

210
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:49,680
from one area to another one gather

211
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:50,910
information collect it and then

212
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,680
exfiltrated and there are a lot of

213
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:55,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">different ways that you can exfiltrate</font>

214
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:56,819
data you can and usually they're going

215
00:09:55,020 --> 00:10:01,230
to do it through ports that they know

216
00:09:56,820 --> 00:10:02,850
are open so what's open 8443 sometimes

217
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:05,670
ICMP

218
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:07,589
so there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are ways</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that you can pad data</font>

219
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:11,009
that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to exfiltrate inside of</font>

220
00:10:07,589 --> 00:10:13,709
DNS data or you can hide it inside of

221
00:10:11,009 --> 00:10:15,569
ICMP data you can encrypt it and get it

222
00:10:13,709 --> 00:10:18,449
out through<font color="#E5E5E5"> 4 43 so there are a lot of</font>

223
00:10:15,569 --> 00:10:21,329
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> ways you can get data</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out and</font>

224
00:10:18,449 --> 00:10:23,459
if you have the right data and you're

225
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:27,709
analyzing it then you're able to piece

226
00:10:23,459 --> 00:10:29,910
together the entire story going<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

227
00:10:27,709 --> 00:10:32,130
threat intelligence type<font color="#CCCCCC"> of information</font>

228
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:34,920
where you know there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are paid there's</font>

229
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:36,660
free and it gets a little bit noisy so

230
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,860
you have to figure<font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how you're going</font>

231
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:39,899
to rank the different threat

232
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:41,339
intelligence feeds and give them

233
00:10:39,899 --> 00:10:42,990
different types of priority so you're

234
00:10:41,339 --> 00:10:45,720
not getting inundated with information

235
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:47,940
that's heading your way you know

236
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:50,819
firewall information so what's what's

237
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:52,980
normal transmission for this user has

238
00:10:50,819 --> 00:10:54,750
this user ever transmitted this amount

239
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:56,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">of data before has this device ever</font>

240
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:58,230
transmitted a certain amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of data</font>

241
00:10:56,610 --> 00:11:01,980
before and can<font color="#E5E5E5"> we correlate that with</font>

242
00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:04,680
other information that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're seeing if</font>

243
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:06,329
we can get endpoint data great you know

244
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:09,120
what processes are being spun under

245
00:11:06,329 --> 00:11:11,430
there any rare or unique processes that

246
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:13,019
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> seeing are those automatically</font>

247
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:15,180
being compared against things like

248
00:11:13,019 --> 00:11:18,000
virustotal which we know that is going

249
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:20,370
to be a very very high fidelity does

250
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,199
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> system have a vulnerability</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

251
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:24,449
that exploit on it you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know it's kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

252
00:11:22,199 --> 00:11:27,719
<font color="#CCCCCC">trip bringing all these things two</font>

253
00:11:24,449 --> 00:11:31,469
together and then also combining some

254
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:32,970
sort of contextual information because

255
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:35,399
you know all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the computer systems they</font>

256
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:37,470
don't know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this one server has PII</font>

257
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:39,000
data and the other server has the

258
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:41,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">pictures for the company picnic</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on it</font>

259
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:44,970
not too<font color="#E5E5E5"> big of a deal of it here huge</font>

260
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:48,449
deal over here and just connecting the

261
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:50,699
dots being able to zoom in pivot through

262
00:11:48,449 --> 00:11:53,160
all this information really really

263
00:11:50,699 --> 00:11:54,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">quickly so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you can perform an</font>

264
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:57,689
investigation and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> isn't hey let me</font>

265
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:59,518
write some search click a button go get

266
00:11:57,689 --> 00:12:02,219
coffee and<font color="#E5E5E5"> come back it has to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> come back</font>

267
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:04,139
within say about five seconds is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

268
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:06,779
reasonable<font color="#CCCCCC"> amount so that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font>

269
00:12:04,139 --> 00:12:09,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">perform a deep deep investigation going</font>

270
00:12:06,779 --> 00:12:12,059
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know known bad</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> c2</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> malware or</font>

271
00:12:09,689 --> 00:12:13,529
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of what are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all the different dots</font>

272
00:12:12,059 --> 00:12:15,809
and making sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you can</font>

273
00:12:13,529 --> 00:12:18,420
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> go through and collect them and</font>

274
00:12:15,809 --> 00:12:21,569
that doesn't address the issue with

275
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:23,279
insider threats because now you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

276
00:12:21,569 --> 00:12:27,599
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to exploit anything there's</font>

277
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:30,260
no cyber security controls that are in

278
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:32,699
there that we're violating any type of

279
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:34,920
you know we're not using malware we're

280
00:12:32,699 --> 00:12:37,050
not using exploits so we have an insider

281
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:39,599
has access to<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the data and is</font>

282
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:41,219
getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> the data out so when can we</font>

283
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:44,309
actually detect that how can<font color="#CCCCCC"> we detect</font>

284
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:48,720
that so<font color="#E5E5E5"> really there's a new approach</font>

285
00:12:44,309 --> 00:12:50,610
that needs to be used so combining the

286
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:53,250
people process and technology using

287
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:56,459
behavior based components so what's

288
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:58,589
normal for every<font color="#E5E5E5"> single user as humans</font>

289
00:12:56,459 --> 00:13:00,599
were you know we're creatures of habit

290
00:12:58,589 --> 00:13:04,410
most of the time we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do the</font>

291
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:07,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">same thing over and over login connect</font>

292
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:09,059
the VPN go on confluence update

293
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:11,490
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that when does the behavior</font>

294
00:13:09,059 --> 00:13:13,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually start to change and when it</font>

295
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:16,019
changes we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be able to call that</font>

296
00:13:13,769 --> 00:13:21,149
out and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then be able to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at it</font>

297
00:13:16,019 --> 00:13:24,720
and analyze it be able to share and

298
00:13:21,149 --> 00:13:27,240
collaborate so right now when you look

299
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:29,189
at if you if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> look at kind of the</font>

300
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:32,399
dark web and see what's happening in

301
00:13:29,189 --> 00:13:34,860
dark IRC channels they're sharing their

302
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:36,870
information really really well they'll

303
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:38,819
say you know what this exploits

304
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:41,519
available on this server for this

305
00:13:38,819 --> 00:13:44,130
company everybody rushes in there it's

306
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:47,399
like a<font color="#E5E5E5"> smash-and-grab but on our side</font>

307
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:48,870
when somebody gets hacked they keep all

308
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:51,149
that information and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they don't really</font>

309
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:54,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to share exactly what they did what</font>

310
00:13:51,149 --> 00:13:57,600
happened so on there and they're able to

311
00:13:54,620 --> 00:14:00,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">operationalize their attacks and we're</font>

312
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:02,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">helping them by not sharing the attack</font>

313
00:14:00,149 --> 00:14:04,800
patterns we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> starting to do some</font>

314
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:07,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">things with you know the different ice</font>

315
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:10,019
axe that are out there but that's just I

316
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:12,630
p addresses going outbound and<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

317
00:14:10,019 --> 00:14:15,029
get into<font color="#E5E5E5"> it a little bit but if we can</font>

318
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:18,720
get to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the point where we're sharing</font>

319
00:14:15,029 --> 00:14:21,870
their TTP's or tactics techniques and

320
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:23,819
processes and export<font color="#CCCCCC"> them and be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

321
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:26,370
share that<font color="#E5E5E5"> really quickly then they'll</font>

322
00:14:23,819 --> 00:14:28,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">have to rewrite their malware that'll</font>

323
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:29,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it a lot more expensive for them</font>

324
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:31,890
and then the

325
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:34,680
go do something<font color="#CCCCCC"> else that's that's</font>

326
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:37,800
easier so sharing collaborating is

327
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:40,469
critical talk we talked about analyzing

328
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:44,550
all the data and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then leveraging IOC and</font>

329
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:46,470
threat<font color="#E5E5E5"> Intel information so you know</font>

330
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:49,319
that we've highlighted the threats are

331
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:52,200
definitely out there the lack of people

332
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:55,620
is is huge so we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to do</font>

333
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:58,530
more with with less people and it has<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

334
00:14:55,620 --> 00:15:02,160
be efficient so we can't get inundated

335
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:05,010
with millions and millions of alerts in

336
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:07,949
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the target breach they had 80,000</font>

337
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:09,870
alerts telling them about that attack so

338
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:11,910
that they weren't able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get to all of</font>

339
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:13,920
them so they<font color="#CCCCCC"> just kind of let them let</font>

340
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:15,870
them fall by the wayside and the old

341
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:19,920
paradigm<font color="#E5E5E5"> which worked really well for a</font>

342
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:21,570
long time is let's build new rules let's

343
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:23,849
build<font color="#E5E5E5"> different types of signatures and</font>

344
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:26,760
then we'll analyze all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> information</font>

345
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:28,830
as it's coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> in but we can't keep</font>

346
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:31,500
writing more and more correlation rules

347
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:33,120
it just doesn't scale so every day<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

348
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:35,460
look at see what's going out there

349
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,450
create a new correlation rule import it

350
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:41,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">and just kind of going through that</font>

351
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:44,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">process the new paradigm what I'm seeing</font>

352
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:47,270
at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> is using data science and</font>

353
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:50,220
machine learning to help operationalize

354
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:52,620
what's normal for every user kind of

355
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:54,000
baseline that<font color="#E5E5E5"> entire behavior and then</font>

356
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:56,040
start to call out different types of

357
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:59,100
anomalies and in being able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that</font>

358
00:15:56,040 --> 00:16:00,540
in near<font color="#CCCCCC"> real-time is is the real is the</font>

359
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:02,730
big trick there so you need to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

360
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:04,800
big data foundation and then you're

361
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:07,410
incorporating security analytics and

362
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:10,020
using machine learning what this lets

363
00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:11,930
you do is find<font color="#CCCCCC"> unknown threats attack</font>

364
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:17,010
patterns that we haven't even seen yet

365
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:18,930
so if I'm able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> say that one user is</font>

366
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:21,410
now doing something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's different</font>

367
00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:24,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">that he that he hasn't done before and</font>

368
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:26,370
that user is touching one system and a

369
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:28,109
different system we might<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able just</font>

370
00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:30,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">from the anomalies just because you're</font>

371
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:31,920
deviating from of the behavior<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

372
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:34,500
might be an attack pattern that hasn't

373
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:37,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">been seen before so really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is the</font>

374
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:40,080
focus around looking for unknown threats

375
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:41,760
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're not really using</font>

376
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:43,459
signatures anymore if you're if you're

377
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:47,379
using<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're taking this approach</font>

378
00:16:43,459 --> 00:16:50,660
we're baselining every entity users

379
00:16:47,379 --> 00:16:52,850
devices applications what's normal for

380
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:55,100
all these different systems and when is

381
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:57,050
there an anomaly and that's kind of what

382
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:59,240
allow you to find different<font color="#E5E5E5"> types of</font>

383
00:16:57,050 --> 00:17:01,579
unknown threats and when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

384
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:03,290
baselining really you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to map the</font>

385
00:17:01,579 --> 00:17:05,209
different behaviors to different models

386
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:07,639
and there are two ways<font color="#CCCCCC"> to approach this</font>

387
00:17:05,209 --> 00:17:10,069
two<font color="#E5E5E5"> different types of machine learning</font>

388
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:11,600
processes the first one is supervised

389
00:17:10,069 --> 00:17:15,849
machine learning where you're going to

390
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:19,279
grab a particular data set analyze it

391
00:17:15,849 --> 00:17:21,289
and then you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to train the model I</font>

392
00:17:19,279 --> 00:17:24,260
said that there's always a level an

393
00:17:21,289 --> 00:17:26,779
acceptable level of false positives and

394
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:28,339
false negatives so where is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> line</font>

395
00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:30,049
okay I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want to get too many false</font>

396
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:32,178
positives<font color="#E5E5E5"> but i also</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to miss</font>

397
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:33,950
something so where do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you draw</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that line</font>

398
00:17:32,179 --> 00:17:36,080
so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to test it and then you</font>

399
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:37,970
apply an algorithm and then you have

400
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,678
<font color="#E5E5E5">finally a product you verify that this</font>

401
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:41,620
is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work correctly and then</font>

402
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:45,260
you're able to put it<font color="#CCCCCC"> into production</font>

403
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:47,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">and this is critical to be able to</font>

404
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:51,529
detect mobile indicators of compromise

405
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:54,129
so kind of looking at<font color="#E5E5E5"> it from just</font>

406
00:17:51,529 --> 00:17:56,240
command and control perspective

407
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:57,380
attackers that are smart enough malware

408
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:01,010
that's smart enough is going to be

409
00:17:57,380 --> 00:18:03,200
hopping<font color="#CCCCCC"> their their command-and-control</font>

410
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:07,190
servers so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'll be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going from one server</font>

411
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:09,770
to another one if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> only looking at</font>

412
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:12,500
known bad<font color="#CCCCCC"> c2 that's the you'll kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

413
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:15,110
create some blind spots if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can look</font>

414
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:17,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">at the actual behavior the moment that</font>

415
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:19,789
an insider starts doing things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they</font>

416
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:21,320
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> normally do or that they become</font>

417
00:18:19,789 --> 00:18:24,770
compromised because those two things are

418
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:26,360
relatively similar a compromise user and

419
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:28,460
a user<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's trying to do something bad</font>

420
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:30,408
they're behaving in similar ways they're

421
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:34,010
doing things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they haven't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> seen</font>

422
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:36,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">before so in using behavior is really</font>

423
00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:40,190
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> critical and then finally without</font>

424
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:42,169
actually going in and having to look at

425
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:44,770
the data and massage the data there's

426
00:18:42,169 --> 00:18:46,700
unsupervised machine learning so

427
00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:49,010
unsupervised machine learning is going

428
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:51,770
to label and categorize the data

429
00:18:49,010 --> 00:18:53,899
automatically without the need for human

430
00:18:51,770 --> 00:18:55,129
feedback because remember that the

431
00:18:53,899 --> 00:18:57,139
original<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea is that we don't have</font>

432
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:57,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">enough time to keep writing more and</font>

433
00:18:57,139 --> 00:18:59,979
more

434
00:18:57,460 --> 00:19:01,480
relation rules that doesn't scale there

435
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:04,779
aren't enough talent at security folks

436
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:06,820
to go around so<font color="#E5E5E5"> creating some machine</font>

437
00:19:04,779 --> 00:19:09,159
learning system that you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> train</font>

438
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:10,960
kind of ties back to that issue so if

439
00:19:09,159 --> 00:19:12,279
you look you've using unsupervised

440
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,740
machine learning it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

441
00:19:12,279 --> 00:19:16,750
automatically learn it'll know when the

442
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:18,490
model is stabilized it'll know when the

443
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:21,720
model is ready and then it will start to

444
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:26,460
call out different types of anomalies

445
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:29,830
another<font color="#CCCCCC"> know I talked a lot of CEOs and</font>

446
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:31,870
enciso and they<font color="#E5E5E5"> always say no know</font>

447
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:34,029
thyself kind of know everything that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

448
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:36,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">have in your environment but I kind of</font>

449
00:19:34,029 --> 00:19:40,690
take that one step<font color="#E5E5E5"> further and I say</font>

450
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:43,539
hack thyself so<font color="#E5E5E5"> really scan everything</font>

451
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:46,149
with credentials or with agents get that

452
00:19:43,539 --> 00:19:48,039
deeper level of understanding of what

453
00:19:46,149 --> 00:19:51,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">the security weaknesses are on those</font>

454
00:19:48,039 --> 00:19:53,049
systems and really pen test it so pen

455
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:55,990
testing is a term that gets thrown

456
00:19:53,049 --> 00:20:00,220
around a lot but<font color="#E5E5E5"> pen testing is trying</font>

457
00:19:55,990 --> 00:20:02,409
to exploit a vulnerability I've had some

458
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:04,390
folks that say they wanted a pen test

459
00:20:02,409 --> 00:20:07,120
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then it turns out they just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want a</font>

460
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:09,909
vulnerability scan so kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of making it</font>

461
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:13,389
clear differentiation their fish your

462
00:20:09,909 --> 00:20:15,429
employees I used to it was so long time

463
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:18,090
ago I worked at a bank in Southern

464
00:20:15,429 --> 00:20:22,169
California and I had one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my employees</font>

465
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:24,668
who was a member service representative

466
00:20:22,169 --> 00:20:26,890
she was probably the least technical

467
00:20:24,669 --> 00:20:30,429
technically savvy person that I've ever

468
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:33,130
met and we ran a fishing campaign and we

469
00:20:30,429 --> 00:20:34,870
fished her we called her she opened up

470
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:37,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">the command prompt and started running</font>

471
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:39,969
commands but it really is once<font color="#E5E5E5"> bitten</font>

472
00:20:37,779 --> 00:20:41,770
twice shy because from that point

473
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:44,740
forward anything that popped<font color="#E5E5E5"> up on her</font>

474
00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:47,860
computer she<font color="#CCCCCC"> was calling security and</font>

475
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:50,110
saying hey is this<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so when you fish</font>

476
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:51,639
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> employees it's not to trick them you</font>

477
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:54,428
know that's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of the mentality</font>

478
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:55,750
it's let's make sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this is what</font>

479
00:20:54,429 --> 00:20:57,789
attackers would do and let's make<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure</font>

480
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:59,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll be able to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> catch those things</font>

481
00:20:57,789 --> 00:21:03,429
then provide training you know kind of

482
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:06,820
just um some common sense goes a really

483
00:21:03,429 --> 00:21:09,460
really long way and we provide USB drops

484
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:10,790
so I get really<font color="#CCCCCC"> nervous when people are</font>

485
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:14,120
just passing around us

486
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:16,460
he sticks I've played a little bit

487
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:19,070
around with rubber ducky and I see what

488
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:22,190
it can do you can commit<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can take</font>

489
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:24,679
over systems pretty easily by bypassing

490
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:26,930
USB sticks around and probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

491
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:29,750
the most famous attacks Stuxnet it was

492
00:21:26,930 --> 00:21:34,550
air-gapped<font color="#CCCCCC"> Iranian nuclear centrifuge</font>

493
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:35,930
how to get in there USB so you us and

494
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:38,600
use these kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> an impressive</font>

495
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:41,330
technology also it goes back to Pentium

496
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:44,629
to MMX if anybody can<font color="#CCCCCC"> remember</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that so</font>

497
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:46,429
USB has been around for at least 20

498
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:48,800
years<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I know like another technology</font>

499
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:51,200
it's been around for that long but pass

500
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:52,879
around USB sticks drop<font color="#E5E5E5"> them in the</font>

501
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,650
hallways put them in the bathroom even

502
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:57,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">though that's kind of gross and see if</font>

503
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:59,450
somebody's going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to grab it and put it</font>

504
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:01,330
into their computer and let them know

505
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:04,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">like hey you shouldn't have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> done that</font>

506
00:22:01,330 --> 00:22:06,889
don't be putting us v6 or you know put

507
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:10,910
crazy glue on them or<font color="#CCCCCC"> something and then</font>

508
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:14,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">social engineering so drive up to to the</font>

509
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:17,330
shop with AT&T or Verizon shirt and the

510
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:19,700
truck and say hey the you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> see so or</font>

511
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:21,560
CIO told me that I need to install this

512
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:22,850
it's really important are they going to

513
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:26,899
let<font color="#E5E5E5"> him and give are they going to give</font>

514
00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:29,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">him access to the data room or not so</font>

515
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:31,520
pack myself make sure that when you when

516
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:37,190
you're doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> this it has to be strategic</font>

517
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:39,290
and comprehensive so when i was when i

518
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:41,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">was at rapid7 we sold pen testing</font>

519
00:22:39,290 --> 00:22:44,300
services and you know how<font color="#E5E5E5"> many times</font>

520
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:46,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">people wanted a pen test but really the</font>

521
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:47,810
like yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> but don't exploit anything</font>

522
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:50,570
like well that's not that's not a real

523
00:22:47,810 --> 00:22:53,750
pen test in one instance there was an

524
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:57,040
organization who we<font color="#CCCCCC"> did a pen test</font>

525
00:22:53,750 --> 00:23:00,170
against their their web application and

526
00:22:57,040 --> 00:23:03,020
everything looked good three months

527
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:05,690
later that web application gets hacked

528
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:07,420
gets breached and they said<font color="#CCCCCC"> well yeah</font>

529
00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:10,730
you guys gave<font color="#E5E5E5"> us a clean bill of health</font>

530
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:13,340
what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on here and we go back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

531
00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:15,640
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> look and we didn't actually pen test</font>

532
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:18,860
the application that was in production

533
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:22,400
we pen tested the test application weep

534
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:24,439
weep and tested pre-production

535
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:26,900
so waking apprentice pre-production is

536
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:30,680
you can't you see is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not that it's not</font>

537
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:33,320
an exact copy I've highly recommend pen

538
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:37,280
testing and production<font color="#E5E5E5"> do it do it</font>

539
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:40,850
during down hours maintenance windows if

540
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:47,030
not you give<font color="#CCCCCC"> yourself a huge huge blind</font>

541
00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:49,219
spot sharing is caring so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mentioned</font>

542
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:52,040
this earlier so what<font color="#CCCCCC"> can we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do to</font>

543
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:53,810
disrupt the techniques that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bad guys</font>

544
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:58,190
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to use against us we need a</font>

545
00:23:53,810 --> 00:24:00,350
way to export their techniques and then

546
00:23:58,190 --> 00:24:04,940
share that so that somebody can import

547
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:07,699
those those techniques things like ice

548
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:10,610
axe help you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> solter edge and other</font>

549
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:13,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">industries and I kind of see different</font>

550
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:16,189
organizations starting to band together

551
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:18,590
whether its large healthcare providers

552
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:21,040
they have a color and are all talking

553
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:23,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">together and I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> great or</font>

554
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:25,940
organizations and they go by their

555
00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:28,940
football affiliations or sports

556
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:31,490
affiliations the big 12 and all those

557
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:34,070
different organizations they get

558
00:24:31,490 --> 00:24:36,080
together and they say we should share

559
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:38,990
our information is starting to get there

560
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:43,730
but there isn't an easy way to do that

561
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:44,960
yet but you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know we're starting to get</font>

562
00:24:43,730 --> 00:24:48,170
the people<font color="#E5E5E5"> are starting to think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

563
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:50,300
way because when we actually get this

564
00:24:48,170 --> 00:24:53,210
stuff together and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we start</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing it</font>

565
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:55,460
correctly it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make it so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> much</font>

566
00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:58,550
more difficult will pretty much be able

567
00:24:55,460 --> 00:25:01,070
to exterminate a certain variant of

568
00:24:58,550 --> 00:25:03,200
malware because they all kind of follow

569
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:04,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">the same patterns and if we're able to</font>

570
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:07,370
say whenever we see this pattern

571
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:09,500
automatically detect it or automatically

572
00:25:07,370 --> 00:25:12,409
stop it even<font color="#CCCCCC"> better then they'll have to</font>

573
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:15,710
change and rewrite that entire malware

574
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:17,660
or those those exploits this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font>

575
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:19,940
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we talk a lot about at</font>

576
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:23,980
splunk is listen listen to your data

577
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:28,700
have a realistic vision of where you are

578
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:31,790
talk to see so a couple weeks ago and he

579
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:34,100
said you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're pretty</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> good we feel</font>

580
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:35,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">it we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> feel like we're pretty good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

581
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:38,830
cool do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have</font>

582
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:42,699
centralized logging yeah the logs are on

583
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:44,320
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> servers like no like centralized</font>

584
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:45,820
logging that means that all of<font color="#CCCCCC"> your logs</font>

585
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:48,070
your server logs should be going

586
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:51,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">somewhere for analysis and for</font>

587
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:54,309
correlation instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of wrapping system</font>

588
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:55,990
by system like it that that just doesn't

589
00:25:54,309 --> 00:25:59,320
make any sense and if the bigger you are

590
00:25:55,990 --> 00:26:02,800
that should really be something to focus

591
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:05,439
on so having unrealistic visions on yeah

592
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:07,290
we're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay when you're not doing</font>

593
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:10,780
the the basics is really really tough

594
00:26:07,290 --> 00:26:13,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">and have a path to have a vision have a</font>

595
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:15,639
strategy have a roadmap<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the</font>

596
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:19,600
organization<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> security</font>

597
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:21,970
organization we talked a lot at splunk

598
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:23,740
that all data is security relevant the

599
00:26:21,970 --> 00:26:25,210
moment<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you say oh well that data is</font>

600
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:27,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">not that important i'm not going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to take</font>

601
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:29,470
a look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that data that's when the</font>

602
00:26:27,309 --> 00:26:31,059
attackers will figure out a way to

603
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:33,780
leverage that<font color="#E5E5E5"> data that you're not</font>

604
00:26:31,059 --> 00:26:36,850
listening<font color="#CCCCCC"> to and use that against you</font>

605
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:39,580
and you if you don't have the data you

606
00:26:36,850 --> 00:26:41,830
can't perform<font color="#E5E5E5"> an investigation so the</font>

607
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:44,860
locked<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk to some law enforcement</font>

608
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:47,199
agencies and whenever they go into a

609
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:49,689
place<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's been breached the very</font>

610
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:51,280
first<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is no do you have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> splunk if</font>

611
00:26:49,690 --> 00:26:53,710
they have<font color="#CCCCCC"> splunk they hand them these</font>

612
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:56,230
searches<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay great I run these searches</font>

613
00:26:53,710 --> 00:26:59,650
to see if you have these patterns so the

614
00:26:56,230 --> 00:27:01,420
bits and pieces of exporting certain a

615
00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:05,170
certain things certain searches is

616
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:08,770
starting to get there and this is taken

617
00:27:05,170 --> 00:27:11,410
from the sands threat hunting summit on

618
00:27:08,770 --> 00:27:13,480
you know everybody's talking about throw

619
00:27:11,410 --> 00:27:15,880
hunting right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now but it's all you can't</font>

620
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:18,040
threat hunt everything so where do you

621
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:20,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">start your threat hunting kind of on the</font>

622
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:23,260
left side is ad hoc searching<font color="#CCCCCC"> over this</font>

623
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:24,850
computer is really slow right now let's

624
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:27,190
see what's going on there let's comb

625
00:27:24,850 --> 00:27:29,530
through the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the logs in the data or</font>

626
00:27:27,190 --> 00:27:31,300
you've centralized it and you're

627
00:27:29,530 --> 00:27:33,280
starting to do some statistical analysis

628
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:35,350
maybe you find a mean you find two

629
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:37,120
standard deviations out where are the

630
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:40,360
outliers you can use visualization

631
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:43,479
technique so put it on some fancy graph

632
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:45,729
or chart or 3d whatever you can get your

633
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:48,640
hands on and see you know when there are

634
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:49,720
there any spikes aggregation is just

635
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:52,390
correlation so

636
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:54,490
having multiple data sources and you

637
00:27:52,390 --> 00:27:57,550
know when something with fire and

638
00:27:54,490 --> 00:27:59,500
something on<font color="#E5E5E5"> my firewall and a server</font>

639
00:27:57,550 --> 00:28:01,210
log of a certain type and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have</font>

640
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:03,520
vulnerability<font color="#CCCCCC"> on that system that has an</font>

641
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:05,020
exploit out there for it boom you know

642
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:06,400
those<font color="#CCCCCC"> things all line up then this is</font>

643
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:09,000
something that's really really important

644
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:13,030
and then kind of the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> most mature</font>

645
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:16,810
phase is grabbing all that data modeling

646
00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:20,710
it looking for anomalies using machine

647
00:28:16,810 --> 00:28:22,990
learning and data science so kind of

648
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:25,300
where<font color="#E5E5E5"> where are different folks on the</font>

649
00:28:22,990 --> 00:28:27,880
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the path so very first part is search</font>

650
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:30,659
and investigate from there they'll move

651
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:33,610
on to proactive monitoring and alerting

652
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:36,700
then you have security situational

653
00:28:33,610 --> 00:28:39,070
awareness and then finally real-time

654
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:41,020
risk inside where you're able to almost

655
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:43,480
predict the different things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are</font>

656
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:46,510
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to happen because you've not just</font>

657
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:49,030
gotten the different iocs from different

658
00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:51,250
areas but you've built in your own<font color="#CCCCCC"> IOC's</font>

659
00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:52,870
also and you're starting to start to

660
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:54,640
create<font color="#E5E5E5"> your own threat intelligence and</font>

661
00:28:52,870 --> 00:28:58,300
that's when you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> becoming more</font>

662
00:28:54,640 --> 00:29:01,840
and more proactive so couple takeaways

663
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:04,090
for wrap up here number one there

664
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:07,030
they're coming<font color="#CCCCCC"> for us you know the data</font>

665
00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:09,220
is there<font color="#CCCCCC"> the data is worth money they're</font>

666
00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:12,450
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the business they are definitely</font>

667
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:14,440
trying to to get rich off of this

668
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:17,800
machine learning is something that's

669
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:20,500
that's critical when you're able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go</font>

670
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:22,030
beyond correlation and use machine

671
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:24,360
learning as a place to<font color="#E5E5E5"> start your threat</font>

672
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:27,280
hunting you can really go much deeper

673
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:30,340
hack thyself make sure that your pen

674
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:32,200
test and what you're doing around trying

675
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:34,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">to take advantage of security weaknesses</font>

676
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:37,150
and also talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the different people</font>

677
00:29:34,810 --> 00:29:40,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are in the organization make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font>

678
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:44,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">that they're a strategic</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> incomprehensive</font>

679
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:47,100
and and share share in use so cyber

680
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:50,530
security is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a competitive advantage</font>

681
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:52,719
if you're kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of hiding all the secrets</font>

682
00:29:50,530 --> 00:29:54,460
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> say exactly what you</font>

683
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:56,020
did but<font color="#E5E5E5"> just different those different</font>

684
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:57,940
techniques the more that we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> share</font>

685
00:29:56,020 --> 00:30:00,100
that's where it's going to make it much

686
00:29:57,940 --> 00:30:02,500
more expensive and much more difficult

687
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:04,449
for four attackers and be

688
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:08,680
realistic of you know where you<font color="#E5E5E5"> are and</font>

689
00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:10,930
how you could possibly improve this is

690
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:12,820
just a standard<font color="#CCCCCC"> splunk side but these</font>

691
00:30:10,930 --> 00:30:15,580
are the<font color="#E5E5E5"> different services and products</font>

692
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:18,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we offer and if you'd</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk</font>

693
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:20,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">to me after just i'll be up here thank</font>

694
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:20,340
you
