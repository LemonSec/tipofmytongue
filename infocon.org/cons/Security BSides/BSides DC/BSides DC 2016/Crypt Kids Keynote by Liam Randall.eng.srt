30
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,890
huge honor to get asked to give a

right a kid's cryptic on you know when

33
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,939
we're when we're talking about security

34
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:40,320
I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to sort of think about you know</font>

35
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:41,610
what is our real goal here today you

36
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,189
know we're gonna we're going to learn

37
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:45,720
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have a good time we're</font>

38
00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:47,158
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to spend</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with the</font>

39
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:49,110
community maybe we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

40
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:51,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">experiment with some new things and</font>

41
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:53,700
we're going to build<font color="#CCCCCC"> relationships with</font>

42
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:55,649
not only the people we brought but

43
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:56,880
perhaps with new people we're gonna have

44
00:01:55,649 --> 00:01:59,969
a chance to share what we're passionate

45
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:01,890
about if you think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the parents</font>

46
00:01:59,969 --> 00:02:03,570
here we're probably in technology in

47
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:05,880
some way so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's something that we're</font>

48
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:08,459
really incredibly passionate about and

49
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:10,049
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> our opportunity to continue to</font>

50
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:11,940
share those passions with our kids with

51
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:13,440
like-minded adults it's a really unique

52
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:16,109
community and one of the main

53
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:18,420
reasons<font color="#E5E5E5"> why my wife and I just relocated</font>

54
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:21,030
out to the Northern Virginia area for a

55
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:23,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">long time I've commuted globally for bro</font>

56
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:25,860
training and other events but we're

57
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:28,079
local now and it was a big push for me

58
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:30,510
was that I wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be near community</font>

59
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:33,210
of people like<font color="#E5E5E5"> nova hackers and other</font>

60
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:35,700
orgs that were interested<font color="#E5E5E5"> in doing these</font>

61
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:38,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of things so with community in mind</font>

62
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:39,720
I wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> start by plugging a few of</font>

63
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:41,910
the open source projects that I'm

64
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:44,850
heavily involved in the first is

65
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:47,160
obviously still bro there's a we did a

66
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:49,200

74

75
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:06,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">been able to every year squeeze people</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">in I think our count just from free bro</font>

97
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:03,540
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> start</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> by sharing some of my own</font>

98
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:05,670
personal story and I picked up<font color="#CCCCCC"> my mother</font>

99
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:09,390
to share her story a little bit to start

100
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:11,970
mine because she grew<font color="#CCCCCC"> up in the midst of</font>

101
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:13,890
a civil war in Northern Ireland not<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

102
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:17,640
far away and not that long ago and she

103
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:18,988
fled in 1969 to marry my dad who was<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

104
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:21,238
the Air Force at the time he'd been

drafted and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's multi with 60s in the</font>

mouth police on me and

108
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,110
he was lucky enough to be in the Air

109
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:33,600
Force stationed in North Africa and I

110
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:35,370
remember as a young man going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> visit</font>

111
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,840
my mom's family and I asked I said mom

112
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:38,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know how could you ever possibly</font>

113
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:41,130
leave these people<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're amazing</font>

114
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:42,440
they're wonderful and her<font color="#CCCCCC"> response was</font>

115
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:44,670
simple she said there was no opportunity

116
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:46,650
she said I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have a family and I</font>

117
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:48,180
wanted you guys to have the ability<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

118
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:49,590
pursue your passions and that that

119
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:52,350
wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> available in Ireland at the time</font>

120
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:55,409
and so growing up in Kentucky which is

121
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:58,620
where my parents<font color="#CCCCCC"> ended up I had a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

122
00:04:55,410 --> 00:05:00,510
great childhood being in Kentucky

123
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:03,480
there's lots of rural things to do so a

124
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:06,180
lot of fishing outdoor camping and stuff

125
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:07,140
like that and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was lucky</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> enough to have</font>

126
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:10,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">family members that were very</font>

127
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:12,390
entrepreneurial<font color="#CCCCCC"> II minded so my earliest</font>

128
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:14,640
job that I remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> was actually working</font>

129
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:16,710
at flea markets<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we sold everything</font>

130
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:19,050
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> would sell these little my first big</font>

131
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:20,489
sale was that rubber band gun right

132
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:22,140
there it's got a little sprocket in it

133
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:23,669
so you'd load these big red rubber bands

134
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:25,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">in it and you could like rapid-fire them</font>

135
00:05:23,669 --> 00:05:28,770
I still<font color="#CCCCCC"> remember how exhilarated I was</font>

136
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:30,750
as a six-year-old making a $25 sale and

137
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:32,700
you know you know BIC bantering back and

138
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:35,190
forth with a guy<font color="#CCCCCC"> this was nineteen</font>

139
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:36,719
<font color="#CCCCCC">eighty three or so and we would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go on to</font>

140
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:39,060
sell things like cuckoo clocks and

141
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:41,040
t-shirts blood<font color="#E5E5E5"> tests I was sort of like</font>

144
00:05:43,169 --> 00:05:46,409
people in and pull them into my booth

145
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:48,000
and so if you've ever seen me<font color="#E5E5E5"> at my bro</font>

146
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:49,380
training I think it now kind of all

147
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,720
starts to make sense right you start to

148
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:53,460
see that little bit of<font color="#E5E5E5"> carnival you know</font>

149
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:56,190
festival nature and my bro training that

150
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:58,979
I do<font color="#E5E5E5"> I went on to run fireworks booth so</font>

151
00:05:56,190 --> 00:06:01,050
we would stock shelves in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the summer and</font>

152
00:05:58,979 --> 00:06:03,840
then we'd run these little store side

153
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:05,820
tents and we do fifteen thousand dollars

154
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,770
in fireworks fireworks sales over a

155
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:09,540
seven day period so I sort of grew<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font>

156
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:12,120
with this<font color="#E5E5E5"> really strong entrepreneurial</font>

157
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:13,860
spirit that really served me very well I

00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:15,300
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say that that's my first true</font>

159
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:17,130
real passion that I discovered<font color="#CCCCCC"> was that</font>

160
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:19,620
I really liked controlling my own

161
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:21,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">destiny I like to see the ability to</font>

162
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:23,940
work really<font color="#CCCCCC"> hard and then to capture</font>

163
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:26,430
those results myself so I've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

164
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:28,260
evolved into the serial entrepreneur my

weirdest job is definitely<font color="#CCCCCC"> number three</font>

166
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:33,719
I was an actual clown on a<font color="#CCCCCC"> riverboat on</font>

167
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:35,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">the muddy Ohio River I got paid one</font>

168
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:38,640
hundred dollars i taught myself how to

169
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:40,670
juggle and got some little pocket tricks

170
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:42,960
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i did this</font>

171
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:44,670
birthday parties so in a four hour

172
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,650
cruise I get a hundred dollars cash no

173
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:48,390
questions asked that the time that was

definitely my PQ no earnings per hour

175
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:52,919
maybe fireworks a beat that ten years

176
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:55,470
after<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I went on of course</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to work</font>

177
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:58,080
in restaurants and lifeguards before I

00:06:55,470 --> 00:07:01,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">found my second great passion which was</font>

around network security and I'll share<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">I went to university in 1995 I went to</font>

00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:12,300
Xavier University in Cincinnati it's a

<font color="#E5E5E5">great school is a great school for me</font>

very<font color="#E5E5E5"> small computer science department</font>

186
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:18,180

like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take apart things like hair</font>

191
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:26,820
dryers and understand how they work I

192
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,990
actually said that and it was true

193
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:31,469
because that's what I was doing on the

194
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:33,419
weekends rebuilding machines teaching

195
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:35,640
myself about electronics because I

196
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:37,169
didn't really<font color="#CCCCCC"> have that large of a</font>

social life<font color="#CCCCCC"> to sort of pivot around</font>

198
00:07:37,169 --> 00:07:41,580
after that and in college<font color="#E5E5E5"> was that weird</font>

199
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:44,040
time for me when being<font color="#E5E5E5"> in technology</font>

200
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:45,900
became very cool I got hired by the

201
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:48,030
university as a full-time employee and

202

we didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a red team I'm fortunate</font>

great guys we didn't have anything like

207

that at the time I was doing what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

would call<font color="#E5E5E5"> DevOps i was writing</font>

exciting and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I remember my first</font>

213
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:12,419
vulnerability that I found was the ping

214
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:14,550
of death right and uh not being an

215
00:08:12,419 --> 00:08:16,320
inexperienced young man I didn't really

216
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:18,330
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the consequences of testing</font>

217
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:20,580
in my own environment so I crashed a few

218
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:23,700
workstations not a big deal and then

219
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:26,010
took down wwdd you and it didn't come

220
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:27,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">back up until it was replaced two weeks</font>

221
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:30,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">later I have no</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> idea what kind of kernel</font>

panic I caused to you know overwrite the

223
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:34,140
MBR I don't even know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what that what the</font>

224
00:08:32,099 --> 00:08:37,229
heck<font color="#CCCCCC"> happened but it turned into a minor</font>

225
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:39,479
debacle and I I just you know was

226
00:08:37,229 --> 00:08:41,880
testing I didn't really<font color="#CCCCCC"> think about it</font>

227
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:44,790
so I that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was my the first time and</font>

228
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:46,380
until recently only this latter two

229
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:47,939
years ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had my second time when I</font>

230
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:49,950
crashed something on accident when I was

231
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:51,839
testing out another exploit or actually

232
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:53,329
testing out a fingerprint but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't</font>

233
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:55,610
talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about that one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yet</font>

234
00:08:53,329 --> 00:08:57,949
so let me skip ahead a bit so let me

235
00:08:55,610 --> 00:09:00,350
skip ahead ten<font color="#E5E5E5"> years</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> after that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> past</font>

237
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:10,009
to 2005 and I'll mute this and hopefully

238
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:12,019
the video still plays good and at the

239
00:09:10,009 --> 00:09:14,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">time had been dating my wife are in my</font>

I was going to ask her to marry<font color="#E5E5E5"> man I</font>

00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:25,160
the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the Great Wall marathon we</font>

00:09:23,929 --> 00:09:27,350
finished right there at the finish line

00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:29,360
we made it on CNN we made it on

<font color="#CCCCCC">sportscenter we made it on all these</font>

249
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:33,079
kind of things but I was shocked when I

250
00:09:31,309 --> 00:09:35,329
was over there and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was a very</font>

251
00:09:33,079 --> 00:09:36,618
personal to me<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kids</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">and I actually I didn't include the</font>

00:09:36,619 --> 00:09:39,559
youngest kids in the video I tried to

254
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:42,529
pick kids that look like they were

255
00:09:39,559 --> 00:09:44,360
around 16 17 18 that I pulled out but in

256
00:09:42,529 --> 00:09:46,549
our personal videos<font color="#E5E5E5"> everywhere we went</font>

257
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:48,619
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> China every market place we went to</font>

258
00:09:46,549 --> 00:09:50,660
were those little kids working those

259
00:09:48,619 --> 00:09:52,610
flea markets and I commented to my wife

260
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:54,769
about about how<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was how I grew up</font>

261
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:57,529
but that<font color="#CCCCCC"> wasn't how I wanted my kids to</font>

262
00:09:54,769 --> 00:09:59,899
grow up and it felt kind of hypocritical

263
00:09:57,529 --> 00:10:01,759
because I wouldn't change my childhood I

264
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:03,410
wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> change anything I've done even</font>

265
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:05,029
though even the the lowest low that I've

266
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:08,779
had ended up turning into one of the

267
00:10:05,029 --> 00:10:10,429
best<font color="#CCCCCC"> things ever happened to me but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

268
00:10:08,779 --> 00:10:12,829
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> very powerful and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it made me</font>

269
00:10:10,429 --> 00:10:15,139
somewhat hesitant and fearful for my own

270
00:10:12,829 --> 00:10:16,910
kids even though this was years before I

271
00:10:15,139 --> 00:10:18,949
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> even married and had my own kids and</font>

272
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:20,868
I commented about how all of these kids

<font color="#E5E5E5">are growing up with the skill with these</font>

285
00:10:44,749 --> 00:10:49,970
pick up those entrepreneurial skills

286
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:52,009
right that sort of go to market the

287
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:54,499
ability to market themselves the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ability</font>

288
00:10:52,009 --> 00:10:56,299
to fail and to pick<font color="#CCCCCC"> yourself back up and</font>

289
00:10:54,499 --> 00:10:58,699
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> where that's when I sort of felt</font>

290
00:10:56,299 --> 00:11:00,559
like a real hypocrite and had a some

291
00:10:58,699 --> 00:11:02,719
real personal reflections about what I

292
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:05,629
do with these guys right because<font color="#CCCCCC"> I want</font>

293
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:07,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">my kids to grow up with the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ability and</font>

294
00:11:05,629 --> 00:11:09,500
the opportunity<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

295
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:11,209
have similar sorts of experiences<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

296
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:13,130
are outside of the classroom they're

297
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:15,500
outside of traditional educational

298
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:17,000
systems because for me personally most

299
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:19,490
of the technology stuff I picked on my

300
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,589
CS degree was incredible but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

301
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:23,510
learned when I was out working and the

302
00:11:21,589 --> 00:11:24,620
entrepreneur skills you know I<font color="#E5E5E5"> learned</font>

303
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:28,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">all that on the fly didn't ever get a</font>

304
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:31,100
business degree or anything and the sort

305
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:32,750
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNA that I've really adopted here is</font>

306
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:34,610
this this that a start-up is a search

307
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:36,200
for repeatable scalable business model

308
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:38,510
it makes it different than operating a

309
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:41,510
business and I reflected on that about

310
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:43,130
how life is sort of a search for finding

311
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:44,959
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you can repeat that you</font>

312
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:47,959
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to repeat that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> scale</font>

313
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:50,510
that you want to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> passionate about and</font>

314
00:11:47,959 --> 00:11:51,770
move forward so that's that's looking

315
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:53,810
back and that's well and good<font color="#E5E5E5"> and all</font>

316
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:55,490
but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought about taking it a little</font>

317
00:11:53,810 --> 00:11:58,520
further and then trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look ahead</font>

318
00:11:55,490 --> 00:12:00,860
and you've ever seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> the videos</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

319
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:02,930
Amazon work centers or the increasing

320
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:05,089
levels of automation in our society it

321
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:07,010
certainly provides a bit of opportunity

322
00:12:05,089 --> 00:12:09,200
I mean we're in tech right this is our

323
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:11,600
bread and butter but at some point you

324
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:13,760
have to wonder when the scale tips and

325
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,990
we start<font color="#E5E5E5"> to outpace ourselves I'm not</font>

326
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:16,370
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to let</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this one play all the way I</font>

327
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:18,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">think you guys get the idea but I did</font>

328
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:20,270
want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> show you the next</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one which is</font>

329
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:21,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">the new Tesla factory where this is</font>

330
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:23,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">about the most meta thing I could find</font>

331
00:12:21,709 --> 00:12:26,569
right now that's actually current and

332
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:30,350
invoke this these are robots building

333
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:33,410
self-driving cars think about that for a

334
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:35,690
second right robots building

335
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:36,980
self-driving cars transportation is

336
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:39,320
still the number one employer in the

337
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:41,120
United States<font color="#E5E5E5"> and while I'm passionate</font>

338
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:44,120
about technology and I think I'm trying

339
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:46,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know teach my kids that passion</font>

340
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:48,589
is contagious you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> I see how excited</font>

341
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:50,000
I am about<font color="#CCCCCC"> arduinos and circuits and</font>

342
00:12:48,589 --> 00:12:52,520
robotics and they get excited<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

343
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,750
those things but<font color="#CCCCCC"> that doesn't</font>

344
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:56,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">necessarily mean that I want to</font>

345
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:59,240
pigeonhole them into what I love I want

346
00:12:56,180 --> 00:13:02,239
them to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the ability</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to you know to</font>

347
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:04,160
discover their own passions and I'm

348
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,600
certainly not the first person and we're

349
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,610
certainly<font color="#E5E5E5"> not the first generation to</font>

350
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:10,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">think about how technology</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

351
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:12,320
impact us the Luddites actually were

352
00:13:10,279 --> 00:13:14,810
afraid of<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the looms and the weaving</font>

353
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:16,339
and this guy a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Connor at gessner I try</font>

354
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:18,410
to find the oldest example that I could

355
00:13:16,339 --> 00:13:20,990
find and he printed a book about

356
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:21,519
information<font color="#E5E5E5"> overload on the Gutenberg</font>

357
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:23,839
press

358
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:25,519
right and he was like<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's too many</font>

359
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:27,410
books there's too much information the

360
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:28,970
human mind can't deal with all this and

361
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:31,699
I thought I looked for quotes but they

362
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:33,410
were all like they were too old time I

363
00:13:31,699 --> 00:13:34,728
<font color="#E5E5E5">wanted to do I wanted to find a quote I</font>

364
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:36,079
could read and you would you know not

365
00:13:34,729 --> 00:13:37,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">know if it was modern heard or not but</font>

366
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:41,689
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> didn't work out so I'll just sort</font>

367
00:13:37,579 --> 00:13:43,579
of explain it so that's looking back and

368
00:13:41,689 --> 00:13:48,259
that's that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking about for it yes</font>

369
00:13:43,579 --> 00:13:49,638
Karen you'll do your jokes in just a

370
00:13:48,259 --> 00:13:53,749
minute we're almost to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the jokes part</font>

371
00:13:49,639 --> 00:13:56,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">all right so we're all raising our kids</font>

372
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:58,099
with iPads and technology and there are

373
00:13:56,149 --> 00:13:59,869
these digital natives right they don't

374
00:13:58,099 --> 00:14:02,359
know what it's like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to not have that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

375
00:13:59,869 --> 00:14:05,119
and what are the consequences of growing

376
00:14:02,359 --> 00:14:07,129
up with things like Google<font color="#CCCCCC"> AI have you</font>

377
00:14:05,119 --> 00:14:09,519
installed who's installed<font color="#E5E5E5"> a loo on their</font>

phone that's google's new chat bot<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

379
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:14,419
after<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm finished speaking before you</font>

message<font color="#CCCCCC"> a friend with it it is</font>

382
00:14:15,619 --> 00:14:20,419
incredible it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like having all 100</font>

383
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:21,739
million of Google's answers and little

384
00:14:20,419 --> 00:14:23,749
pivots that you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get in a browser</font>

385
00:14:21,739 --> 00:14:26,359
that you can ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> it questions available</font>

386
00:14:23,749 --> 00:14:27,379
to you and chat so you can do things<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

387
00:14:26,359 --> 00:14:30,169
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know if you can see this very well</font>

388
00:14:27,379 --> 00:14:32,600
you can say in a chat with other people

389
00:14:30,169 --> 00:14:34,519
conversational you can say<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok Google how</font>

390
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:35,989
much is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it to fly to Cancun next weekend</font>

391
00:14:34,519 --> 00:14:39,409
and it will<font color="#E5E5E5"> come into channel and</font>

392
00:14:35,989 --> 00:14:40,879
interact with you and it has this intent

393
00:14:39,409 --> 00:14:42,409
driven interface if you will it's the

394
00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:45,049
best way I can describe it where it

395
00:14:42,409 --> 00:14:46,819
understands what was the intent of the

396
00:14:45,049 --> 00:14:48,739
conversation<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it gives you these</font>

397
00:14:46,819 --> 00:14:50,149
options here at the at the bottom of

398
00:14:48,739 --> 00:14:53,389
each chat to drive the conversation

399
00:14:50,149 --> 00:14:55,609
forward and it continues to learn and

400
00:14:53,389 --> 00:14:57,829
get smarter as it adopts to your working

401
00:14:55,609 --> 00:14:59,809
styles it's a pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> amazing kind of</font>

402
00:14:57,829 --> 00:15:02,628
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the new google home which is</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">their version of echo just came out that</font>

404
00:15:02,629 --> 00:15:06,679
is also<font color="#E5E5E5"> another interface for this so</font>

405
00:15:05,269 --> 00:15:09,049
it's there's this<font color="#E5E5E5"> universal interface</font>

406
00:15:06,679 --> 00:15:12,049
for that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm tremendously excited about</font>

407
00:15:09,049 --> 00:15:16,069
it and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have it yet but who has</font>

408
00:15:12,049 --> 00:15:18,259

409
00:15:16,069 --> 00:15:19,699
great product to really sort of

410
00:15:18,259 --> 00:15:22,249
understand how your kids are going to

00:15:19,699 --> 00:15:23,419
interact with<font color="#CCCCCC"> technology and boys i</font>

daddy's phone did you guys know that you

415

00:15:31,309 --> 00:15:35,209
go through some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the things that my</font>

already tell them that I don't want to

00:23:08,670 --> 00:23:13,170
a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of time about the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> last 15</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> years</font>

567
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:15,660
almost exclusively working in security

568
00:23:13,170 --> 00:23:17,610
and thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about a defense in</font>

569
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:19,080
particular because defense is really

570
00:23:17,610 --> 00:23:21,990
hard no offense to our<font color="#E5E5E5"> red team I love</font>

571
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:24,000
what you guys do but defense is is even

572
00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:26,790
harder than<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and this sort of modern</font>

573
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:29,730
security paradigm essentially is is that

574
00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:31,560
you accept that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> goal is not</font>

575
00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:34,020
prevention it's the minimize the risk of

576
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:35,429
loss due to intrusion and the sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 10</font>

577
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:37,830
general understanding there is that

578
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:39,860
compromise is inevitable that's another

579
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:42,689
way of saying that<font color="#E5E5E5"> failure is inevitable</font>

580
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:44,939
right that part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of your process needs to</font>

581
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:47,070
understand that a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of the things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

582
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:48,870
try aren't going to work and a lot of

583
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:52,919
times it's how quickly you respond to

584
00:23:48,870 --> 00:23:55,800
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and taking that idea and applying</font>

585
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:58,470
it to my own life personally failure is

586
00:23:55,800 --> 00:24:00,990
inevitable and I'll share<font color="#E5E5E5"> a quick story</font>

587
00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:04,410
here that leads to a<font color="#CCCCCC"> very happy ending</font>

588
00:24:00,990 --> 00:24:07,080
to startups ago I was working my ass off

589
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:08,970
I was flying all around the world I can

590
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:09,590
tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> you I'm sorry the language there I</font>

591
00:24:08,970 --> 00:24:12,289
can

592
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:14,149
tell you that in two<font color="#CCCCCC"> years I flew a</font>

593
00:24:12,289 --> 00:24:18,110
little over half a million miles I

594
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:20,390
visited a hundred or more cities I was

595
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:23,658
away<font color="#CCCCCC"> from my family non stop putting in</font>

596
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:26,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">110 percent and for a variety of reasons</font>

597
00:24:23,659 --> 00:24:29,299
the startup didn't work out and I ended

598
00:24:26,419 --> 00:24:31,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">up being fired at the worst point the</font>

599
00:24:29,299 --> 00:24:34,370
day I was supposed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get paid nearly</font>

600
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:36,110
sixty thousand dollars which I needed to

601
00:24:34,370 --> 00:24:38,000
feed my kids here right here with you

602
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:39,529
<font color="#CCCCCC">guys it was a very devastating</font>

603
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,510
experience I'm very fortunate to have a

604
00:24:39,529 --> 00:24:44,059
lot of supportive friends an<font color="#E5E5E5"> amazing</font>

605
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:46,190
wife actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> my first call was to Brett</font>

606
00:24:44,059 --> 00:24:47,270
Thorson if you guys know Thor he was in

607
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:49,580
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> room and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I was I was still</font>

608
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:51,710
flabbergasted I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> like I still cannot</font>

609
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:53,510
believe that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this just happened and over</font>

610
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:55,820
the next few days we were reeling my

611
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:59,379
wife and I talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it we decided</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

612
00:24:55,820 --> 00:25:01,789
take another bite at the Apple and to

613
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:06,169
have just accepted that this was failing

614
00:25:01,789 --> 00:25:08,899
fast so seven days later I did another

615
00:25:06,169 --> 00:25:11,210
startup critical stack which was a

616
00:25:08,899 --> 00:25:13,820
pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> small team with pretty huge</font>

617
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:16,039
results today we have over 6,000

618
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:18,289
customers and we've built this a

619
00:25:16,039 --> 00:25:21,200
platform around<font color="#CCCCCC"> Kuber Nettie's let you</font>

620
00:25:18,289 --> 00:25:23,450
container eyes and scale pretty much

621
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:26,659
anything and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I talked about that happy</font>

622
00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:29,090
ending we went from fired fearing that

623
00:25:26,659 --> 00:25:31,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">we were going to not be able to pay our</font>

624
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:34,149
mortgage to less<font color="#CCCCCC"> than 18 months later</font>

625
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:37,640
being acquired by Capital One Bank and

626
00:25:34,149 --> 00:25:40,549
it wasn't the desire to be rich that got

627
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:43,279
me through those months it was having a

628
00:25:40,549 --> 00:25:45,200
supportive community it was being<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

629
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:48,049
passionate and believing<font color="#E5E5E5"> in what I was</font>

630
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:50,750
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it was accepting that it is</font>

631
00:25:48,049 --> 00:25:52,970
okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> to fail even</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if it's embarrassing</font>

632
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:57,740
even if it feels humiliating because

633
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:59,750
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what it felt like so when I think</font>

634
00:25:57,740 --> 00:26:01,549
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know what we're doing today I</font>

635
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:03,860
don't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we're here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

636
00:26:01,549 --> 00:26:05,179
talk about you know vocational work for

637
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:08,000
our kids we're not here to talk about

638
00:26:05,179 --> 00:26:10,370
what jobs we can you know but you know

639
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,549
shoehorn them into because everybody

640
00:26:10,370 --> 00:26:16,070
knows text gonna stay hot until it's not

641
00:26:12,549 --> 00:26:17,389
but I was even<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to think about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

642
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:19,340
know what kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of jobs would we be</font>

643
00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:21,020
preparing<font color="#CCCCCC"> for that don't don't exist and</font>

644
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:23,240
thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the AI was thinking that</font>

645
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:25,490
maybe there'll be an AI therapist

646
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:28,520
right a job that<font color="#E5E5E5"> your your job is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

647
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:31,670
help diagnose weird emotional behaviors

648
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:34,970
in AI or a drone manager or a<font color="#E5E5E5"> human</font>

649
00:26:31,670 --> 00:26:37,100
Android integration specialist but but I

650
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:39,980
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that's totally the wrong idea</font>

651
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:43,340
because the goal is not to find jobs for

652
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:45,830
my kids it's to<font color="#E5E5E5"> help them try a lot of</font>

653
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:48,649
stuff and find<font color="#E5E5E5"> out what they're</font>

654
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:51,260
passionate about and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out how</font>

655
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:54,470
they can do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the most because that</font>

656
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:57,620
seems to be the real trick to success

657
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:59,210
and enjoying yourself and getting to go

658
00:26:57,620 --> 00:27:01,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">to work every day and still being able</font>

659
00:26:59,210 --> 00:27:03,740
to say which I do I can't believe I get

660
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:06,020
paid to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do this it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> unbelievable that</font>

661
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:09,559
somebody gives me money to come in and

662
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:11,870
do what I get to do right so how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

663
00:27:09,559 --> 00:27:14,240
get there I don't think child<font color="#E5E5E5"> labor</font>

664
00:27:11,870 --> 00:27:16,070
where we started is the right is there

665
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:18,890
is necessarily a right way to get there

666
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:21,710
but I do think that together in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

667
00:27:18,890 --> 00:27:23,840
room this is the best<font color="#CCCCCC"> example that I can</font>

668
00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:26,390
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> of because it comes down to</font>

669
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:28,490
community it comes down to family and it

670
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:31,130
comes down to service and that seems to

671
00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:33,559
be the real path to success so what my

672
00:27:31,130 --> 00:27:36,800
strategy is for my family<font color="#CCCCCC"> and what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font>

673
00:27:33,559 --> 00:27:40,090
doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> out here today</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is after the</font>

675
00:27:40,090 --> 00:27:45,770
volunteering<font color="#E5E5E5"> community service style in</font>

676
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:48,740
