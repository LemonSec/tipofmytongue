00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:53,489
staff attorney there for seven years and

19
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:56,610
then I left and I started<font color="#E5E5E5"> my own</font>

practice<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I consider my practice area</font>

00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:02,989
to be digital civil liberties that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> how</font>

22
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:07,590
I describe<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so I'm interested in</font>

23
00:01:02,989 --> 00:01:12,210
privacy a free expression creativity

24
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:17,220
innovation and I really<font color="#CCCCCC"> am interested in</font>

25
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:21,048
hacking and in information security in

26
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:23,369
general and a<font color="#CCCCCC"> number of my clients are</font>

27
00:01:21,049 --> 00:01:25,950
security researchers<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I love</font>

28
00:01:23,369 --> 00:01:28,290
conferences like these ones I'm a big

29
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:31,650
fan of everything you all do and it's

30
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:33,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">nice to meet you all and I didn't</font>

31
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:35,670
actually expect to talk about the crypto

32
00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:38,070
Wars I feel like every conference you go

33
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:39,930
to these days you know the legal people

34
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:40,919
at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> all conferences I go to the</font>

35
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:42,450
legal<font color="#E5E5E5"> people are talking about the</font>

36
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:44,670
crypto Wars and it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> very important</font>

37
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:46,049
topic but everybody's talking about it

38
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:47,880
all the time so I was going to do

39
00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:48,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really crazy and innovative</font>

40
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:51,060
and go in a totally different direction

41
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:52,530
and talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> else but then</font>

42
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:55,290
there are some really interesting

43
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:57,000
developments in the past few days and I

44
00:01:55,290 --> 00:02:00,689
thought this is a great<font color="#CCCCCC"> time to talk</font>

45
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,360
about what's what's new and hopefully

46
00:02:00,689 --> 00:02:04,860
teach you all something that you you

47
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,750
don't already know about about the

48
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:08,190
crypto Wars that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think is very</font>

49
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:11,900
important and something we need to keep

50
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:14,190
an eye on so to start<font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font>

51
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:16,530
talk about a little bit of recent

52
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:18,810
history just to make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

53
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:20,940
the same playing field and in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same</font>

54
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:23,450
ballpark and the place I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start</font>

55
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:26,129
is not the crypto Wars like 20 years<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago</font>

56
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:29,130
but actually much more recently than

57
00:02:26,129 --> 00:02:33,959
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that the invention of the</font>

58
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:36,630
cell phone is a really huge moment in

59
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:38,880
human history and when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

60
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:42,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">it it's incredible that you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know the</font>

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> vast majority of Americans at this</font>

time have a cell phone it's it's

64
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:54,030
incredible what a what<font color="#E5E5E5"> a important part</font>

65
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,069
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our lives this type of device has</font>

become most of us carry it around with

00:02:56,069 --> 00:03:00,869
us<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the time it's one of the first</font>

00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:02,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">things we reach four in the morning it's</font>

69
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:06,420
one of the last things we look at at

70
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:10,849
night and it has<font color="#CCCCCC"> information about our</font>

71
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:13,290
families our business relationships

72
00:03:10,849 --> 00:03:16,319
communications with pretty much

73
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:19,078
everybody that we know can have

74
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:22,018
financial information<font color="#E5E5E5"> tracks your</font>

75
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:23,609
location all the time I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

76
00:03:22,019 --> 00:03:25,950
there's ever been anything quite like it

77
00:03:23,609 --> 00:03:28,290
in human history in terms of the

78
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:31,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">information that it reveals about each</font>

79
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:34,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">and every one of us and of course that</font>

80
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:37,340
makes it very interesting to a lot of

81
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:39,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">people including law enforcement and</font>

82
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:43,109
that's one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the key things that we're</font>

83
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:46,859
<font color="#CCCCCC">going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about today now as quickly</font>

84
00:03:43,109 --> 00:03:52,250
as this little<font color="#E5E5E5"> device has taken a key</font>

85
00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:56,220
role in all of our<font color="#E5E5E5"> lives the law around</font>

86
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:57,599
what the<font color="#CCCCCC"> law</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> around of how we treat this</font>

87
00:03:56,220 --> 00:04:00,209
kind of information and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we treat these</font>

88
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:03,119
devices has been a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> slower to develop</font>

89
00:04:00,209 --> 00:04:08,280
and that's pretty typical technology

90
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:09,660
moves fast law moves slowly and you know

91
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:12,630
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are a lot of reasons why that is</font>

92
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:15,120
but one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the most interesting</font>

93
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:17,599
challenges I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think in my work is that we</font>

94
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:20,789
see these really interesting new

95
00:04:17,599 --> 00:04:23,230
creations that are widely adopted by

96
00:04:20,789 --> 00:04:25,330
everybody<font color="#CCCCCC"> enter</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in common</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use</font>

97
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:27,130
and you have to do a<font color="#E5E5E5"> good job of</font>

98
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:28,690
explaining to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the courts what the</font>

99
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:32,050
implications are and why that's

100
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:34,240
important and judges are often people

101
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:36,400
who are not early adopters and they may

102
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,290
not easily and readily get the

103
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,570
implications<font color="#E5E5E5"> so it's a fun and</font>

104
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:42,220
interesting challenge but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

105
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:45,790
that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> always have to think about</font>

106
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:48,550
you're always struggling with now that

107
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:53,190
said the courts are starting to catch up

108
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:55,870
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've had a lot of interesting</font>

109
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:58,840
situations in which the courts have

110
00:04:55,870 --> 00:05:01,750
looked at questions involving law

111
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:05,919
enforcement access to data on mobile

112
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:07,410
devices such as such<font color="#CCCCCC"> as smartphones the</font>

113
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:09,870
issues that I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to focus on today</font>

114
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:13,870
involve the Fourth Amendment and the

115
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:15,550
Fifth Amendment the Fourth Amendment

116
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:18,010
protects us against unreasonable

117
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:23,530
government searches and seizures<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

118
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:27,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">right and the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> basic rule is that if you</font>

119
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:29,650
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> engaged in an activity or if you're</font>

120
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:33,729
in a place that you reasonably consider

121
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:35,830
private as a general rule law

122
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:40,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">enforcement would need to get a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> warrant</font>

123
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:43,030
and signed off on by a judge that<font color="#CCCCCC"> says</font>

124
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:46,659
that they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> allowed to search or</font>

125
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:49,000
seized evidence of a crime in that<font color="#E5E5E5"> place</font>

126
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:52,600
and there are exceptions to that rule

127
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:57,490
we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about some of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them today but</font>

128
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:59,640
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the basic rule and we saw a</font>

129
00:05:57,490 --> 00:06:04,420
number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of cases over the past few years</font>

130
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:05,890
raising the question of when law

131
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:08,710
enforcement needs to get a warrant to

132
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:10,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">search your phone and I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think the most</font>

133
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:13,719
interesting of these cases<font color="#E5E5E5"> involve the</font>

134
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:15,400
question of what<font color="#CCCCCC"> happens when law</font>

135
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:18,520
enforcement is in the course of

136
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:21,340
arresting a person are they allowed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

137
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:25,240
search the phone there is an exception

138
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:26,530
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Fourth Amendment requirement that</font>

139
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:28,840
law enforcement needs a<font color="#E5E5E5"> warrant to</font>

140
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:30,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">search something in situations where the</font>

141
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:33,880
search is performed incident to arrest

142
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:36,100
so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea is if you get arrested</font>

143
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:37,900
and law enforcement is allowed to Pat

144
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:39,220
you down they're allowed to see if you

145
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:42,070
have any weapons on you because that

146
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:43,420
implicates officer safety they're

147
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:45,130
allowed to see if you have evidence<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a</font>

148
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:47,800
crime on your person that you might

149
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:49,000
easily be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to destroy they can take</font>

150
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,740
it away from you and they<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't need to</font>

151
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,490
get a warrant to do all that<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff right</font>

152
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:56,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">and so in some of these early cases we</font>

153
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:58,930
saw situations where somebody's getting

154
00:06:56,200 --> 00:07:00,550
arrested and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the officer finds a cell</font>

155
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:03,820
phone perhaps in this person's pocket

156
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:05,440
and the question<font color="#CCCCCC"> becomes can they search</font>

157
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:08,890
that phone right there incident to

158
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:11,800
arrest or do they have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a warrant</font>

159
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:13,570
and the government's perspective of

160
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:16,540
course was well we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

161
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:17,950
long-established you know rule that were

162
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:20,290
allowed to search things incident to

163
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:24,430
arrest why would a<font color="#E5E5E5"> cell phone be any</font>

164
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:26,140
different and on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other hand people</font>

165
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:28,540
said well a cell phone is different

166
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:31,270
right there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of information on</font>

167
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:33,760
there that implicates a much wider

168
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:35,349
variety of privacy interest than

169
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:38,289
anything you might anything else you

170
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:39,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">might have in your pocket</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and this</font>

171
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:42,180
question when all the way up<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

172
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:44,890
Supreme Court and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Supreme Court said</font>

173
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:46,450

174
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:49,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">search a phone they're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not allowed to</font>

175
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:51,039

176
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:52,900
potentially maybe be certain

177
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:54,820
case-by-case situations where a

different<font color="#E5E5E5"> warrant exception maybe could</font>

179
00:07:54,820 --> 00:08:00,810
apply but as a general matter a warrant

180
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:03,970
is needed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to search a cell phone and</font>

181
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:06,220
basically the reason is<font color="#CCCCCC"> because a cell</font>

182
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:09,040

<font color="#E5E5E5">anything we've ever</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> seen before and so</font>

185
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:16,989
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was a very interesting development</font>

186
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:19,650
in the law and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that for many</font>

00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:23,410
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who follow these issues it was a</font>

188
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:25,419
big surprise and it shows that even at

189
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:27,190
the highest levels the courts are

190
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:29,380
starting to understand that technology

191
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:31,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">is not quite the same thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we've</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">centuries that we've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> been developing the</font>

195
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:41,380
legal interests I want to talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you</font>

196
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:45,280
about is the Fifth<font color="#CCCCCC"> Amendment privilege</font>

197
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:46,790
against self-incrimination so the

198
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:50,079
Constitution says

199
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:54,140
that the government can't compel you to

200
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:56,630
give<font color="#CCCCCC"> testimony against yourself that</font>

201
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:59,170
would be incriminating<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so three</font>

202
00:08:56,630 --> 00:09:04,220
requirements government compulsion

203
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:06,079
testimony and incriminating and there

204
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:08,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">been a number of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cases in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the last</font>

205
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:11,570
several years that have raised the

206
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:14,420
question of whether in attempt by the

207
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:18,890
government<font color="#E5E5E5"> to force somebody to decrypt</font>

208
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:22,839
data or provide a password or perhaps

209
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:28,610
provide a thumbprint to unlock a phone

210
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:31,460
raises these concerns something is

211
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:33,620
considered testimonial when it reveals

212
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:35,780
the contents<font color="#E5E5E5"> of your mind that's the</font>

213
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:37,970
general rule and the courts have

214
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:41,000
recognized that sometimes that doesn't

215
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:42,830
involve saying things out loud what it

216
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,520
could mean is you've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> asked to take</font>

217
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:48,440
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of an action and that action</font>

218
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:51,650
itself would implicitly admit certain

219
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:54,740
things like for<font color="#CCCCCC"> example that you have</font>

220
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:57,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">control over something or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that certain</font>

221
00:09:54,740 --> 00:10:01,040
information exists or that it's

222
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:02,359
authentic and in those situations if the

223
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,969
government<font color="#E5E5E5"> is trying to compel you to</font>

protects you from having to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

227
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:15,530
because of the implicit testimonial

228
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:18,890
aspects of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> action and it's a little</font>

229
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:20,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">bit confusing right um and I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think that</font>

230
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:23,110
there are some blurry lines between what

231
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:25,490
is testimonial what is not testimonial

232
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:29,360
but we can talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about that a little bit</font>

233
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:33,740
later many of the cases<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we've seen</font>

234
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:35,630
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> far in this area have not involved</font>

235
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:37,790
phones per se but we're starting to see

236
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:39,200
that more<font color="#E5E5E5"> and more and this question</font>

237
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:41,360
hasn't reached the Supreme<font color="#E5E5E5"> Court yet</font>

238
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:44,420
it's just starting to kind of percolate

239
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:46,670
up to the appeals court level which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

240
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:47,900
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the the middle between the the</font>

241
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:49,790
district courts which are the trial

242
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:52,459
courts and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> High Court</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> which is the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">Supreme Court so to further complicate</font>

244
00:10:52,460 --> 00:11:02,070
all of this the Snowden if that happened

245
00:10:57,670 --> 00:11:04,949
so after Edward Snowden gave a

246
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:06,730
tremendous amount of<font color="#E5E5E5"> information to</font>

247
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:09,280
journalists with which then was

248
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:11,920
ultimately published a lot of tech

249
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:16,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">companies decided that they wanted to</font>

250
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:19,060
take additional action to try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep</font>

251
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:21,220
the NSA out of their systems and try to

00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:24,880
protect the<font color="#E5E5E5"> data on their systems which</font>

253
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:27,280
meant that encryption by default became

254
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:29,680
much more widespread it was built into

255
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:33,520
products it became less difficult for

256
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:36,520
users to take<font color="#E5E5E5"> advantage of and in many</font>

257
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:38,199
cases users were encrypting their data

258
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:40,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">just totally by default because that's</font>

259
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:43,870
how the products at that<font color="#E5E5E5"> point</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> were</font>

260
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:45,430
built<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so to make the Fourth</font>

Amendment and the Fifth Amendment issues

00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:57,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">and so then we've started to see these</font>

265
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:59,800
questions emerge about what happens when

266
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:02,110
law enforcement is trying to collect

267
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:05,589
evidence of a crime that's encrypted and

268
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:08,050
they're not able to they're not able to

get<font color="#E5E5E5"> around that you know how do we deal</font>

270
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:15,609
with that and this has been<font color="#CCCCCC"> a topic of</font>

271
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:17,050
great discussion for a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of years I</font>

00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:20,580
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> say you all may remember this</font>

Washington Post editorial in<font color="#E5E5E5"> which the</font>

274
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:25,060

companies<font color="#CCCCCC"> like Apple</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and Google might</font>

invent a kind of secure golden key that

00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:33,699
they would keep and could be<font color="#CCCCCC"> used by law</font>

00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:04,990
gained a tremendous amount of attention

289
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:08,290
and is the pressure that's been put on

290
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:09,970
certain service providers<font color="#CCCCCC"> to give</font>

291
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:11,469
assistance to law enforcement to get

292
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:14,050
around some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these problems</font>

293
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:17,500
and the clearest and most obvious

294
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:20,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">example is Apple I'm sure that many of</font>

295
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:23,650
you read in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the news</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about a very</font>

296
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:27,390
particular situation in which the

297
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:31,300
Department of Justice was investigating

298
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:33,819
the really terrible and unfortunate

299
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:39,130
incident in San Bernardino<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're a</font>

302
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:49,210
the course of investigating the

303
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:52,689
situation after<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fact the FBI learned</font>

304
00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:58,540
that one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those suspects had a work</font>

305
00:13:52,690 --> 00:14:00,940
phone that was an iphone<font color="#E5E5E5"> 5c and the FBI</font>

306
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:03,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">wanted to see whether there was anything</font>

307
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:07,360
on that phone that might help in the

308
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:13,569
investigation the issue is that that

309
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:15,280
phone was running iOS 9 which had

310
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:18,220
encrypted the information on the phone

311
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:19,900
and had certain mechanism mechanisms

312
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:22,360
that made it so that if you attempted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

313
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:23,620
pass code too many<font color="#E5E5E5"> times the keys to</font>

314
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:27,370
decrypt that information would be

315
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:28,660
permanently wiped so the government<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

316
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:29,860
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this tough spot where they really</font>

317
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:33,579
wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see the information on the</font>

318
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:36,280
phone but weren't in a position to to

319
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:39,340
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and you know they had</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a valid</font>

320
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:41,650
warrant you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> by by all legal rights</font>

321
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:43,570
they should be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get it but they</font>

322
00:14:41,650 --> 00:14:45,939
couldn't get it because<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the security</font>

323
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:50,110
features<font color="#E5E5E5"> that Apple had built into the</font>

324
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:53,830
phone so what does the Department of

325
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:58,390
Justice do it goes to a court and it

326
00:14:53,830 --> 00:15:00,910
says listen we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need some help here court</font>

327
00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:05,020
could you please<font color="#E5E5E5"> issue an order under</font>

328
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:07,689
the all writs<font color="#CCCCCC"> Act and to help us out now</font>

329
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:09,730
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> all writs</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Act is this old law I</font>

330
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:11,560
actually read last night that it was

331
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:14,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">first signed into law by George</font>

332
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:17,160
Washington amazingly and that basically

333
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:20,620
says that the courts have the power to

334
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:24,610
issue any orders that are appropriate

335
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:28,000
and necessary<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make sure that</font>

336
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:32,350
and certain events occur as long as its

337
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:35,200
lawful and and it's necessary and no

338
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:38,019
other law would would make it happen so

339
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:39,790
the Justice Department says listen could

340
00:15:38,019 --> 00:15:42,940
you issue an order under the all writs

341
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:45,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">Act basically so that we can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> execute our</font>

342
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:50,709
search warrant and what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want you to</font>

343
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:54,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">do is order Apple to develop a special</font>

344
00:15:50,709 --> 00:15:58,239
version of its operating system that

345
00:15:54,760 --> 00:16:00,819
would basically compromise some of the

346
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:03,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">security features</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that are in place to</font>

347
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:08,649
protect this data so that we can decrypt

348
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:12,310
it and initially the court ordered Apple

349
00:16:08,649 --> 00:16:15,310
to do it and then Apple said no

350
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:17,560
absolutely not and they went<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the mat</font>

351
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:19,989
on it they lawyered up they hired some

352
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:22,060
of the best lawyers in the country and

353
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:24,190
they basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> said listen you know if</font>

354
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:26,018
we have to build<font color="#CCCCCC"> the software this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

355
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:27,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to be a big problem you know we</font>

356
00:16:26,019 --> 00:16:28,899
think this is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put us in a</font>

357
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:32,380
position where we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to compromise the</font>

358
00:16:28,899 --> 00:16:34,240
security<font color="#CCCCCC"> on our products basically at</font>

359
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:36,010
large because if we do this one-off

360
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,779
thing for you surely we're going to have

361
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:40,720
to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this for everybody else who comes</font>

362
00:16:37,779 --> 00:16:42,250
asking as well right and the government

363
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,839
says no no no no<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not like that's</font>

364
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:44,980
just you know one<font color="#E5E5E5"> time thing that you're</font>

365
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:48,519
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> making this something that it's</font>

366
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:51,100
not and it was this huge public deal I'm

367
00:16:48,519 --> 00:16:53,649
sure I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure all of you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> probably read</font>

368
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:56,529
about this in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> news and then it kind</font>

369
00:16:53,649 --> 00:16:59,529
of fizzled and the reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it</font>

370
00:16:56,529 --> 00:17:03,100
fizzled was because the FBI<font color="#E5E5E5"> found a</font>

371
00:16:59,529 --> 00:17:05,799
private party a security firm<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was</font>

372
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:08,290
able to help it get into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the phone and</font>

373
00:17:05,799 --> 00:17:10,900
it said hey listen we got this<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff we</font>

374
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:13,418
were looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> for we don't need this</font>

375
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:15,839
order from the court anymore you know no

376
00:17:13,419 --> 00:17:19,329
harm no foul we're all done here right

377
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:20,980
and so you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> we kind of end up in</font>

378
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:22,418
this situation where there's this you

379
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:25,329
know i would<font color="#CCCCCC"> i would call it at least</font>

380
00:17:22,419 --> 00:17:28,690
publicly you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know this it appears</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

381
00:17:25,329 --> 00:17:30,580
an uneasy truce where you know certainly

382
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:32,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">i think the government knows that apple</font>

383
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:36,110
doesn't wish to be terribly cooperative

384
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:37,820
with helping the government to

385
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:42,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">XS encrypted information that's stored</font>

386
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:43,730
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> Apple products and so you know the</font>

387
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:46,250
government<font color="#E5E5E5"> needs to think about how else</font>

388
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:50,780
to deal with that situation and I think

389
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:54,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">that this leads us to a place where the</font>

390
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:58,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">pressure becomes more diffuse it gets</font>

391
00:17:54,799 --> 00:18:01,639
shifted from the providers to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the users</font>

392
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:03,670
of the technology because you know that

393
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:07,220
is another that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> another place where</font>

394
00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:10,280
perhaps the government<font color="#E5E5E5"> might be able to</font>

395
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:11,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">access this information right so here's</font>

396
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:15,710
the new development but i think is

397
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:17,510
really really really<font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting what we</font>

398
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:19,850
have learned in the past couple of weeks

399
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:24,559
is that there have been<font color="#CCCCCC"> a couple of</font>

400
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:32,270
situations in which the government has

401
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:35,149
gone to a court and said hi we would

402
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:40,480
like you to issue a search warrant that

403
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:43,250
allows<font color="#CCCCCC"> us to go into a home and compel</font>

404
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:44,870
everybody in that<font color="#E5E5E5"> home who</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we think has</font>

405
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:49,910
a mobile device that can be<font color="#CCCCCC"> unlocked</font>

406
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:51,979
with a<font color="#CCCCCC"> with a thumbprint to give us or</font>

407
00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:54,770
blue the word that the government uses

408
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:59,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">is too depressed to depress their</font>

409
00:18:54,770 --> 00:19:01,100
fingers and their thumbs on the phone on

410
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:04,010
their phones so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they can be</font>

411
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:08,418
<font color="#E5E5E5">unlocked and you know this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the front</font>

412
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:10,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">of this filing it actually appears to</font>

413
00:19:08,419 --> 00:19:12,410
have been under seal it's not a hundred

414
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:16,190
percent clear to me how it<font color="#E5E5E5"> all came out</font>

415
00:19:12,410 --> 00:19:17,450
and but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know I'm sure you all are</font>

416
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:19,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to have a hard time reading that</font>

417
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:20,980
but basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know this is exactly</font>

418
00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:23,030
what the government<font color="#CCCCCC"> asked for</font>

419
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:25,070
authorization to depress the

420
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:27,950
fingerprints and thumb prints of every

421
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:29,809
person who is<font color="#E5E5E5"> located at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the subject</font>

422
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:32,360
premises during the execution of the

423
00:19:29,809 --> 00:19:34,460
search and who is reasonably believed by

424
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:36,918
law enforcement to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a user</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of a</font>

425
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:38,809
fingerprint sensor enabled device that

426
00:19:36,919 --> 00:19:40,780
is located<font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the subject premises and</font>

427
00:19:38,809 --> 00:19:43,040
falls within<font color="#E5E5E5"> the scope of the warrant</font>

428
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:44,389
the government seeks this<font color="#CCCCCC"> authority</font>

429
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:46,520
because those fingerprints when

430
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:49,140
authorized by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the user of the device can</font>

431
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:55,350
unlock<font color="#CCCCCC"> the device so</font>

432
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:57,900
so we now get into a situation where<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

433
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:59,459
government goes to a court and says give

434
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:02,490
us the authority to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> into a home and</font>

435
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:04,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">do this right you know imagine you are</font>

436
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:08,250
the person in the house when they show

437
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:10,620
up or the people<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the house when they</font>

438
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:12,030
show up right and they say hey listen I

439
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:14,479
have a legal order here that says that

440
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:16,710
I'm you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm allowed to have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

441
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:20,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">depress your fingers on the phone to</font>

442
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:21,630
unlock it right is it possible you might

443
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:24,360
have a valid Fifth Amendment privilege

444
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:26,520
against self-incrimination I think it's

445
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:28,949
possible depending on the circumstances

446
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:30,810
but I think very very few people<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

447
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:33,600
going to be comfortable<font color="#E5E5E5"> in that</font>

448
00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:35,580
situation trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to assert a privilege</font>

449
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:39,000
like that and in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Fifth Amendment</font>

450
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:42,210
cases we've seen<font color="#CCCCCC"> before the the timing</font>

451
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:44,610
was different in those cases what

452
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:48,000
happened was law enforcement would seize

453
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:50,280
a device take it away find that they

454
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:53,310
couldn't get into it and then would ask

455
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:55,530
a court to basically force the person to

456
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:57,090
decrypt the information that person

457
00:20:55,530 --> 00:20:59,700
raises Fifth Amendment privilege and

458
00:20:57,090 --> 00:21:01,169
then we fight<font color="#CCCCCC"> over it right but you know</font>

459
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:03,630
a court gets to hear about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and a</font>

460
00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:06,000
court gets to decide but when it's done

461
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:08,190
this way what this means is that I think

462
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:11,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">we're going to see fewer challenges</font>

463
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:13,260
because people i think are not going to

464
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:16,469
be in a position in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the heat of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

465
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:18,960
moment to say wait a<font color="#CCCCCC"> minute i have a</font>

466
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:21,780
think i have a valid constitutional

467
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:22,890
privilege here to not do this and you

468
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:26,670
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it takes a special person</font>

469
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:28,500
to take that<font color="#E5E5E5"> stand in that moment so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

470
00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:30,870
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it really shifts the dynamics of</font>

471
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:32,910
things in a very interesting way and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

472
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:34,379
can see how for law enforcement there's

473
00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:39,510
a great deal of incentive to go in<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

474
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:41,160
direction so what does this mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

475
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:47,160
future what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we think we're going to</font>

476
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:49,020
see so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we can expect</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see more</font>

477
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:51,720
law enforcement efforts to force users

478
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:53,940
to decrypt data on demand in the moment

479
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:56,640
before their devices are taken away from

480
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:59,460
them because after their devices are

481
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:02,640
taken away from them I think we get<font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

482
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:02,820
a situation where<font color="#E5E5E5"> the courts are in a</font>

483
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,679
bed

484
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:06,779
our position<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at those issues and</font>

485
00:22:04,679 --> 00:22:10,380
make<font color="#E5E5E5"> a reasoned decision about it here</font>

486
00:22:06,779 --> 00:22:12,659
both sides of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> issue before hand if</font>

487
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:15,000
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> this all comes as the result of</font>

488
00:22:12,659 --> 00:22:16,950
a warrant application the court hears

489
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,720
one side of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> story which is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the site</font>

490
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:23,100
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the government doesn't hear from the</font>

491
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:25,049
user you know for these reasons I think

492
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:26,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">these these are situations they're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

493
00:22:25,049 --> 00:22:28,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be more difficult for the users</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

494
00:22:26,850 --> 00:22:31,259
challenged in court than they've been in

495
00:22:28,529 --> 00:22:33,929
the past which i think is concerning and

496
00:22:31,259 --> 00:22:36,059
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think we're not going to see very many</font>

497
00:22:33,929 --> 00:22:38,850
public battles over this<font color="#E5E5E5"> because a lot</font>

498
00:22:36,059 --> 00:22:41,250
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's going to be done in secret with</font>

499
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:44,129
approval sought to do it unilaterally

500
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:48,779
and under seal by the government before

501
00:22:44,129 --> 00:22:51,840
it ever even happens and yet<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have to</font>

502
00:22:48,779 --> 00:22:53,519
say<font color="#E5E5E5"> I feel kind of optimistic because I</font>

503
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:55,678
do think we don't need<font color="#E5E5E5"> a gazillion</font>

504
00:22:53,519 --> 00:22:57,629
battles to happen in court I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

505
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:59,519
we only need a few of the right battles

506
00:22:57,629 --> 00:23:01,740
to happen in court and as I mentioned

507
00:22:59,519 --> 00:23:04,620
earlier i<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> supreme court</font>

508
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:09,840
and other judges are starting to

509
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:12,360
recognize how important it is to be

510
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:15,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">thoughtful about how we think about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

511
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:19,199
legal<font color="#E5E5E5"> implications of technology and the</font>

512
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:25,200
balance<font color="#E5E5E5"> of power among users and</font>

513
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:27,000
government and private industry and how

514
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:31,409
we protect those interests and how we

515
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:32,850
make sure that at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same time law</font>

516
00:23:31,409 --> 00:23:39,659
enforcement can do what it needs to do

517
00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:41,610
right and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that the more that the</font>

518
00:23:39,659 --> 00:23:44,009
courts tend to think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this in that</font>

519
00:23:41,610 --> 00:23:46,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">way you know I don't I don't think we</font>

520
00:23:44,009 --> 00:23:48,029
need a gazillion challenges in court I

521
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:51,570
think we<font color="#CCCCCC"> just need to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure that it</font>

522
00:23:48,029 --> 00:23:53,129
happens at the right times occasionally

523
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:55,769
at the very least because then we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

524
00:23:53,129 --> 00:23:58,139
an opportunity<font color="#E5E5E5"> to litigate it so you</font>

525
00:23:55,769 --> 00:24:02,480
know I I'm curious to hear what you all

526
00:23:58,139 --> 00:24:02,479
think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this yes</font>

527
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:10,250
I can't got it is that they can't compel

528
00:24:07,399 --> 00:24:11,570
you type in your PIN code then you

529
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:13,190
should use pins instead of using

530
00:24:11,570 --> 00:24:15,620
fingerprints you can't change<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

531
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:17,960
fingerprint it makes a horrible password

532
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:21,529
once attacked it's available forever and

533
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:23,210
so nobody should using fingerprints on

534
00:24:21,529 --> 00:24:28,580
your phone fingerprints a great user

535
00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:30,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">maintenance of stinky password and so am</font>

536
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:31,970
i right that if I put it in my<font color="#CCCCCC"> coat I</font>

537
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:35,360
can't the right to say no I'm not going

538
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:38,480
to give you my pin but our behalf word

539
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:40,340
but the difference they can compel so a

540
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:45,140
couple of thoughts about that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

541
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:48,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">you're correct that a password is more</font>

542
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:51,520
testimonial I think just<font color="#CCCCCC"> inherently more</font>

543
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:53,570
testimonial than a fingerprint because a

544
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:56,990
password is something that is in your

545
00:24:53,570 --> 00:24:58,610
mind right unless you've like written it

546
00:24:56,990 --> 00:25:00,200
down or you're keeping it at a password

547
00:24:58,610 --> 00:25:02,418
manager / say we can talk about that

548
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:03,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">later of course right but even with a</font>

549
00:25:02,419 --> 00:25:06,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">password manager you've got at least one</font>

550
00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:08,330
password that you know right and so it's

551
00:25:06,649 --> 00:25:09,559
that that piece<font color="#CCCCCC"> of it that's in your mom</font>

552
00:25:08,330 --> 00:25:11,240
that's in your brain that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

553
00:25:09,559 --> 00:25:14,418
important part and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think you're right</font>

554
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:16,610
that on the whole pass pass codes or

555
00:25:14,419 --> 00:25:19,370
passwords are better for maintaining

556
00:25:16,610 --> 00:25:21,559
your likelihood of being able to assert

557
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:24,320
a Fifth Amendment privilege right I do

558
00:25:21,559 --> 00:25:28,279
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there can be circumstances</font>

559
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:29,539
where a fingerprint would work and but

560
00:25:28,279 --> 00:25:31,100
it has to be the right circumstance

561
00:25:29,539 --> 00:25:33,350
right it's like they<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ask you the</font>

562
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:37,789
right question and it has<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be a</font>

563
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:39,080
situation<font color="#E5E5E5"> where you know putting your</font>

564
00:25:37,789 --> 00:25:40,520
fingerprint on the phone would reveal

565
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:42,230
something right so like if<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

566
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:45,770
government says for example unlock this

567
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:48,230
for me<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay here you know I</font>

568
00:25:45,770 --> 00:25:50,270
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you're revealing that could</font>

569
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:53,690
have testimonial aspects to it

570
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:55,340
testimonial value is that this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is you</font>

571
00:25:53,690 --> 00:25:57,620
know you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this finger well</font>

572
00:25:55,340 --> 00:26:00,980
unlock this phone right so you have

573
00:25:57,620 --> 00:26:03,020
control<font color="#E5E5E5"> over it so I think that there</font>

574
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:05,870
could<font color="#CCCCCC"> be testimonial aspects to that but</font>

575
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:07,039
as a general matter you know like the

576
00:26:05,870 --> 00:26:09,408
government<font color="#CCCCCC"> is allowed to take</font>

577
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:12,230
fingerprints is allowed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to draw</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> blood is</font>

578
00:26:09,409 --> 00:26:14,750
allowed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to take DNA without Fifth</font>

579
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:16,210
Amendment implications because you know

580
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:17,530
those are things that

581
00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:19,570
don't reveal anything about what you

582
00:26:17,530 --> 00:26:22,210
know they<font color="#E5E5E5"> simply reveal who you are</font>

583
00:26:19,570 --> 00:26:23,860
right so I agree with<font color="#CCCCCC"> you that as a</font>

584
00:26:22,210 --> 00:26:26,650
general matter i think passwords are

585
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:28,540
better you know two factors pretty great

586
00:26:26,650 --> 00:26:33,640
too you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to factor resolves</font>

587
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:35,710
both of these issues but fingerprints

588
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:37,930
alone I think your your your legal

589
00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:42,010
protection in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Fifth Amendment sense</font>

590
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:44,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">isn't as robust yes so you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> said you're</font>

591
00:26:42,010 --> 00:26:47,170
optimistic about how all this shakes out

592
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:49,240
what in<font color="#CCCCCC"> your research and your travels</font>

593
00:26:47,170 --> 00:26:51,250
have you seen you feel with the

594
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:54,160
government's next step to try to erode

595
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:58,450
this kind of privacy something that we

596
00:26:54,160 --> 00:27:00,460
as users can look to be on the lookout

597
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:02,890
for so that we know it's coming chance

598
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:04,390
favors the prepared mind right so if

599
00:27:02,890 --> 00:27:05,770
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> prepared and you know what you're</font>

600
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:08,260
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> for you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ready for that</font>

601
00:27:05,770 --> 00:27:10,180
situation<font color="#E5E5E5"> what is something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font>

602
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:12,030
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> looking for for them to take</font>

603
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:14,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">the next step when you say no screw you</font>

604
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:15,790
you're giving me you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> giving it to me</font>

605
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:18,010
whether you like you're not late what do

606
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:20,020
you see what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you feel would be if a</font>

607
00:27:18,010 --> 00:27:22,870
value added to the government<font color="#CCCCCC"> as their</font>

608
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:25,180
next step Selena so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the</font>

609
00:27:22,870 --> 00:27:27,719
trend is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be more in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

610
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:30,610
direction of putting pressure on users

611
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:34,300
because I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know a users are in</font>

612
00:27:30,610 --> 00:27:36,129
a less strong position to fight back I

613
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:38,220
think the best thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can do is know</font>

614
00:27:36,130 --> 00:27:41,860
what your legal rights are and know

615
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:43,930
enough to realize when you get into a

616
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:48,159
situation<font color="#E5E5E5"> where you could assert a right</font>

617
00:27:43,930 --> 00:27:49,300
and be brave enough to assert it you

618
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:51,280
know I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think for a lot of people that's</font>

619
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:53,139
really scary right you need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> think and</font>

620
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:54,790
the in the moment you think oh my gosh

621
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:56,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know if I'm not cooperative here</font>

622
00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:57,639
maybe I just get arrested you know who

623
00:27:56,470 --> 00:27:59,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">knows who knows what's going to happen</font>

624
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:00,940
right but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we need to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

625
00:27:59,530 --> 00:28:02,110
some people who are willing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take that</font>

626
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:07,990
risk if we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be able to fight</font>

627
00:28:02,110 --> 00:28:10,560
the battles yes understanding still

628
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:10,560
challenge

629
00:28:11,090 --> 00:28:17,629
court system as<font color="#E5E5E5"> part of the case what do</font>

630
00:28:14,729 --> 00:28:21,989
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do other real negatives of</font>

631
00:28:17,629 --> 00:28:25,830
interacting and nothing about<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

632
00:28:21,989 --> 00:28:27,629
petition but but the fingerprint data

633
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:32,369
and challenging in court during the

634
00:28:27,629 --> 00:28:36,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">trial well you know I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that part of</font>

635
00:28:32,369 --> 00:28:38,759
the issue is that if you give them you

636
00:28:36,299 --> 00:28:42,839
know if law enforcement shows up at your

637
00:28:38,759 --> 00:28:43,950
home<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you know says I have a warrant</font>

638
00:28:42,839 --> 00:28:47,129
here that says you need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to unlock this</font>

639
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:48,330
device<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you do it I don't know that</font>

640
00:28:47,129 --> 00:28:49,799
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to have a very good leg to</font>

641
00:28:48,330 --> 00:28:51,478
stand on later to challenge it in court

642
00:28:49,799 --> 00:28:53,700
because you know I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think what they're</font>

643
00:28:51,479 --> 00:28:56,700
going to say is basically you agreed to

644
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:58,889
do it right you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I worry that one is</font>

645
00:28:56,700 --> 00:29:00,989
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> waive their rights if they try</font>

646
00:28:58,889 --> 00:29:02,908
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do that and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to make it even a little</font>

647
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:04,739
bit more complicated there was a case

648
00:29:02,909 --> 00:29:08,460
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Supreme Court decided a few</font>

649
00:29:04,739 --> 00:29:10,349
years ago the in which the court

650
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:14,669
basically said if you want to assert

651
00:29:10,349 --> 00:29:16,619
your Fifth Amendment privilege you need

652
00:29:14,669 --> 00:29:18,749
to like make clear that that's what

653
00:29:16,619 --> 00:29:20,849
you're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not supposed to just</font>

654
00:29:18,749 --> 00:29:23,009
remain silent and not answer questions

655
00:29:20,849 --> 00:29:25,139
you're supposed to specifically say I

656
00:29:23,009 --> 00:29:28,499
assert my Fifth Amendment privilege and

657
00:29:25,139 --> 00:29:31,519
so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of people will not do</font>

658
00:29:28,499 --> 00:29:35,789
that in the heat of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the moment right so</font>

659
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:38,849
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that those are all things to to</font>

660
00:29:35,789 --> 00:29:39,989
keep in mind and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know those are all</font>

661
00:29:38,849 --> 00:29:41,729
things that are important to know if you

662
00:29:39,989 --> 00:29:44,429
ever find yourself in a situation like

663
00:29:41,729 --> 00:29:47,519
the one we're talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

664
00:29:44,429 --> 00:29:49,229
know when that type of privilege is

665
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:51,149
likely to arise know if you're likely to

666
00:29:49,229 --> 00:29:54,719
have it and realize that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> need to</font>

667
00:29:51,149 --> 00:29:57,718
specifically say you're asserting it yes

668
00:29:54,719 --> 00:30:00,690
so tidy doesn't work the first time you

669
00:29:57,719 --> 00:30:02,429
fell on<font color="#CCCCCC"> a device if you power off in two</font>

670
00:30:00,690 --> 00:30:03,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">places you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> guys like you need a coming</font>

671
00:30:02,429 --> 00:30:06,260
it out at all does<font color="#E5E5E5"> that leave you guys</font>

672
00:30:03,839 --> 00:30:08,240
like obstruction of justice yes idea

673
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:11,090
ask you I think it just<font color="#E5E5E5"> totally depends</font>

674
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:12,320
on the circumstances um you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know I mean</font>

675
00:30:11,090 --> 00:30:15,830
how would you necessarily know they're

676
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:17,179
coming for one thing right<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you know</font>

677
00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:19,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">I think that the way that that would</font>

678
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:20,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably play out is if the government</font>

679
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:23,690
thinks that you did<font color="#CCCCCC"> something to</font>

680
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:25,670
obstruct their ability to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

681
00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:27,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">evidence that they're looking for you</font>

682
00:30:25,670 --> 00:30:29,480
know they probably would tell a judge

683
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:31,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">that they thought you did that and if</font>

684
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:35,170
the judge believed that that was true

685
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:38,780
then you you could be in trouble right

686
00:30:35,170 --> 00:30:41,150
so I think we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> just about it time it</font>

687
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:42,560
appears to me looking at the clock on<font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

688
00:30:41,150 --> 00:30:44,780
laptop but I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be around feel</font>

689
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:46,190
free to come up and chat with<font color="#E5E5E5"> me I know</font>

690
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:49,810
a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> questions happy to</font>

691
00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:49,810
talk thank you
