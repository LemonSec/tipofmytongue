8
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:25,710
my talk today which is vulnerability

9
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:29,279
management systems flawed leaving your

10
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:33,480
enterprise at high risk but first let me

11
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:36,380
share a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit about myself so I</font>

12
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:40,379
work in San<font color="#CCCCCC"> Antonio for digital defense</font>

13
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:42,210
so just to break the ice i was born<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

14
00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:47,309
Montreal Canada there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of ice</font>

15
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:49,200
there and I grew up<font color="#E5E5E5"> there and graduated</font>

16
00:00:47,309 --> 00:00:51,750
from mcgill university with a computer

17
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,340
engineering degree started working<font color="#CCCCCC"> for a</font>

18
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:55,800
telecom company called northern telecom

19
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:59,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">Bell Nordmann research later transformed</font>

20
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:03,089
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> nortel now no longer exists and</font>

21
00:00:59,539 --> 00:01:05,580
spent five years there and because i was

22
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:07,860
in telecom<font color="#CCCCCC"> i thought where's all the</font>

23
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:10,080
action and all of the telecom action

24
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:12,380
just happened to be in<font color="#E5E5E5"> dallas texas so i</font>

25
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:14,789
moved my small family to dallas texas in

26
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:17,670
late nineteen<font color="#E5E5E5"> ninety-five just after</font>

27
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:18,750
Christmas and started working<font color="#E5E5E5"> there for</font>

28
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:21,470
a company<font color="#CCCCCC"> called digital switching</font>

29
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:24,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">corporation which</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was bought by alcatel</font>

30
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:26,700
anyway<font color="#CCCCCC"> i did a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of software over the</font>

31
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:29,220
years a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of telecom signaling type</font>

32
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:33,119
software and telecom was going downhill

33
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:35,759
around year two thousand or so and by

34
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:37,950
2002 I was just about to be laid off and

35
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,840
I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> starting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to look around and I knew</font>

36
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:42,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">very little about internet security but</font>

37
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,970
I knew a lot about software and so I met

38
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:47,100
met these folks digital defense in San

39
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:48,420
Antonio<font color="#E5E5E5"> they brought me down and I</font>

40
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:50,250
thought hey I'm just going to spend a

41
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:52,110
year there so maybe go back to Dallas

42
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:54,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">because I really liked it but I'm still</font>

43
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:57,030
there it's been 14 years really<font color="#CCCCCC"> loved it</font>

44
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:59,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">they brought me on board to actually</font>

45
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:01,979
help them riorca<font color="#CCCCCC"> tect at the time many</font>

46
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:04,619
many moons ago they're immature

47
00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:06,869
vulnerability management system so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

48
00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:09,889
took I took a tiger team of four people

49
00:02:06,869 --> 00:02:12,760
with myself and weary architected it

50
00:02:09,889 --> 00:02:14,798
it's a SAS base model

51
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:18,129
at the time wasn't called<font color="#E5E5E5"> SAS but you</font>

52
00:02:14,799 --> 00:02:19,900
know terms change and so now<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're in</font>

53
00:02:18,129 --> 00:02:22,359
our sixth iteration so we do

54
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:23,890
vulnerability management learned a lot

55
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:26,290
about that<font color="#E5E5E5"> across</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the years and that's</font>

56
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:27,609
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> this talk is based on I've done</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

57
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:30,640
lot of studies based on what i'm about

58
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:34,299
to share and there is a limitation or a

59
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:37,298
flaw that I've seen in the industry or

60
00:02:34,299 --> 00:02:39,250
rather it's a challenge that all vendors

61
00:02:37,299 --> 00:02:43,540
have to overcome and that's what this

62
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:45,040
talk is about so<font color="#E5E5E5"> hopefully you'll learn</font>

63
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:47,319
something I've given this talk before

64
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:49,599
and many<font color="#E5E5E5"> times most of the times</font>

65
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:51,129
actually when I given it people raise

66
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:52,840
their eyebrows and really Wow why didn't

67
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:54,250
I think of that yeah that makes sense I

68
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:58,870
didn't realize that that was actually a

69
00:02:54,250 --> 00:03:01,569
challenge pretty cool good stuff so the

70
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:04,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I give this talk nowadays is I</font>

71
00:03:01,569 --> 00:03:06,760
don't actually reveal the flaw<font color="#CCCCCC"> up front</font>

72
00:03:04,829 --> 00:03:09,400
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> three quarters of the way through</font>

73
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:11,290
I'll say<font color="#CCCCCC"> AHA here's what the problem is</font>

74
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:14,829
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then we'll talk about consequences</font>

75
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:17,410
etc and so I invite<font color="#CCCCCC"> you if you can guess</font>

76
00:03:14,829 --> 00:03:18,849
this problem before I get to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the end you</font>

77
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:21,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">just raise your hand and I'll call upon</font>

78
00:03:18,849 --> 00:03:23,828
you and you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of shout it out and</font>

79
00:03:21,129 --> 00:03:25,780
if you get the answer correct I don't

80
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:30,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">have any prizes but you get recognition</font>

81
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:32,079
so that's pretty cool<font color="#E5E5E5"> right recognition</font>

82
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:34,000
at bsides DC that's pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool this</font>

83
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:36,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">pretty big conference my first time at</font>

84
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:42,010
besides DC not not at various other

85
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:44,440
besides but anyway I digress so let's

86
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:45,970
kick it off by sharing a use case and

87
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:48,669
there are many<font color="#E5E5E5"> different use cases that</font>

88
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:50,829
sort of highlight this challenge but in

89
00:03:48,669 --> 00:03:53,040
this specific risk use case what I'm

90
00:03:50,829 --> 00:03:55,900
sharing is a hypothetical<font color="#CCCCCC"> situation</font>

91
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:57,819
right so don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> go to this room and say</font>

92
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:59,049
well Gordon just revealed a zero-day

93
00:03:57,819 --> 00:04:02,260
vulnerability because that's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

94
00:03:59,049 --> 00:04:05,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">case</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right but let's assume</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that it</font>

95
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:09,478
recently announced<font color="#CCCCCC"> zero-day just came</font>

96
00:04:05,139 --> 00:04:12,940
out let's say today or yesterday that

97
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:14,889
<font color="#CCCCCC">we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Apache mount the most the earlier</font>

98
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:16,949
versions so two point four point zero<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

99
00:04:14,889 --> 00:04:20,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">two point four point two two is</font>

100
00:04:16,949 --> 00:04:23,110
vulnerable to<font color="#E5E5E5"> some really serious you</font>

101
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:25,430
know flaw but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not impactful</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

102
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:27,289
most recent<font color="#CCCCCC"> release okay</font>

103
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:29,900
what would you do<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a security</font>

104
00:04:27,289 --> 00:04:32,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">professional to understand what your</font>

105
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:33,888
risk is across your organization right

106
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:36,080
so certainly what you'd want to do is

107
00:04:33,889 --> 00:04:38,479
find out where am I vulnerable in my

108
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:40,430
enterprise right where what machines do

109
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:44,479
I have that are running<font color="#E5E5E5"> this vulnerable</font>

110
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:45,860
version so that's one and so you'd

111
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:47,960
probably even run a more recent

112
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:49,880
assessment you could you know even

113
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:51,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">though the vendors out there may not</font>

114
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:53,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">have emerged with the detection that</font>

115
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:55,880
detects this yet they may have but they

116
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:58,370
may<font color="#CCCCCC"> not have you can probably</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> still look</font>

117
00:04:55,880 --> 00:05:00,650
at you know what what where is<font color="#E5E5E5"> Apache</font>

118
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:02,930
and where are the vulnerable versions

119
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:05,330
because many vulnerabilities canners and

120
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:06,349
systems give a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of insight even</font>

121
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:08,630
though they<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't tell you what</font>

122
00:05:06,349 --> 00:05:10,219
application versions etc and<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this</font>

123
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:11,570
case<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this is this is something</font>

124
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:12,979
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you could do but still you'd</font>

125
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:15,139
probably want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> run a more recent</font>

126
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:18,219
assessment across your enterprise to

127
00:05:15,139 --> 00:05:20,870
find out where the vulnerabilities live

128
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:22,970
but that's actually not<font color="#E5E5E5"> enough or said</font>

129
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:25,190
differently we've evolved across time to

130
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:27,860
handle you know more complex use cases

131
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:30,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">and this is where i share in step two</font>

132
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:33,139
where what you'd like to do in addition

133
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:35,570
to step one is to understand you'd like

134
00:05:33,139 --> 00:05:38,000
to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the past and say well it's</font>

135
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:40,219
possible<font color="#E5E5E5"> that i actually was running</font>

136
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">apache on certain machines where ID</font>

137
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:44,690
installed it or maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> i did have a</font>

138
00:05:42,919 --> 00:05:46,940
vulnerable version but i upgraded for

139
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:48,320
whatever reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean the most recent</font>

140
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:53,090
version of apache has been out<font color="#CCCCCC"> for a</font>

141
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:56,120
while here and so so you'd do that right

142
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:59,630
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm showing a diagram here which sort</font>

143
00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:01,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">of puts this into perspective and I like</font>

144
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:04,219
these timing diagrams because a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font>

145
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:05,810
this talk brings in the dimension of

146
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:08,990
time right and we'll talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little more</font>

147
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:12,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">about that in a second the right side of</font>

148
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:14,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">the diagram is showing us instances</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

149
00:06:12,979 --> 00:06:17,330
where we're vulnerable now so it's sort

150
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:19,909
of like a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little tacky network diagram</font>

151
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:22,969
but the red dots are illustrating you

152
00:06:19,909 --> 00:06:24,889
know where<font color="#E5E5E5"> apache is installed at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

153
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:26,389
vulnerable version right so at least wow

154
00:06:24,889 --> 00:06:28,820
yeah we know we know we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have three</font>

155
00:06:26,389 --> 00:06:30,620
instances we can prioritize these we can

156
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:33,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know figure if we want to solve them</font>

157
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:35,240
and remediate them right away or not but

158
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:38,810
now if you look into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> left side of</font>

159
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:40,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">the diagram there's a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot more red dots</font>

160
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:44,060
and what I'm showing here is the

161
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:45,919
possibility of where some at some<font color="#CCCCCC"> point</font>

162
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:49,400
in the past you may have had you know

163
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:51,080
Apache installed at the vulnerable

164
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:52,489
version but whereas today you don't

165
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,690
because for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> you might have D</font>

166
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:55,730
installed a patch you didn't need

167
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:58,760
anymore or maybe you've upgraded right

168
00:06:55,730 --> 00:07:00,110
and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> from an attackers perspective or</font>

169
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:02,360
from a security professionals

170
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:05,120
perspective you may say well<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's very</font>

171
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:06,860
possible that although<font color="#CCCCCC"> we know about</font>

172
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:09,680
this problem today this vulnerability

173
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:11,900
today it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very possible that the</font>

174
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:14,870
hackers or some hackers have known about

175
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:17,120
this problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the past and because of</font>

176
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:19,100
that they may have<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually compromised</font>

177
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,840
some of our systems so you could take

178
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:22,669
<font color="#CCCCCC">this intelligence right this</font>

179
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:24,650
vulnerability intelligence as I say

180
00:07:22,669 --> 00:07:28,010
which lives only in vulnerability land

181
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:30,888
and you can feed that into your Incident

182
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:33,200
Response program to sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you know</font>

185
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,729
know maybe I've already been compromised

00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,900
on this because<font color="#E5E5E5"> your instant response</font>

program might have missed these

188
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:45,380
instances in the past so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font>

189
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:47,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">pretty cool use case so I'm showing a</font>

190
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:49,490
diagram here which is essentially the

191
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:51,169
same and all I'm showing you is you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

192
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:52,820
I'm kind of relating the<font color="#E5E5E5"> endpoints to</font>

193
00:07:51,169 --> 00:07:54,590
give you a better<font color="#E5E5E5"> understanding of you</font>

194
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:56,840
know the past and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the present right so</font>

195
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:58,789
it's very important to be able to relate

196
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:00,770
what's been seen in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the past to what's</font>

197

timing diagram that I like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use and</font>

200
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:12,500
I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be using this kind of</font>

201
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:17,570
diagram throughout my talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so we'll</font>

202
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:19,340
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk a little bit about this so the</font>

bottom<font color="#CCCCCC"> part</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the diagram what I'm</font>

204
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:24,349
showing there is three assets three

205
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:26,690
computers these are the computers that

206
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:30,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can touch you know they're there</font>

207
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:31,850
right there like as a human being I can

208
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:36,849
stand here all day and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can feel this</font>

209
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:39,080
computer assume that's asset a whereas

210
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:42,950
vulnerability management systems that

211
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:46,190
are you know assessing these computers

212
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:48,110
across time they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not just doing it in</font>

213
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:49,820
one shot maybe in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the very very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> olden</font>

214
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:51,590
days that's what a lot of organizations

215
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:53,540
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> run a vulnerability assessment once</font>

216
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:55,520
a year they may or may not have fixed

217
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:58,610
problems but nowadays we're running

218
00:08:55,520 --> 00:09:01,760
scans daily weekly even sometimes

219
00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:04,460
continuously right so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm showing in the</font>

220
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:06,980
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the top part of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the diagram two</font>

00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:08,930
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> points in time where a</font>

223
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:15,920
management system this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is how they</font>

224
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:20,949
viewed these assets across time<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

225
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:25,250
does that make sense so we got a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

226
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:27,260
break here just it's someone already

227
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:32,950
knows what this problem is you can raise

228
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:32,950
your hand great over<font color="#CCCCCC"> here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

229
00:09:50,929 --> 00:09:56,429
pretty pretty good pretty good<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not</font>

230
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:58,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">sure if it's exactly it but it might be</font>

231
00:09:56,429 --> 00:10:02,069
so we'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> just hold on to that one well</font>

232
00:09:58,709 --> 00:10:03,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">hold on to it will continue time has</font>

233
00:10:02,069 --> 00:10:05,099
changed changes time I couldn't really

234
00:10:03,569 --> 00:10:07,738
find something that's sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of more Zen</font>

235
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:10,169
ish than this I've gotten into<font color="#E5E5E5"> Buddhism</font>

236
00:10:07,739 --> 00:10:12,119
over the last<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple years and but</font>

237
00:10:10,169 --> 00:10:14,600
anyway it's this is sort of our little

238
00:10:12,119 --> 00:10:17,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">break point so let's let's get into</font>

239
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:19,709
different scanning technologies to sort

240
00:10:17,459 --> 00:10:23,758
of give us a little more clues a little

241
00:10:19,709 --> 00:10:27,179
more detail right so vulnerability

242
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:29,009
management vendors scan in different

243
00:10:27,179 --> 00:10:31,019
ways they use different technologies and

244
00:10:29,009 --> 00:10:33,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm not showing all of the technologies</font>

245
00:10:31,019 --> 00:10:36,029
here there's there's one that one of the

246
00:10:33,809 --> 00:10:37,858
sponsors sure has which<font color="#E5E5E5"> is pretty cool</font>

247
00:10:36,029 --> 00:10:40,709
it's called passive passive scanning

248
00:10:37,859 --> 00:10:43,230
that's not up here but nevertheless all

249
00:10:40,709 --> 00:10:45,689
of these technologies<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I'm getting</font>

250
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:47,910
into some have this issue and some do

251
00:10:45,689 --> 00:10:50,189
not so agent-based let's talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

252
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:53,249
agent based in agent-based scanning this

253
00:10:50,189 --> 00:10:56,399
is where the vendor has come up with

254
00:10:53,249 --> 00:10:59,939
agents they're like programs that that

255
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:02,459
run on the endpoints so there may be a

256
00:10:59,939 --> 00:11:05,368
centralized scanning solution that

257
00:11:02,459 --> 00:11:07,439
interacts with these agents to signal it

258
00:11:05,369 --> 00:11:09,239
to do a scan starts can but the actual

259
00:11:07,439 --> 00:11:10,618
scan itself is happening<font color="#CCCCCC"> right on the</font>

260
00:11:09,239 --> 00:11:12,809
right on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the end point right on the</font>

261
00:11:10,619 --> 00:11:17,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">computer right so it's pretty</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> accurate</font>

262
00:11:12,809 --> 00:11:22,230
so that's agent-based credentialed based

263
00:11:17,549 --> 00:11:26,309
is a technology where the scanning

264
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:28,860
engine is remote to to the device<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

265
00:11:26,309 --> 00:11:31,860
scanning but you can set up a set of

266
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:33,509
credentials on the endpoints in<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

267
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:35,429
form or fashion and also in the

268
00:11:33,509 --> 00:11:38,610
vulnerability management system and then

269
00:11:35,429 --> 00:11:41,488
the engine will authenticate to the

270
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:44,369
<font color="#CCCCCC">endpoint</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and once authenticated it could</font>

271
00:11:41,489 --> 00:11:47,459
get registry<font color="#E5E5E5"> keys files different</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font>

272
00:11:44,369 --> 00:11:49,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">like that it could even drop if it has</font>

273
00:11:47,459 --> 00:11:51,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">right you know right privileges an</font>

274
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:55,169
endpoint or a program right<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the right</font>

275
00:11:51,959 --> 00:11:56,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the end point so in that regard it's</font>

276
00:11:55,169 --> 00:11:58,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">sort of very similar to age</font>

277
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:59,579
<font color="#CCCCCC">bass but nevertheless it's a little</font>

278
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:02,399
different right<font color="#E5E5E5"> because you have to set</font>

279
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:05,339
up credentials etc so it's also quite

280
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:06,690
accurate but it does have some IT

281
00:12:05,339 --> 00:12:09,959
overhead we'll talk about that in a

282
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:12,290
second<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then thirdly we have the</font>

283
00:12:09,959 --> 00:12:14,849
remote unauthenticated or remote network

284
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:17,449
unauthenticated scanning and this is

285
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:19,829
where once again the scanning engine is

286
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:21,959
remote to the endpoints that it's

287
00:12:19,829 --> 00:12:24,839
scanning it's not on the endpoints it's

288
00:12:21,959 --> 00:12:27,510
not on those hosts in fact in this case

289
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:29,010
it doesn't use any credentials you go

290
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:30,870
into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the vulnerability management system</font>

291
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:34,230
you set up set of ranges or maybe

292
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:35,850
domains and it will use internet

293
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:38,550
messages it'll message these endpoints

294
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:39,899
it'll send ping sweeps etc is there an

295
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:42,899
end point there or not and<font color="#E5E5E5"> if there</font>

296
00:12:39,899 --> 00:12:45,690
isn't it moves on if there is you know

297
00:12:42,899 --> 00:12:48,990
it continues on with open ports it tries

298
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:50,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">to find what OS it is it looks at what</font>

299
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:52,170
applications are running and obviously

300
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:55,140
looks at what vulnerabilities are

301
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:58,860
present right so that's remote

302
00:12:55,140 --> 00:13:00,329
unauthenticated so there's advantages

303
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:05,490
and disadvantages of each of these

304
00:13:00,329 --> 00:13:07,620
different scanning technologies<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

306
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:13,020
this time I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about the</font>

307
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:14,459
last one<font color="#E5E5E5"> remote unauthenticated so just</font>

308
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:16,110
take a<font color="#CCCCCC"> step back all of the vendors</font>

309
00:13:14,459 --> 00:13:20,339
including digital defense which is the

310
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:23,279
company I<font color="#CCCCCC"> work for we use different</font>

311
00:13:20,339 --> 00:13:24,899
techniques technologies I don't think

312
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:28,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's anyone that actually just uses</font>

313
00:13:24,899 --> 00:13:32,070
aging base but most of us<font color="#E5E5E5"> use at least</font>

314
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:34,520
two of these technologies<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we'll</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use</font>

315
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:36,450
remote unauthenticated or as a client

316
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:38,520
you're going to use remote

317
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:40,980
unauthenticated to cast the wide net

318
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:43,439
right because there's no light overhead

319
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:45,510
to do so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you just set a plop a bunch of</font>

320
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:47,540
scanners down and in the case of you

321
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:50,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">know external vulnerability assessments</font>

322
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:51,810
if you're using a cloud-based you don't

323
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:53,070
even need to do anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> because the</font>

324

scanners are just scanning you from

325

external but anyway the key message is

326
00:13:55,880 --> 00:14:01,560
very low overhead and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty good</font>

327
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:03,570

privileged required but anyway I digress

333
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:15,270
so that's remote unauthenticated so as a

334
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:17,610
client as an organization you'll be

335
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:19,710
using that technology by and large to

336
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:23,190
cast a wide net across time at regular

337
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:25,620

you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to do this across the board</font>

341
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:34,860
that's good for<font color="#CCCCCC"> you but agent based in</font>

342
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:37,199
credential based have high tea overhead

00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:38,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">right and they don't they're sporadic in</font>

344
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:40,560
that you you don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> agents for every</font>

345
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:42,540
type of device you don't have agents for

00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:44,910
routers and you know it's hard<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

347
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:46,349
credential eyes these things and you

348
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:48,420
probably want to keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> your credentials</font>

349
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:50,370
set up forever etc so<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are some</font>

350
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:52,469
disadvantages to those but<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's</font>

351
00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:54,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">certainly it's better to use those</font>

352
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:56,910
because they're deeper right because

353
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,200
you're on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> endpoints you can get a</font>

for example<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can't see remotely right</font>

357
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:06,630
because they're not internet-facing so

358
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:07,890
you'll have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> use credential</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> base or</font>

359
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:09,660
agent-based applying those types of

360
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:11,040
things so there's a mixture of these

361
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:14,189
different technologies that one would

362
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:16,050
use and so key message here is by and

363
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:18,720
large remote unauthenticated or remote

364

366
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:28,190
be using it to some extent so<font color="#CCCCCC"> takeaways</font>

367
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:32,040
most vulnerability management vendors

368
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:34,560
use or at least provide you the client

369
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:36,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">the enterprise with the technique of</font>

370
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:40,020
remote on authenticated scanning but

371
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:41,730
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> of course you could also give you a</font>

372
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:43,199
credential based or agent based and you

373
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:45,360
can use these depending upon your use

374
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:48,030
case right so if you know where your

375
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:50,010
high-value assets are you would use

376
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:51,329
you'd use a credential<font color="#CCCCCC"> base you'd spend</font>

377
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:54,860
a little bit more money to use

378
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:54,860
credential base or agent based right

379
00:15:55,040 --> 00:16:01,199
organizations<font color="#E5E5E5"> employ remote scanning on</font>

380
00:15:57,390 --> 00:16:02,850
a recurrent basics across time to cast a

381
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:06,060
wide net because it's easy right low IT

382
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:09,300
overhead and once<font color="#E5E5E5"> again they'll use</font>

383
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:12,140
credential based for agent-based for

384
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:12,140
high risk assets

385
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:21,069
so we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> getting closer one question</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

386
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:22,870
might ask is is especially when you're

387
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:25,800
looking at that timing diagram that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

388
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:28,150
showed earlier on where you saw the

389
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:30,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">different endpoints being scanned at</font>

390
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:33,280
different points in time and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the real</font>

391
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:37,930
world assets at the bottom that you can

392
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:42,790
touch well you'd wonder<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay how does</font>

393
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:45,489
the system know that the endpoints in

394
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:46,839
one point in time<font color="#E5E5E5"> are related to the</font>

395
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:48,840
correct counterparts at a different

396
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:52,060
point in time<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be a question</font>

397
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:54,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you'd wonder about right and that's</font>

398
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:57,520
what this talks about essentially so how

399
00:16:54,370 --> 00:17:00,700
did the vendors do this so they use

400
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:02,949
various what I call<font color="#E5E5E5"> network detectable</font>

401
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:05,980
cat characteristics as their match key

402
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:08,890
right so certainly IP address is used

403
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:12,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">quite heavily but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they're other vendors</font>

404
00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:14,800
use various hostnames MAC address is a

405
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:17,110
good one although as evolution has

406
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:20,349
occurred not necessarily for virtualized

407
00:17:17,109 --> 00:17:22,119
environments host types lots of other

408
00:17:20,349 --> 00:17:24,458
different characteristics that these

409
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:29,320
vendors use<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so this is just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to give</font>

410
00:17:24,459 --> 00:17:31,030
you a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea so in my research I</font>

411
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:32,290
looked at I looked out there and I tried

412
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:35,560
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> understand well what do these vendors</font>

413
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:39,280
like what do specific vendors do and how

414
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:41,919
accurate is it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I found this</font>

415
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:43,660
algorithm which is actually it's pretty

416
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:47,140
cool because<font color="#E5E5E5"> they actually describe it</font>

417
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:50,710
right on their website and they call it

418
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:52,960
hosts tracking and or the prop they<font color="#CCCCCC"> call</font>

419
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:55,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">the problem host tracking I call this</font>

420
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:59,080
algorithm single host tracking key where

421
00:17:55,810 --> 00:18:01,600
the administrator is allowed or able to

422
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:03,970
go in<font color="#E5E5E5"> and specify which one to choose so</font>

423
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:06,340
if you think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about this algorithm you</font>

424
00:18:03,970 --> 00:18:09,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">can think about your fingerprint and if</font>

425
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:12,070
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at a fingerprint in this</font>

426
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:13,720
example you as the administrator of the

427
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:16,149
vulnerability management system can come

428
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:19,360
in and indicate I want to use

429
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:21,640
characteristic a or characters to be or

430
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:23,530
characteristic see it's not all three at

431
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:25,600
the same time that's one so you choose

432
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:27,549
one and it depends on what type of<font color="#E5E5E5"> host</font>

433
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:29,590
you have so if you have laptop

434
00:18:27,549 --> 00:18:31,779
right or desktops that are in dhcp

435
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:34,720
ranges you're not going to choose IP

436
00:18:31,779 --> 00:18:36,009
address but incidentally if you don't

437
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,960
even know<font color="#CCCCCC"> about this problem when you</font>

438
00:18:36,009 --> 00:18:40,299
just wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you know install your</font>

439
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:42,820
scanners quickly and start scanning your

440
00:18:40,299 --> 00:18:45,129
environment by<font color="#E5E5E5"> default it's going to use</font>

441
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:47,379
IP address and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> only thing</font>

442
00:18:45,129 --> 00:18:49,418
that's going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to use to track so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> after a</font>

443
00:18:47,379 --> 00:18:50,969
<font color="#CCCCCC">while when you start discovering some</font>

444
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:53,350
issues which we'll talk about later

445
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:56,049
you'll then<font color="#E5E5E5"> go into the system and</font>

446
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:58,570
you'll say oh<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> isn't a DHCP</font>

447
00:18:56,049 --> 00:19:01,570
range i think i'll use netbios hostname

448
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:03,908
as an example<font color="#E5E5E5"> right so it's one of these</font>

449
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:06,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">three that you could</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

450
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:09,309
this is an example of one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the largest</font>

451
00:19:06,129 --> 00:19:15,609
vendors out there incidentally<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font>

452
00:19:09,309 --> 00:19:17,918
not a sponsor here so just sharing it so

453
00:19:15,609 --> 00:19:20,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">I was curious I was curious because when</font>

454
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:22,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">I started a digital defense in the first</font>

455
00:19:20,619 --> 00:19:25,299
iteration when i was there very very

456
00:19:22,899 --> 00:19:28,959
young system I<font color="#E5E5E5"> guess very you know put</font>

457
00:19:25,299 --> 00:19:31,389
together with a Spock would say I'm a

458
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:34,779
Star Trek fan stone knives and bearskins

459
00:19:31,389 --> 00:19:38,109
but anyway I remember I<font color="#CCCCCC"> was in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the lab</font>

460
00:19:34,779 --> 00:19:39,999
because we had some clients who were you

461
00:19:38,109 --> 00:19:42,939
know they<font color="#CCCCCC"> had</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these bugs as we call him</font>

462
00:19:39,999 --> 00:19:45,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">right and I couldn't actually solve it</font>

463
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:46,960
because our database relations were the

464
00:19:45,429 --> 00:19:48,309
way they<font color="#CCCCCC"> were right so I was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to</font>

465
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:52,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">move data around to sort of get things</font>

466
00:19:48,309 --> 00:19:54,940
to work with the key messages i did this

467
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:56,529
issue when I was very<font color="#CCCCCC"> very young at</font>

468
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:58,269
digital defense not to say<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I'm</font>

469
00:19:56,529 --> 00:20:01,389
young but young meaning i just started

470
00:19:58,269 --> 00:20:04,359
there right and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i wondered how could</font>

471
00:20:01,389 --> 00:20:06,908
i solve this issue how could I how could

472
00:20:04,359 --> 00:20:09,580
I how could I make it better and so I

473
00:20:06,909 --> 00:20:12,549
came<font color="#E5E5E5"> out with an algorithm that is still</font>

474
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:14,918
<font color="#E5E5E5">being used and that's been involved but</font>

475
00:20:12,549 --> 00:20:16,869
of course with anything that's complex

476
00:20:14,919 --> 00:20:18,359
in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> world of software if there's some</font>

477
00:20:16,869 --> 00:20:20,529
software developers here you understand

478
00:20:18,359 --> 00:20:21,970
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> always going to have some bugs it</font>

479
00:20:20,529 --> 00:20:24,039
doesn't matter how<font color="#CCCCCC"> good you are right</font>

480
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:27,489
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not just you it's your whole</font>

481
00:20:24,039 --> 00:20:29,169
team and so there's an investment right

482
00:20:27,489 --> 00:20:30,700
so as you start getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> more mature in</font>

483
00:20:29,169 --> 00:20:32,619
your career you understand yeah there's

484
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:35,769
software and then there's economics

485
00:20:32,619 --> 00:20:37,869
right and so the more complex you you

486
00:20:35,769 --> 00:20:39,910
make a feature you have to think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

487
00:20:37,869 --> 00:20:41,740
the economics involved in that right

488
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:43,600
and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wondered that we waste our time</font>

489
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:45,040
with this because we're you know we're

490
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:48,639
having<font color="#E5E5E5"> the baby sit this algorithm</font>

491
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:51,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">evolve it etc and so I said you know let</font>

492
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:54,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">me do a study and I went out there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and I</font>

493
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:56,320
try to understand well how<font color="#CCCCCC"> often do</font>

494
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:59,560
these characteristics that these vendors

495
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:01,659
use to track the end points across time

496
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:04,330
or the<font color="#CCCCCC"> host across time how often do</font>

497
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:06,730
these characteristics change and of

498
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:09,159
<font color="#CCCCCC">course you know if you're talking about</font>

499
00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:12,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">laptops you're going to realize or at</font>

500
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:13,780
least intuitively know that your IP

501
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:15,850
addresses are not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to stay static</font>

502
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:18,370
forever because you're in dhcp range so

503
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:20,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">that makes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sense right so what I did is</font>

504
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:21,820
I looked I looked and because we're like

505
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:23,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">a cloud basis a space we have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of</font>

506
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:26,980
data and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can talk about how i did</font>

507
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:31,090
this analysis if you're interested but I

508
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:33,700
spy categorized different devices into

509
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:40,179
server type devices client type devices

510
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:42,190
laptops desktops printers you know

511
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:45,760
different routers etc different<font color="#E5E5E5"> types of</font>

512
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:47,920
devices and I looked across time and my

513
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:49,810
goal was to understand how often<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

514
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:52,470
these characteristics change across time

515
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:55,510
so I took us time slice of three months

516
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:57,580
the study actually covered like over a

517
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:59,950
year<font color="#CCCCCC"> but I took a time slice of three</font>

518
00:21:57,580 --> 00:22:02,560
months and I said<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay if a</font>

519
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:04,230
characteristic changes at least once

520
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:07,210
across that three month time period

521
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:10,570
that's a flag that's account right and

522
00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:14,710
so I'm listing two different categories

523
00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:17,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">of devices here servers and client type</font>

524
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:18,970
devices servers<font color="#E5E5E5"> are database servers web</font>

525
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:21,550
servers those kind of types of servers

526
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:23,440
that actually serve and client type

527
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:25,389
devices are like laptops or you have

528
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:27,430
your you know your<font color="#E5E5E5"> your google chrome</font>

529
00:22:25,390 --> 00:22:30,640
etc you're doing work you're writing

530
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:33,040
word docs etc right so server type

531
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:34,150
characteristics<font color="#E5E5E5"> you would think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that if</font>

532
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:36,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">you have a server it's not going to</font>

533
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:37,930
change characteristics much you plop it

534
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:40,060
down you know you<font color="#E5E5E5"> give it an IP address</font>

535
00:22:37,930 --> 00:22:42,640
you give it a<font color="#CCCCCC"> dull name don't maybe a</font>

536
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:46,530
domain name etc and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it's not</font>

537
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:48,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">going to change much but actually it</font>

538
00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:50,379
changes more frequently than what we

539
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:52,600
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> have thought and so my analysis</font>

540
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:55,570
shows my analysis and my team shows that

541
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:58,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">for example even just IP address changes</font>

542
00:22:55,570 --> 00:23:00,399
at four percent across a three month

543
00:22:58,090 --> 00:23:02,590
time period so if you think<font color="#E5E5E5"> of an</font>

544
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:05,410
organization a large organization<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

545
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:07,510
has for example 100,000 servers in their

546
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:09,310
organization and you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font>

547
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:14,170
vulnerability management<font color="#CCCCCC"> moaner ability</font>

548
00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:15,460
scanning as time goes<font color="#CCCCCC"> on or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> even if</font>

549
00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:18,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not doing vulnerability scanning</font>

550
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:22,330
the point is those characteristics that

551
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:25,540
are being<font color="#CCCCCC"> used as as match piece change</font>

552
00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:28,060
they're moving and so four percent of

553
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:30,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">those that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 4,000 devices may not be</font>

554
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:31,929
much but compounds over time it's like

555
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:34,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">the compounding value of money right</font>

556
00:23:31,930 --> 00:23:36,280
it's like interest so after another

557
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:37,810
three months you get another four

558
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:40,300
percent and even the original four

559
00:23:37,810 --> 00:23:41,679
percent changes again if<font color="#E5E5E5"> that makes</font>

560
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:42,730
sense at a four percent rate so that's

561
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:44,740
IP address and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then the other</font>

562
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:46,810
characteristics are listed here I'm only

563
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:49,300
listening three characteristics but the

564
00:23:46,810 --> 00:23:50,500
study actually covers much more and if

565
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:52,030
you're interested links at the bottom

566
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:53,550
there I know he's probably hard to see

567
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:56,290
but hopefully the slides<font color="#E5E5E5"> are available</font>

568
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:58,300
afterwards and you can get to it but

569
00:23:56,290 --> 00:24:04,720
it's on<font color="#CCCCCC"> my website my company's website</font>

570
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:08,320
right so things change so<font color="#CCCCCC"> the takeaway</font>

571
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:10,420
here is if you look at a given asset a

572
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:14,760
given endpoint a given host on using

573
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:19,150
these different terms interchangeably as

574
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:21,820
time progresses those things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we see</font>

575
00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:23,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">from a remote perspective right when</font>

576
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:25,929
we're back here as a scanner<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we're</font>

577
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:27,970
looking and we're sending messages that

578
00:24:25,930 --> 00:24:29,560
and we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting responses back we're</font>

579
00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:33,550
saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay this is what we're seeing</font>

580
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:36,129
for this device<font color="#E5E5E5"> right now but if I scan</font>

581
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:39,159
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> next week will I see the same that's</font>

582
00:24:36,130 --> 00:24:44,380
the question the answer is to some

583
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:45,520
extent yes but to a large extent<font color="#E5E5E5"> no so</font>

584
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:47,830
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the point in time where I</font>

585
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:50,379
actually and I kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of been scanning to</font>

586
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:52,149
see if there's any hands up but this is

587
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:55,000
the point in time where I reveal this

588
00:24:52,150 --> 00:24:57,160
limitation this flaw right so let's

589
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">bring it together and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then we'll talk</font>

590
00:24:57,160 --> 00:25:00,880
about consequences the most widely<font color="#CCCCCC"> used</font>

591
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,640
scanning technology is remote on

592
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:06,290
authentic

593
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:10,260
okay we talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that most vendors</font>

594
00:25:06,290 --> 00:25:12,530
will will track hosts track point in

595
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:15,720
time scanned endpoints using a limited

596
00:25:12,530 --> 00:25:17,370
set of these characteristics that i

597
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:19,680
mentioned for example IP address<font color="#CCCCCC"> teen</font>

598
00:25:17,370 --> 00:25:22,439
<font color="#CCCCCC">associating that bias hosting in the</font>

599
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:24,630
example i gave you of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the large vendor</font>

600
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:27,330
you could actually go in and specify

601
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:28,890
which one so you have some control but

602
00:25:27,330 --> 00:25:31,320
even<font color="#CCCCCC"> then it's still not enough and</font>

603
00:25:28,890 --> 00:25:32,670
other vendors actually you you don't

604
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:35,610
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> control which is good because its</font>

605
00:25:32,670 --> 00:25:39,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">hands off but if you have a problem how</font>

606
00:25:35,610 --> 00:25:41,879
do you fix it Third Point all remotely

607
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:44,370
discoverable characteristics are subject

608
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:45,840
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> change and the study that we've done</font>

609
00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:47,459
actually shows that a change is quite

610
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:49,679
frequently more than<font color="#E5E5E5"> what would have</font>

611
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:52,200
thought so what is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this flaw what is</font>

612
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:54,750
this problem it's that vulnerability

613
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:58,050
management systems often track point in

614
00:25:54,750 --> 00:26:00,960
time you know scanned endpoints and they

615
00:25:58,050 --> 00:26:05,040
make mistakes<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we'll go through those</font>

616
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:07,830
mistakes with the consequences there's

617
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:10,889
two different types of consequences acid

618
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:12,600
duplication and asset mismatch and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

619
00:26:10,890 --> 00:26:17,060
have my opinion as as to which ones more

620
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:20,060
severe but let's let's look at these

621
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:20,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay</font>

622
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:28,490
the more bubbly not connected

623
00:26:31,610 --> 00:26:39,570
very true yes very true yeah okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> great</font>

624
00:26:36,659 --> 00:26:41,669
so consequences of this of this flaw

625
00:26:39,570 --> 00:26:43,439
asset mismatch so here's here's that

626
00:26:41,669 --> 00:26:46,379
diagram again where I'm showing us at a

627
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:48,779
B and C right so<font color="#E5E5E5"> imagine you know Here I</font>

628
00:26:46,379 --> 00:26:51,629
am in week one I do my skin I see three

629
00:26:48,779 --> 00:26:54,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">endpoints red yellow and the black</font>

630
00:26:51,629 --> 00:26:56,340
endpoint and I don't know if you can see

631
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:57,748
this but essentially they're different

632
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:59,699
characteristics up there there's IP

633
00:26:57,749 --> 00:27:02,460
address there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS hosting that bias</font>

634
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:06,749
hostname MAC address etc at the on the

635
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:11,460
different endpoint or hosts some point

636
00:27:06,749 --> 00:27:14,100
between at some point between scan week

637
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:17,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">one and scan week two there's been some</font>

638
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:19,559
IT you know someone an IT<font color="#E5E5E5"> and um keep in</font>

639
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:22,249
mind and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know when you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in a large</font>

640
00:27:19,559 --> 00:27:25,559
enterprise often what happens is that

641
00:27:22,249 --> 00:27:27,779
there's a centralized security team that

642
00:27:25,559 --> 00:27:29,549
manages vulnerability management and

643
00:27:27,779 --> 00:27:32,970
other security tools and then you have

644
00:27:29,549 --> 00:27:34,470
maybe even multiple IT teams spread out

645
00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:38,549
throughout the organization that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you you</font>

646
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:40,110
know a sign remediation out to etc and

647
00:27:38,549 --> 00:27:41,759
then thirdly<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have these IT people</font>

648
00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:43,678
that are you know making things making

649
00:27:41,759 --> 00:27:45,840
sure things stay up moving things around

650
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:47,519
moving printers around etc right so

651
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:49,080
they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing i.t work right and they</font>

652
00:27:47,519 --> 00:27:50,460
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> necessarily even know that there's</font>

653
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:52,199
a vulnerability management program in

654
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:54,240
place they're just their goal in life is

655
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:56,970
to keep things running and they don't

656
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:58,529
necessarily communicate together so it's

657
00:27:56,970 --> 00:28:02,369
not like someone's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be like oh I</font>

658
00:27:58,529 --> 00:28:03,960
better not change this because yep what

659
00:28:02,369 --> 00:28:05,158
they're thinking about users certainly

660
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:06,830
but they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not necessarily thinking</font>

661
00:28:05,159 --> 00:28:09,809
about the vulnerability management

662
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:12,149
management team who's actually you know

663
00:28:09,809 --> 00:28:14,730
trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to measure risk and trying to you</font>

664
00:28:12,149 --> 00:28:17,309
know drive out risk so anyway this is a

665
00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:19,049
situation where in week<font color="#CCCCCC"> two we see that</font>

666
00:28:17,309 --> 00:28:21,269
the yellow note in the red note

667
00:28:19,049 --> 00:28:23,519
experienced an IP address change and as

668
00:28:21,269 --> 00:28:27,779
a result the vulnerability management

669
00:28:23,519 --> 00:28:31,460
system actually if I had a pointer I'd

670
00:28:27,779 --> 00:28:36,059
show this the asset a is actually

671
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:38,789
mismatched and so what happens is the

672
00:28:36,059 --> 00:28:40,440
red the red asset originally was the red

673
00:28:38,789 --> 00:28:42,180
asset but now the boner

674
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:45,000
management system thinks it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the actual</font>

675
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:47,490
yellow one and what happens in this case

676
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:49,680
is if you imagine a situation to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make to</font>

677
00:28:47,490 --> 00:28:51,960
sort of make it<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple imagine a</font>

678
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:53,670
situation where the red asset and the

679
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:56,040
yellow asset they both have

680
00:28:53,670 --> 00:28:57,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">vulnerabilities but their sets are</font>

681
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:59,159
completely disjoint they don't have

682
00:28:57,780 --> 00:29:01,950
vulnerabilities in common let's just

683
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:03,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">make that assumption right now the</font>

684
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:06,960
vulnerability management system after

685
00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:09,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">this mismatch had occurred what it will</font>

686
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:11,310
do is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it will declare all of the</font>

687
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:13,200
vulnerabilities that were there that

688
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:16,830
were present that we're scan in<font color="#E5E5E5"> week</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font>

689
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:18,510
as having been fixed because<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't</font>

690
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:22,470
see them anymore right because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

691
00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:24,330
mismatch and so you're like yay<font color="#E5E5E5"> I solved</font>

692
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:25,650
all those vulnerabilities but it's like

693
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:28,889
we'll wait a second no I didn't really

694
00:29:25,650 --> 00:29:32,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">and of course it'll also declare new</font>

695
00:29:28,890 --> 00:29:34,920
ones those of the yellow right so that's

696
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:37,139
a mismatch pretty serious a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

697
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:39,510
times it's hard to tell because you have

698
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:40,830
so many hosts in your organization and

699
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:43,140
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> running this program in a</font>

700
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:45,389
continuous basis so it's difficult<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

701
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:46,890
see often you'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> see something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's</font>

702
00:29:45,390 --> 00:29:49,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">like I don't know what's wrong there's</font>

703
00:29:46,890 --> 00:29:55,820
something wrong here and this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is what's</font>

704
00:29:49,410 --> 00:29:57,900
happening<font color="#E5E5E5"> often asset duplication is</font>

705
00:29:55,820 --> 00:30:00,090
other than the one<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the gentleman</font>

706
00:29:57,900 --> 00:30:05,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">over there mentioned is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the second type</font>

707
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:07,699
of flaw so in this scenario imagine time

708
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:10,290
has gone by now we're at week 23 and

709
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:12,420
we've solved<font color="#CCCCCC"> the issue of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the red host</font>

710
00:30:10,290 --> 00:30:14,370
because what happened is we said hey

711
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:18,420
let's use a different match key let's

712
00:30:14,370 --> 00:30:20,280
use<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> host name because that thing</font>

713
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:22,680
doesn't seem to change as much and you

714
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:23,940
know we have a naming server and so

715
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:26,880
let's do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> for this thing that's</font>

716
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:29,850
great so we see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that in week 24 when the</font>

717
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:32,610
scan ran the red endpoint is correctly

718
00:30:29,850 --> 00:30:36,240
matched and that's good but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem</font>

719
00:30:32,610 --> 00:30:38,100
is the yellow endpoint which just have

720
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:40,590
so happened to have the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> IP as the</font>

721
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:44,310
red one originally which has a different

722
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:46,679
IP than what it had in week 23 and it

723
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:48,960
was actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> still using IP address as a</font>

724
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:50,460
match key and as a result the system

725
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:52,290
says well I never<font color="#CCCCCC"> seen this endpoint</font>

726
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:55,110
before it must be new

727
00:30:52,290 --> 00:30:56,850
let me add it to my asset list so now

728
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:59,159
instead of<font color="#CCCCCC"> having three assets I have</font>

729
00:30:56,850 --> 00:31:00,570
four which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of cool from the</font>

730
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:02,670
vendor's perspective if they're charging

731
00:31:00,570 --> 00:31:04,590
by IP address because now you're

732
00:31:02,670 --> 00:31:06,660
actually spending more money but in fact

733
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:09,389
you still<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> only have three endpoints</font>

734
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:11,190
you really don't have four right so this

735
00:31:09,390 --> 00:31:14,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">is an issue right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is this could</font>

736
00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:16,950
happen so as you you know in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the olden</font>

737
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:18,510
days digital defense actually had these

738
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:20,970
issues and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we evolved it but we had a</font>

739
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:22,950
very large client and we had a certain

740
00:31:20,970 --> 00:31:24,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">set of assets and the asset list and it</font>

741
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:26,760
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> growing and it was growing and it</font>

742
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:27,990
was growing and we're monitoring and

743
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:29,550
we're like what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on or something</font>

744
00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:31,170
wrong so that's been fixed and stuff

745
00:31:29,550 --> 00:31:34,649
many many years ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> in over</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ten years</font>

746
00:31:31,170 --> 00:31:40,020
but the key messages all vendors are

747
00:31:34,650 --> 00:31:42,690
susceptible to this<font color="#E5E5E5"> challenge so these</font>

748
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:43,920
are not the<font color="#CCCCCC"> host you're looking for so</font>

749
00:31:42,690 --> 00:31:46,530
I'm a Star Trek fan but I couldn't find

750
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:53,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">anything on Star Trek I like Star Wars 2</font>

751
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:53,000
so anyway how we doing on time pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font>

752
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:57,959
impacts now you could you could imagine

753
00:31:56,160 --> 00:32:01,910
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the impacts now I'm assuming</font>

754
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:05,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">right based upon what we talked about I</font>

755
00:32:01,910 --> 00:32:06,930
call these<font color="#CCCCCC"> dev ops</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and sec ops impacts</font>

756
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:09,629
and and I have a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of stories on this</font>

757
00:32:06,930 --> 00:32:11,250
there's there's a there's something I

758
00:32:09,630 --> 00:32:14,520
call chasing ghosts<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we've had</font>

759
00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:17,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">multiple prospects come to us and they</font>

760
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:19,020
tell us<font color="#E5E5E5"> about stories which is good</font>

761
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:21,090
because we're like oh we know what the

762
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:23,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">problem is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and we shared with them you</font>

763
00:32:21,090 --> 00:32:26,639
know how how our technology solves it

764
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:28,650
but anyway the story<font color="#E5E5E5"> the story is where</font>

765
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:31,350
before<font color="#E5E5E5"> I kind of alluded or start</font>

766
00:32:28,650 --> 00:32:33,450
started a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit we're in large</font>

767
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:35,280
organizations you have these humongous

768
00:32:33,450 --> 00:32:37,080
teams right<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have a centralized</font>

769
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:40,649
security team and then you have IT teams

770
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:42,300
out there right so this prospect who's

771
00:32:40,650 --> 00:32:44,940
now a client came to us<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they and</font>

772
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:46,950
they told<font color="#E5E5E5"> us</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> story where the vote</font>

773
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:48,960
they were they were doing this scan and

774
00:32:46,950 --> 00:32:51,630
because of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the mismatches they were</font>

775
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:53,670
taking the vulnerabilities and assigning

776
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:55,290
them out to the wrong IT team thinking

777
00:32:53,670 --> 00:32:58,260
that they own these assets when in fact

778
00:32:55,290 --> 00:33:00,480
it was just due to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a mismatch and so</font>

779
00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:02,250
what happened was the<font color="#E5E5E5"> people who were</font>

780
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:04,500
receiving these problems these

781
00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:06,220
vulnerabilities to solve they were like

782
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:07,539
okay that's great let me<font color="#E5E5E5"> go into</font>

783
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:09,669
the gate and they would spend<font color="#CCCCCC"> time</font>

784
00:33:07,539 --> 00:33:11,020
investigating learning about the

785
00:33:09,669 --> 00:33:12,909
vulnerability which is a good thing so

786
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:15,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's not really wasted i guess if they</font>

787
00:33:12,909 --> 00:33:16,960
had<font color="#E5E5E5"> that moment really really to fix but</font>

788
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:19,720
then when it came time to actually find

789
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:21,549
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> device it took them a long time to</font>

790
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:23,500
figure out this<font color="#E5E5E5"> isn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> even our this is</font>

791
00:33:21,549 --> 00:33:25,570
you it isn't even<font color="#E5E5E5"> our device you miss</font>

792
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:27,010
assigned it and so that's what<font color="#E5E5E5"> i call</font>

793
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:30,908
chasing ghosts so there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of money</font>

794
00:33:27,010 --> 00:33:36,039
spent you know chasing ghosts and and

795
00:33:30,909 --> 00:33:38,740
and wasting time mismatch scanned<font color="#CCCCCC"> end</font>

796
00:33:36,039 --> 00:33:41,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">points as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i mentioned</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> before we roll all</font>

797
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:42,549
my vulnerabilities have been solved that

798
00:33:41,049 --> 00:33:45,100
actually gives you a false sense of

799
00:33:42,549 --> 00:33:49,870
security so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is this is sort of like</font>

800
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:51,850
this is pretty serious<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean when you</font>

801
00:33:49,870 --> 00:33:54,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at vulnerability management systems</font>

802
00:33:51,850 --> 00:33:56,530
nowadays we're we're all pretty good<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

803
00:33:54,130 --> 00:33:58,000
scanning you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah we you</font>

804
00:33:56,530 --> 00:33:59,889
know a lot of a lot of clients or

805
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:03,370
prospects will when they're vetting out

806
00:33:59,890 --> 00:34:07,750
different vendors they will run<font color="#E5E5E5"> a scan</font>

807
00:34:03,370 --> 00:34:10,210
on a specific you know test bed and

808
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:11,320
they'll do that for all the different

809
00:34:10,210 --> 00:34:13,300
vendors<font color="#E5E5E5"> but they're really just running</font>

810
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:15,520
one scan they're not and they're looking

811
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:17,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">at well how accurate is it and okay</font>

812
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:19,449
great and that's good and maybe in the

813
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:21,490
olden days you know we would have seen

814
00:34:19,449 --> 00:34:24,759
some vendors have a lot more coverage

815
00:34:21,489 --> 00:34:27,040
than others but one of the things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

816
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:29,500
know that these prospects don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> do is</font>

817
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:31,869
actually take into account this time

818
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:34,300
drift right run scans across time what

819
00:34:31,869 --> 00:34:36,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">happens if your if your if your</font>

820
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:39,399
endpoints actually change right change

821
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:42,790
these characteristics so that's a sort

822
00:34:39,399 --> 00:34:45,219
of my spiel on that boner believes the

823
00:34:42,790 --> 00:34:46,810
cleared fix when<font color="#E5E5E5"> in fact they're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not so</font>

824
00:34:45,219 --> 00:34:48,609
that's a problem and one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the things</font>

825
00:34:46,810 --> 00:34:51,489
<font color="#CCCCCC">that I you know in some other talks that</font>

826
00:34:48,609 --> 00:34:56,589
I give is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> as as a security general</font>

827
00:34:51,489 --> 00:34:58,180
like a SISO or you know a CIO etc you're

828
00:34:56,589 --> 00:35:01,000
looking at this vulnerability management

829
00:34:58,180 --> 00:35:03,580
system as a gauge for your risk right

830
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:06,910
and you're using this information to

831
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:10,060
make important decisions what if this

832
00:35:06,910 --> 00:35:13,180
gauge is off that's what I say and I've

833
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:15,880
seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so obviously the ideal scan the</font>

834
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:17,618
scan<font color="#E5E5E5"> endpoint correlation solution is to</font>

835
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:18,859
get everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> right it doesn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> always</font>

836
00:35:17,619 --> 00:35:21,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">happen</font>

837
00:35:18,859 --> 00:35:23,779
but there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> some solutions out there</font>

838
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:28,950
including<font color="#CCCCCC"> digital defense that actually</font>

839
00:35:23,779 --> 00:35:30,900
we use we use everything we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can see</font>

840
00:35:28,950 --> 00:35:33,509
right so it's kind of like<font color="#E5E5E5"> instead of</font>

841
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:36,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> using one thing on your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fingerprint</font>

842
00:35:33,509 --> 00:35:39,539
why not look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything and so that's</font>

843
00:35:36,089 --> 00:35:41,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">what we do we look at all of those</font>

844
00:35:39,539 --> 00:35:42,660
characteristics i mentioned we look at

845
00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:44,849
what ports are open we look<font color="#CCCCCC"> at what</font>

846
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:46,259
applications are running we look at all

847
00:35:44,849 --> 00:35:48,089
the way down<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the vulnerabilities and</font>

848
00:35:46,259 --> 00:35:49,650
granted vulnerabilities are going to

849
00:35:48,089 --> 00:35:51,960
change a lot they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be solved</font>

850
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:54,089
but we still<font color="#CCCCCC"> use them in a different</font>

851
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:55,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">weighted fashion that makes sense we</font>

852
00:35:54,089 --> 00:35:57,989
don't look at every characteristic and

853
00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:00,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">say oh that's that's so important that's</font>

854
00:35:57,989 --> 00:36:02,549
something different characteristics have

855
00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:05,039
different weights that sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of and then</font>

856
00:36:02,549 --> 00:36:09,630
when i say weights their weights as it

857
00:36:05,039 --> 00:36:12,930
relates<font color="#CCCCCC"> to change right and so as time</font>

858
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:16,109
evolves these these weights may change

859
00:36:12,930 --> 00:36:17,879
too<font color="#E5E5E5"> because just because you know it is</font>

860
00:36:16,109 --> 00:36:19,259
the way it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is today doesn't mean that in</font>

861
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:23,099
the future something's not going to

862
00:36:19,259 --> 00:36:24,690
change so for example<font color="#CCCCCC"> MAC addresses /</font>

863
00:36:23,099 --> 00:36:26,279
virtualized environments it's my

864
00:36:24,690 --> 00:36:27,900
understanding when machines go up and

865
00:36:26,279 --> 00:36:30,450
down they actually sometimes get

866
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:32,729
allocated different mac addresses so you

867
00:36:30,450 --> 00:36:37,288
can't use<font color="#E5E5E5"> mac address as necessary as a</font>

868
00:36:32,729 --> 00:36:41,910
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> hardcore characteristic for</font>

869
00:36:37,289 --> 00:36:44,069
tracking what can you do well one thing

870
00:36:41,910 --> 00:36:47,759
<font color="#CCCCCC">is be aware of it and hopefully now you</font>

871
00:36:44,069 --> 00:36:50,369
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure if this is new to some</font>

872
00:36:47,759 --> 00:36:52,289
people is it is it something that makes

873
00:36:50,369 --> 00:36:54,119
sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> is it something that you were</font>

874
00:36:52,289 --> 00:36:57,029
aware about but if not hopefully you are

875
00:36:54,119 --> 00:36:59,249
aware about it now and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then secondly</font>

876
00:36:57,029 --> 00:37:01,920
there's a third thing but secondly and

877
00:36:59,249 --> 00:37:03,629
when when you're benchmarking vendors

878
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:05,219
when you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at solutions be</font>

879
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:08,519
aware of this problem and see<font color="#CCCCCC"> will and</font>

880
00:37:05,219 --> 00:37:10,890
ask them how do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> solve this issue if</font>

881
00:37:08,519 --> 00:37:12,328
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> something like oh don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> worry</font>

882
00:37:10,890 --> 00:37:14,339
you'll just use credential based

883
00:37:12,329 --> 00:37:18,450
scanning all over the board well that's

884
00:37:14,339 --> 00:37:19,769
not easy to do all the time right the

885
00:37:18,450 --> 00:37:22,618
other thing you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can do is do your own</font>

886
00:37:19,769 --> 00:37:24,390
correlation it's my understanding that

887
00:37:22,619 --> 00:37:28,490
there's some other security products

888
00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:30,569
that pull in vulnerability scans

889
00:37:28,490 --> 00:37:33,209
from different<font color="#CCCCCC"> vendors and they do</font>

890
00:37:30,570 --> 00:37:35,130
correlation so they somehow solve this

891
00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:36,990
problem in my assumption is that they're

892
00:37:35,130 --> 00:37:40,710
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> it in very similar fashion as to</font>

893
00:37:36,990 --> 00:37:43,620
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> as what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we're doing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right so wrap</font>

894
00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:46,160
up and then we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get the questions his</font>

895
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:48,960
historical security information is key

896
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:52,170
it's not just now as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was mentioning</font>

897
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:54,690
them before when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you look at time when</font>

898
00:37:52,170 --> 00:37:56,370
you look at impermanence impermanence is

899
00:37:54,690 --> 00:37:59,130
something that you know if there's

900
00:37:56,370 --> 00:38:01,259
anything that's absolute change is

901
00:37:59,130 --> 00:38:04,440
absolute and you know with change comes

902
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:07,170
another dimension of complexity<font color="#E5E5E5"> network</font>

903
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:09,420
endpoints / hosts change characteristics

904
00:38:07,170 --> 00:38:11,520
but why did they change we actually

905
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:14,070
interviewed people when we were doing

906
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:15,780
this study some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our clients</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to sort</font>

907
00:38:14,070 --> 00:38:17,160
of validate and make sure hey what's

908
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:18,990
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on here and they would tell us</font>

909
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:20,910
things like well we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing name</font>

910
00:38:18,990 --> 00:38:22,290
changes we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a new naming convention</font>

911
00:38:20,910 --> 00:38:24,930
so we're changing all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of our you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

912
00:38:22,290 --> 00:38:26,520
domain names etc and so so that's one

913
00:38:24,930 --> 00:38:28,109
reason and there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of different</font>

914
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:30,509
<font color="#CCCCCC">reasons</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but the key messages there</font>

915
00:38:28,110 --> 00:38:32,220
they're not doing these things to to

916
00:38:30,510 --> 00:38:35,940
cause problems in fact they are unaware

917
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:37,350
that they're causing problems right most

918
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:39,390
vulnerability management solutions are

919
00:38:37,350 --> 00:38:41,400
good with one point in<font color="#CCCCCC"> time assessments</font>

920
00:38:39,390 --> 00:38:43,799
as I mentioned before I mean you can

921
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:46,140
benchmark them with just<font color="#E5E5E5"> one scan you'll</font>

922
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:48,240
probably see some differences in some

923
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:50,609
strengths etc but by and large<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font>

924
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:53,100
nowadays a saying<font color="#CCCCCC"> there that's a pretty</font>

925
00:38:50,610 --> 00:38:54,750
mature market and then finally<font color="#CCCCCC"> when</font>

926
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:58,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">you're selecting a vendor keep this in</font>

927
00:38:54,750 --> 00:39:03,210
mind ideally move stuff around and see

928
00:38:58,350 --> 00:39:05,580
how how the solution response so I think

929
00:39:03,210 --> 00:39:10,430
we're really good on time a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> dirty</font>

930
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:10,430
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay questions</font>

931
00:39:24,559 --> 00:39:29,839
absolutely so in fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's why I kind</font>

932
00:39:27,499 --> 00:39:31,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">of shared the difference between remote</font>

933
00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:33,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">on authenticated versus the other</font>

934
00:39:31,130 --> 00:39:36,289
technologies as credentialed origin

935
00:39:33,709 --> 00:39:37,910
based you could you can you could do our

936
00:39:36,289 --> 00:39:40,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">techniques where you could actually like</font>

937
00:39:37,910 --> 00:39:41,660
for example agent-based you're on the

938
00:39:40,309 --> 00:39:44,900
computer<font color="#CCCCCC"> so you can give</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it a specific</font>

939
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:46,459
ID that's unique<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so the next and</font>

940
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:48,529
credential<font color="#E5E5E5"> based same thing you could</font>

941
00:39:46,459 --> 00:39:50,448
actually deposit something like an ID

942
00:39:48,529 --> 00:39:51,890
there that's unique and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so the next time</font>

943
00:39:50,449 --> 00:39:54,859
you come<font color="#CCCCCC"> back and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do another credential</font>

944
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:57,140
scan be like well I did I deposit an ID

945
00:39:54,859 --> 00:39:59,689
there before oh I did oh ok so now I can

946
00:39:57,140 --> 00:40:03,920
correlate it so those technologies are

947
00:39:59,689 --> 00:40:06,279
not susceptible to this problem if that

948
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:06,279
makes sense

949
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:19,770
well actually I wonder who you're

950
00:40:16,950 --> 00:40:21,868
working for because there is a vendor

951
00:40:19,770 --> 00:40:25,140
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> does that yeah right and that's</font>

952
00:40:21,869 --> 00:40:27,750
cool but again that's assuming that you

953
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:30,058
know that that that the reason that the

954
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:33,000
IP change was because it just got<font color="#E5E5E5"> a new</font>

955
00:40:30,059 --> 00:40:37,710
IP due to a<font color="#E5E5E5"> dhcp and that works</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> great</font>

956
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:39,299
for that case but for the case<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

957
00:40:37,710 --> 00:40:41,819
servers that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mentioned where you know</font>

958
00:40:39,299 --> 00:40:43,529
the IP<font color="#CCCCCC"> address is changing but it's not</font>

959
00:40:41,819 --> 00:40:46,020
in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> DHCP range you're not going to see</font>

960
00:40:43,529 --> 00:40:48,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">that in your DHCP logs and so if that</font>

961
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:59,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">makes sense you know so very good point</font>

962
00:40:48,029 --> 00:41:03,059
yeah you know it's been<font color="#CCCCCC"> a while its</font>

963
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:05,509
large<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to say it's definitely over</font>

964
00:41:03,059 --> 00:41:08,309
a million endpoints over a million hosts

965
00:41:05,510 --> 00:41:10,589
and we actually sub divided it into

966
00:41:08,309 --> 00:41:12,270
large enterprise medium and small so

967
00:41:10,589 --> 00:41:14,058
this one I'm showing is actually a

968
00:41:12,270 --> 00:41:16,440
medium enterprise what I was showing<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

969
00:41:14,059 --> 00:41:18,900
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of like taking the average of</font>

970
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:20,910
the two because smaller ones don't you

971
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:23,130
know there's the changes are actually

972
00:41:20,910 --> 00:41:29,118
different for the different sizes which

973
00:41:23,130 --> 00:41:33,380
was interesting to us but yeah others

974
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:33,380
thank you so much appreciate it
