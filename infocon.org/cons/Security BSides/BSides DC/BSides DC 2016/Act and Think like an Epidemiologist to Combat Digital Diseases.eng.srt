you have come your company has a lot of

46
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:06,859
smart people researching all this

47
00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:09,290
antivirus stuff so why do i keep getting

48
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:12,650
viruses in my computer right this is

49
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:15,170
like six six years<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago now and it hit me</font>

52
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,350
she asked me this question so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

53
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:23,269
immediately just said dr. you're a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

54
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:25,970
smart doctor and I'm sure there's a lot

55
00:03:23,269 --> 00:03:29,870
of medical practitioners researching you

56
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:31,700
know Ebola and stuff so why do I keep

57
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:34,340
keep getting sick why do I keep getting

58
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:36,619
sick and that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of spawned the</font>

59
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:40,459
an idea that because I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to</font>

60
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:41,900
educate a highly educated person on and

61
00:03:40,459 --> 00:03:44,120
I made a bridge right I connected that

62
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:48,409
bridge from her way of thinking too

63
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:50,810
I'm cyber anybody has a drink drink<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

64
00:03:48,409 --> 00:03:52,280
then she<font color="#CCCCCC"> said</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> oh I get it so I started</font>

65
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:53,510
researching and I had the friends who

66
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:55,819
are nurses and they gave me all these

67
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:57,859
books on epidemiology basically level

68
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:59,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">six viruses and stuff like that this is</font>

69
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:01,549
before the whole thing in Africa

70
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:06,500
happened and one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the books mentioned</font>

71
00:04:01,549 --> 00:04:08,450
the tool called<font color="#E5E5E5"> epi info so i guess none</font>

72
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:09,560
of you know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> epi info is it's a tool</font>

73
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:11,569
developed at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Centers for Disease</font>

74
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:13,129
Control that's provided to

75
00:04:11,569 --> 00:04:15,589
epidemiologist so when they go out in

76
00:04:13,129 --> 00:04:18,139
the field to study malaria or you know

77
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:20,329
smoking Ebola whatever they enter the

78
00:04:18,139 --> 00:04:22,940
data into this tool and then they run

79
00:04:20,329 --> 00:04:25,190
statistically statistical wits that

80
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:26,780
would either predict where people are

81
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:30,350
getting sick why they're getting sick

82
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:31,820
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so on so I started playing with the</font>

83
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:34,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">tool</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just because I'm curious that way</font>

84
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:38,090
and I I ran some old data this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is from</font>

85
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:40,430
1854 it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very famous epidemic in</font>

86
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:42,770
London and this is called an aberration

87
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:44,389
detection chart this is a you can see

88
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:47,389
the little reference in the bottom it's

89
00:04:44,389 --> 00:04:50,300
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> epi info software and I'm like oh</font>

90
00:04:47,389 --> 00:04:51,860
that's cool what other stuff is in there

91
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:54,979
all they have these two by two widgets

92
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:57,200
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> little things you can run that you</font>

93
00:04:54,979 --> 00:04:58,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">ask it oh no why did somebody get sick</font>

94
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:00,950
well we don't know so let's just find

95
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:02,960
out you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what what did they eat at</font>

96
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:04,760
the picnic where somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> people got</font>

97
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,979
infected so some people a bacon some

98
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:08,659
people a butter some people ate turkey

99
00:05:06,979 --> 00:05:11,960
and so on and they did these<font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font>

100
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:14,000
called two by two tables the laser is

101
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:16,190
not as good these two by two tables so

102
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,039
out of the three hundred and<font color="#E5E5E5"> fifty nine</font>

103
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:20,990
people that<font color="#CCCCCC"> were at this massive picnic</font>

104
00:05:18,039 --> 00:05:23,449
118 of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them had eat that were exposed to</font>

105
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:26,150
the cook bacon and got sick 34 did not

106
00:05:23,449 --> 00:05:31,160
get sick all<font color="#CCCCCC"> right bear with me this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

107
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:32,599
going somewhere<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok Bacon's good so it</font>

108
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:35,120
wasn't the bacon it was the butter that

109
00:05:32,599 --> 00:05:36,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">got everybody sick so um so they found</font>

110
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there was a</font>

111
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:41,180
larger proportion eighty-two percent

112
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:44,330
almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> 83 that if you had had the butter</font>

113
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:46,729
you would have become sick<font color="#E5E5E5"> alright so</font>

114
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:49,969
that's that's one tool um that's just

115
00:05:46,729 --> 00:05:52,190
the numbers<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then like I had one</font>

116
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:53,659
<font color="#CCCCCC">of those midnight explosions in my mind</font>

117
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:55,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">like oh my god</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this tool has a sequel</font>

118
00:05:53,659 --> 00:05:56,460
connector I wonder<font color="#E5E5E5"> what happens if i</font>

119
00:05:55,340 --> 00:06:01,409
plug it into the cement

120
00:05:56,460 --> 00:06:03,180
database its sequel and I would I just

121
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:05,880
click on the widgets give me a frequency

122
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:09,780
analysis for the alerts that are coming

123
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:12,810
in and which machines are getting

124
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:15,119
infected and why and then I<font color="#E5E5E5"> saw this mic</font>

125
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:16,889
on most of the detections are not being

126
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,410
detected with the antivirus is being

127
00:06:16,889 --> 00:06:21,660
detected with this practice stuff that's

128
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:23,780
interesting again remember this is a CDC

129
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:27,509
epi info a tool for researching

130
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:29,219
biological viruses right and then I did

131
00:06:27,509 --> 00:06:31,289
it had a paretto button and I'm not a

132
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:33,660
statistician I just hit the little

133
00:06:31,289 --> 00:06:37,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">peretta button and most of the events</font>

134
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:41,400
were left alone like oh wow that's a lot

135
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:42,810
of left the loans<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and then they</font>

136
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,609
have something called an epi curve which

137
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:46,680
is cakes a count of the number of

138
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:48,930
infections that have occurred over time

139
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:51,720
and then and this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is something that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

140
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:55,020
used has been used for decades<font color="#CCCCCC"> to look</font>

141
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:57,419
for a burst of infections okay and so

142
00:06:55,020 --> 00:07:00,479
what happened<font color="#E5E5E5"> that day so that's a</font>

143
00:06:57,419 --> 00:07:02,789
question so I've tried this tool with

144
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:06,719
many other products not just semantics

145
00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:08,880
and it raises a lot of questions doesn't

146
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:11,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">really answer many questions but it</font>

147
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:14,849
makes you ask what happened that<font color="#E5E5E5"> day to</font>

148
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:17,880
cause that right okay then had other

149
00:07:14,849 --> 00:07:20,729
stuff that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I could run so frequency on</font>

150
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:22,820
the what policies reflect the most which

151
00:07:20,729 --> 00:07:25,320
viruses the word of the most prevalent

152
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:29,070
you get the idea so those on the bottom

153
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:31,199
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are behavioral policies they're</font>

154
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:34,380
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> no people plug-in and USB sticks</font>

155
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:36,330
and and the like and then I asked for

156
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:40,020
frequency analysis on what was detected

157
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:41,698
I found that like ninety percent of the

158
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:44,400
infections in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the environment we're</font>

159
00:07:41,699 --> 00:07:45,389
basically attributed to salary so what

160
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,880
so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is now this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is the</font>

161
00:07:45,389 --> 00:07:50,759
epidemiologist thinking what about<font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font>

162
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:53,669
environment makes me exposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's dis</font>

163
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:55,949
ality<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> instead of trying to</font>

164
00:07:53,669 --> 00:07:58,680
write a virus definition or write

165
00:07:55,949 --> 00:08:01,169
another<font color="#E5E5E5"> IPS signature what is it about</font>

166
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:03,719
my environment that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> could change to</font>

167
00:08:01,169 --> 00:08:05,039
make it less susceptible to that<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

168
00:08:03,719 --> 00:08:07,199
<font color="#CCCCCC">right so I started I kept reading</font>

169
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:09,330
reading and reading about a PD me ology

170
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:10,740
and I found<font color="#E5E5E5"> these other things yeah you</font>

171
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:12,780
know cross regulations case

172
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:13,919
control studies cohort studies and

173
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:16,619
clinical trials<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to talk</font>

174
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:19,049
about those some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of those later but I</font>

175
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:20,430
showed you the EPI curves that's an epic

176
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:22,800
curve on the top so on that<font color="#CCCCCC"> day</font>

177
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:24,660
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> happen so maybe I should look</font>

178
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know narrow if you're using</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> splunk</font>

179
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:29,120
narrow your search to those two to those

180
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:32,819
days a<font color="#CCCCCC"> few days before few days after</font>

181
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:36,839
you whatever sin you're using<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right</font>

182
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:39,870
so then I looked at the history of

183
00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:42,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">Epidemiology and how the United States</font>

184
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:48,300
invests its money in<font color="#E5E5E5"> health care in a</font>

185
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:51,390
public health and I saw a link with the

186
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:53,520
digital so<font color="#E5E5E5"> before 1979 there was</font>

187
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:55,319
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> called sickness management all</font>

188
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:57,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">right so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go compare it to</font>

189
00:08:55,320 --> 00:09:00,630
our digital world today so sickness

190
00:08:57,959 --> 00:09:02,339
management is basically dealing with the

191
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:04,800
effects of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the disease after the fact so</font>

192
00:09:02,339 --> 00:09:06,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">let's take</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a look at it in a digital in</font>

193
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,689
the digital world so we install some

194
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,800
technology because we love to buy

195
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:12,779
technology we install it on our end

196
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,430
points or gateways whatever and then we

197
00:09:12,779 --> 00:09:17,910
wait for the security<font color="#E5E5E5"> vendor to provide</font>

198
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:19,410
us or vaccines and so on and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

199
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:21,750
don't know you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know not you guys of</font>

200
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:24,449
course but most security guys just sit

201
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:25,589
back<font color="#CCCCCC"> and wait for the alerts right you</font>

202
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:27,870
wait for the alert and when the alert

203
00:09:25,589 --> 00:09:29,070
pops up you do your<font color="#CCCCCC"> job</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you check your</font>

204
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:30,600
console on Monday Tuesday Wednesday

205
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:32,850
Thursday Friday everything's cool

206
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:35,370
because it says I detected a virus and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

207
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:37,170
removed it I detected a you know a call

208
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:39,510
to a command and control and I stopped

209
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:41,670
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then one day something happens</font>

210
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:43,770
and all you know you call your favorite

211
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:45,689
I our team to come in and do their job

212
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:48,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">and then you do the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> investigation and</font>

213
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:50,880
remediation and then it's done<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then</font>

214
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:52,680
you go back to waiting for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the alert and</font>

215
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,810
then it happens again and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it happens</font>

216
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:56,579
again so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a i call</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it the</font>

217
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:59,510
hamster wheel of death you just<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

218
00:09:56,579 --> 00:10:01,349
do it over and over so in

219
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:03,569
epidemiological circles there's three

220
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:06,029
types of prevention this would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be called</font>

221
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:08,220
secondary prevention where you wait for

222
00:10:06,029 --> 00:10:09,540
the thing to have to get diseased and

223
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:17,880
then you try to alleviate the symptoms

224
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:20,420
right this is crazy then after 1979 the

225
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:22,589
NIH published this this huge document

226
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:23,740
that changed everything into like

227
00:10:22,589 --> 00:10:25,660
wellness management

228
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:27,760
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll go into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more detail on that but</font>

229
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:29,140
let me just illustrate it here for for

230
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:31,600
you guys on the Digital side and then

231
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:33,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'll go back so wellness if you if we</font>

232
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:37,090
were to apply wellness management to our

233
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:39,280
same routine that big line on the bottom

234
00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:42,130
is the new thing right so you actively

235
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:46,630
study your environment so<font color="#E5E5E5"> our people you</font>

236
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:49,689
know what are the logs telling me not

237
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:52,360
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> the I detected something definitely</font>

238
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:55,570
bad but what's probably bad possibly bad

239
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:57,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is a preventive security</font>

240
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:59,950
thinking okay so you study who's getting

241
00:10:57,730 --> 00:11:02,170
infected or who's running a certain

242
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:03,940
application that's not signed what are

243
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:07,089
they doing when<font color="#CCCCCC"> are they doing it where</font>

244
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:08,590
are they doing it I have to be very

245
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:12,190
careful my kids are in the audience oh<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

246
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:14,140
can't use certain words though there was

247
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:16,470
a joke right there clinical on case

248
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:18,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">control studies you got you guys got it</font>

249
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:21,250
so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> studied you know did</font>

250
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:23,410
epidemiologist study like where did

251
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:25,660
people drink water from where<font color="#E5E5E5"> did they</font>

252
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:27,939
eat what<font color="#CCCCCC"> did they eat who were they with</font>

253
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:30,400
right and then you<font color="#E5E5E5"> you run some</font>

254
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:34,180
statistical analysis on it and you get

255
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:36,189
possibly<font color="#E5E5E5"> infected probably infected or</font>

256
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:37,839
confirmed those are<font color="#E5E5E5"> the three things</font>

257
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:39,520
that they look for whereas management

258
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:42,250
wants to know you know there definitely

259
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:44,790
is a breach or we're definitely clean

260
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:46,330
it's like a zero or one hundred percent

261
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:48,849
epidemiologist take a different approach

262
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:52,000
you know you're you could be sort of

263
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:53,320
sick right you got Ebola on Monday<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

264
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're not going to show symptoms for</font>

265
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:57,550
like seven days but if you're exhibiting

266
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:59,140
the symptoms initial symptoms then if

267
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:01,030
you start reacting towards the beginning

268
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:05,230
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a better chance of containing</font>

269
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:06,699
that thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> right alright so walnuts</font>

270
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:09,070
management requires that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> Institute</font>

271
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:10,960
controls and I think everybody in here

272
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:12,220
has instituted controls but an

273
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:13,960
epidemiology do it a little bit

274
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:15,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">differently I think then most people I</font>

275
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:18,820
see where instead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> just deploying that</font>

276
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:21,250
IPS policy or that firewall policy or AV

277
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:24,610
or whatever DLP policy they would deploy

278
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:28,270
their wish policy like what policy but

279
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:30,420
you love<font color="#CCCCCC"> to deploy in log mode right so</font>

280
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:33,520
management won't allow you to<font color="#CCCCCC"> install</font>

281
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:35,560
you know to block USB they want to allow

282
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:38,140
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to block certain applications for</font>

283
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:40,779
ever being blocked so why don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> you turn</font>

284
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:42,699
on your wish list then after a few weeks

285
00:12:40,779 --> 00:12:45,640
or months whatever you decide how long

286
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:48,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">your study your clinical study should be</font>

287
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:51,760
then you have evidence<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay this is what</font>

288
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:54,339
the very famous epidemiologist did where

289
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:57,100
he he tried to convince management to

290
00:12:54,339 --> 00:12:58,870
institute a control and they said no you

291
00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:00,520
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have enough evidence he collected</font>

292
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:02,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">the evidence and when he presented it</font>

293
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:06,040
they had no choice because now they're

294
00:13:02,589 --> 00:13:08,710
liable<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so we need to do the similar</font>

295
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:13,449
thing okay but<font color="#E5E5E5"> we need to create those</font>

296
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:17,740
those are wish policies so what ends up

297
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:19,720
happening<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think is that you your your</font>

298
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:22,029
number of incidents should go down right

299
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:25,720
and I'll go<font color="#E5E5E5"> into some studies that we've</font>

300
00:13:22,029 --> 00:13:28,089
done later but um but instead of just

301
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:29,890
chillin back<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay now I've done such a</font>

302
00:13:28,089 --> 00:13:32,950
great job now<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can watch netflix at</font>

303
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:35,199
work how about go do more not that

304
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:38,440
anybody does that but do more studies

305
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:39,910
okay just do study<font color="#CCCCCC"> your environment more</font>

306
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:42,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">view if you're sick of endpoint security</font>

307
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:45,430
go to the LP or or your network ideas

308
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:47,500
whatever study them over a long period

309
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:50,290
of time and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to say that this is</font>

310
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:53,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">very different than your IR guy or</font>

311
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:56,319
forensics guy<font color="#E5E5E5"> your reimaging guy because</font>

312
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:58,660
we still need those people this is the

313
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:00,850
kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> I tend to say it's boring but</font>

314
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:02,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's exciting because you're going to</font>

315
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:04,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">look at the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> long-term</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're not going</font>

316
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:06,520
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> discover the apt you're going to</font>

317
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:10,089
discover<font color="#E5E5E5"> the behavior people do that</font>

318
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:13,300
exposes them to vote up to infection so

319
00:14:10,089 --> 00:14:16,360
like I said if it's USB prison as if

320
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:18,130
it's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> browser's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not getting patched</font>

321
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:20,290
fast enough<font color="#E5E5E5"> if the plugins are in game</font>

322
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:23,260
patch enough now you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> evidence that</font>

323
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:25,719
you can send up to suggest our patching

324
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:28,630
of operating system is not enough maybe

325
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:30,190
patching Adobe Acrobat is more important

326
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:31,959
than patching the OS based on the

327
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:33,790
statistics you've collected I don't know

328
00:14:31,959 --> 00:14:37,119
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know your neighborhood better than</font>

329
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:39,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">me right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so this is the</font>

330
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:42,670
healthy people document that i copied

331
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:44,650
quite a bit from so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the 1979</font>

332
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:49,270
paper by<font color="#CCCCCC"> nih you can download it</font>

333
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:49,900
enormous but here's a kind of what it

334
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:52,810
was basic

335
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:55,060
saying before 1979 the United States

336
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:58,810
invested most of its budget for health

337
00:14:55,060 --> 00:15:00,699
on fighting the pathogen<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so that's</font>

338
00:14:58,810 --> 00:15:04,479
<font color="#CCCCCC">the cholera malaria you can see them</font>

339
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:08,850
there so that's antivirus<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright</font>

340
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:11,830
fighting the pathogens okay after 1979

341
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:13,630
after the CDC and NIH studied all this

342
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:16,330
stuff they realized wait a minute we

343
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:18,820
could save more people's lives and have

344
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:20,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">people live longer not by focusing on</font>

345
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:23,170
preventing malaria cholera<font color="#E5E5E5"> the flu and</font>

346
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:26,260
e.coli and so on but just have them stop

347
00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:28,240
eating so many burgers<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right have</font>

348
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:32,020
them stop you know we're driving without

349
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:35,770
a seat belt you know stop smoking<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

350
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:37,090
they found<font color="#E5E5E5"> that these behaviors that in</font>

351
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:41,890
the document they're called lifestyle

352
00:15:37,090 --> 00:15:45,250
choices made them die sooner so how do

353
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:47,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">we apply that to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the digital well first</font>

354
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:50,020
let's look at the controls that they put

355
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:52,480
in place for the past and and 44 post

356
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:54,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">past and post 1979 so before they no</font>

357
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:56,470
vaccines you had sewage treatment<font color="#CCCCCC"> plans</font>

358
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:58,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">you had you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the little signs that</font>

359
00:15:56,470 --> 00:16:00,430
say wash your hands and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then the you</font>

360
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:02,319
know all these controls to prevent<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

361
00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:06,219
like spanish flu from spreading you know

362
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:08,560
put the the face masks on and after 1979

363
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:11,290
eat well right this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is these are</font>

364
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:12,640
preventive controls you know exercise

365
00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:15,280
don't sit on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the sofa that's what the</font>

366
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:17,830
sofa meant by the way<font color="#CCCCCC"> seatbelts were</font>

367
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:20,500
mandated and thousands<font color="#E5E5E5"> of people were</font>

368
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:23,140
saved the very next year<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay little</font>

369
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:26,140
tiny controls and no smoking<font color="#E5E5E5"> so instead</font>

370
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:28,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">of focusing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on oh I found</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the apt or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

371
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:30,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">found this let me write this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> IOC this is</font>

372
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:32,260
awesome it is excited it's exciting

373
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:34,270
right this is not<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of work</font>

374
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:35,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's court that's great that this kind</font>

375
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:38,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">of work is kind of the look boring</font>

376
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:41,680
drawn-out work that could have a huge

377
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:43,660
impact because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're having people put</font>

378
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:46,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">on your seatbelt all right stop</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> smoking</font>

379
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:49,030
so let's compare it in the digital so

380
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:51,580
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is before viruses worms Trojans</font>

381
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:54,550
apts<font color="#E5E5E5"> backdoors all the cool stuff that</font>

382
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:57,880
we like to hunt so how about if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

383
00:16:54,550 --> 00:17:00,490
educate our users observe our users what

384
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:03,850
are they doing are they bit touring

385
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:07,660
that a real word bit turning at work are

386
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:09,429
they touring are they running like a

387
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:13,179
gazillion browsers that the corporation

388
00:17:09,429 --> 00:17:15,339
is not patching you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know and are they</font>

389
00:17:13,179 --> 00:17:16,900
click addicts I don't know if that's a

390
00:17:15,339 --> 00:17:19,688
thing but I know<font color="#CCCCCC"> like if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a word</font>

391
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:21,400
but I you know who I'm talking about if

392
00:17:19,689 --> 00:17:24,939
it if it has a hyperlink I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to click</font>

393
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:26,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">it right people is there something we</font>

394
00:17:24,939 --> 00:17:29,500
can do to kind of alter that behavior or

395
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:31,150
if we can't convince them to do it put a

396
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:34,480
control in place and if you can't

397
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:35,980
prevent it monitor it so you can

398
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:38,530
convince upper management to allow you

399
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:40,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">to control it because if you disable</font>

400
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:42,100
certain features<font color="#CCCCCC"> if the masses are going</font>

401
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:43,540
to write it<font color="#E5E5E5"> right so you're going to</font>

402
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:44,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">have to give management buy-in and the</font>

403
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:46,360
only way you're going to get is with

404
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:49,809
evidence you need evidence driven

405
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:51,580
security so what kind of controls<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

406
00:17:49,809 --> 00:17:53,559
put in place for all that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

407
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:56,649
viruses map the Trojans the pts and

408
00:17:53,559 --> 00:18:00,910
stuff oh we anti-malware network ID s is

409
00:17:56,650 --> 00:18:04,450
endpoint IPS is firewalls we bought all

410
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:06,340
this stuff and then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just we try I</font>

411
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:08,380
don't know exactly when it started but

412
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:12,220
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> we started using certificates and</font>

413
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:15,220
you know containerization and we stopped

414
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:17,980
focusing so much on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the antivirus and</font>

415
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:21,100
studies shifting over to policies

416
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:23,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">checklists patching security awareness</font>

417
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:26,050
programs and so on but I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

418
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:29,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're not we're not doing that enough we</font>

419
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:31,510
need to focus a lot on<font color="#E5E5E5"> this side because</font>

420
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:33,730
buying five extra network IDs isn't

421
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:35,830
isn't going to do it all right we have

422
00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:37,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">to get the users to learn to cover their</font>

423
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:40,270
mouths when they cough if you will and

424
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:42,250
and don't eat that sandwich off the

425
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:43,780
floor just you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know you wouldn't pick up</font>

426
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:45,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">a sandwich and eat it off the floor so</font>

427
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:47,950
why would<font color="#CCCCCC"> you do it to a USB stick on</font>

428
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:49,570
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> computer all right all right and</font>

429
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:50,590
another thing I usually<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is the</font>

430
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:52,570
first time when I say this stuff in

431
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:55,510
front of my kids but I've been teaching

432
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:59,290
our kids to do this<font color="#E5E5E5"> know when you cough</font>

433
00:18:55,510 --> 00:19:02,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay we didn't teach them that in our</font>

434
00:18:59,290 --> 00:19:04,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">one our yearly security compliance or</font>

435
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:07,419
health compliance training we had to do

436
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:09,280
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> repeatedly over and over and too</font>

437
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:12,700
often companies<font color="#E5E5E5"> just do it once a year</font>

438
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:13,850
or worse at the employee boot camp when

439
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:15,679
they first get hired

440
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:17,030
and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and then every year they</font>

441
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:18,919
just have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to sign a piece of paper says</font>

442
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:21,710
they're aware of the security policies

443
00:19:18,919 --> 00:19:25,179
now we have to kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of repeat it over</font>

444
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:27,230
and over and they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> pretty good now the</font>

445
00:19:25,179 --> 00:19:28,970
irony somebody pointed this out to me

446
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:30,410
there any<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the coughing into your</font>

447
00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:32,690
arm is that it will not make<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

448
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:35,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">healthier it makes the other person</font>

449
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:37,610
healthier it's a weird<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing is one of</font>

450
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:39,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">those altruistic things that we do as</font>

451
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:41,389
humans we teach our kids to take care of

452
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:42,980
others only ask them to cover their

453
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:44,330
mouths<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we hope that everybody else</font>

454
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:46,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">does it we need that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of mentality</font>

455
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:48,620
that kind of reinforcement at work don't

456
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:51,559
click on<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you know document from</font>

457
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:53,330
from a random person not as much to

458
00:19:51,559 --> 00:19:55,428
<font color="#CCCCCC">protect you but to protect the entire</font>

459
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:58,070
corporation right otherwise<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

460
00:19:55,429 --> 00:20:01,789
sneezing over the entire company or

461
00:19:58,070 --> 00:20:04,399
coughing all right I made this slide to

462
00:20:01,789 --> 00:20:05,900
kind of show<font color="#CCCCCC"> that more parallels then</font>

463
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,460
I'm telling<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of stories so you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

464
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:10,429
take some of these nuggets and share

465
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:12,380
them when you're out there so in both

466
00:20:10,429 --> 00:20:16,909
biological and digital space you have

467
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:20,799
simple threats the common cold or adware

468
00:20:16,909 --> 00:20:24,440
you have complex threats Ebola Stuxnet

469
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:26,360
you have the sharing of stuff so when we

470
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:28,640
share water we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the possibility of</font>

471
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:30,770
getting an illness from it when we<font color="#E5E5E5"> share</font>

472
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:33,289
<font color="#CCCCCC">nazareth's we have a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> possibility</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

473
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:37,070
getting an illness when we share<font color="#E5E5E5"> needles</font>

474
00:20:33,289 --> 00:20:38,419
which you try and do I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> care</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font>

475
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:41,299
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do on the weekends just don't share</font>

476
00:20:38,419 --> 00:20:43,220
the needles and then the USBs when you

477
00:20:41,299 --> 00:20:45,879
share USB so a similar type<font color="#CCCCCC"> of thing as</font>

478
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:50,150
part of the human condition and socially

479
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:52,070
and in the social digital space we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

480
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:55,250
to share but you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have to be</font>

481
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:58,580
reckless and then both in biology and

482
00:20:55,250 --> 00:21:00,559
digital<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the bad stuff seems to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> find</font>

483
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:01,939
a way<font color="#E5E5E5"> around whatever we implement so no</font>

484
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:04,610
matter what technology you put in place

485
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:07,039
<font color="#CCCCCC">the bad stuff still going to get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in all</font>

486
00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:08,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">right so let's stop assuming that we can</font>

487
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:10,879
buy the golden pill you know that's

488
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:13,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to solve everything and then I</font>

489
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:15,049
kind of like this one too it's a since

490
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:16,760
the dawn of life there's been diseases

491
00:21:15,049 --> 00:21:19,940
since the dawn of the digital age has

492
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:21,350
been digital diseases right so I'm

493
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:23,179
telling<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of these stories this way</font>

494
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:25,219
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of these on little snippets so</font>

495
00:21:23,179 --> 00:21:26,870
that you can share those with people so

496
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:29,510
that they can click you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

497
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:31,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">aha so now let's get them into more</font>

498
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:33,740
thinking like an epidemiologist when an

499
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:35,510
epidemiologist goes out to another

500
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:37,280
usually another country but we have a

501
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:39,860
number of epidemics here to still today

502
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:44,240
like the ice cream one we just had<font color="#CCCCCC"> a few</font>

503
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:47,209
weather last year they do not they

504
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:49,190
cannot<font color="#E5E5E5"> afford to cure everything or to</font>

505
00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:51,110
put a control everywhere so what they go

506
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:52,940
in with these these three little circles

507
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:54,340
in mind where can<font color="#E5E5E5"> I take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my little</font>

508
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:58,550
resources they only have so much money

509
00:21:54,340 --> 00:22:01,580
where can I apply my budget to stop the

510
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:04,399
disease and what that triad illustrates

511
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:06,710
is that the disease can only occur in

512
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:08,780
this case an infectious disease if you

513
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:10,520
have all three so if you can invest a

514
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:11,870
little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> money here this is antique</font>

515
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:14,059
Lee this is the pathogen that's the

516
00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:15,830
thing that's actually getting people to

517
00:22:14,059 --> 00:22:17,470
get sick if you can do something<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

518
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:19,939
prevent that great like like a vaccine

519
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:22,130
if you can't<font color="#CCCCCC"> afford a vaccine or you</font>

520
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:25,429
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have one is there something you</font>

521
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:26,809
can do to the host to protect it if you

522
00:22:25,429 --> 00:22:28,370
can't do that is there something you can

523
00:22:26,809 --> 00:22:29,899
do to the environment so in the

524
00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:31,879
biological space that would be

525
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:34,460
environmental controls might be like the

526
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:37,160
netting over the bed for malaria okay in

527
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:39,620
the digital space you have websites you

528
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:41,840
have you know blue coats and all this

529
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:44,209
stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> to control the environment coming</font>

530
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:45,980
to the host and on the host we do all

531
00:22:44,210 --> 00:22:48,140
kinds of crazy stuff signing of

532
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:50,150
applications we<font color="#E5E5E5"> containerized</font>

533
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:52,220
applications we're going really crazy

534
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:53,480
with all this stuff trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to isolate</font>

535
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:56,080
everything we're trying to put

536
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:58,580
everything in its own little like

537
00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:02,210
biohazard containment unit that you know

538
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:04,280
if you can think of it that way so how

539
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:06,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">how can you convince management to give</font>

540
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:08,809
you everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want you can so pick</font>

541
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:10,520
pick where<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're going to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> focus your</font>

542
00:23:08,809 --> 00:23:13,460
energies for the particular types of

543
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:16,550
problems you're having<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so don't try</font>

544
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:20,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">to get everything focus unfortunately</font>

545
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:22,899
that requires studies so oh it's a

546
00:23:20,570 --> 00:23:22,899
question

547
00:23:27,730 --> 00:23:33,720
so thank you so<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the host of people or</font>

548
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:33,720
the computer

549
00:23:50,169 --> 00:24:05,919
ok can you come up<font color="#CCCCCC"> cuz you got</font>

550
00:23:53,619 --> 00:24:09,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">competition pruning the people ah yeah I</font>

551
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:12,730
wish we could do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> no um so I've been</font>

552
00:24:09,519 --> 00:24:15,549
in many dinners where people say exactly

553
00:24:12,730 --> 00:24:17,590
that and I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we can go that</font>

554
00:24:15,549 --> 00:24:19,658
far just<font color="#E5E5E5"> yet maybe in the military they</font>

555
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:21,488
can do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> or something but what I've</font>

556
00:24:19,659 --> 00:24:24,570
seen done like what happens in my

557
00:24:21,489 --> 00:24:27,309
company we get fished on internally and

558
00:24:24,570 --> 00:24:29,710
if you ax if you're dumb enough to click

559
00:24:27,309 --> 00:24:31,119
on it we get the<font color="#E5E5E5"> little rat that says</font>

560
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:33,159
guess what you're going to security

561
00:24:31,119 --> 00:24:35,529
training so it's kind of a punishment

562
00:24:33,159 --> 00:24:37,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">right you're not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> getting fired but if</font>

563
00:24:35,529 --> 00:24:40,169
you click the link you're going to have

564
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:43,359
to go to security awareness training so

565
00:24:40,169 --> 00:24:48,700
firing people will<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be great maybe on</font>

566
00:24:43,359 --> 00:24:52,480
the third<font color="#E5E5E5"> strike but yeah how many</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of us</font>

567
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:55,419
would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of a job right now yeah</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

568
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:56,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">right so this is another i mean i'm</font>

569
00:24:55,419 --> 00:24:58,330
shamelessly stealing from the Centers

570
00:24:56,950 --> 00:24:59,799
for Disease Control this is something

571
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:01,330
called it SI our graph it's a

572
00:24:59,799 --> 00:25:03,999
susceptibility and flexibility and

573
00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:05,289
recoverability say that five times so it

574
00:25:03,999 --> 00:25:09,009
shows you that if you can see it<font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font>

575
00:25:05,289 --> 00:25:11,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">back there the red marks are when you</font>

576
00:25:09,009 --> 00:25:14,830
were susceptible or exposed to something

577
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:16,960
the longevity of the line is how long

578
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:19,480
you were exposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to that thing and then</font>

579
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:22,299
if you have a black anchor you're dead

580
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:23,679
so you basically died<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so that's</font>

581
00:25:22,299 --> 00:25:25,389
that's one of the ways they plot out

582
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:27,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay when somebody was exposed this is</font>

583
00:25:25,389 --> 00:25:30,639
how they determine things like the

584
00:25:27,519 --> 00:25:32,619
incubation period and if if you go more

585
00:25:30,639 --> 00:25:34,928
than 21 days without symptoms and you're

586
00:25:32,619 --> 00:25:36,399
not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> get Ebola right because</font>

587
00:25:34,929 --> 00:25:39,580
they did they saw<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the longest time</font>

588
00:25:36,399 --> 00:25:41,258
was 21 days so what you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at</font>

589
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:44,739
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> is my first prototype about two</font>

590
00:25:41,259 --> 00:25:46,960
years ago and on the y-axis our user

591
00:25:44,739 --> 00:25:52,059
names for computers instead of people's

592
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:54,279
names and on the x-axis is time and then

593
00:25:52,059 --> 00:25:55,840
the background colors pretty bad account

594
00:25:54,279 --> 00:25:58,480
you can see the colors but is the

595
00:25:55,840 --> 00:26:01,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">group's so the logical groupings in the</font>

596
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:03,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">corporation so this is this is this was</font>

597
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:04,000
the crew for concept and then a buddy of

598
00:26:03,669 --> 00:26:06,010
mine

599
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,080
his websites right<font color="#E5E5E5"> that his github is</font>

600
00:26:06,010 --> 00:26:10,660
right there we got together and built

601
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:16,419
this tool I'm totally ripping off the

602
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:18,550
CDC so we have again x axis is time y

603
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:20,470
axes are the<font color="#E5E5E5"> host we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> change</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the host</font>

604
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:23,560
names to numbers so we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually so I</font>

605
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:25,210
can show<font color="#E5E5E5"> you this but all we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> did this</font>

606
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:26,679
isn't this is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> two-year-old slide and</font>

607
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:29,770
we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> work up to the more recent stuff</font>

608
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:31,900
but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> gray dots are updates content</font>

609
00:26:29,770 --> 00:26:34,510
updates the blue dots are check-in times

610
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:36,220
and the red dots are infections and

611
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:37,720
again since i since most of these

612
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:39,310
presentations people can see them<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'll</font>

613
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:42,790
highlight them for you those are the

614
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:45,700
infections so what we decided to do is

615
00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:48,060
use that<font color="#CCCCCC"> s</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ir idea to kind of just show</font>

616
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:50,140
the data visually and let the human

617
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:51,879
correlation kick in so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's one of the</font>

618
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:55,030
one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the proof of concepts we</font>

619
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:57,070
developed so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just we spotted patterns</font>

620
00:26:55,030 --> 00:27:00,490
so that's the same computer getting

621
00:26:57,070 --> 00:27:02,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">infected almost every</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> other day ok but</font>

622
00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:04,900
here's here's the crazy part if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you log</font>

623
00:27:02,530 --> 00:27:07,720
into the console it said<font color="#CCCCCC"> i detected</font>

624
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:10,210
something and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i cleaned it the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> next day</font>

625
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:11,440
i detected something and i cleaned it so

626
00:27:10,210 --> 00:27:14,110
when you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at it's like going to the</font>

627
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:16,900
doctor and they go oh oh yeah you were

628
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:18,459
sick but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you're fixed now and then</font>

629
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:19,780
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> go to a different doctor and</font>

630
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:21,450
another one<font color="#E5E5E5"> and another one and another</font>

631
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:24,040
one but they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> see the big picture</font>

632
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:26,050
that they've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been getting infected / and</font>

633
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:28,690
/ or bo they're getting ill for some

634
00:27:26,050 --> 00:27:29,950
reason over and over and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I forget</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> which</font>

635
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:31,150
one of these it was because there were

636
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:33,130
different reasons<font color="#CCCCCC"> for this happening but</font>

637
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:35,620
one of them is a downloader so the

638
00:27:33,130 --> 00:27:37,540
downloader was did we did not<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

639
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:39,760
signature for it but when it downloaded

640
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:42,610
components the AV detector didn't

641
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:45,480
cleaned it<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay but when you look at a</font>

642
00:27:42,610 --> 00:27:47,469
console know regardless of what it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

643
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:50,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> seeing that point in time</font>

644
00:27:47,470 --> 00:27:52,780
versus time lining it this way<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right</font>

645
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:55,209
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then you know oh by the way the word</font>

646
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:57,460
disease I<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought it meant something you</font>

647
00:27:55,210 --> 00:27:59,350
caught it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not it doesn't mean that it</font>

648
00:27:57,460 --> 00:28:02,410
means the abnormal function of an

649
00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:05,590
organism<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so and that's impolite now</font>

650
00:28:02,410 --> 00:28:08,230
because we spotted other diseases that

651
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:10,899
were non-pathogenic right so like we saw

652
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:12,700
these white lines<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know if you</font>

653
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:15,040
can look like<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can't see them</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font>

654
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:16,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">there but basically we saw a pattern of</font>

655
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:17,480
when people are turning off their

656
00:28:16,150 --> 00:28:19,580
computers

657
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:20,929
right we didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> expect to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see that on a</font>

658
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:23,570
visualization we didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> program it to do</font>

659
00:28:20,929 --> 00:28:26,840
that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> visualize</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> times</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> two events</font>

660
00:28:23,570 --> 00:28:28,159
over time of color like<font color="#E5E5E5"> huh some people</font>

661
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:29,870
are not turning off their computers and

662
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:31,610
they have little red dots in the middle

663
00:28:29,870 --> 00:28:33,049
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the night who's sitting on that</font>

664
00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:35,540
computer at two o'clock in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the morning</font>

665
00:28:33,049 --> 00:28:38,179
then we spotted other things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like this</font>

666
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:41,149
one here where my<font color="#E5E5E5"> laser</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> eiga this is</font>

667
00:28:38,179 --> 00:28:43,910
getting more updates by a lot compared

668
00:28:41,150 --> 00:28:45,770
to the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> ones why we had a group of</font>

669
00:28:43,910 --> 00:28:48,590
machines that were checking into their

670
00:28:45,770 --> 00:28:51,320
manager like almost non-stop saturating

671
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:53,480
the LAN links<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so I forgive it's</font>

672
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:55,939
this one or the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next slide but they</font>

673
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:57,500
tended<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be the drives are full so</font>

674
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:59,150
that's when a hard drive is full and it

675
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:02,299
tries to download content when it tries

676
00:28:59,150 --> 00:29:03,410
to decompress it it can't so I fails and

677
00:29:02,299 --> 00:29:05,210
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> it waits for the nest chat next</font>

678
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:07,940
check-in time and it downloads it again

679
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:09,740
and it can't install it shuts it you

680
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:12,320
know turns the dog<font color="#CCCCCC"> turn it off next 15</font>

681
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:14,600
minutes check in does it again so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

682
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:16,909
was a abnormal<font color="#CCCCCC"> function of an organism</font>

683
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:19,040
and after check after seeing it this way

684
00:29:16,910 --> 00:29:21,110
just go check check the policy and

685
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:22,850
change it oh look at that the hard

686
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:25,729
drives fall let's let's pick this

687
00:29:22,850 --> 00:29:28,549
remediated at but those machines were

688
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:31,850
now susceptible because they weren't

689
00:29:28,549 --> 00:29:33,470
getting their updates you know and then

690
00:29:31,850 --> 00:29:35,629
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is another</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one where you had an</font>

691
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:38,990
entire office drop off and they stop

692
00:29:35,630 --> 00:29:42,530
they just stopped checking in<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay yeah</font>

693
00:29:38,990 --> 00:29:44,419
so on a console when you're looking at

694
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:45,799
thousands of machines for hundreds of

695
00:29:44,419 --> 00:29:47,540
machines whatever your organization is

696
00:29:45,799 --> 00:29:51,110
as you're scrolling down if you see a

697
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:53,870
big black<font color="#CCCCCC"> Blanc block that that would be</font>

698
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:57,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">a problem all right but if you looked at</font>

699
00:29:53,870 --> 00:29:58,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">it just for the day it looks fine then</font>

700
00:29:57,080 --> 00:30:01,010
we looked at another product so we took

701
00:29:58,610 --> 00:30:03,500
the same another<font color="#CCCCCC"> product the console</font>

702
00:30:01,010 --> 00:30:05,120
this interface is something we worked on

703
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:08,510
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is a different product we</font>

704
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:10,040
collected their logs and do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> again</font>

705
00:30:08,510 --> 00:30:12,169
okay here we go there's the there's the

706
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:14,360
same type of stuff different company and

707
00:30:12,169 --> 00:30:17,030
those<font color="#CCCCCC"> two bottom ones were the first</font>

708
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:18,500
high priority ones the laser pointers

709
00:30:17,030 --> 00:30:20,590
not working so these two let's

710
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:23,600
investigate those what's going on<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

711
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:25,699
look at me this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is very troubling these</font>

712
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:27,830
guys this entire<font color="#E5E5E5"> group is checking in</font>

713
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:29,180
but never getting updates it's not even

714
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:31,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">trying to download up</font>

715
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:34,310
anymore so again these are not

716
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:36,290
infectious diseases it's just that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

717
00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:38,629
hosts<font color="#E5E5E5"> are not functioning correctly and</font>

718
00:30:36,290 --> 00:30:40,970
we're able to see that go change<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

719
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:43,700
policy and now it<font color="#E5E5E5"> works it functions</font>

720
00:30:40,970 --> 00:30:45,500
correctly so the probability of them

721
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:46,640
getting infected is lowered because yeah

722
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:50,510
they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually working the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> way they're</font>

723
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:53,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">supposed to this making sense and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

724
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:55,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">are machines that the other machines</font>

725
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:57,500
work is pretty consistent and being

726
00:30:55,010 --> 00:30:58,760
turned off at night these were<font color="#E5E5E5"> not so</font>

727
00:30:57,500 --> 00:31:00,590
they were violating policy you're

728
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:03,080
supposed to turn these off so go change

729
00:31:00,590 --> 00:31:06,169
for some<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get turned off then one more</font>

730
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:10,240
this is a later revision this is back in

731
00:31:06,170 --> 00:31:12,650
like april 2015 this one we added

732
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:14,330
application device control so like what

733
00:31:12,650 --> 00:31:16,220
processes are executing when they're

734
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:18,649
executing our USB sticks getting plugged

735
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:21,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">and all that stuff and that's shown as</font>

736
00:31:18,650 --> 00:31:24,260
green so quickly you can see<font color="#E5E5E5"> that two</font>

737
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:26,360
machines are very green there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

738
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:31,250
activity on those machines or violating

739
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:34,429
a lot of policy so why then we my buddy

740
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:36,290
made it so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that when you click yeah what</font>

741
00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:39,020
I ended<font color="#E5E5E5"> up calling the patient report</font>

742
00:31:36,290 --> 00:31:41,210
came up there<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is so now it shows in</font>

743
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:44,000
color it breaks out the firewall IPS

744
00:31:41,210 --> 00:31:47,360
what files they downloaded what maybe

745
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:50,720
what AV signatures were triggered an

746
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:53,209
application device control and very

747
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:55,870
quickly can maybe quickly you can see

748
00:31:53,210 --> 00:31:58,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the firewall is getting hammered</font>

749
00:31:55,870 --> 00:32:01,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">something's up it's either communicating</font>

750
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:04,010
out or somebody something scanning and

751
00:32:01,130 --> 00:32:05,810
so then we added another<font color="#E5E5E5"> button oops to</font>

752
00:32:04,010 --> 00:32:08,690
get<font color="#CCCCCC"> even more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> details so he can hover</font>

753
00:32:05,810 --> 00:32:12,950
over that one<font color="#E5E5E5"> event and see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what what's</font>

754
00:32:08,690 --> 00:32:15,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">causing it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so um this was my buddy doing</font>

755
00:32:12,950 --> 00:32:19,220
work on his customers I ended up using

756
00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:22,550
this at one of mine and the moment we

757
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:26,210
lit it up on his data we found dual<font color="#CCCCCC"> nics</font>

758
00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:28,129
servers so one<font color="#CCCCCC"> nix on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the inside one nix</font>

759
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:30,340
on the outside<font color="#E5E5E5"> bypassing other security</font>

760
00:32:28,130 --> 00:32:33,020
and all we saw was black lines across

761
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:35,959
showing heartbleed just hitting the

762
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:38,540
company but the product was blocking

763
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:40,580
heartbleed right so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> eight and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

764
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:42,230
IPS was actually saying<font color="#CCCCCC"> I detected</font>

765
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:42,770
heartbleed and I stopped it<font color="#E5E5E5"> I detected</font>

766
00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:45,110
hard plate and

767
00:32:42,770 --> 00:32:46,100
I stopped it but it at least let<font color="#CCCCCC"> them</font>

768
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:48,320
know that you have an abnormal

769
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:50,030
functioning of an organism here it was

770
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:51,770
not supposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have to nix plugged in</font>

771
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:54,320
one to the outside<font color="#CCCCCC"> and one on the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> inside</font>

772
00:32:51,770 --> 00:32:56,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">that way so again I'm not focusing on</font>

773
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:58,490
discovering the apt and focusing on

774
00:32:56,360 --> 00:33:00,949
looking at the long picture and making

775
00:32:58,490 --> 00:33:04,310
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> hosts healthier like making them</font>

776
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:06,950
work correctly then I used other tools

777
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:10,370
this is a key be the part of the elk

778
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:14,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">Ithaca offshoot of Cabana to do a these</font>

779
00:33:10,370 --> 00:33:16,040
are scans AV scans so I saw saw machines

780
00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:18,530
that were taking too long and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> believe</font>

781
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:20,690
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the one that was a nas scan from</font>

782
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:22,940
an endpoint a very cheap customer

783
00:33:20,690 --> 00:33:26,360
setting<font color="#E5E5E5"> up an endpoint to scan a nas</font>

784
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:29,560
drive which would take forever bad<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea</font>

785
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:36,250
and then policy detections<font color="#E5E5E5"> by time fire</font>

786
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:38,780
alerts by OS and stuff like that and

787
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:42,080
then this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> old slide and you</font>

788
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:43,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">can see my awesome graphics this is just</font>

789
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:46,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">the illustrate kind of the mentality</font>

790
00:33:43,910 --> 00:33:50,330
change from today to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> EPI digit</font>

791
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:53,240
ologist right<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so that that guy right</font>

792
00:33:50,330 --> 00:33:55,879
there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> your everyday I information</font>

793
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:58,070
security guy you know he's a firefighter

794
00:33:55,880 --> 00:34:01,100
right he's saving all these machines all

795
00:33:58,070 --> 00:34:03,560
these hosts he rips them out of the

796
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:05,870
network reimage<font color="#CCCCCC"> 'as them and they're</font>

797
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:08,570
healthy again they go off to their merry

798
00:34:05,870 --> 00:34:09,980
way you introduced this new guy get my

799
00:34:08,570 --> 00:34:12,460
graphics<font color="#E5E5E5"> are terrible but did you</font>

800
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:15,320
introduce this epi digit ologist guy and

801
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:17,210
he's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to come in and you know the</font>

802
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:18,919
legacy guys going to say where you going

803
00:34:17,210 --> 00:34:20,659
help me save these people<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am going to</font>

804
00:34:18,918 --> 00:34:22,100
help I'm gonna find out<font color="#E5E5E5"> why they're</font>

805
00:34:20,659 --> 00:34:24,320
getting sick in the first place that's a

806
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:26,750
whole different you know differently

807
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:30,200
from way of thinking all right it feels

808
00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:33,350
good to save somebody's computer to get

809
00:34:30,199 --> 00:34:35,270
them<font color="#E5E5E5"> back into production and so on this</font>

810
00:34:33,350 --> 00:34:39,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">boring work somebody needs to do it</font>

811
00:34:35,270 --> 00:34:43,070
right and when they find out oh it's it

812
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:45,380
was the Nazarite so let's put a rule<font color="#E5E5E5"> 2</font>

813
00:34:43,070 --> 00:34:47,810
or less installs a scan engine on that

814
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:50,690
thing and now you'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> have less people to</font>

815
00:34:47,810 --> 00:34:52,520
deal with less laptops to reimage right

816
00:34:50,690 --> 00:34:53,840
because you're preventing you're

817
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:56,570
lowering the amount of<font color="#CCCCCC"> P</font>

818
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:58,730
that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting sick yeah it's not the</font>

819
00:34:56,570 --> 00:35:00,590
water's polluted all right and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

820
00:34:58,730 --> 00:35:02,900
folks started asking me so where do we

821
00:35:00,590 --> 00:35:04,220
get these people<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you get</font>

822
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:06,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">you information</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> security guys are</font>

823
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:09,290
expensive you know there's a skills

824
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:11,300
shortage and so on and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so forth and then</font>

825
00:35:09,290 --> 00:35:14,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">I started basically arguing that the</font>

826
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:17,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">helpdesk would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be a great rapport a repo</font>

827
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:19,370
of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the higher so you don't an</font>

828
00:35:17,030 --> 00:35:21,650
epi digit ologist doesn't have to be a

829
00:35:19,370 --> 00:35:24,259
you know static analysis ninja or

830
00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:27,290
dynamic analysis ninja they just need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

831
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:29,630
have a logical mind be analytical and

832
00:35:27,290 --> 00:35:32,450
have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of patience but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> um help desk</font>

833
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:34,040
folks if they have enough years in the

834
00:35:32,450 --> 00:35:35,990
job they know where your exchange

835
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:38,480
servers are they know where your

836
00:35:35,990 --> 00:35:41,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">sharepoint servers are they know the</font>

837
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:44,090
neighborhood right so what better person

838
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:46,610
to put in front<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a dashboard to look</font>

839
00:35:44,090 --> 00:35:49,600
at statistics like when they see an

840
00:35:46,610 --> 00:35:52,280
outlier like on some of those graphs

841
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:53,660
like the customer<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have we saw oh that</font>

842
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:55,610
their dual<font color="#E5E5E5"> nicked they're not supposed</font>

843
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:57,710
to be I didn't know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I will couldn't</font>

844
00:35:55,610 --> 00:35:59,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">possibly know that he knows his</font>

845
00:35:57,710 --> 00:36:02,990
neighborhood better than me and that's

846
00:35:59,210 --> 00:36:05,150
where I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> helpdesk hiring up</font>

847
00:36:02,990 --> 00:36:08,120
internally and who doesn't want to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

848
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:10,940
security at sexy right this may not be

849
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:14,600
the sexiest entry entry way but it's it

850
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:17,180
so it's a way in and I believe and I

851
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:19,279
mean my my son my ten-year-old here has

852
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:21,020
seen my tool at work at home anyone he's

853
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:22,790
pointed out oh that looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> like this and</font>

854
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:31,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">that looks like that my ten-year-old can</font>

855
00:36:22,790 --> 00:36:33,170
figure it out huh yeah um and then I so

856
00:36:31,070 --> 00:36:39,380
I put a slide up for clinical trials

857
00:36:33,170 --> 00:36:40,700
okay okay cool perfect almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> done so</font>

858
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:43,970
this goes back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I touched on</font>

859
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:46,730
earlier survey your environment analyzed

860
00:36:43,970 --> 00:36:49,069
as many laws as<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can then you create</font>

861
00:36:46,730 --> 00:36:52,430
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> awesome control you wish you could</font>

862
00:36:49,070 --> 00:36:54,650
put in place right test the control now

863
00:36:52,430 --> 00:36:58,100
it's very important that you test

864
00:36:54,650 --> 00:37:00,110
randomly<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay too many times when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I talk</font>

865
00:36:58,100 --> 00:37:01,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">to customers and like yeah we tested</font>

866
00:37:00,110 --> 00:37:05,840
that product and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's terrible</font>

867
00:37:01,910 --> 00:37:06,830
self-censorship it's terrible like

868
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:10,430
where'd you tested Oh

869
00:37:06,830 --> 00:37:12,440
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> tested it on the IT guys we will hold</font>

870
00:37:10,430 --> 00:37:16,990
on can you pick somebody from HR

871
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:16,990
somebody from finance somebody from

872
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:23,330
sorry<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so you know basically</font>

873
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:25,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">randomly select so I wrote a little</font>

874
00:37:23,330 --> 00:37:27,259
Python script that just goes into the

875
00:37:25,130 --> 00:37:30,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">semantic database and just picks</font>

876
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:33,770
machines at random and then I can apply

877
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:36,530
a policy that the wishful policy on just

878
00:37:33,770 --> 00:37:39,920
those machines and now as you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're</font>

879
00:37:36,530 --> 00:37:41,450
polling<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you poll randomly it tends</font>

880
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:46,100
to represent the rest of the population

881
00:37:41,450 --> 00:37:48,950
better versus polling bias<font color="#E5E5E5"> Lee</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay let</font>

882
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:52,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">me just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pull everybody that like in the</font>

883
00:37:48,950 --> 00:37:54,049
famous telephone survey back in the

884
00:37:52,010 --> 00:37:55,970
nineteen like 30s where they surveyed

885
00:37:54,050 --> 00:37:57,290
who would vote for the president<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

886
00:37:55,970 --> 00:38:01,009
they only called people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who had a phone</font>

887
00:37:57,290 --> 00:38:03,740
people who had money it wasn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> a truly</font>

888
00:38:01,010 --> 00:38:05,360
random sampling so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I would suggest test</font>

889
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:07,459
the control on a truly random sample

890
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:09,470
then measure the<font color="#E5E5E5"> effect is effectiveness</font>

891
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:11,000
of the control after<font color="#E5E5E5"> a period of time</font>

892
00:38:09,470 --> 00:38:14,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">you decide whether</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's a week a month</font>

893
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:16,820
maybe you do<font color="#E5E5E5"> checkpoints and if it was</font>

894
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:19,100
terrible start over if you didn't if

895
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:22,070
your control was terrible rewrite it and

896
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:24,920
start again if it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was awesome deploy it</font>

897
00:38:22,070 --> 00:38:26,960
to everybody else right just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the</font>

898
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:28,190
biological space just like the

899
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:30,560
pharmaceuticals do just like

900
00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:34,700
epidemiologist do you do the placebo

901
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:36,230
type thing and the real one okay almost

902
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:37,850
look at like nine minutes left so

903
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:40,220
changing how users think<font color="#E5E5E5"> of digital</font>

904
00:38:37,850 --> 00:38:42,470
threats so think digital diseases so

905
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:45,109
just you know tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> you tell the users</font>

906
00:38:42,470 --> 00:38:47,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">malware's just another type of infection</font>

907
00:38:45,110 --> 00:38:48,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">all right just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that just like you get</font>

908
00:38:47,030 --> 00:38:51,980
the cold you're inevitably going to get

911
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:57,589
product this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is for management there's</font>

912
00:38:56,150 --> 00:38:59,090
no product you can buy that's going to

913
00:38:57,590 --> 00:39:02,030
prevent your machine from getting sick

914
00:38:59,090 --> 00:39:06,920
if a vendor says I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> invented the</font>

915
00:39:02,030 --> 00:39:08,450
magic the magic pill they're lying and

916
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:10,730
then this one tends to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a good laugh</font>

917
00:39:08,450 --> 00:39:13,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">and I have to censor myself but just</font>

918
00:39:10,730 --> 00:39:15,260
because we invented antibiotics doesn't

919
00:39:13,490 --> 00:39:16,669
mean you go<font color="#E5E5E5"> crazy and you're not you</font>

920
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:19,400
guys<font color="#CCCCCC"> from the 70s know what I'm talking</font>

921
00:39:16,670 --> 00:39:20,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">about so you know it should be a</font>

922
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:23,990
somebody

923
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:25,700
me you got it it you should just because

924
00:39:23,990 --> 00:39:28,368
then a lot of users do this all<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have</font>

925
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:30,950
norton so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i should</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be protected i can</font>

926
00:39:28,369 --> 00:39:34,220
click on whatever I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> no so we have</font>

927
00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:35,660
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> change that mindset</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay that's like</font>

928
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:39,020
my ten-year-old pointed out that a

929
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:41,299
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who use helmets tend to take more</font>

930
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:43,940
risks because they feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> though I have</font>

931
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:45,800
the helmet on so I'll be safer no it's

932
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:47,210
supposed to be the last line of defense

933
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:51,470
don't take more risk because<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have</font>

934
00:39:47,210 --> 00:39:57,710
the helmet and then study continually

935
00:39:51,470 --> 00:40:00,890
study and I'm guilty<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this and I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hope</font>

936
00:39:57,710 --> 00:40:04,460
you agree with me our<font color="#E5E5E5"> desk slide manner</font>

937
00:40:00,890 --> 00:40:06,970
has been terrible<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright we tell our</font>

938
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:10,640
users behind their back their stupid

939
00:40:06,970 --> 00:40:12,200
right they don't understand anything so

940
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:15,529
why would<font color="#CCCCCC"> they listen to our</font>

941
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:18,200
prescriptions to better themselves when

942
00:40:15,530 --> 00:40:21,200
we belittle them<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so our bet our</font>

943
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:23,720
desk side manner needs to improve and

944
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:24,980
and and just I'm sure you've experienced

945
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:28,069
this with your doctor when your doctor

946
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:29,930
is a has good bedside manner you<font color="#E5E5E5"> tend to</font>

947
00:40:28,069 --> 00:40:33,079
listen to them when they don't you

948
00:40:29,930 --> 00:40:36,169
ignore them<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you make</font>

949
00:40:33,079 --> 00:40:39,170
when you prescribe a certain action if

950
00:40:36,170 --> 00:40:41,480
you do it nicely they'll actually think

951
00:40:39,170 --> 00:40:45,559
<font color="#CCCCCC">about it when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they get that email that</font>

952
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:48,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">asks them to click ok so what what to do</font>

953
00:40:45,559 --> 00:40:50,270
when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to your offices get to</font>

954
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:52,160
know well but<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe not you but get</font>

955
00:40:50,270 --> 00:40:53,630
somebody whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> in turn or somebody</font>

956
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:56,270
from the helpdesk well maybe you do it

957
00:40:53,630 --> 00:40:57,680
but get<font color="#CCCCCC"> to know your assets you need to</font>

958
00:40:56,270 --> 00:40:59,299
know your neighborhood who lives in your

959
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:01,790
neighborhood where's the exchange server

960
00:40:59,299 --> 00:41:04,460
right where's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> sharepoint server and</font>

961
00:41:01,790 --> 00:41:06,099
so on visualize your data<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean I was</font>

962
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:08,390
shocked to see the<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff that we saw</font>

963
00:41:06,099 --> 00:41:09,950
totally unexpected results by just

964
00:41:08,390 --> 00:41:11,779
visualizing the data you can use the

965
00:41:09,950 --> 00:41:13,520
tool that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> provided but there's plenty</font>

966
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:18,260
of other stuff out there that elastic

967
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:19,700
logstash gabbana excuse me tableau

968
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:21,710
there's plenty<font color="#CCCCCC"> of tool that you can</font>

969
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:23,390
start to<font color="#E5E5E5"> visualize your data and then</font>

970
00:41:21,710 --> 00:41:26,170
use those visualizations to communicate

971
00:41:23,390 --> 00:41:28,069
to management they love crayon pictures

972
00:41:26,170 --> 00:41:31,609
leverage and then leverage a new

973
00:41:28,069 --> 00:41:32,690
insights to insta to create new clinical

974
00:41:31,609 --> 00:41:35,670
trials

975
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:37,920
create if you see certain things and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

976
00:41:35,670 --> 00:41:40,620
want to enrich that data then create the

977
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:42,600
trial and deploy it<font color="#CCCCCC"> in law only mode and</font>

978
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:47,250
then a few weeks later you can actually

979
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:49,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">make an informed decision and basically</font>

980
00:41:47,250 --> 00:41:51,030
make it evidence-based<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I think I'm</font>

981
00:41:49,950 --> 00:41:53,509
right on the money<font color="#E5E5E5"> is there any</font>

982
00:41:51,030 --> 00:41:53,510
questions

983
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:16,510
herd immunity so not not<font color="#E5E5E5"> community um so</font>

984
00:42:14,230 --> 00:42:19,060
when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a customer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that has the</font>

985
00:42:16,510 --> 00:42:20,980
firewall and the IPS on some of their

986
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:23,290
machines I wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> call it hurt</font>

987
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:25,210
immunity but I would call<font color="#CCCCCC"> it like alerts</font>

988
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:28,930
like they become like the neighborhood

989
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:30,430
gossip so if you were watching I feel

990
00:42:28,930 --> 00:42:32,069
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have many customers who don't</font>

991
00:42:30,430 --> 00:42:34,930
have the IPS or firewall turned on

992
00:42:32,070 --> 00:42:37,180
unfortunately so when we tell them turn

993
00:42:34,930 --> 00:42:41,440
it on on a random set of machines they

994
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:43,810
become the you know the canary okay so

995
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:46,300
it's not herd immunity but at least you

996
00:42:43,810 --> 00:42:50,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">get as long as it's random because if</font>

997
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:52,450
you just turn it<font color="#E5E5E5"> on is then so you have</font>

998
00:42:50,350 --> 00:42:54,720
the canary to alert you but you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

999
00:42:52,450 --> 00:42:57,549
be looking and not looking in that one

1000
00:42:54,720 --> 00:43:03,450
day console you got to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at it over</font>

1001
00:42:57,550 --> 00:43:03,450
time question about

1002
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:22,460
hmm

1003
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:33,420
yep

1004
00:43:36,490 --> 00:43:42,189
yeah so when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> write on man you're</font>

1005
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:44,530
installing all these applications what

1006
00:43:42,190 --> 00:43:47,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">dll's came with those applications right</font>

1007
00:43:44,530 --> 00:43:49,330
that introduced vulnerabilities and if

1008
00:43:47,590 --> 00:43:50,980
they installed it you probably have no

1009
00:43:49,330 --> 00:43:53,920
purview into them so you're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

1010
00:43:50,980 --> 00:43:58,480
patch it anymore for i'll use an<font color="#E5E5E5"> example</font>

1011
00:43:53,920 --> 00:44:00,850
anaconda is holier than Swiss cheese

1012
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:02,230
right so somebody installs it because

1013
00:44:00,850 --> 00:44:04,390
they need to write their little scripts

1014
00:44:02,230 --> 00:44:06,850
not knowing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they just opened up</font>

1015
00:44:04,390 --> 00:44:09,790
that machine to a ton of vulnerabilities

1016
00:44:06,850 --> 00:44:11,440
right so yeah when you install too many

1017
00:44:09,790 --> 00:44:13,450
applications it's somebody eating too

1018
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:15,940
many different things or take actually

1019
00:44:13,450 --> 00:44:18,270
taking many different medicines you

1020
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:24,700
don't know what<font color="#CCCCCC"> the interactions will be</font>

1021
00:44:18,270 --> 00:44:27,090
anybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> else</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right well thank you</font>

1022
00:44:24,700 --> 00:44:27,089
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming</font>
