16
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:46,320
2012 I've disclosed approximately 100

00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:52,050
vulnerabilities that I've publicly

20
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:53,879
disclosed in total over my security I'm

21
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:55,050
a professional security career I've

22
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:58,800
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> found upwards of about a</font>

23
00:00:55,050 --> 00:01:00,769
thousand bugs and why do I do this

24
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:04,438
because security is incredibly important

25
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:08,490
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> really quick about is see where a</font>

27
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:12,539
computer scientists hackers and just

28
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:14,150
individuals who like to break things so

29
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:17,460
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> what we do on a day-to-day basis</font>

30
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:19,409
our clients are anybody that is in need

31
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:20,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">of protecting assets so if you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> had a</font>

we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> here for and the biggest</font>

35
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:28,430
difference<font color="#CCCCCC"> between us and a lot of other</font>

36
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:31,140
security companies is our perspective we

37
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:32,689
primarily focus on white box assessments

38
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:36,750
as opposed to the black box testing

39
00:01:32,689 --> 00:01:38,270
methodology so really quick some of the

40
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:40,619
research<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we've done</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the past</font>

50
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:05,009
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so to kind of get down to</font>

51
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:07,439
business why hospital security is

52
00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:09,209
important security<font color="#CCCCCC"> in general</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is very</font>

53
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:11,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">important but when it comes to hospitals</font>

54
00:02:09,209 --> 00:02:12,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">its of greater importance because we</font>

55
00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:14,250
start talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the well-being of</font>

56
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:15,720
individuals

57
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:17,070
and you know people<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> obviously in a</font>

58
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:20,340
hospital because they're hurt sick

59
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:22,010
whatever so why this is important is

60
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:25,010
because hospitals are being targeted

61
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:27,000
medical equipment is<font color="#CCCCCC"> being exploited</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

62
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:28,769
patient health must<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> protected</font>

63
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,770
otherwise it's very likely that a

64
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:32,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">patient could</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> die</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from a cyberattack so</font>

65
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:35,490
the topics we're going to talk about

66
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:37,950
today<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the introduction of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the Maya</font>

67
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:40,230
kiss my presentation<font color="#E5E5E5"> examines security</font>

68
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:43,769
aspects and then the recommendation the

69
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:46,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">examined security aspects will be topics</font>

70
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:48,330
that will be covered throughout the

71
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:50,519
presentation that are basically a recap

72
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:54,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the research</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we performed over</font>

73
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:56,370
the past couple of years so introduction

74
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:59,190
I guess the goal of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> healthcare</font>

75
00:02:56,370 --> 00:03:01,980
research was to<font color="#E5E5E5"> demonstrate that an</font>

76
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:04,980
attacker could compromise a patient the

77
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:07,260
health of a patient more specifically we

78
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:10,679
were focused<font color="#E5E5E5"> on whether or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it was</font>

79
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:13,590
feasible for a adversary from a remote

80
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:15,660
perspective to be able to induce harm to

81
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:18,989
a patient as opposed to going<font color="#E5E5E5"> after</font>

82
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:22,079
medical records which is a common vector

83
00:03:18,989 --> 00:03:24,540
of attack these days this research

84
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,760
results from our assessment of<font color="#E5E5E5"> 12</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> health</font>

85
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:29,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">care facilities to healthcare data</font>

86
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:32,220
facilities the assessment of for medical

87
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:35,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">devices as well as the assessment of a</font>

88
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:38,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">couple of web-based applications that</font>

89
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:41,120
were EHR to be specific and then

90
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:44,940
securing patient health very important

91
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:46,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so for the implementation flaws</font>

92
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:48,930
we're going to talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

93
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:50,010
implementation issues that arise in some

94
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:52,049
of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> devices so they're going to be</font>

95
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:54,060
common application and web application

96
00:03:52,049 --> 00:03:55,950
security vulnerabilities then we're

97
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:58,590
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to actually dissect a couple of</font>

98
00:03:55,950 --> 00:04:02,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">real-world attack scenarios these attack</font>

99
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:04,709
scenarios are ways in<font color="#CCCCCC"> which remote</font>

100
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:06,359
adversaries are able to break into a

101
00:04:04,709 --> 00:04:08,489
hospital and induce patient harm and

102
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:10,140
these aren't theoretical we've actually

103
00:04:08,489 --> 00:04:11,820
were able to do these throughout<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

104
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:13,440
research with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the cooperation of</font>

105
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:15,630
hospitals<font color="#E5E5E5"> that participated in our study</font>

106
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:18,660
so that's kind of I<font color="#CCCCCC"> guess the meat of</font>

107
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:20,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">the presentation so here are the</font>

108
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:22,500
examined medical devices i mentioned

109
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:24,210
that there were four of them two<font color="#CCCCCC"> of them</font>

110
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">are redacted as we're currently going</font>

111
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:26,940
through responsible disclosure with the

112
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:29,849
manufacturer but<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

113
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:32,810
have two devices listed here from<font color="#E5E5E5"> G and</font>

114
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:35,670
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> happen to be cara cara skate</font>

115
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:39,720
patient monitors there's a be<font color="#E5E5E5"> 650 and</font>

116
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:40,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">abby 850 and here is a list of some of</font>

117
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:44,520
the vulnerabilities that were found<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

118
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:46,800
the devices so some pretty common things

119
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:48,690
like the use of outdated software as

120
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,790
well as some common web vulnerabilities

121
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:52,650
like cross-site scripting or cross-site

122
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:54,300
request forgery and then you have some

123
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:56,849
more serious issues like command

124
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:59,910
injection or memory corruption which

125
00:04:56,850 --> 00:05:03,960
would lead to some form of remote

126
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:06,120
exploit so vulnerability example number

127
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:08,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">one we're going to talk about the use of</font>

128
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:10,260
dynamically constructed database queries

129
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:11,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">so this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the vulnerability and</font>

130
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:14,130
the attack<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is common with this</font>

131
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:16,290
vulnerability a sequel injection and

132
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:18,360
sequel injection vulnerabilities are the

133
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:20,490
direct result of<font color="#E5E5E5"> an application taking</font>

134
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:21,900
input supplied by user and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> using</font>

135
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:23,310
that in the construction<font color="#E5E5E5"> of dynamic</font>

136
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:25,229
queries that are then sent to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

137
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:26,700
database so it allows an attacker<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

138
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:29,790
manipulate you know the<font color="#CCCCCC"> underline</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> query</font>

139
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:30,990
structure and you know access parts of

00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:34,320
the database they shouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> access</font>

141
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:37,350
to so as you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on the slide here</font>

142
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:40,110

152
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:06,659
demonstrating here is that we're

153

attempting<font color="#E5E5E5"> to log into this portal with</font>

156
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:14,190
the bottom that says that the password

157
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:19,169
is actually incorrect so we're unable<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">log in on this slide I'm demonstrating</font>

00:06:19,169 --> 00:06:23,669
that again we're trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> login</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> except</font>

172
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:56,280
given this magical response that is

00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:59,160
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> than what we saw when we were</font>

unable<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> login so that's kind of</font>

175
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:03,450
interesting well as<font color="#E5E5E5"> soon as our browser</font>

176
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:05,940
receives this response or presented with

00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:07,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">this lovely page and we're essentially</font>

178
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:10,590
able to bypass authentication by

179
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:12,000
injecting a very trivial payload so the

180
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:13,679
very common example a sequel injection

181
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,050
that you may<font color="#CCCCCC"> have learned about when you</font>

182
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:19,590
were first you know I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know curious</font>

183
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:21,060
about what sequel injection is exists in

184
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:23,130
a medical device that is used you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

185
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:25,260
within a hospital so it kind of shows

186
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:30,570
you the state<font color="#CCCCCC"> of security of these</font>

187
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:32,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">devices it's it's fairly weak the next</font>

188
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:35,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">attack example we're going to talk about</font>

189
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:37,590
is insufficient input validation and

190
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:39,840
output sanitization and this refers to a

191
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:43,200
very common<font color="#E5E5E5"> web-based attack known as</font>

192
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:45,289
cross-site scripting and again like most

193
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:49,170
vulnerabilities cross-site scripting

194
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:51,150
results from the application taking raw

195
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:53,310
user input and again and then using<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

196
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:57,450
without properly validating or

197
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:59,790
sanitizing<font color="#CCCCCC"> the output so here this is a</font>

198
00:07:57,450 --> 00:08:02,400
less complex example just showing the

199
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:04,700
typical javascript alert box saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> let</font>

201
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:10,920
this isn't the GE care escape monitor as

202
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:14,880
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> see GE healthcare logo on the</font>

203
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:17,130
top right and vulnerability example

204
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:19,950
number<font color="#CCCCCC"> three we're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to discuss the</font>

205
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:22,469
failure to canonicalize file paths and

206
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:25,700
this results in a directory traversal

207
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:29,460
attack also known as a dot<font color="#E5E5E5"> slash attack</font>

208
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:31,440
again the result of the application

209
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:35,220
taking input without proper properly

210
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:37,980
validating<font color="#E5E5E5"> it it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so here we are</font>

211
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:39,420
showing the GE care escape and while we

212
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:40,800
were playing around<font color="#E5E5E5"> this device we had</font>

213
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:43,589
noticed that there was some

214
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:45,000
functionality to view<font color="#CCCCCC"> log files so we</font>

215
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:46,620
clicked on you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the view blogs</font>

216
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,030
button as<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can see in the left-hand</font>

217
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:50,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">panel and we were presented with this</font>

218
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:52,199
sub modules for viewing logs well when

219
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,590
we clicked on one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these buttons we</font>

220
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,740
see

221
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:58,080
that the device issues an API request to

222
00:08:55,740 --> 00:09:01,470
the server excuse me that the client our

223
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:04,350
web browser and there is this get

224
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:07,830
request to the view log file<font color="#E5E5E5"> dot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> CGI</font>

225
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:10,410
file and there's an HTTP parameter that

226
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:12,300
is passed called link name and if you

227
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:15,510
notice the value of link name it's a

228
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:19,260
looks awfully familiar are similar to a

229
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:21,930
file path and sure enough VAR log

230
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:26,340
messages is a directory or is a file

231
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:27,780
that exists on<font color="#E5E5E5"> a Linux system and if you</font>

232
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:29,880
were to request this file you're going

233
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:31,589
to get the message as well well we can

234
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:34,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">play around with that again and use the</font>

235
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:35,490
dot<font color="#CCCCCC"> dot slash sequence and just back up</font>

236
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:36,960
a little bit and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font>

237
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:39,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">back in you know to you that's you</font>

238
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:41,880
directory and access shadow well as you

239
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:43,620
guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> know this attack will would succeed</font>

240
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:45,750
if the application<font color="#E5E5E5"> was vulnerable to</font>

241
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:46,830
directory traversal and if we had

242
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:49,410
permission<font color="#E5E5E5"> to read the shadow file</font>

243
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:55,230
that's owned by root hopefully this

244
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:57,870
doesn't work oh crap it works<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right</font>

245
00:09:55,230 --> 00:10:00,270
so there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to serious issues here</font>

246
00:09:57,870 --> 00:10:02,340
one we've demonstrated that an attacker

247
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:03,120
is able to are identified and is able to

248
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:04,590
exploit a directory traversal

249
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,450
vulnerability and we've also

250
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:08,250
demonstrated that the web server<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is</font>

251
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:10,170
running this vulnerable application is

252
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:12,960
running with root permissions or at

253
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:15,780
least the code<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was accessing that</font>

254
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:18,150
file was privileged so we were able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

255
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:20,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">read files owned by root so essentially</font>

256
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:22,230
any file on the file system we're able

257
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:25,739
to access through this vulnerable

258
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:27,330
application the next vulnerability we're

259
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:30,150
going to discuss is the use of outdated

260
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:33,330
software so in a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of cases the the</font>

261
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:34,500
severity of this issue could<font color="#E5E5E5"> be could be</font>

262
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:36,960
on opposite ends of the spectrum right

263
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:39,480
you could have in I don't know a simple

264
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:41,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">information disclosure that may be rated</font>

265
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:43,770
as a low severity or you could have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

266
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:44,970
vulnerability that leads to remote code

267
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:47,370
execution that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be rated as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

268
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:48,930
higher critical severity so when you see

269
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:53,010
this classification of use of outdated

270
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:54,420
software the i guess the end result

271
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:58,170
could be disastrous or it could be

272
00:10:54,420 --> 00:11:01,199
fairly benign well in this case<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font>

273
00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:03,120
just looking around at the system<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we</font>

274
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,130
had noticed some interesting files and

275
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,860
these interesting files made us look at

276
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:06,820
some you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

277
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:09,820
bugs that have been recently published

278
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:11,680
and a big one<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> shellshock quick</font>

279
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:13,690
show of hands<font color="#E5E5E5"> who's familiar with the</font>

280
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:16,149
shell shock<font color="#E5E5E5"> or the bash shock bug most</font>

281
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:21,250
of you has you should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> awesome so</font>

282
00:11:16,149 --> 00:11:26,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">really quick this uh this bug exists in</font>

283
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:29,740
bash and it's the result of improper or

284
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:31,540
inadequate parsing of function

285
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:35,829
definitions so what actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> happens is</font>

286
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:36,969
if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a excuse me if you have an</font>

287
00:11:35,829 --> 00:11:38,890
environment variable and that

288
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:41,230
environment variable contains a function

289
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:42,550
definition whether it's correct or not

290
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:45,760
it just<font color="#E5E5E5"> has to be syntactically correct</font>

291
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:47,709
any trailing characters are going to be

292
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:49,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">interpreted and actually executed so</font>

293
00:11:47,709 --> 00:11:51,339
what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do is set up an environment</font>

294
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:53,709
variable to contain a bogus function

295
00:11:51,339 --> 00:11:55,690
definition and then have whatever attack

296
00:11:53,709 --> 00:11:57,550
string that you want to X cube following

297
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:59,230
the definition<font color="#E5E5E5"> and bash will go ahead</font>

298
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:02,290
and incorrectly parse it and execute

299
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:03,730
those commands that's pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> awesome so</font>

300
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:06,670
like I said we're playing around the

301
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:07,779
device<font color="#E5E5E5"> and again I mentioned CGI files</font>

302
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:09,670
when we were talking about directory

303
00:12:07,779 --> 00:12:12,730
traversal here it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> again you've logged</font>

304
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:15,219
at<font color="#CCCCCC"> CGI</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hmm that's pretty interesting</font>

305
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:17,470
given the way that you know CGI files

306
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:20,500
are handled by<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know certain web</font>

307
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:23,560
servers maybe maybe or not maybe not

308
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:26,050
maybe or maybe not well this thing be

309
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:28,569
vulnerable to so shocked so really<font color="#E5E5E5"> quick</font>

310
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:30,040
we knowing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I eat leverages CGI</font>

311
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:31,959
knowing of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> existence of</font>

312
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:34,930
shell-shocked we quickly constructed a

313
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:36,489
payload and there's a picture<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a of my</font>

314
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:38,140
colleagues terminal here Jake Thompson

315
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:43,600
he's actually sitting in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the audience</font>

316
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:46,420
over here so hello Jake but as you can

317
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,740
see we are using curl actually might be

318
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:50,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">hard for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to see but we're using curl</font>

319
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:52,930
and basically we're going to make a post

320
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:54,760
to this<font color="#E5E5E5"> web server and in the user agent</font>

321
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:56,170
we have a function definition which by

322
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:58,360
the way the user agent gets set as a

323
00:12:56,170 --> 00:13:00,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">specific environment variable and Nick's</font>

324
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:02,829
based OS is this is part of the reason

325
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:04,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">why that's going to work so we have a we</font>

326
00:13:02,829 --> 00:13:06,550
have our function definition and then

327
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:07,930
after it we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a string and attack</font>

328
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:09,640
string starting with the word bash and

329
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:11,829
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> what that is is running bash</font>

330
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:14,890
interactive mode and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then if you notice</font>

331
00:13:11,829 --> 00:13:18,729

interactive

334
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:22,240
and the / dub is actually going to make

a<font color="#E5E5E5"> connection to us because we're going</font>

00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:41,320
crossed BAM reverse show<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so we were</font>

342
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:43,240
able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to compromise device compromised</font>

this device without authentication from

a remote perspective using a well known

shell Who am I route I'm talking really

347
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:59,410
fast<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so now we're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

348
00:13:55,630 --> 00:14:01,960
attack<font color="#CCCCCC"> anatomies and yeah really quick</font>

349
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:05,219
we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a list</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the excuse me not a</font>

350
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:09,460
list but we have a picture that has a

351
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:14,050
list of locations of various hospitals

352
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:16,480
that were part of our study so<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

353
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:20,290
quick attack<font color="#E5E5E5"> Anatomy number one we're</font>

354
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:22,720
going to basically owned a hospital from

355
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:24,640
a remote<font color="#E5E5E5"> managed point and how are we</font>

356
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:28,630
going to do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to go in</font>

357
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:31,870
through an external web application so

358
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:33,820
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the attack steps here well as a</font>

359
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:35,610
remote adversary<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanting to break into a</font>

360
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:37,900
hospital I need to figure<font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how to</font>

361
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:39,580
break the perimeter of the hospital

362
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:41,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">first right so obviously need to</font>

363
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:42,910
circumvent the perimeter once the

364
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:44,440
perimeter has been circumvented and

365
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:48,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're inside</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> network we have to</font>

366
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:50,320
pivot within the hospital and once<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

367
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:53,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">are pivoting we have to compromise an</font>

368
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:56,350
end system and then we hopefully profit

369
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:58,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so how do you circumvent the</font>

370
00:14:56,350 --> 00:15:01,510
perimeter well first you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to</font>

371
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:03,160
identify external endpoints and in this

372
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:04,810
case while we were working with the

373
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:07,600
hospital we were looking at their IP

374
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:11,469
range we had found an endpoint that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

375
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:13,660
I was used for I guess data collection

376
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:15,310
um I got to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be careful some of the</font>

377
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:16,600
details that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I revealed you guys so we</font>

378
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:19,000
used they use this endpoint for data

379
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:20,620
collection it was exposed thought

380
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,770
authentication<font color="#E5E5E5"> we figured this would be</font>

381
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:25,780
you know a great avenue of attack so we

382
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:27,699
started messing around with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the external</font>

383
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:29,290
web server and the application<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we</font>

384
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:32,850
attempted to identify and obviously

385
00:15:29,290 --> 00:15:35,399
exploit vulnerabilities well

386
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:39,779
once<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing that once we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> own</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the web</font>

387
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:40,769
server we had a<font color="#CCCCCC"> system on the network we</font>

388
00:15:39,779 --> 00:15:43,500
essentially we're in a privileged

389
00:15:40,769 --> 00:15:45,360
location and from there we had to I

390
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:46,740
guess go further into the network and

391
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">how do you do that you're gonna have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

392
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:50,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">map internal systems and then from there</font>

393
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:52,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">you're going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> continue to pivot and</font>

394
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:56,759
that's the exploitation of identify

395
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:58,199
systems<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so as you're pivoting</font>

396
00:15:56,759 --> 00:16:00,389
through the network you need to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

397
00:15:58,199 --> 00:16:02,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">guess an end goal in mind and our</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> goal</font>

398
00:16:00,389 --> 00:16:06,569
our end goal was<font color="#CCCCCC"> to find and compromise</font>

399
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:11,009
a medical device that would allow<font color="#E5E5E5"> us to</font>

400
00:16:06,569 --> 00:16:14,490
induce harm to a patient so here quickly

401
00:16:11,009 --> 00:16:17,550
is a demo these demos aren't live demos

402
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:19,620
but i will talk to you<font color="#E5E5E5"> about them as</font>

403
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:21,089
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going so could somebody kill a</font>

404
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:23,100
patient from another country the answer

405
00:16:21,089 --> 00:16:25,230
is yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what we were</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do is</font>

406
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:27,209
demonstrate that a remote attacker could

407
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:29,040
compromise an external facing web

408
00:16:27,209 --> 00:16:31,258
application using sequel injection

409
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:33,149
vulnerabilities and file inclusion

410
00:16:31,259 --> 00:16:35,490
vulnerabilities I had to redact that

411
00:16:33,149 --> 00:16:38,339
from the presentation sorry guys and

412
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:40,920
then from<font color="#E5E5E5"> there they're able to pivot</font>

413
00:16:38,339 --> 00:16:43,560
throughout Hospital machines on various

414
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:45,990
Network segments and from there you

415
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:48,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">compromised a vulnerable medical device</font>

416
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:51,860
and you can induce harm to a patient and

417
00:16:48,569 --> 00:16:56,160
they they may fall over just like that

418
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:59,279
maybe maybe not so yes from an external

419
00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:01,860
perspective you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> definitely induce</font>

420
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:05,819
harmful patient and you profit the

421
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:09,839
profit is harming your patient attacking

422
00:17:05,819 --> 00:17:12,809
<font color="#CCCCCC">atopy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> number two</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so this is kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

423
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:14,579
interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> I just demonstrated or at</font>

424
00:17:12,809 --> 00:17:16,470
least talked about how it's possible for

425
00:17:14,579 --> 00:17:18,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">an attacker from a different country or</font>

426
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:24,270
some remote location you know to to harm

427
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:27,750
a patient and this next attack anatomy

428
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:29,190
is remote but argue art<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's local but</font>

429
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:31,500
arguably<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's remote and what I mean</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> by</font>

430
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:34,559
<font color="#CCCCCC">that is we're going to leverage a guest</font>

431
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:39,570
kiosk and the vantage point<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the</font>

432
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:41,220
hospital lobby so again as usual we have

433
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:43,110
to circumvent the perimeter of the

434
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:44,340
hospital network we have to pivot within

435
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:46,229
the network and then we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

436
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:48,299
compromise an end system and

437
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:51,510
profiting is going to be the harming of

438
00:17:48,299 --> 00:17:53,910
a patient so here<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a picture of a</font>

439
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:55,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">hospital one of the hospitals that we've</font>

440
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:58,440
actually attacked and there's an arrow

441
00:17:55,980 --> 00:18:02,820
pointing to a guest lobby or guest kiosk

442
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:04,980
excuse me really quick this kiosk was

443
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:07,320
used for like I guess visitor

444
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:09,299
registration you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up to it it's in</font>

445
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:11,070
a kiosk mode type in some data and it

446
00:18:09,299 --> 00:18:14,150
will print out like a banner or a

447
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:17,549
sticker whatever you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to call it</font>

448
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:19,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so circumvent the perimeter well we</font>

449
00:18:17,549 --> 00:18:24,570
talked about the hospital kiosk it's in

450
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:27,000
kiosk mode there's you know no you have

451
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:28,439
there's no ability for an attacker to do

452
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:32,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">anything than interface with this kiosk</font>

453
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:34,110
mode so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think well we start</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thinking</font>

454
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,940
about I guess okay what is this kiosk

455
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:37,830
well it's obviously computer we see<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

456
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:39,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">there aren't any physical connections so</font>

457
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:41,100
it's obviously connected to the network

458
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:43,830
over wireless okay well that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> good to</font>

459
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:45,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">know how might these technologies be</font>

460
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:47,760
implemented so you kind of start

461
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:50,549
thinking about I guess what a kiosk is

462
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:52,320
what's involved and how somebody would

463
00:18:50,549 --> 00:18:53,610
have implemented it and a common thing

464
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:55,230
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you find these days are a lot of</font>

465
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:57,209
kiosk modes are actually web

466
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:59,429
applications so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I got to thinking okay</font>

467
00:18:57,210 --> 00:19:00,900
maybe it's a web client let's play

468
00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:03,780
around well as we're playing around we

469
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:05,429
had figured out that oh hey there is no

470
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:08,490
windows key there's no way to escape out

471
00:19:05,429 --> 00:19:09,900
of this mode but it is a web client what

472
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:12,450
about right click<font color="#CCCCCC"> will you right click</font>

473
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:14,309
sure enough it's a web page and you get

474
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:16,200
this awesome dialog box<font color="#E5E5E5"> that says I</font>

475
00:19:14,309 --> 00:19:18,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't know view source or view page</font>

476
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:20,340
source well you can click on that<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

477
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,900
all of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> sudden you get a lovely you</font>

478
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:24,320
know developer tool like window that has

479
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:27,169
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the source code for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the Patrian</font>

480
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:30,480
that doesn't sound<font color="#CCCCCC"> very useful does it</font>

481
00:19:27,169 --> 00:19:33,179
and not in isolation but that window

482
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:36,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">also happens to have a save button okay</font>

483
00:19:33,179 --> 00:19:38,790
so go file save what happens you get

484
00:19:36,179 --> 00:19:40,590
this nice little you know pop-up dialog

485
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:43,168
<font color="#CCCCCC">you know that's allowing you to browse</font>

486
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:45,240
your<font color="#CCCCCC"> file system and choose a location</font>

487
00:19:43,169 --> 00:19:47,220
to save a file something you may not

488
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:49,679
know about<font color="#E5E5E5"> windows is in that little</font>

489
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:51,660
safe bot dialogue if you navigate<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a</font>

490
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:56,210
file and hit enter the<font color="#E5E5E5"> file is going to</font>

491
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:59,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">open well cmd.exe is a file isn't it yes</font>

492
00:19:56,210 --> 00:20:01,880
so we did<font color="#CCCCCC"> exactly that and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this picture</font>

493
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:03,840
shows it we navigated is cmd.exe

494
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:05,340
immediately got a command prompt and

495
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,750
behind the command prompt you can

496
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:10,580
actually see the save dialog that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font>

497
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:14,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">referring to so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> awesome we have a shell</font>

498
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:18,539
sweet what can you do with it well<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

499
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:20,459
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know pivot yeah absolutely so this</font>

500
00:20:18,539 --> 00:20:22,919
user or<font color="#CCCCCC"> the user on this machine was</font>

501
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:26,070
actually a domain user and this kiosk

502
00:20:22,919 --> 00:20:28,110
was connected<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a privileged Wi-Fi</font>

503
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:30,450
network so this hospital had a guest

504
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:32,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">Network guess wireless network excuse me</font>

505
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:34,110
this was an attached to that nope as

506
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:35,460
attached right to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> privileged network</font>

507
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:37,649
so immediately had a domain user on the

508
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:40,980
pillage network from<font color="#CCCCCC"> here we're able to</font>

509
00:20:37,649 --> 00:20:43,949
you know put it so again just showing

510
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:45,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">you a closer or a zoomed in picture of</font>

511
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:47,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">the terminal you there are two arrows</font>

512
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:49,350
the bottom arrow is just showing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

513
00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:51,120
hey<font color="#CCCCCC"> look at kiosk machine and the second</font>

514
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:55,678
arrow<font color="#CCCCCC"> is just pointing to a reflection</font>

515
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:58,049
of me that has my visitor band on and

516
00:20:55,679 --> 00:21:00,029
then the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> picture here is from our</font>

517
00:20:58,049 --> 00:21:01,679
show we're pretty much able to do

518
00:21:00,029 --> 00:21:03,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">whatever we want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and I'm just</font>

519
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:04,980
demonstrating that we had the ability to

520
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:06,689
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> download and execute code and</font>

521
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:09,000
in this particular example<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm showing</font>

522
00:21:06,690 --> 00:21:10,830
the use of the putty client we

523
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,960
downloaded it executed it and from there

524
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:14,158
we were able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know leverage secure</font>

525
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:17,100
shell to help pivot throughout the

526
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:22,950
network yeah port forwarding is awesome

527
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:25,260
stuff so from there<font color="#CCCCCC"> compromised</font>

528
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:26,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">announced a medical device and you just</font>

529
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:28,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">continue pivoting until you find the</font>

530
00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:32,960
individual<font color="#E5E5E5"> or device that you're after</font>

531
00:21:28,649 --> 00:21:36,750
and you're kind of profit so oops sorry

532
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:38,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">another demo so could somebody kill a</font>

533
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:42,899
patient from a hospital lobby well the

534
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:44,789
<font color="#CCCCCC">answer is yes so just kind of recapping</font>

535
00:21:42,899 --> 00:21:46,649
what we did broke out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the kiosk mode</font>

536
00:21:44,789 --> 00:21:49,260
we've got a command prompts from the

537
00:21:46,649 --> 00:21:50,939
command prompt we were able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> download</font>

538
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:57,960
code and<font color="#E5E5E5"> from there pivot throughout the</font>

539
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:59,460
network we know the video and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> as we</font>

540
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:02,220
pivoted through the network we identify

541
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:03,980
devices compromised the devices and then

542
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:06,059
your ultimate<font color="#E5E5E5"> ly able to harm a patient</font>

543
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:07,889
this video is a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> different it's</font>

544
00:22:06,059 --> 00:22:10,350
showing actual barcode scanner so one of

545
00:22:07,889 --> 00:22:13,649
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> devices we were able to reach was a</font>

546
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:17,310
medical dispenser or medicine dispenser

547
00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:22,050
I forget exactly what<font color="#E5E5E5"> they call them but</font>

548
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:25,100
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to change the prescription</font>

549
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:27,770
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was administered to a patient so</font>

550
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:32,280
we've now demonstrated that from a

551
00:22:27,770 --> 00:22:34,530
remote a remote vantage point whether

552
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:37,680
it's across the street<font color="#E5E5E5"> another country</font>

553
00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:41,100
wherever and from within the hospital

554
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:44,640
but arguably remote you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to you</font>

555
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:46,800
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> induce harm to patients so the</font>

556
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:49,700
third attack<font color="#CCCCCC"> anatomy is strikingly</font>

557
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:52,159
different than the first two but it's

558
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:54,450
probably going to result in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same way</font>

559
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:57,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">i've noticed i said a result</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot in</font>

560
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:58,650
this presentation by the way anyway so

561
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:01,140
attack<font color="#E5E5E5"> anatomy number three social</font>

00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:27,540
you're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to carry out its really</font>

574
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:30,360
quick social engineering<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm sure most</font>

575
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:35,070
of you are but who<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not familiar with</font>

576
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:36,929
social engineering nice awesome<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

577
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:38,610
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> quick social engineering the use</font>

578
00:23:36,930 --> 00:23:42,150
of deception to manipulate individuals

579
00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:43,500
so that's kind of a politically correct

580
00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:46,080
way to put it but in other words you're

581
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:52,020
lying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to people to get them to do what</font>

582
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:53,730
you want so okay how<font color="#E5E5E5"> did this attack</font>

583
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:57,710
word well we decided<font color="#E5E5E5"> to actually</font>

584
00:23:53,730 --> 00:24:01,800
leverage USB devices as opposed to a

585
00:23:57,710 --> 00:24:04,830
fishing campaign yeah that's pretty

586
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:07,050
pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> much the main avenue for social</font>

587
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:09,330
engineering so we prepared malware

588
00:24:07,050 --> 00:24:11,040
infected USB sticks and we deliver the

589
00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:13,800
stick to the hospital and drop them off

590
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:16,770
in various locations we waited for

591
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:19,710
infection and then you profit so

592
00:24:16,770 --> 00:24:22,080
preparing malware infected USB sticks

593
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:24,060
here is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> picture of one of the USB</font>

594
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:26,010
devices that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually used they</font>

595
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:27,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">happen to be rubber duckies you guys</font>

596
00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:30,780
familiar with rubber duckies

597
00:24:27,570 --> 00:24:33,810
yes cool rubber<font color="#CCCCCC"> duckies really quick</font>

598
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:36,389
that's a tool developed by hak5<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hid</font>

599
00:24:33,810 --> 00:24:38,310
device to where there is a ducky

600
00:24:36,390 --> 00:24:41,550
scripting language which is ultimately a

601
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:45,750
way to interface with their devices and

602
00:24:41,550 --> 00:24:48,870
yeah delivering the malware USB sticks

603
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:50,130
so once we prepare these sticks how did

604
00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:51,540
we infect the hospital well we pretty

605
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:53,580
much walk in the hospital<font color="#CCCCCC"> just like we</font>

606
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:55,230
did when we access the lobby and we just

607
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:59,010
drop them off<font color="#CCCCCC"> in any location that we</font>

608
00:24:55,230 --> 00:25:02,250
could access so anywhere from a nurse's

609
00:24:59,010 --> 00:25:03,930
station front desk cafeteria you name it

610
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:05,430
any area we were able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to access we</font>

611
00:25:03,930 --> 00:25:09,630
dropped him<font color="#E5E5E5"> off and we dropped about 20</font>

612
00:25:05,430 --> 00:25:11,850
devices<font color="#E5E5E5"> off so now we have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to wait</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

613
00:25:09,630 --> 00:25:17,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">is the boring part but it always</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ends</font>

614
00:25:11,850 --> 00:25:21,780
with smiley<font color="#CCCCCC"> faces so you're right</font>

615
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:23,400
somebody else may<font color="#E5E5E5"> be smiling but yeah so</font>

616
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:26,580
we keep waiting wait wait wait wait<font color="#E5E5E5"> wait</font>

617
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:29,100
and all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a sudden thing we caught our</font>

618
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:31,350
first fish so within 24 hours somebody

619
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:36,600
had plugged in a drive<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's</font>

620
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:42,330
ultimately game over<font color="#CCCCCC"> wow what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

621
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:44,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">happened</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> another demo for you so</font>

622
00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:49,590
could a USB<font color="#CCCCCC"> flash drive kill a patient</font>

623
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:51,720
the short answer yes so as I<font color="#CCCCCC"> said we</font>

624
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:53,399
prepared these malicious USB sticks we

625
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:55,470
dropped him off in various locations in

626
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:57,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">the hospital some unsuspecting users</font>

627
00:25:55,470 --> 00:26:03,140
picked these flash drives up and in some

628
00:25:57,660 --> 00:26:06,330
cases plug them<font color="#E5E5E5"> in one or more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> times and</font>

629
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:07,830
from there it's exactly as I said once

630
00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:10,379
they plug in that drive we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have access</font>

631
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:11,879
to a machine pivot the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network you find</font>

632
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:16,080
a medical device or the patient you're

633
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:21,540
after and it's game over and I'm sorry

634
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:27,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> say but score bad guys three score</font>

635
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:27,200
hospital 0 or negative 3<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess</font>

636
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:35,520
so yeah you profit<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay examined</font>

637
00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:39,030
security aspects now we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk</font>

638
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:41,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">about the human factor this is</font>

639
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:43,590
interesting so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just talked about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

640
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:45,360
social engineering attacking out of me

641
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:48,539
and how you can leverage a malicious

642
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:53,100
flash drive to compromise a hospital and

643
00:26:48,539 --> 00:26:55,530
ultimately induce harm to a patient now

644
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:57,809
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to actually talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about a</font>

645
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:59,940
more benign payload<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was leveraged</font>

646
00:26:57,809 --> 00:27:02,700
in these devices and this was used<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

647
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:05,190
data aggregation so basically we

648
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:06,659
conducted a separate USB experiment we

649
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:08,700
wanted to<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how many people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> would</font>

650
00:27:06,659 --> 00:27:10,620
plug these devices in and what types of

651
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:12,000
individuals and when I when I say what

652
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:14,489
types of individuals<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm referring</font>

653
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,559
specifically to their role within<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

654
00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:18,809
hospital would<font color="#CCCCCC"> it just be you know</font>

655
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:20,789
<font color="#CCCCCC">healthcare protection practitioners such</font>

656
00:27:18,809 --> 00:27:22,770
as nurses or doctors or where we start

657
00:27:20,789 --> 00:27:24,629
seeing<font color="#CCCCCC"> help desk and maybe you know</font>

658
00:27:22,770 --> 00:27:28,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">higher level not technical engineers</font>

659
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:31,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">plugging these devices in as well these</font>

660
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:33,990
flash drives consisted of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> PowerShell</font>

661
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:36,750
pelo this was the meat of I guess the

662
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:40,289
attack and it required a logging server

663
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:43,500
which I wrote in PHP just essentially a

664
00:27:40,289 --> 00:27:46,020
very small concise server that leverages

665
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:47,730
a couple of API calls the log data and

666
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:50,370
we're going to gather<font color="#E5E5E5"> information about</font>

667
00:27:47,730 --> 00:27:54,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">the victim the IP address the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> username</font>

668
00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:56,370
computer name and device ID so here's a

669
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:58,949
picture<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the flash drives of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of a</font>

670
00:27:56,370 --> 00:28:02,340
rubber ducky those beautiful hie devices

671
00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:04,710
there's so much fun<font color="#CCCCCC"> here is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the attack</font>

672
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:07,139
payload<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was used very hard for you</font>

673
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:08,549
guys to read I apologize but<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's just a</font>

674
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:10,169
ducky script what's important is the

675
00:28:08,549 --> 00:28:12,658
highlighted part here which you may or

676
00:28:10,169 --> 00:28:15,600
may not be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to read but really all</font>

677
00:28:12,659 --> 00:28:18,240
that we're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> here is invoking an</font>

678
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:21,689
instance of the PowerShell web client

679
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:24,510
class and then calling<font color="#CCCCCC"> the download</font>

680
00:28:21,690 --> 00:28:26,880
string method on that objects and what

681
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:29,879
that's going to do is<font color="#CCCCCC"> just issue or a</font>

682
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:33,710
web request and it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to call my</font>

683
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:37,919
API with the data that we gathered and

684
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:40,020
here is the table of results so on this

685
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:42,650
table it's hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> for you guys to read</font>

686
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:44,879
we we call it several fish we had

687
00:28:42,650 --> 00:28:47,850
several<font color="#E5E5E5"> nurses plug in these devices</font>

688
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:49,620
we've had network engineers plug in

689
00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:51,060
these devices so some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> their core</font>

690
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:53,219
administrators<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> worked</font>

691
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:54,870
with throughout<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> course of our</font>

692
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:57,360
research yet they plugged in these

693
00:28:54,870 --> 00:29:00,060
devices as well as some hospital

694
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:02,879
executives so we pretty much compromised

695
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:04,020
all layers of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> hospital pretty much any</font>

696
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">department you would want to have access</font>

697
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:17,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">to yeah we definitely gained access to</font>

698
00:29:05,850 --> 00:29:20,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">it yeah the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Lenovo pcs yeah it division</font>

699
00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:25,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">of responsibilities so this is kind of a</font>

700
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:28,230
unique thing in that<font color="#E5E5E5"> not every hospital</font>

701
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:30,960
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> in this has this predicament but</font>

702
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:33,170
while we were while we were working with

703
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:36,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">some of the engineers in the hospital</font>

704
00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:39,990
they've actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> oftentimes were heavily</font>

705
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:41,910
distracted doing I guess out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them I</font>

706
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:44,910
don't want to call them meaningless but

707
00:29:41,910 --> 00:29:47,280
less important tasks such as resetting a

708
00:29:44,910 --> 00:29:49,590
user's password so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have individuals</font>

709
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:52,050
who<font color="#CCCCCC"> are combating malware infected</font>

710
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:54,139
machines who are then interrupted to go

711
00:29:52,050 --> 00:29:56,639
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Risa you know Joe schmo's password</font>

712
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:59,640
so there's definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> a discrepancy</font>

713
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:01,650
between what responsibility what is the

714
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:06,930
responsibility and whose role is

715
00:30:01,650 --> 00:30:11,160
responsible for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> responsibility okay</font>

716
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:14,130
so examine security aspects we had the

717
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:16,140
use of outdated software systems<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

718
00:30:14,130 --> 00:30:17,450
known malware infections missing or

719
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:19,680
unenforced security policies

720
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:25,200
undocumented systems and unregulated

721
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:27,120
vendors all of which led to disastrous

722
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:29,190
things that we'll talk about so the use

723
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:32,969
of outdated software within the hospital

724
00:30:29,190 --> 00:30:36,150
we found a large number of<font color="#CCCCCC"> windows XP</font>

725
00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:38,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">machines as well as windows server 2003</font>

726
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:42,900
we all know that server 2003 and XP are

727
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:44,730
no longer supported and pretty much<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

728
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:46,950
don't want to say okay lots of servers

729
00:30:44,730 --> 00:30:49,590
and workstations are missing security

730
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:53,450
patches that's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very polite way to say</font>

731
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:56,840
it so<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> quick</font>

732
00:30:53,450 --> 00:30:59,280
we I mentioned in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Windows XP server 2003</font>

733
00:30:56,840 --> 00:31:00,600
that's pretty terrible as attackers we

734
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:03,000
get really<font color="#E5E5E5"> happy when we see those types</font>

735
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:05,790
of things this has<font color="#E5E5E5"> nothing to do with</font>

736
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:07,560
the hospital but it could you could

737
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:09,510
arguably make a point that maybe

738
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:10,889
hospitals are a little more secure than

739
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:13,080
I don't know other industries such as

740
00:31:10,890 --> 00:31:15,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">airlines I was boarding an aircraft and</font>

741
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:18,810
happened to notice a windows 98 computer

not frightening I don't I honestly don't

752
00:31:43,050 --> 00:31:48,870
there are quite a few files that are

756
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:57,600
actually running a pharmacy within a

guess secure computing policies there

770
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:44,280
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> isn't a whole lot of I guess</font>

training that goes into informing staff

what they should and shouldn't do in a

using untrusted peripherals but that's a

know what<font color="#CCCCCC"> else to say so undocumented</font>

799
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:52,050
systems this is great<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we're actually</font>

800
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:54,389
in the net in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> hospital we were</font>

801
00:33:52,050 --> 00:33:56,430
performing a port scan we identified

802
00:33:54,390 --> 00:33:59,400
some outdated I believe<font color="#E5E5E5"> those like</font>

803
00:33:56,430 --> 00:34:01,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">davian</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> six or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> something some really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> old</font>

804
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:03,450
machine and we actually inquired with

805
00:34:01,530 --> 00:34:05,129
the hospital one of their engineers and

806
00:34:03,450 --> 00:34:07,290
we asked them<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know what was the</font>

807
00:34:05,130 --> 00:34:10,230
purpose<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this machine and where was it</font>

808
00:34:07,290 --> 00:34:11,159
located well unfortunately<font color="#CCCCCC"> they didn't</font>

809
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:13,710
know the answer to either of those

810
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:15,750
questions so this is exactly what

811
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:18,330
happened they they couldn't find<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

812
00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:20,610
machine so they had to literally trace

813
00:34:18,330 --> 00:34:23,399
ethernet cables from their server room

814
00:34:20,610 --> 00:34:27,139
to patch panels to you know to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the room</font>

815
00:34:23,399 --> 00:34:27,138
where<font color="#E5E5E5"> the server ultimately resided</font>

816
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:34,440
funny stuff so unregulated vendors what

817
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:36,540
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean by that well something I</font>

818
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:39,030
didn't know until I actually got into I

819
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:42,270
guess hospital security i'll call it was

820
00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:43,740
that in a hot within a hospital network

821
00:34:42,270 --> 00:34:46,710
there are several different departments

822
00:34:43,739 --> 00:34:49,168
an example all uses the pharmacy the

823
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:50,820
pharmacy from the hospitals<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we</font>

824
00:34:49,168 --> 00:34:53,250
looked at wasn't directly affiliated

825
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:55,470
with the hospital they're kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of like a</font>

826
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:57,960
contractor so to speak<font color="#CCCCCC"> so what happens</font>

827
00:34:55,469 --> 00:35:00,839
is these external contractors i'll call

828
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:03,570
them comes into the hospital the

829
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:05,790
hospital engineering team kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of sets</font>

830
00:35:03,570 --> 00:35:07,320
them up with an environment to deploy

831
00:35:05,790 --> 00:35:09,150
their computer systems and then they're

832
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:12,230
left unchecked so<font color="#CCCCCC"> to degree you could</font>

833
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:15,660
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the hospital acting as an ISP</font>

834
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:18,660
but what ends up happening is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

835
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:21,040
vendors end up dictating to the hospital

836
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:23,529
engineers how the network should be arc

837
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:25,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">heck did</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know what types of systems</font>

838
00:35:23,530 --> 00:35:27,160
and data should be<font color="#CCCCCC"> permitted through a</font>

839
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:29,530
firewall or through other network

840
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:31,779
segments and it ends<font color="#E5E5E5"> up leading to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

841
00:35:29,530 --> 00:35:40,690
very insecure environment for the

842
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:44,170
hospital<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a whole and I guess it what</font>

843
00:35:40,690 --> 00:35:48,790
boils what happens next what am I<font color="#CCCCCC"> trying</font>

844
00:35:44,170 --> 00:35:50,470
to say of the security issues okay<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

845
00:35:48,790 --> 00:35:53,259
yeah with the with these environments

846
00:35:50,470 --> 00:35:54,759
the that are deployed by vendors excuse

847
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:55,780
me<font color="#E5E5E5"> I lost my train of thought these in</font>

848
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:57,460
these vendors deployed these

849
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:58,870
environments the hospital takes a very

850
00:35:57,460 --> 00:36:02,580
hands-off approach once it's up and

851
00:35:58,870 --> 00:36:04,960
running they don't question anything and

852
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:08,529
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that the systems that reside</font>

853
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:10,330
on these networks end up becoming I

854
00:36:08,530 --> 00:36:11,950
guess subject to attack and in some

855
00:36:10,330 --> 00:36:14,049
cases<font color="#E5E5E5"> compromised as I demonstrated with</font>

856
00:36:11,950 --> 00:36:16,149
the malware infections and the IT staff

857
00:36:14,050 --> 00:36:20,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">just ignores them their hands off</font>

858
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:23,190
approach it's not their problem so what

859
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:26,620
do we do to<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of address these issues</font>

860
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:30,040
emphasis needs to be put on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fact</font>

861
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:32,950
that patient health is more important

862
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:34,570
than patient health records<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so</font>

863
00:36:32,950 --> 00:36:36,299
that's a big thing on<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of cases</font>

864
00:36:34,570 --> 00:36:38,500
today you'll hear hospitals or

865
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:40,720
manufacturers of medical devices<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking</font>

866
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:42,640
about HIPAA and you know other

867
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:44,919
compliance standards that I guess are

868
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:47,710
their core focus well I can tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

869
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:49,720
most<font color="#E5E5E5"> cases none of these standards state</font>

870
00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:51,880
that you know the health or the

871
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:55,379
well-being of an individual is a concern

872
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:58,350
there more or less concerned with the

873
00:36:55,380 --> 00:37:01,630
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the confidential confidentiality of</font>

874
00:36:58,350 --> 00:37:03,310
data talking about the patient<font color="#E5E5E5"> right so</font>

875
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:05,740
the health of the patient<font color="#E5E5E5"> is irrelevant</font>

876
00:37:03,310 --> 00:37:08,110
the information about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the patient's</font>

877
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:10,870
health is relevant so they're kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

878
00:37:08,110 --> 00:37:12,850
needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be like a paradigm shift as to</font>

879
00:37:10,870 --> 00:37:16,690
what is the focus or what<font color="#E5E5E5"> should be the</font>

880
00:37:12,850 --> 00:37:18,580
focus of security hospital<font color="#CCCCCC"> i key they</font>

881
00:37:16,690 --> 00:37:20,410
need to take<font color="#E5E5E5"> control of their networks</font>

882
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:23,170
from device vendors it should really be

883
00:37:20,410 --> 00:37:25,899
the opposite way<font color="#CCCCCC"> around</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are the</font>

884
00:37:23,170 --> 00:37:27,730
reciprocal of what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said can somebody</font>

885
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:30,910
tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> me when was the last time you</font>

886
00:37:27,730 --> 00:37:32,130
dictated to your<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISP you know what your</font>

887
00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:33,569
bill should be a

888
00:37:32,130 --> 00:37:36,330
or you know how much bandwidth you

889
00:37:33,570 --> 00:37:38,220
should have probably that's probably

890
00:37:36,330 --> 00:37:39,540
never happened and in this case you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

891
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:41,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">vendors shouldn't be dictating to</font>

892
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:44,610
hospital IT staff how their network

893
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:46,200
should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be ran and operated threat</font>

894
00:37:44,610 --> 00:37:49,110
modeling threat modeling is very

895
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:51,689
important ultimately it there we go with

896
00:37:49,110 --> 00:37:55,740
the ultimately it allows you to quantify

897
00:37:51,690 --> 00:37:57,690
the risk quantify the risk posed to an

898
00:37:55,740 --> 00:38:00,149
organization by identifying all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

899
00:37:57,690 --> 00:38:02,280
possible threat threat actors your

900
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:04,020
assets and vulnerabilities with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> pop</font>

901
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:06,900
with a proper threat model you're not

902
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:07,830
going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> prevent the ability to I guess</font>

903
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:09,720
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not you're not going to be</font>

904
00:38:07,830 --> 00:38:11,850
invulnerable to attack but you're

905
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:13,560
definitely going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> limit the damages</font>

906
00:38:11,850 --> 00:38:15,870
should<font color="#CCCCCC"> you be attacked and actually</font>

907
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:20,880
compromised and then finally<font color="#E5E5E5"> FDA</font>

908
00:38:15,870 --> 00:38:23,130
regulations are way too strict hardware

909
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:25,230
and software certification specifically

910
00:38:23,130 --> 00:38:28,590
some medical devices they have to be

911
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:30,030
certified and once they're certified if

912
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:32,310
any change is made to the device that

913
00:38:30,030 --> 00:38:34,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">entire certification process has to be</font>

914
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:36,860
gone through again and that's very

915
00:38:34,530 --> 00:38:39,450
costly to manufacture so in a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

916
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:42,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">often times they decide to ignore</font>

917
00:38:39,450 --> 00:38:45,330
security issues or ignore other types of

918
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:52,320
issues<font color="#E5E5E5"> unless they're forced to address</font>

919
00:38:45,330 --> 00:38:56,520
them hi hold on one second and yeah

920
00:38:52,320 --> 00:39:00,830
that's pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> much my presentation thank</font>

921
00:38:56,520 --> 00:39:00,830
you guys I<font color="#CCCCCC"> appreciate it and</font>

922
00:39:01,230 --> 00:39:10,290
I spoke incredibly fast so we have more

923
00:39:07,650 --> 00:39:12,150
time for QA than I had expected so I

924
00:39:10,290 --> 00:39:14,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">guess that's positive thing or negative</font>

925
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:42,510
fun so<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah I guess</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I open up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the floor</font>

926
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:44,160
to questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> once line yes so the</font>

927
00:39:42,510 --> 00:39:46,140
specifics of the certification process

928
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:49,020
I'm not intimately familiar with but I

929
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:50,279
do know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there you're right right so</font>

930
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:52,350
I know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there is a clause that</font>

931
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:53,730
certain changes are permitted without

932
00:39:52,350 --> 00:39:55,529
the device having to go through a

933
00:39:53,730 --> 00:39:59,220
recertification but if you were to

934
00:39:55,530 --> 00:40:00,510
address a let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> say one of those web</font>

935
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:02,939
boner abilities that I had discussed

936
00:40:00,510 --> 00:40:04,560
earlier in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> software and it produced</font>

937
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:05,340
a new firmware file I'm pretty sure

938
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:09,420
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to have to go through that</font>

939
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:12,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">certification process again what yeah</font>

940
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:12,710
right yeah

941
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:23,540
right yeah case in point

942
00:40:28,170 --> 00:40:34,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm not not interesting yeah no I'm not</font>

943
00:40:32,579 --> 00:40:35,960
familiar with that if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have more</font>

944
00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:45,630
information i'm not actually like to

945
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:55,339
talk to you about it so i am<font color="#CCCCCC"> not now yep</font>

946
00:40:45,630 --> 00:40:55,339
i dunno i am the Calvary yeah okay yep

947
00:40:56,809 --> 00:41:10,200
ok cool thanks for tip appreciate it any

948
00:41:00,930 --> 00:41:12,319
other questions yes can you repeat<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

949
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:12,319
question

950
00:41:19,850 --> 00:41:24,690
yes so they would be one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the vendors</font>

951
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:27,480
and actually I forgot to mention<font color="#CCCCCC"> that in</font>

952
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:31,710
this talk but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mentioned no malware</font>

953
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:35,160
infections there was one hospital that

954
00:41:31,710 --> 00:41:38,520
had a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Starbucks</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in it as well as some</font>

955
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:40,890
other I guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> food whatever and they had</font>

956
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:42,060
a cash register that went down the cash

957
00:41:40,890 --> 00:41:44,819
register actual had a<font color="#E5E5E5"> bunch of database</font>

958
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:46,799
errors and one of their the engineers

959
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:49,050
received a phone call from an ISP

960
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:51,690
actually and somebody<font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually being</font>

961
00:41:49,050 --> 00:41:53,580
d dost by this hospital and the hospital

962
00:41:51,690 --> 00:41:55,680
found out that they were compromised

963
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:57,360
because somebody called them and told

964
00:41:55,680 --> 00:42:00,270
them<font color="#CCCCCC"> the hey you're attacking me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> quit d</font>

965
00:41:57,360 --> 00:42:02,370
tossing me so their solution<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

966
00:42:00,270 --> 00:42:03,630
problem was to just block the outgoing

967
00:42:02,370 --> 00:42:06,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">ports with that machine they didn't</font>

968
00:42:03,630 --> 00:42:07,560
touch the machine I mean forget that you

969
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:10,439
have malware running rampant on your

970
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:14,480
network<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know so to answer your</font>

971
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:14,480
question<font color="#CCCCCC"> yes yeah</font>

972
00:42:22,050 --> 00:42:26,820
yeah so really most medical devices and

973
00:42:25,950 --> 00:42:28,529
<font color="#CCCCCC">i'm going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make it i'm going to make a</font>

974
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:31,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">pointer so most medical devices these</font>

975
00:42:28,530 --> 00:42:33,180
days you know are there ip-enabled they

976
00:42:31,410 --> 00:42:34,950
have the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ability to be controlled over</font>

977
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:37,049
network so to your point yes it's

978
00:42:34,950 --> 00:42:40,379
definitely<font color="#CCCCCC"> true now the devices that we</font>

979
00:42:37,050 --> 00:42:41,880
looked at were passive devices meaning

980
00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:44,430
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they were they were monitors I</font>

981
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:46,230
didn't actively you know administer

982
00:42:44,430 --> 00:42:48,210
medications although than that one

983
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:53,610
medicine like dispenser thing I talked

984
00:42:48,210 --> 00:42:55,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">about so yeah to your question yes there</font>

985
00:42:53,610 --> 00:42:57,810
are machines such as insulin pumps and

986
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:59,220
other machine like x-ray machines that

987
00:42:57,810 --> 00:43:00,630
are control over the network you could

988
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:03,120
definitely you know actively harm

989
00:43:00,630 --> 00:43:05,250
somebody the devices that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we looked at</font>

990
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:07,109
being passive we would I guess

991
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:10,680
manipulate the type of information that

992
00:43:07,110 --> 00:43:12,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">was reported</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to a nurse and the wrong</font>

993
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:14,790
type of medication you know would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

994
00:43:12,060 --> 00:43:18,290
administered but yeah any any medical

995
00:43:14,790 --> 00:43:24,090
advice you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> think of it's ip-enabled</font>

996
00:43:18,290 --> 00:43:26,220
any other questions over here yes I have

997
00:43:24,090 --> 00:43:27,720
no<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea I still don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think they know</font>

998
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:31,589
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was being used</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for but at least</font>

999
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:34,080
they found it yeah that's that's what it

1000
00:43:31,590 --> 00:43:37,730
was it ended up being a vendor yeah okay

1001
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:37,730
that's why<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

1002
00:43:44,260 --> 00:43:49,770
oh man I don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> any time is spent</font>

1003
00:43:46,870 --> 00:43:53,020
on security that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just my opinion I</font>

1004
00:43:49,770 --> 00:43:57,940
can't say that definitively but i would

1005
00:43:53,020 --> 00:44:04,900
say little to no effort at all any other

1006
00:43:57,940 --> 00:44:07,480
questions yes oh we're definitely gonna

1007
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:11,050
see more<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it so like a couple of years</font>

1008
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:13,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">ago</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean Soho routers have been known</font>

1009
00:44:11,050 --> 00:44:14,620
to be vulnerable<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a long time right a</font>

1010
00:44:13,060 --> 00:44:17,830
couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of years ago I had talked</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

1011
00:44:14,620 --> 00:44:20,620
them being incredibly vulnerable so have

1012
00:44:17,830 --> 00:44:21,940
many other researchers and what ended up

1013
00:44:20,620 --> 00:44:24,069
happening is we started seeing<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

1014
00:44:21,940 --> 00:44:25,750
malware targeting these devices there

1015
00:44:24,070 --> 00:44:27,370
was the the moon worm the moon room

1016
00:44:25,750 --> 00:44:29,440
compromised a bunch of linksys routers

1017
00:44:27,370 --> 00:44:31,839
they were using<font color="#E5E5E5"> a botnet we recently saw</font>

1018
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:34,600
this you know botnet that was made up<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1019
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:37,420
dvrs and a bunch of cameras I mean this

1020
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:39,700
is in the news like as of yesterday so

1021
00:44:37,420 --> 00:44:41,320
to your<font color="#E5E5E5"> question yes these devices are</font>

1022
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:42,549
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> continue to be compromised</font>

1023
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:44,260
hospitals are going to continue to be

1024
00:44:42,550 --> 00:44:45,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">targeted and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in a lot of cases I feel</font>

1025
00:44:44,260 --> 00:44:48,040
like it's actually going to get worse as

1026
00:44:45,940 --> 00:44:50,350
the focus has been currently<font color="#CCCCCC"> on getting</font>

1027
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:52,810
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> a hospital or compromising the</font>

1028
00:44:50,350 --> 00:44:55,029
health records of a patient but<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

1029
00:44:52,810 --> 00:44:57,279
actually killing people like we haven't

1030
00:44:55,030 --> 00:44:59,500
actually seen in a real<font color="#E5E5E5"> world somebody</font>

1031
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:01,600
compromised a hospital in an attempt<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1032
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:03,970
kill somebody you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know when that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> happens</font>

1033
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:05,410
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think people are going to have a rude</font>

1034
00:45:03,970 --> 00:45:07,839
awakening you know that this is an<font color="#E5E5E5"> issue</font>

1035
00:45:05,410 --> 00:45:08,980
that needs to be addressed so<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah I</font>

1036
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:12,340
definitely think this is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1037
00:45:08,980 --> 00:45:14,970
continue to happen any other questions

1038
00:45:12,340 --> 00:45:14,970
yes

1039
00:45:16,359 --> 00:45:19,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">Yeah right</font>

1040
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:36,460
great

1041
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:55,440
yeah I knew it was a multi-month process

1042
00:45:54,150 --> 00:45:57,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">I thought it was closer to like a</font>

1043
00:45:55,440 --> 00:46:07,729
six-month window but you said board as

1044
00:45:57,209 --> 00:46:10,319
well let's Wow yeah so in a lot of cases

1045
00:46:07,729 --> 00:46:12,180
network segmentation would reduce the

1046
00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:14,519
impact of an attack right it<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't</font>

1047
00:46:12,180 --> 00:46:16,558
make you invulnerable you can make a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font>

1048
00:46:14,519 --> 00:46:18,839
of these<font color="#CCCCCC"> systems unaccessible to an</font>

1049
00:46:16,559 --> 00:46:20,279
attacker but again<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would take with</font>

1050
00:46:18,839 --> 00:46:21,808
somebody to plug a flash drive into a

1051
00:46:20,279 --> 00:46:23,999
network segment you know that has a

1052
00:46:21,809 --> 00:46:32,630
vulnerable device and from there it's

1053
00:46:23,999 --> 00:46:32,629
game over any other questions yes

1054
00:46:41,410 --> 00:46:45,379
yeah it's definitely gonna depend on the

1055
00:46:43,670 --> 00:46:46,730
hospital right not every hospital is

1056
00:46:45,380 --> 00:46:48,079
architected in the same way and what I

1057
00:46:46,730 --> 00:46:51,530
mean by architected I mean the network

1058
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:53,990
and the servers but yeah it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna</font>

1059
00:46:51,530 --> 00:46:55,339
depend on the hospital but really what

1060
00:46:53,990 --> 00:46:57,020
we had found<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there wasn't a single</font>

1061
00:46:55,339 --> 00:47:00,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">hospital</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we evaluated that did any</font>

1062
00:46:57,020 --> 00:47:01,579
type of cross-network accident didn't

1063
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:03,500
have any type of cross network access

1064
00:47:01,579 --> 00:47:05,329
control so once you were on the internal

1065
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:07,339
network even though things were properly

1066
00:47:05,329 --> 00:47:10,220
sub netted you could just pivot between

1067
00:47:07,339 --> 00:47:13,670
the network's freely so any other

1068
00:47:10,220 --> 00:47:16,839
questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> no well thank you guys for you</font>

1069
00:47:13,670 --> 00:47:16,839
know coming<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my talk I appreciate it</font>
