55
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:22,180
that you basically create a persona in

00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:24,550
your mind of this person<font color="#CCCCCC"> and Morse code</font>

57
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:25,990
has a rhythm to it and that's part of

58
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:28,240
what makes you successful as a Morse

59
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:30,460
code operator is that once you adjust to

60
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:32,110
someone's rhythm I can pretty much<font color="#E5E5E5"> copy</font>

00:06:16,229 --> 00:06:22,099
threat landscape has really evolved

147
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:24,210
since i began working in the sock

148
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:27,180
predominantly in the past what we would

149
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:29,400
see is that the social engineering

150
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:32,729
attacks were very brand specific meaning

151
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:34,530
they would say<font color="#CCCCCC"> dear bank user of this</font>

152
00:06:32,729 --> 00:06:37,229
type of bank update<font color="#E5E5E5"> your account or dear</font>

153
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:39,320
subscriber to this service<font color="#E5E5E5"> etc we saw a</font>

154
00:06:37,229 --> 00:06:43,580
shift around 2014

155
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:46,490
where they started pivoting based on our

156
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:48,380
behaviors meaning today most<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

162
00:06:56,750 --> 00:07:03,500

<font color="#CCCCCC">Facebook Twitter etc amazon so the</font>

00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:10,849
persistent they realize<font color="#CCCCCC"> that if they</font>

that's the keys to the kingdom<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

169
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:23,260
eight dropbox sites and you can see by

170
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:26,210
2015 it had went over 250 thousand and

171
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:28,280
twenty sixteen to these numbers are

172
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:30,260
poured from this week over a hundred

173
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:32,210
thousand but if you look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> google and</font>

00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:35,330
this comprises the whole google family

emailed at us it was a gmail<font color="#CCCCCC"> account</font>

181
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:55,010
they got compromised so the numbers are

00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:57,520
really growing and what<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

vectors because their work email might

197
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:35,510
be secure but many users check their

social media accounts and personal email

199
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:40,490
at work and they often reuse the same

important for IT email administrators to

kind of pay attention to those type of

there's a reason external data sources

are very important when<font color="#CCCCCC"> we first started</font>

going to detect social engineering

226
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:51,880
would crawl the web but what we decided

227
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:54,680
to do was kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of flip the logic and</font>

228
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:57,529
partner with large email providers and

229
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:59,209
just taking their spam feeds so we will

230
00:09:57,529 --> 00:10:00,650
have the major email providers that you

231
00:09:59,209 --> 00:10:02,630
know today that offer free email

235
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:11,300
and then we would extract the fishing

<font color="#E5E5E5">URLs today because of the problem has</font>

237
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:17,089
grown so much there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot more of you</font>

know open source intelligence feeds you

239
00:10:17,089 --> 00:10:23,600
have non-government organizations such

240
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:26,420
as the AP WG<font color="#E5E5E5"> mog etc you have vendors</font>

241
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:28,010
that do email security or other type of

<font color="#E5E5E5">security that will actually sell you</font>

243
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:35,510

244
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:37,550
to try to expand<font color="#E5E5E5"> your footprint as large</font>

248
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:46,730
important to be active in the infosec

community as well as<font color="#E5E5E5"> your constituents</font>

250
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:50,750
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we did what we notice is</font>

251
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:52,339
that threat actors they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

target one organization what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you'll</font>

you'll find is that you'll be part of a

they they have all these<font color="#CCCCCC"> different tools</font>

259
00:11:10,339 --> 00:11:14,119
that are submitting information but what

260
00:11:12,499 --> 00:11:15,679
I find<font color="#E5E5E5"> when speaking to the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> analysts</font>

261
00:11:14,119 --> 00:11:18,019
that there's so much information

overload that they can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sense of</font>

263
00:11:18,019 --> 00:11:24,769
it so what we do<font color="#CCCCCC"> we don't use this</font>

264
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:27,170
methodology we actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> extract the</font>

00:11:24,769 --> 00:11:28,999
information categorize it and then we

266
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:31,149
process it in a different way<font color="#CCCCCC"> so that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

to just simple information<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

269
00:11:33,379 --> 00:11:37,790

<font color="#E5E5E5">intelligence is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the story behind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what's</font>

we<font color="#E5E5E5"> look through the emails we also do</font>

what we see in the CEO type scams or

other scams don't register a whole

288
00:12:24,459 --> 00:12:30,138
brand's name for look-alike domains so

289
00:12:27,529 --> 00:12:32,389
say<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'll use google google with 3 o's</font>

290
00:12:30,139 --> 00:12:34,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">with fire off and we would get the whois</font>

291
00:12:32,389 --> 00:12:37,009
record and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then we can then take the</font>

292
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:38,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">register on and do a reverse on that and</font>

293
00:12:37,009 --> 00:12:40,279
see all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other domains that they just</font>

00:12:38,389 --> 00:12:41,809
<font color="#CCCCCC">recently registered then we'll alert</font>

295
00:12:40,279 --> 00:12:43,819
everyone that hey you<font color="#E5E5E5"> might have an</font>

296
00:12:41,809 --> 00:12:46,339
attack coming soon so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the kind</font>

297
00:12:43,819 --> 00:12:51,829
of work that we've been doing to kind of

298
00:12:46,339 --> 00:12:53,439
get ahead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the curve here's a tip that</font>

299
00:12:51,829 --> 00:12:56,660
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna give everybody in the audience</font>

300
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:58,849
when you have users that are using like

301
00:12:56,660 --> 00:13:01,069
a microsoft office type client or any

302
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:02,779
type of client they'll offer full often

303
00:13:01,069 --> 00:13:04,610
forward you an email and say hey this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

304
00:13:02,779 --> 00:13:06,170
suspicious can you check it<font color="#E5E5E5"> out the</font>

305
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:08,389
problem when they forward the email is

306
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:09,949
that the headers are overwritten from

307
00:13:08,389 --> 00:13:10,480
the original message and now we just

308
00:13:09,949 --> 00:13:15,069
have a copy

309
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:16,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">there helps if you hit ctrl or f it will</font>

310
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:19,000
take the message<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is selected and</font>

311
00:13:16,779 --> 00:13:22,120
pop open another window with it as an

312
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,769
attachment so any user regardless of

313
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:25,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">their technical sophistication or</font>

314
00:13:23,769 --> 00:13:28,300
comfortability or whatever can do this

315
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:30,490
then they can forward you to information

316
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:33,550
and you can then analyze the headers

317
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:36,839
properly so i<font color="#E5E5E5"> always try to make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font>

318
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:39,939
our put this out to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the audience</font>

319
00:13:36,839 --> 00:13:42,160
malicious document analysis this is

320
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:44,920
definitely<font color="#CCCCCC"> something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we find very</font>

321
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:47,260
useful there's a whole row of my sock

322
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:48,339
team members and colleagues sitting

323
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:51,029
there that's why I'm kind of nervous

324
00:13:48,339 --> 00:13:53,829
because they're staring<font color="#E5E5E5"> at me but uh</font>

325
00:13:51,029 --> 00:13:55,660
it's it's definitely a new art form and

326
00:13:53,829 --> 00:13:59,079
<font color="#CCCCCC">um I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to reinvent the wheel</font>

328
00:13:59,079 --> 00:14:07,269
he has a good a cheat sheet that he put

329
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:08,649
together and has all the different tips

330
00:14:07,269 --> 00:14:17,850
and tricks for all the different types

331
00:14:08,649 --> 00:14:20,740
of documents so whenever<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm talking to</font>

332
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:21,910
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> intel analyst I seen this</font>

333
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:23,980
presentation many times where they say

334
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:26,290
the who what when where how why and they

335
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:28,000
actually apply that to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> threat actor</font>

336
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:32,290
what we did was kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of reverse the</font>

337
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:34,660
logic again and look at who's being

338
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:37,000
targeted what's the method<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they're</font>

339
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:39,459
targeting being targeted with when are

340
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,620
the messages being received this is very

341
00:14:39,459 --> 00:14:43,209
important because what time the messages

342
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:45,010
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> being received will tell you two</font>

343
00:14:43,209 --> 00:14:47,229
things it'll tell you one how much

operational<font color="#E5E5E5"> Intel the threat actor has</font>

345
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:51,519
because if they know your schedule that

346
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:54,910
every Monday you show up at work at 9am

347
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:57,040
vs 10 a.m. vs 8 a.m. and you receive

00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:58,779
this message<font color="#E5E5E5"> that has a sense of urgency</font>

349

that looks like it was waiting<font color="#E5E5E5"> over the</font>

350
00:14:58,779 --> 00:15:04,060
weekend etc they kind of have some kind

of insight<font color="#CCCCCC"> into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your schedule where the</font>

00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:13,209
important how are the message is getting

355
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:17,139
through you know most organizations have

356
00:15:13,209 --> 00:15:19,660
AV of scrubbing their email and uh all

357
00:15:17,139 --> 00:15:21,100
type of spam filters yet the messages

358
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:22,930
are still coming through because<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

359
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:24,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">threat actors have some type of</font>

360
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:26,500
knowledge of how

361
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:29,590
to circumvent the system and the last

362
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:31,720
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I find very very important to</font>

363
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:34,330
question is what are their intentions

364
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:37,090
what's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> endgame you know different</font>

365
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:39,280
deceit CFO he can authorize a wire

366
00:15:37,090 --> 00:15:40,570
transfer but what about an admin what

367
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:43,810
about someone the<font color="#CCCCCC"> security guard at the</font>

368
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:45,250
front desk if they're being targeted the

369
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:48,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">endgame for all of those different</font>

370
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:50,200
individuals it's totally different same

371
00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:51,850
goes for if you're a<font color="#E5E5E5"> software developer</font>

372
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:53,340
is receiving a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of social engineering</font>

373
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:56,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">attacks versus a system administrator</font>

374
00:15:53,340 --> 00:16:02,590
these are people that have access to

375
00:15:56,470 --> 00:16:04,150
very critical systems so you know you

376
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:08,050
collect collect all the information is

377
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:09,760
very important to conduct analysis so

378
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:12,359
I'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> just roll back to a couple years</font>

379
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:15,480
ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> we were initially in our business</font>

380
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:18,490
detection and shut down time<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the two</font>

381
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:20,500
primary metrics that all customers are

382
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:22,360
interested in alpha how much can<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

383
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:25,570
detect how fast you detective how fast

384
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:27,490
can shut it<font color="#CCCCCC"> down</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so you know we've been</font>

385
00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:30,100
doing it for a while<font color="#E5E5E5"> and customers are</font>

386
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:31,780
never satisfied with status quo so a lot

387
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:33,190
of smart customers are saying well what

388
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:35,050
else can you do for us what else can<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

389
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:37,150
get me what else can you give me so we

390
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:39,400
started<font color="#E5E5E5"> digging around and what we would</font>

391
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:42,520
find is trace trace evidence that is

392
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:44,170
left behind such as fish kit the domain

393
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:46,420
registrations like I spoke to the whois

394
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:48,099
records and what we started doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

395
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:50,410
actually picking through all of these

396
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:53,500
different pieces of information and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

397
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:55,000
would find<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this phishing attack was</font>

398
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:56,860
shipped the information to this email

399
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,170
address<font color="#E5E5E5"> where this type of phishing</font>

400
00:16:56,860 --> 00:17:01,960
attack will ship this email ship the

401
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:04,980
collected information to our<font color="#CCCCCC"> C forum or</font>

402
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:08,620
all different kind of you know formats

403
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:10,959
we begin<font color="#E5E5E5"> I started off just playing</font>

404
00:17:08,619 --> 00:17:13,688
around<font color="#E5E5E5"> and put it into a spreadsheet and</font>

405
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:16,540
what I noticed is that a pattern just

406
00:17:13,689 --> 00:17:18,579
popped out<font color="#E5E5E5"> apparently clear so then I</font>

407
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:20,170
spoke with another senior engineer i'm a

408

senior analysts that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was been working</font>

409
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:23,740
with me for about<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 years now it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

410
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:26,708
check this out<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm doing X Y Z and this</font>

411
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:28,240
looks<font color="#CCCCCC"> very interesting so we started you</font>

412
00:17:26,709 --> 00:17:30,990
know just playing around so we can do

413
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:33,640
and it was definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> something there</font>

414
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:35,020
perfect storm or the<font color="#E5E5E5"> stars align</font>

415
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:38,170
properly<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had</font>

416
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:39,940
to analysts who changed the shift so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

417
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:41,680
was working with them directly<font color="#E5E5E5"> we hired</font>

418
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:44,830
an engineer who had a background in a

gaming because gamers cheat<font color="#CCCCCC"> Allah so</font>

420
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:53,080
this guy had a very very his booth he

421

had a very very<font color="#E5E5E5"> good mind set of PHP PHP</font>

vulnerabilities and all kind of

423
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:58,810
obfuscation and just crazy things that

did then was moved from a spreadsheet to

a database and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> we began automating</font>

some of the collection of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

hacking into to see if there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a</font>

433
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:26,140
pattern there and of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course there were</font>

434
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:30,070
so what we would notice is that certain

435
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:32,470
sites had common vulnerabilities so

436
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:34,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">WordPress is very popular they pop those</font>

437
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:36,970
sites all day and what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> see is that</font>

438
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:39,310
this site would have a cherry<font color="#E5E5E5"> plugin</font>

439
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:41,230
this would have XYZ plugin<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then we</font>

440
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:42,730
would notice<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the brands that are</font>

441
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:44,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">being targeted matched up with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

442
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:45,580
different vulnerabilities and then we

443
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:47,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">started mapping them and we would say</font>

444
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:51,730
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the same person this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the same</font>

445
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:54,129
person etc and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason why this was</font>

446
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:58,240
very possible is because human beings

447
00:18:54,130 --> 00:19:00,160
have behaviors and habits I like the

448
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:02,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">classify them just for simply is like</font>

449
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:04,960
periods of activities and automation or

450
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:07,989
the lack of automation is a behavior so

451
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:10,450
we wouldn't measure things like if we

452
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:12,760
take a site offline how long would it

453
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:15,990
take for<font color="#CCCCCC"> it to come back</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> online or what</font>

454
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:19,390
another site appeared so for instance if

455
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:22,540
we would see<font color="#E5E5E5"> 50 phishing sites come up</font>

456
00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:25,660
and we would take them down if they were

457
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:29,800
back online in five minutes then the

458
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:31,870
guise of monitoring and automating the

459
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:34,690
deployment because it's impossible<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font>

460
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:36,340
that manually versus you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know you take a</font>

461
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:38,170
site down<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then two days later it</font>

462
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:43,379
comes back up or it repaired somewhere

463
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:46,360
else also habits<font color="#E5E5E5"> up whenever you Oh</font>

464
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:48,669
malware binaries there's text fields

465
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:51,158
inside of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> also fish kits</font>

466
00:19:48,669 --> 00:19:53,409
so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the Royal text you'll</font>

467
00:19:51,159 --> 00:19:54,909
see<font color="#E5E5E5"> that their speech patterns</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> though</font>

468
00:19:53,409 --> 00:19:57,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">the right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things in their native tongue</font>

469
00:19:54,909 --> 00:19:59,590
they'll use grammar mistakes they'll

470
00:19:57,190 --> 00:20:01,600
even just put weird things like six

471
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:03,789
spaces<font color="#E5E5E5"> or I was talking someone else</font>

472
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:05,230
they told me that<font color="#CCCCCC"> uh they had a guy he</font>

473
00:20:03,789 --> 00:20:07,809
would just finish everything with six

474
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:09,909
lashes or five slashes or something like

475
00:20:07,809 --> 00:20:12,279
that and these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sub conscious</font>

476
00:20:09,909 --> 00:20:16,029
decisions that people make just like if

477
00:20:12,279 --> 00:20:17,739
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> ever watch</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the poker wars they all</font>

478
00:20:16,029 --> 00:20:20,169
wear these weird disguises and do

479
00:20:17,739 --> 00:20:21,999
strange things because we all have a

480
00:20:20,169 --> 00:20:23,649
tail and what they try to do is

481
00:20:21,999 --> 00:20:27,369
obfuscated<font color="#E5E5E5"> their tell by just behaving</font>

482
00:20:23,649 --> 00:20:31,439
oddly because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's human human nature so</font>

483
00:20:27,369 --> 00:20:34,629
we just apply the same concept to

484
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:39,720
attributed attacks to certain threat

485
00:20:34,629 --> 00:20:43,168
actors humans also have limitations and

486
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:46,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">I divided these into one is resources</font>

00:20:43,169 --> 00:20:52,049
financial and operational<font color="#E5E5E5"> Intel it</font>

488
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:55,059
limits their scope and ability today

489
00:20:52,049 --> 00:20:56,230
being a hacker has become very simple

490
00:20:55,059 --> 00:20:58,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">and you don't have to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have technical</font>

491
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:59,830
ability and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> reason for this is there</font>

492
00:20:58,210 --> 00:21:02,049
is commercial off-the-shelf services

493
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:06,428
that provide<font color="#E5E5E5"> you with remote access</font>

494
00:21:02,049 --> 00:21:09,070
Trojan exploit kits etc they're all just

00:21:06,429 --> 00:21:11,289
paid for<font color="#CCCCCC"> Play</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> services but the personal</font>

496
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:13,149
limitations<font color="#E5E5E5"> are skill sets it's</font>

497
00:21:11,289 --> 00:21:15,489
impossible<font color="#CCCCCC"> if everyone in here is</font>

498

technical in some way shape<font color="#E5E5E5"> or form and</font>

499
00:21:15,489 --> 00:21:20,649
we know you just cannot go from being

500
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:22,659
interested in programming to an elite

501
00:21:20,649 --> 00:21:25,029
programmer and six<font color="#E5E5E5"> months I don't care</font>

502
00:21:22,659 --> 00:21:27,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">how many online MOOCs you do it's just</font>

503
00:21:25,029 --> 00:21:30,730
impossible also we're limited by our

504
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:32,439
imagination certain<font color="#CCCCCC"> information in one</font>

505

person's hand<font color="#E5E5E5"> is it's much more lethal</font>

506
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:36,850
in someone else's hands based on their

507
00:21:34,389 --> 00:21:38,549
level of imagination and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i also find</font>

508
00:21:36,850 --> 00:21:41,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's true when you're working with your</font>

509
00:21:38,549 --> 00:21:45,480
analysts and then lastly social their

510
00:21:41,859 --> 00:21:48,340
social circles will help them<font color="#E5E5E5"> level up</font>

511
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:50,109
very quickly if they're if they meet the

512
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:53,259
right person and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is true in any</font>

513
00:21:50,109 --> 00:21:56,168
type of interaction with people so this

514
00:21:53,259 --> 00:21:57,749
<font color="#E5E5E5">is another aspect that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we have to you</font>

515
00:21:56,169 --> 00:22:00,640
know consider when we're doing our

attribution

517
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:06,700
so these are listed some resources and I

518
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:09,790
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of divided them from most severe to</font>

519
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:11,380
least severe so if your<font color="#CCCCCC"> organization or</font>

someone<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you're working for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it is</font>

521
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:15,790
being targeted by exploit kits or a

00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:17,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">smash pass which is ransomware as a</font>

00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:20,350
service malware as a service fishing as

524
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:22,770
a service or even you<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying BGP</font>

525
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:26,500
hijacking this is very sophisticated

526
00:22:22,770 --> 00:22:27,970
elite status exploit kits and ransomware

527
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:30,040
as a service<font color="#CCCCCC"> and all these services are</font>

528
00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:32,620
very expensive they can range from ten

529
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:34,180
thousand dollars a month that we've seen

530
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:36,250
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know fifty thousand dollars for a</font>

531
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:39,160
quarter<font color="#E5E5E5"> because the return on investment</font>

532
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:40,870
is so high and the criminals that are

533
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:42,370
supplying the service<font color="#E5E5E5"> control the entire</font>

534
00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:44,520
infrastructure so it makes the

535
00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:46,989
mitigation process extremely difficult

536
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:48,760
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the the middle tier is</font>

537
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:50,920
criminally own where you'll have

538
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:52,570
bulletproof hosting which is where

539
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:54,640
they'll set up their infrastructure

540
00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:56,980
overseas and it's not really bulletproof

541
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:58,510
hosting is kind of like a misnomer<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

542
00:22:56,980 --> 00:23:00,640
myth it's not really bulletproof hosting

543
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:03,879
is that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> country where the hosting</font>

544
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:06,940
provider resides in has very loose loss

545
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:09,730
and the hosting provider themselves has

546
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:12,640
a very loose term of service so their

547
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:14,920
customer base<font color="#CCCCCC"> its word a criminal</font>

548
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:16,420
audience but when law enforcement of

549
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:17,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">anyone contacts them</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> their say they're</font>

550
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:20,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">not breaking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the law because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this was a</font>

551
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:23,050
this is within their terms of service so

552
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:26,140
they don't have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take action and also</font>

553
00:23:23,050 --> 00:23:28,030
they may own the IP space a criminal

554
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:30,400
abuse this is what you'll see very

555
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:32,620
popular where they'll crack sites<font color="#CCCCCC"> bill</font>

556
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:35,890
register sites or install malware

557
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:37,750
binaries on free hosting sites or

558
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:44,230
they'll just abuse terms of<font color="#CCCCCC"> service so</font>

559
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:47,110
last year there was a company<font color="#E5E5E5"> um that</font>

00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:51,960
allow free<font color="#CCCCCC"> register</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> domain registrations</font>

00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:56,139
for 30 days and they just went crazy

<font color="#E5E5E5">there's a subsidiary of two cows and it</font>

00:23:57,820 --> 00:24:05,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">was so bad that I can everyone petition</font>

565
00:24:00,850 --> 00:24:07,990
them to just stop the service so here<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">join together and start sharing and</font>

make the community stronger because our

613
00:25:54,090 --> 00:25:58,678
there's not really much guidance I try

614
00:25:56,730 --> 00:26:00,960
to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> for guidance before coming here</font>

615

00:26:05,129 --> 00:26:10,289
basically what you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do is md5</font>

619
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:12,840
everything that you obtain maintain a

00:26:25,289 --> 00:26:28,560
also suggest

628
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:30,150
that in the course of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your analysis you</font>

629
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:31,830
might have to modify files such as you

00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:33,720
have a zip file you have to unzip it to

631
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:36,480
see the contents once you unzip that

632
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:40,440

their legal code the time is no more and

<font color="#E5E5E5">profited upwards to 60 million dollars</font>

657
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:49,620
so times are definitely changing this is

from<font color="#CCCCCC"> august the first to bring all of</font>

660
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:57,840
work after we did our initial research

661
00:27:54,450 --> 00:28:00,000
and you know prototype in we really<font color="#E5E5E5"> had</font>

way up to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the CEO to get authorization</font>

664
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:07,860
to continue we had to speak to our legal

665
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:11,190
counsel to understand to explain to them

666
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:12,780
what we were doing and also get feedback

667
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:14,730
on boundaries and lines that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we should</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">not cross because once you get into this</font>

669
00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:18,990
type of stuff the rabbit hole goes

670
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:20,399
really really deep you have to bring<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

00:28:26,670 --> 00:28:33,030
the resources that we all use and you

677
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:37,199
have to have them play<font color="#CCCCCC"> ball with you or</font>

678
00:28:33,030 --> 00:28:39,360
you will not get anywhere to make this

679
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,090
type of program work first you need

680
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:42,459
permission

681
00:28:40,090 --> 00:28:46,090
like I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just spoke to have to develop</font>

682
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:48,940
protocols so users have to know what to

683
00:28:46,090 --> 00:28:51,129
do where it is what to do and who to

684
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:52,720
send the information to this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> often</font>

685
00:28:51,130 --> 00:28:54,940
confusing and many organizations where

<font color="#CCCCCC">someone say you'll speak to users and</font>

687
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:58,779
they'll say yeah I received these

688
00:28:57,130 --> 00:28:59,679
strange messages all the time you'll say

689
00:28:58,779 --> 00:29:01,150
what do you do with this like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't</font>

692
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:09,789
this is this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is helping our adversaries</font>

693
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:13,690
stay in stealth mode because<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have no</font>

694
00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:17,049
idea the<font color="#E5E5E5"> breadth of their attacks you</font>

695
00:29:13,690 --> 00:29:18,309
need procedures the processes and and

696
00:29:17,049 --> 00:29:22,750
you bring<font color="#E5E5E5"> it all together you create a</font>

700
00:29:27,909 --> 00:29:31,360

<font color="#CCCCCC">it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and process it and let you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know and</font>

702
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:37,899
also part of that is feedback<font color="#E5E5E5"> without</font>

703
00:29:35,049 --> 00:29:38,799
the feedback the users they feel like

704
00:29:37,899 --> 00:29:40,750
they're just sending the information

705
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:42,190
into<font color="#CCCCCC"> a black hole and this is from you</font>

706
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:46,779
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> my personal interaction and</font>

speaking<font color="#CCCCCC"> with them so you want to enlist</font>

708
00:29:46,779 --> 00:29:50,950
as many human sensors as possible

709
00:29:48,669 --> 00:29:54,190
because we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> tons of users they're</font>

710
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:57,279
all using different apps and services

00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:58,750
and chat forums and more things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font>

malicious content on all of these

714
00:30:00,610 --> 00:30:07,959
services so you have to connect<font color="#CCCCCC"> the dots</font>

create fake linkedin profiles and then

717

send friend requests<font color="#E5E5E5"> to all your you</font>

your you know threat landscape and the

<font color="#CCCCCC">cool thing is that a human being is much</font>

more intelligent than any machine

727
00:30:39,809 --> 00:30:44,770
disturbing patterns as humans we can we

00:30:43,029 --> 00:30:47,169
can look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> and identify patterns really</font>

quickly so<font color="#CCCCCC"> by bringing everyone into the</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">of trying to collect this information</font>

732
00:30:51,659 --> 00:30:58,900
you can really really get a good

733
00:30:53,860 --> 00:31:00,760
insight into your attack threshold this

734
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:02,799
picture right here I<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to bring this</font>

735
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:04,660
in because most IT people were security

736
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:05,950
people are introverts I'm an extrovert

737
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:11,559
so I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a problem with talking</font>

with<font color="#E5E5E5"> people however most</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> end-users look</font>

739
00:31:11,559 --> 00:31:14,440
like my son Adam when they're coming to

a security person<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tell them about</font>

744
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:27,070
really have to build bridges<font color="#E5E5E5"> with our</font>

end users and non techie people for

instance I'm all for you know brown bag

747
00:31:30,370 --> 00:31:33,760
lunches where you invite someone from a

from the admin apartment because only by

751
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:42,160
sharing information and making them feel

752
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:44,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">comfortable with the topic well they</font>

753

then begin to<font color="#E5E5E5"> understand that we're all</font>

754
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:48,520
part of the same team with the same

00:31:46,210 --> 00:31:50,679
overarching goal we have to make

756
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:53,020
ourselves accessible I me myself

757
00:31:50,679 --> 00:31:55,000
included I you know I managed to soccer

758
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:56,049
by call a network engineer the first

759
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:59,140
thing they tell me is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network is</font>

760
00:31:56,049 --> 00:32:01,120
fine or it's not their fault or the

761
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:02,890
security guys he didn't do it or he

762
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:04,899
installed this and I'm like dude I'm not

763
00:32:02,890 --> 00:32:07,390
accusing you or something I'm trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

manager I've been doing this forever I

766
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:14,799
can't imagine someone who barely you

767
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:16,418
know has a good concept of Microsoft

768
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:17,950
Word coming to tell you like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I opened</font>

769
00:32:16,419 --> 00:32:19,750
this document I think something weird is

770
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:22,480
going on most of the time<font color="#E5E5E5"> they won't say</font>

771
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:33,490
anything because everyone's afraid of

dark mall<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right any questions go</font>

773

ahead

774
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:41,600
how are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

775
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:53,649
I'm glad<font color="#E5E5E5"> you asked that question because</font>

776
00:32:52,330 --> 00:32:57,250
I kind of felt like I went through to

777
00:32:53,650 --> 00:32:58,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">quit so where my focus of my top is not</font>

778
00:32:57,250 --> 00:33:00,250
really trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't care what their</font>

779
00:32:58,510 --> 00:33:02,650
name is I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know what they're</font>

780
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:04,570
doing and<font color="#E5E5E5"> how they do it because the</font>

781
00:33:02,650 --> 00:33:07,510
faster I understand their attack pattern

782
00:33:04,570 --> 00:33:08,919
we can we can mitigate quickly I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

783
00:33:07,510 --> 00:33:11,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">to go into a little story I wanted to</font>

784
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:14,500
save time so I can talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> your thing</font>

785
00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:16,479
so we just recently had a very very good

786
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:18,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">example of what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can do with this so</font>

787
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:22,980
we have a guy he's been fishing multiple

788
00:33:18,910 --> 00:33:25,450
customers for years right he uses a

789
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:27,160
certain emails to collect the fishing

790
00:33:25,450 --> 00:33:29,790
forum you drop sites you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> collection</font>

791
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:32,890
point so we enumerated a bunch of them

792
00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:36,670
he was he was a what kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of sites that</font>

793
00:33:32,890 --> 00:33:39,820
he pop<font color="#CCCCCC"> WordPress he popped these</font>

794
00:33:36,670 --> 00:33:41,890
WordPress sites so we were through

795
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:44,250
investigation able to get access to the

796
00:33:41,890 --> 00:33:47,340
files<font color="#CCCCCC"> that he left behind on a server</font>

797
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:50,670
one of these files contained a list of

798
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:55,600
smtp servers with username and passwords

799
00:33:50,670 --> 00:33:59,580
those smt those passwords linked

800
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:59,580
directly to his personal email<font color="#E5E5E5"> accounts</font>

801
00:33:59,610 --> 00:34:07,120
see how that<font color="#CCCCCC"> works so not only</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do we</font>

802
00:34:03,970 --> 00:34:09,340
know his whole IT you know criminal

803
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:12,159
infrastructure we actually know his his

804
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:14,110
personal email<font color="#E5E5E5"> accounts and you know we</font>

805
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:15,700
work within an investigative firm they

806
00:34:14,110 --> 00:34:18,460
were able to log in and see all the

807
00:34:15,699 --> 00:34:20,918
transactions that he's been performing

808
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:23,320
he actually sells all the collected

809
00:34:20,918 --> 00:34:24,790
credentials for<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bitcoin so that's the</font>

810
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:26,380
type of mitigation you could you know

811
00:34:24,790 --> 00:34:27,909
step your level up instead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the</font>

812
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:29,530
whack-a-mole aspect of just shutting

813
00:34:27,909 --> 00:34:31,149
down site shutting down sights what we

814
00:34:29,530 --> 00:34:32,740
want to do is take them offline and

815
00:34:31,149 --> 00:34:35,529
we've actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> worked with law</font>

816
00:34:32,739 --> 00:34:38,319
enforcement in South America where we

817
00:34:35,530 --> 00:34:40,210
attributed an individual that he was

818
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:42,520
prosecuted that was twice in South

819
00:34:40,210 --> 00:34:45,250
America we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a bunch of Nigerian</font>

820
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:47,259
cases going on so I wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to I</font>

821
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:48,668
glanced over at MIT so I'm glad<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

822
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:50,230
asked that question so that's where I'm

823
00:34:48,668 --> 00:34:52,719
going it's it's not really putting a

824
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:54,850
face on a person or a name that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> great</font>

825
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:57,339
if you can get<font color="#CCCCCC"> to that what more</font>

826
00:34:54,850 --> 00:34:59,380
likely because of the laws<font color="#CCCCCC"> of their</font>

827
00:34:57,340 --> 00:35:01,390
country you won't be able to perform an

828
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:03,070
arrest but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can take them offline if</font>

829
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:05,379
you make yourself in your organization a

830
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:07,330
hard target don't move on to a easier

831
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:08,530
target just like a bully a bully doesn't

832
00:35:07,330 --> 00:35:43,810
want anyone that's going to fight back

833
00:35:08,530 --> 00:35:45,730
or stand up to them so yes we've done a

834
00:35:43,810 --> 00:35:47,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">lot of that so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll give you a nice i</font>

835
00:35:45,730 --> 00:35:48,400
was at a conference there was a guy he

836
00:35:47,170 --> 00:35:50,920
came up he's like<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> looking for you</font>

837
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:53,920
so I'm like<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay who are you he's like</font>

838
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:55,750
I'm from this Bank XYZ and I see you

839
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:59,350
guys are being<font color="#E5E5E5"> attacked by the same</font>

840
00:35:55,750 --> 00:36:01,090
people that are attacking us so we spoke

841
00:35:59,350 --> 00:36:03,819
and we just set up a data exchange and

842
00:36:01,090 --> 00:36:05,860
this guy<font color="#CCCCCC"> gave was so much insight into</font>

843
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:08,170
their operation that we really stepped

844
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:11,650
our game up I mean our learning curve

845
00:36:08,170 --> 00:36:14,080
went from here to there so he actually

846
00:36:11,650 --> 00:36:16,390
shared techniques of how he was able to

847
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:18,700
detect when they come online super fast

848
00:36:16,390 --> 00:36:21,730
we we incorporate it into our sock and

849
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:23,529
and benefited everyone and<font color="#E5E5E5"> also there</font>

850
00:36:21,730 --> 00:36:25,360
was two other organizations that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> had</font>

851
00:36:23,530 --> 00:36:27,550
relationships with that we brought into

852
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:29,350
the full and created you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know a cig a</font>

853
00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:31,450
special interest group real quick with

854
00:36:29,350 --> 00:36:33,100
the email thread and we automated the

855
00:36:31,450 --> 00:36:36,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">process of sharing all the detections</font>

856
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:39,819
amongst them we work with registrar's so

857
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:42,610
like a registrar that owns a country a

858
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:45,160
ccTLD country co registrar that they put

859
00:36:42,610 --> 00:36:47,830
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's like calm but shorter and what</font>

860
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:49,569
we do<font color="#CCCCCC"> is we send them the false</font>

861
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:52,450

862
00:36:49,570 --> 00:36:54,760
for their you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know ccTLD and they just</font>

863
00:36:52,450 --> 00:36:57,310
take them offline immediately so this is

864
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:59,320
that this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> where our goal is is the</font>

865
00:36:57,310 --> 00:37:01,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">incident response portion to shorten</font>

866
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:04,560
that window that they have the perform

867
00:37:01,210 --> 00:37:04,560
their illegal activity

868
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:19,349
so we we do use my mouth we we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> use</font>

869
00:37:17,250 --> 00:37:22,710
those plateaus<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have my legal account</font>

870
00:37:19,349 --> 00:37:24,599
that I use sorry about<font color="#CCCCCC"> that but um we</font>

871
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:26,430
have an automated system in a data prior

872
00:37:24,599 --> 00:37:29,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">Terry database that we built because our</font>

873
00:37:26,430 --> 00:37:31,080
detections are so large that it would

874
00:37:29,609 --> 00:37:33,299
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> would be difficult</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

875
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:35,130
graphically visualize everything but

876
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:36,720
once we find something<font color="#E5E5E5"> of interest then</font>

877
00:37:35,130 --> 00:37:41,640
we'll pop it into my OT go to take a

878
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:46,020
closer look at it because you know on a

879
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:48,049
day i<font color="#E5E5E5"> think we detect over</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 1,500 unique</font>

880
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:55,170
fishing cases a day and we process

881
00:37:48,050 --> 00:37:59,550
probably three million urls a day 30

882
00:37:55,170 --> 00:38:00,840
million 15 million<font color="#E5E5E5"> urls a day that's my</font>

883
00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:02,550
engineer he's going to keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> me honest</font>

884
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:05,820
today cuz<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'll just say like 300 million</font>

885
00:38:02,550 --> 00:38:07,619
but yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> i like you know 30 million URL</font>

886
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:10,260
so it gets really difficult at that

887
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:12,330
level to start trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you know bring</font>

888
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:14,070
everything in so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's why our goal is</font>

889
00:38:12,330 --> 00:38:15,810
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> bring everything in normalize it into</font>

890
00:38:14,070 --> 00:38:17,369
a database and then perform the analysis

891
00:38:15,810 --> 00:38:20,430
that's you know that's what I was

892
00:38:17,369 --> 00:38:22,170
alluding to in this the scene image with

893
00:38:20,430 --> 00:38:26,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">the basketball because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can become</font>

894
00:38:22,170 --> 00:38:28,640
overwhelmed with the information<font color="#E5E5E5"> any</font>

895
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:28,640
other questions

896
00:38:32,830 --> 00:38:53,480
good so the relationship I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> glad you</font>

897
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:56,090
asked that um it's about your<font color="#CCCCCC"> endgame I</font>

898
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:58,880
look at this is we're like a crime scene

899
00:38:56,090 --> 00:39:00,770
investigator right so if you coming<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a</font>

900
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:02,270
crime scene<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have the lead</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> detective</font>

901
00:39:00,770 --> 00:39:04,310
he goes through he's like yeah bag it

902
00:39:02,270 --> 00:39:05,870
and tag it get some prints I want you to

903
00:39:04,310 --> 00:39:09,500
dust<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want you to get this forensics</font>

904
00:39:05,870 --> 00:39:13,009
team one person cannot be all things so

905
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:14,480
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> instance if you know i'll ship</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i got</font>

906
00:39:13,010 --> 00:39:16,190
to stop doing it<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'll ship the URL</font>

907
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:17,840
attachment so you know the malicious

908
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:20,900
attachments to one of my malware

909
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:24,200
engineers immediately where you know

910
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:26,390
I'll have<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of my pen test analysts</font>

911
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:28,580
take a look<font color="#CCCCCC"> at the site i'll ship</font>

912
00:39:26,390 --> 00:39:30,350
something else off to someone else you

913
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:32,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have someone who has language</font>

914
00:39:30,350 --> 00:39:37,759
skills take a look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at this in translate</font>

915
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:40,720
so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is why we use custom platforms</font>

916
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:42,740
because there's no commercial you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

917
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:45,259
software that will do what we're doing

918
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:47,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">because our sock is unique where we're</font>

919
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:48,860
externally to the firewall we don't

920
00:39:47,390 --> 00:39:51,350
monitor anything inside the firewall

921
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:54,110
we're out you know this was a fortress

922
00:39:51,350 --> 00:39:55,400
we're outside with the bad guys taking

923
00:39:54,110 --> 00:39:57,410
them out before they can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

924
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:58,880
fort that's how that's that's the

925
00:39:57,410 --> 00:40:07,190
difference between our sock and a

926
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:13,360
traditional side I like questions give

927
00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:13,360
me another question good

928
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:20,250
to protect your personal brand I don't

929
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:23,600
want to be a sales pitch EEE but you

930
00:40:20,250 --> 00:40:27,450
really need to monitor your your

931
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:29,460
internet persona meaning you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you</font>

have to know<font color="#CCCCCC"> your domains and your your</font>

933
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:33,630

934
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:36,360
affiliates<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's very important because</font>

935
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:39,330
a lot of malicious activity can enter

936
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:41,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">your network through your third parties</font>

937
00:40:39,330 --> 00:40:43,350
as well you have to be aware if<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

938
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:45,930
receive a breach or if they have some

939
00:40:43,350 --> 00:40:47,819
type of vulnerability going on you know

940
00:40:45,930 --> 00:40:49,259
your affiliates but it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> being</font>

941
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:53,580
