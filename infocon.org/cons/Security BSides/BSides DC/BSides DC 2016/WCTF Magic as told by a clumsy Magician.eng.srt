00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:18,260
I had to figure dit out because I'm

379
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:23,630

382
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:32,090
a competitor and he's walking<font color="#CCCCCC"> right by</font>

383
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:33,649
me and it's going off and then as he's

384
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:35,990
walking away it starts the signal starts

385
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:40,580
going back down again he's replaying the

386
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:43,580
Fox in his pocket so now on my side I

387
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:46,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">have to every time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I see a good quality</font>

388
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:47,810
signal I have to not look at look around

389
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:52,370
to see that he's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not around so I know</font>

390
00:19:47,810 --> 00:19:54,409
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not him so I found the Fox and I</font>

391
00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:57,530
turned it off<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then stuck it in my</font>

392
00:19:54,410 --> 00:19:59,330
pocket and then went back in the room

393
00:19:57,530 --> 00:20:01,580
and of course the<font color="#E5E5E5"> WC TF team was</font>

394
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:03,230
harassing me the whole time oh you're

397
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:11,320
the other guy so everybody was still

398
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:15,110
seeing the signal for that MAC address I

399
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:16,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">can play dirty too but uh know how to</font>

402
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:20,389

403
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:22,100

SDR class so I had not done any Wi-Fi on

423
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:28,279
it get told by the pen to developer that

00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:34,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">morning that if i put my wireless card</font>

downloaded off a<font color="#E5E5E5"> hotel Wi-Fi in delaware</font>

432
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:54,649
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the box that warning from microcenter</font>

433
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:56,419
and and think that it's going to do you

434
00:21:54,649 --> 00:21:58,010
a lot of good test things beforehand

435
00:21:56,419 --> 00:22:03,740
know what it can do for you know how far

436
00:21:58,010 --> 00:22:06,799
it can see<font color="#E5E5E5"> things so I was walking</font>

437
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:10,070
around looking for the SDR Fox and I've

438
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:12,529
got my tablet I've got the<font color="#E5E5E5"> RTL SDR and</font>

439
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:14,990
I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got like this telescoping antenna</font>

440
00:22:12,529 --> 00:22:17,120
that's up over the top of<font color="#E5E5E5"> my head and</font>

441
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:20,210
I've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> like this booming great signal</font>

442
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:25,729
and it's the exact same signal no matter

443
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:29,270
where I am in the building so first Rick

444
00:22:25,730 --> 00:22:31,970
lets me know I'm an idiot because my

445
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:34,879
intent is<font color="#CCCCCC"> too good he's you can't find</font>

446
00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:36,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">something that's this small right in</font>

447
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:38,809
front of your face with an antenna

448
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:41,299
that's over<font color="#E5E5E5"> your head it's not good so</font>

449
00:22:38,809 --> 00:22:44,120
he sent me on a scavenger hunt for a

450
00:22:41,299 --> 00:22:47,210
paper clip we<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually unrolled a paper</font>

451
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:48,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">clip stuck in the end of my RTR TL</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> RTLS</font>

452
00:22:47,210 --> 00:22:50,210
dr

453
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:53,390
and all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sudden that that giant</font>

454
00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:54,530
waterfall I was getting wet and I was

455
00:22:53,390 --> 00:22:57,350
walking around<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it started getting</font>

456
00:22:54,530 --> 00:23:01,520
bigger and redder and i found the

457
00:22:57,350 --> 00:23:04,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">freaking fox with a with a paperclip</font>

458
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:06,620
stuck in the end so test your gear know

459
00:23:04,010 --> 00:23:09,050
your gear because having the proper

460
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:11,209
antenna a the proper crappy antenna

461
00:23:09,050 --> 00:23:14,780
helps you find the stuff actually you

462
00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:17,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't need the gigantic period log</font>

463
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:21,740
periodic<font color="#CCCCCC"> freaking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's you don't need</font>

464
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:23,540
them allegedly so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i went</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from literally</font>

465
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:25,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">nothing like when I showed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up at the</font>

466
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:28,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">very first b-sides I showed up with my</font>

467
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:31,250
laptop<font color="#CCCCCC"> and my charming personality like</font>

468
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:34,540
that was<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and then I started acquiring</font>

469
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:37,550
a little bit more and a little bit more

470
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:40,159
you can you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> participate relatively</font>

471
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:41,930
cheaply because the Wi-Fi dongles are

472
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:44,450
cheap the SDR like it's all in like the

473
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:45,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">18 dollar range so you can you don't</font>

474
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:47,390
have to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of them at the same time</font>

475
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:49,280
pick one and figure it out but you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

476
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:51,620
you can get<font color="#CCCCCC"> up and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> running with not</font>

477
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:52,610
considering the cost of a laptop<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can</font>

478
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:56,449
get<font color="#CCCCCC"> up and going for under a hundred</font>

479
00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:59,389
dollars so random bits and bobs that

480
00:23:56,450 --> 00:24:03,650
I've discovered battery packs are great

481
00:23:59,390 --> 00:24:04,940
because you're using your phone to go

482
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:06,050
around and look<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the foxes and stuff</font>

483
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:08,120
and if you run out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of battery you're not</font>

484
00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:13,129
going to find a fox so the battery packs

485
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:15,620
are great USB hub so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> rtl SDR that</font>

486
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:17,330
the the TP links the Alpha cards all

487
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:18,830
these things<font color="#E5E5E5"> when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you're so on the</font>

488
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:19,730
laptop when you've got like the porch

489
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:21,379
right next to<font color="#CCCCCC"> each other and you're</font>

490
00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:24,200
trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> shove all this in like the</font>

491
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:26,980
dongles are too big for the slot so yeah

492
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:26,980
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what she said so</font>

493
00:24:30,290 --> 00:24:43,040
I have never heard<font color="#E5E5E5"> that if you've seen</font>

494
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:46,879
my truck different radios so a thorough

495
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:48,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">Intel ralink different radios act</font>

496
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:51,410
differently and sometimes people are

497
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:53,480
specifically attacking specific so if

498
00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:57,380
it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> working on your tp-link switch</font>

499
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:58,910
over to your alpha card phone or tablet

500
00:24:57,380 --> 00:25:03,950
there's a really cool apps on the App

501
00:24:58,910 --> 00:25:06,350
Store pwned pads and or net hunter all

502
00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:08,120
those<font color="#E5E5E5"> things you can get cool apps to</font>

503
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:10,429
help you find things and then homemade

504
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:12,070
stuff so because I didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel like</font>

505
00:25:10,430 --> 00:25:16,120
always having to hold on to that a

506
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:21,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">paperclip on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the end of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my RTO I took a</font>

507
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:25,879
rp-sma to BNC connector and I hot glued

508
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:31,669
a paperclip into the end so now i have a

509
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:35,270
professional-grade paperclip antenna it

510
00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:38,840
helped<font color="#CCCCCC"> me find the SDR Fox's was in a</font>

511
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:41,389
tree for<font color="#CCCCCC"> Cory's class like we're in a</font>

512
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:43,580
park area and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> found it in the tree</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cuz</font>

513
00:25:41,390 --> 00:25:45,650
like when I when you're far away the

514
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:47,780
signal really sucks but when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you start</font>

515
00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:49,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">getting up closer like it it's it starts</font>

516
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:54,170
focusing in your waterfall start opening

517
00:25:49,910 --> 00:25:55,790
up like you're in there so there's not a

518
00:25:54,170 --> 00:25:57,080
picture from my first<font color="#E5E5E5"> be sighs DC</font>

519
00:25:55,790 --> 00:26:01,010
because I didn't take anything so I

520
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:03,110
can't take a picture of<font color="#E5E5E5"> nothing for 2014</font>

521
00:26:01,010 --> 00:26:04,760
that's my little cool set up there with

522
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:06,080
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little Pelican and Mike that's</font>

523
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:09,590
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> the laptop of the networking</font>

524
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:15,230
problems by the way and that's Dan from

525
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:17,959
the w CTF team he<font color="#CCCCCC"> has a USB hub with a</font>

526
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:20,870
bunch of antennas stuck in it so the

527
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:22,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">next year what do I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have I have a USB</font>

528
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:24,080
hub with a bunch of antennas stuck in it

529
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:26,180
because don't reinvent the wheel if

530
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:27,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">somebody he went in there and won the</font>

531
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:31,070
competition so why don't I just get the

532
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:34,480
stuff he's got to win the competition so

533
00:26:31,070 --> 00:26:34,480
my gear progressed

534
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:45,019
so now the gear<font color="#E5E5E5"> I brought to here today</font>

535
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:54,630
actually there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not enough laptops in</font>

536
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:59,850
that picture I actually have four

537
00:26:54,630 --> 00:27:01,590
laptops here so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> bottom right corner</font>

538
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:04,529
is now all the SDR stuff because I'm

539
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:20,189
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do SDR those are for Wi-Fi</font>

543
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:33,389
how dare you so uh there's AC cards

544
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:35,269
there's alpha cards there's the TP links

545
00:27:33,389 --> 00:27:37,979
get those really cool bags in the front

546
00:27:35,269 --> 00:27:39,750
with all the bungees and stuff because

555
00:28:06,389 --> 00:28:15,658
limit limitations do not do the 20 hub

556
00:28:12,539 --> 00:28:18,000
USB thing because your processor can't

557
