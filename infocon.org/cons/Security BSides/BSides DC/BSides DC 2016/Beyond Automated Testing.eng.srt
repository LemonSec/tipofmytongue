put this event together this is our

first b-sides DC event we've ever done

15
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:38,280
so we're really glad to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be here so on</font>

16
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:40,140
behalf of breakpoint labs<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm Zach Myers</font>

17
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:42,180
this is andrew<font color="#CCCCCC"> McNichol and today we're</font>

18
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:43,800
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk to you about how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to go</font>

19
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:45,239
beyond automated testing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and when we say</font>

20
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:47,699
automated testing we're talking about

21
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:49,320
your big gun vulnerability scanners and

22
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:51,360
things of that nature from an external

23
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:53,940
assessment perspective so let's jump

24
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:55,289
into this so here's an agenda<font color="#E5E5E5"> high-level</font>

25
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:56,460
overview of what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're going to cover</font>

26
00:00:55,289 --> 00:00:58,710
today<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not going to bore you and go</font>

27
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:00,120
dot x dot but essentially we're going to

28
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:03,320
talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the methodology and practice</font>

29
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:06,119
that we use in any external assessment

30
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:08,250
we also will kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of heavy in on the</font>

31
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:10,140
manual testing expect and why it's

32
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:11,520
really important so when you run these

33
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:12,960
automated vulnerability scanners you

34
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,030
don't just stop there and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then hand the</font>

35
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,740
report to your customer or just reduce

36
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:18,210
false positives from the automated

37
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:19,979
scanner you<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually do some manual</font>

38
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:21,539
testing and we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into some</font>

39
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:23,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">really good examples of how you do that</font>

40
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:25,229
and how you go above<font color="#E5E5E5"> and beyond and give</font>

41
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:28,409
them that actual great report that

42
00:01:25,229 --> 00:01:30,119
they're looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> for so Who am I like I</font>

essentially we're security geeks by

00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:40,408
nature we're red teamers at break point

48
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:43,530
labs there's our handle there for break

49
00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:45,750
point we're bloggers and podcasters and

contributors to the primal security blog

51
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:50,460
and podcast so feel free to check that

00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:53,220
out we just<font color="#CCCCCC"> recently released a new blog</font>

55
00:01:55,909 --> 00:01:59,310
we're certification junkies<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a way</font>

56
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:01,229
that we have a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> different</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">Python we love capture the flag events</font>

61
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:11,410
we love to mess with vulnerable VMs so

62
00:02:10,288 --> 00:02:13,030
anything on bone hub

63
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:14,440
try<font color="#E5E5E5"> and test it and try to figure it out</font>

64
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:16,720
create our own little walkthroughs

65
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:19,780
personally and collaborate with our<font color="#E5E5E5"> team</font>

66
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:21,220
members we also love to<font color="#E5E5E5"> constantly learn</font>

67
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:22,870
so anyone who's in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this industry you</font>

68
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:24,640
understand we're always at an uphill

69
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:26,200
battle we're always learning and

70
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,779
evolving and always trying to get bigger

71
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:30,369
and better so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> why we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> love this</font>

72
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:32,230
industry I'm learning something new

73
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:33,910
every day and I'm always getting

74
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:35,320
something from<font color="#E5E5E5"> other people so I don't</font>

75
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:37,240
know everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I will never claim</font>

76
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:40,209
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know everything Andrews famous line</font>

77
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:42,970
is what I don't know could fill books so

78
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:44,260
we live by that motto yeah and we also

79
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:46,840
like long walks on the beach and if you

80
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:48,820
do two or by the pier come join us at

81
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:51,030
knapsack it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> recent group that me and</font>

82
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:53,320
another guy from Lars started

83
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:55,510
essentially we just meet up it's a happy

84
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:57,970
hour meets once a month enjoy the third

85
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:59,890
Tuesday of every month in downtown

86
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:02,350
Annapolis it's just a network event we

87
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:06,760
talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> different things if you know</font>

88
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:08,290
you if it was recent you know as anyone

89
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:09,850
knows here dirty cow just came out so

90
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:12,040
that kind of kept some people up linux

91
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:12,940
admins at night and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know the like so</font>

92
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:14,590
we probably would've talked about

93
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:16,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">something like that but it's just a good</font>

94
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:19,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to get to know people and network</font>

95
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,070
and just have a beer<font color="#E5E5E5"> or two so overview</font>

96
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:23,010
so we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to share our experiences with</font>

97
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:25,480
external security assessments

98
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:28,600
essentially the motivation behind this

99
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:30,609
talk was pretty much frustration to be

100
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:32,799
honest<font color="#E5E5E5"> with you the higher powers that</font>

101
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:34,540
be always asking us when is the scan

102
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:36,790
done have you completed the scan how

103
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:38,620
often is the scan occurring you know we

104
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:40,480
hear this all the time is people working

105
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:42,850
in infosec where everyone just thinks

106
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,530
everything's a scan but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not there's</font>

107
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:45,910
much more to it and we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> kind</font>

108
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:47,709
of cover that whether you're a red team

109
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:49,770
or blue team<font color="#CCCCCC"> er</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I hope that you walk</font>

110
00:03:47,709 --> 00:03:52,000
away with something from this talk

111
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:54,250
automated testing when I say automated

112
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,980
testing throughout this thing and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Andrew</font>

113
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:59,380
does to think of<font color="#E5E5E5"> running a vulnerability</font>

114
00:03:56,980 --> 00:04:01,690
scanner because you kind of add a

115
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:03,579
definition whatever term you want to

116
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:04,780
call it manual testing is everything

117
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:06,790
else that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're going to do beyond the</font>

118
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:08,320
scope and going beyond that that

119
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:09,579
automated vulnerability scanner and

120
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:11,230
we're going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> pick up on that</font>

121
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:12,880
definitely throughout but I always think

122
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:15,040
it's a cool<font color="#E5E5E5"> little note Department of</font>

123
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:16,810
Homeland Security reported that

124
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:19,149
sixty-seven percent of high-impact

125
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:20,680
vulnerabilities actually were found

126
00:04:19,149 --> 00:04:22,900
through manual testing and not

127
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:24,730
signatures and vulnerability scanners so

128
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:28,489
I like the<font color="#E5E5E5"> land that point</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> special</font>

129
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:29,180
so how do you go beyond a scan first of

130
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:31,250
all you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right mindset</font>

131
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:32,600
and that's basically you're going to

132
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:34,850
fail a lot more times and you're ever

133
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:36,860
going to succeed as a pen tester you

134
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:38,570
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> perform recon mapping you need</font>

135
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:39,920
to find<font color="#E5E5E5"> your footprint you need to know</font>

136
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:41,599
what you're up against and you need to

137
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:43,910
find out<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the content that's</font>

138
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,680
available to you on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet you</font>

139
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:47,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">need to run these automated testing we</font>

140
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,250
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to bash automated</font>

141
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:51,739
vulnerability scanners every<font color="#E5E5E5"> single</font>

142
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:53,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">person in this industry runs them and we</font>

143
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:55,970
run them too but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need to run the</font>

144
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:58,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">right tool for the right job and then</font>

145
00:04:55,970 --> 00:05:00,350
you need to really go in and go in depth

146
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:02,240
with your manual testing and this is

147
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:04,610
where we<font color="#E5E5E5"> really want to understand and</font>

148
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:07,010
identify and fuzz all areas of user

149
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:08,750
input that are being passed to the

150
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:10,730
applications and the like on the

151
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:12,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">Internet we want to research the</font>

152
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:14,390
technologies and the versioning

153
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:16,990
associated with these technologies

154
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:20,840
sometimes it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a simple you know</font>

155
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:22,370
joomla version exploit DB and you find

156
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:24,169
out a lot more things<font color="#E5E5E5"> and a lot more</font>

157
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:26,480
vulnerabilities than you ever would if

158
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:28,160
you just didn't do that and we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

159
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:30,260
combine findings a lot of times with our

160
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,640
vulnerability scanners and we'll get

161
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:33,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">into this with a good example later</font>

162
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:35,930
they'll report several low findings but

163
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:37,640
if you kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of piece them together you</font>

164
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:40,760
can create the perfect storm into a

165
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:42,380
critical really big bad finding that the

166
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:43,849
automated vulnerabilities can I wouldn't

167
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:45,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">find but you could do with manual</font>

168
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:47,480
testing we also<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to remove the false</font>

169
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:49,250
positives and abuse all the features

170
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:50,960
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we find with these things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

171
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:53,660
internet and then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to take all</font>

172
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:56,180
this fun stuff we just<font color="#E5E5E5"> did and put it</font>

173
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:58,040
into a report it's our favorite part as

174
00:05:56,180 --> 00:06:00,350
being a pen tester<font color="#CCCCCC"> and any assessment we</font>

175
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:01,640
always love to convey everything we

176
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:03,050
found because but that's what everyone

177
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:04,849
pays for you know is the final report

178
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:06,980
essentially but we need to make sure

179
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:08,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we convey it to the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> business impact</font>

180
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:12,080
as well and know what keeps up these

181
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:14,000
firms at night so with every method to a

182
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:17,000
madness you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know you need to have a</font>

183
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,320
methodology a solid methodology is not

184
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,300
only good from a business perspective

185
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:22,640
but from that technical perspective as

186
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:24,020
well and you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to marry the</font>

187
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:25,599
methodology and what I mean by that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

188
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:28,219
<font color="#CCCCCC">you don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> need to go in sequential order</font>

189
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:30,020
when you do these security assessments a

190
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:31,310
lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> times you'll find something maybe</font>

191
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:33,049
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> your manual testing and then you go</font>

192
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:34,880
back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to recon so you don't need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to like</font>

193
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:36,930
just always do recon then automated

194
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:38,340
testing then manual testing you can

195
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:39,449
back and forth between these things and

196
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:41,789
especially if you're collaborating with

197
00:06:39,449 --> 00:06:43,340
a team you always learn new things so

198
00:06:41,789 --> 00:06:45,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's really important that you do that</font>

199
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:46,799
there's several great methodologies out

200
00:06:45,509 --> 00:06:49,380
there that exist these are just three

201
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,940
examples some checklist some guidelines

202
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:53,219
things of that nature feel free to check

203
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:54,449
those out and we believe honestly that

204
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:56,280
every methodology should not only

205
00:06:54,449 --> 00:06:58,050
include the automated testing but the

206
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:59,820
manual testing as well especially when

207
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:01,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">you label it you know as a secure</font>

208
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:04,710
in-depth security assessment or a pen

209
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:06,479
test so here's our methodology from a

210
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:08,310
high level it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably just like every</font>

211
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:09,630
other generic methodology but you know

212
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:11,400
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to cover these steps</font>

213
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:13,680
planning and scoping reconnaissance

214
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:15,448
mapping automated testing manual testing

215
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:18,870
reporting and then the icing<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the cake</font>

216
00:07:15,449 --> 00:07:21,479
the remediation support but<font color="#E5E5E5"> Before we</font>

217
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:23,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">jump into the planning I would like to</font>

218
00:07:21,479 --> 00:07:26,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">just say I think today in our industry</font>

219
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:28,470
we've become a hybrid of not only not

220
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">only having the hard skills but we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

221
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:32,009
to have the soft<font color="#E5E5E5"> skills because we have</font>

222
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:34,500
to convey our findings and our security

223
00:07:32,009 --> 00:07:36,690
assessments not only<font color="#E5E5E5"> at a detailed level</font>

224
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:38,370
but a high level that the high level

225
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:40,289
will understand the developer will

226
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:41,639
understand so I really just want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say</font>

227
00:07:40,289 --> 00:07:43,560
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that soft skills are very</font>

228
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:46,050
important in this industry so definitely

229
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:47,760
hone in on<font color="#E5E5E5"> those and make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that you</font>

230
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:49,199
convey them and just know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> every</font>

231
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:50,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you go into an assessment you have</font>

232
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:51,570
to have that mindset that you're going

233
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:53,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">to fail a lot more you're going to</font>

234
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:55,949
<font color="#CCCCCC">succeed and it's like hitting your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> head</font>

235
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:58,260
against a brick wall half the time<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

236
00:07:55,949 --> 00:08:00,599
planning this is where we want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to know</font>

237
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:02,159
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> our customers goals are right so we</font>

238
00:08:00,599 --> 00:08:04,110
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to establish the scope which is the</font>

239
00:08:02,159 --> 00:08:06,090
what we want to establish the rules of

240
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:07,590
engagement<font color="#E5E5E5"> which is the how we want to</font>

241
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:09,179
set up communication channels and we

242
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:10,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">want to set up the appropriate time</font>

243
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:12,000
frame being the who in the win if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

244
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,849
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't set up communication channels</font>

245
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,840
properly you're going to have a bad time

246
00:08:13,849 --> 00:08:17,909
it's just going to be a whole nightmare

247
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:20,250
with emails going back and forth and

248
00:08:17,909 --> 00:08:21,659
confusion of who to<font color="#E5E5E5"> speak to you don't</font>

249
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:24,289
want to get caught up<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the terms we've</font>

250
00:08:21,659 --> 00:08:26,639
seen this a lot with<font color="#E5E5E5"> our industry is</font>

251
00:08:24,289 --> 00:08:28,740
sometimes people will define things as a

252
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:30,389
pen test or an in-depth vulnerability

253
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:31,650
assessment and it completely means

254
00:08:30,389 --> 00:08:33,329
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> it sits in the eye of the</font>

255
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:35,218
beholder so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> really need to define</font>

256
00:08:33,328 --> 00:08:37,679
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and understand that in the planning</font>

257
00:08:35,219 --> 00:08:39,450
phase because sometimes a pen test means

258
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:40,708
exploit the systems if you find the

259
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:42,450
vulnerability and sometimes it means

260
00:08:40,708 --> 00:08:43,890
just stop when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you find the</font>

261
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:45,360
vulnerability don't exploit it so you

262
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:47,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">really need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to define that so you don't</font>

263
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:50,160
go you know and make somebody pissed off

264
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:51,029
or go beyond the scope and you

265
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,379
someone to figure out what's the most

266
00:08:51,029 --> 00:08:54,180
important thing what keeps them up at

267
00:08:52,379 --> 00:08:55,709
night<font color="#E5E5E5"> is it the confidentiality the</font>

268
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:57,839
availability or the integrity of the

269
00:08:55,709 --> 00:08:59,459
data if they say<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's all the things and</font>

270
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:01,440
you know I guess I'll just kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of go</font>

271
00:08:59,459 --> 00:09:02,819
about that with grading the impact but

272
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,589
if they<font color="#E5E5E5"> say oh man if I lose</font>

273
00:09:02,819 --> 00:09:06,420
availability and I can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sales if</font>

274
00:09:04,589 --> 00:09:08,670
we find something that deals with denial

275
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:11,180
service will probably rate that is more

276
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:13,439
higher vulnerability in the report

277
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:14,878
<font color="#CCCCCC">Before we jump in the recon I always</font>

278
00:09:13,439 --> 00:09:16,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">like to convey this and I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think it's a</font>

really<font color="#CCCCCC"> cool idea a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of times we'll</font>

just type things in Excel spreadsheets

time when you're collaborating with a

finding on the internet of their systems

or the vulnerabilities whatever you want

00:09:33,029 --> 00:09:36,689
to rank it and just go from there and

<font color="#CCCCCC">to land that points i'm a visual kind of</font>

293
00:09:41,129 --> 00:09:47,209
person some reconnaissance this is where

294
00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:50,040
we get to play detective<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's fun</font>

295
00:09:47,209 --> 00:09:52,229
essentially reconnaissance the goal is I

296
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:54,240
give you a company's name go find all

297
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:56,360
the bat now okay now a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of times they</font>

298
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:59,339
usually say besides the company name

299
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:01,050
they'll give you usually a<font color="#E5E5E5"> white list or</font>

300
00:09:59,339 --> 00:10:02,610
they'll maybe give you a cedar range and

301
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:04,229
say this is our IP space you know and

302
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:05,880
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> go from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there you essentially want a</font>

footprint everything and try to find<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

304
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:09,779
their things that belong to them<font color="#CCCCCC"> we want</font>

305
00:10:08,189 --> 00:10:12,089
to do IP and domain research with those

306
00:10:09,779 --> 00:10:13,410
utilities with search engines you want

307
00:10:12,089 --> 00:10:15,660
to do system enumeration whether it's

308
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:17,339
passive or active you want to do sub

309
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:18,660
domain enumeration and you can do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

310
00:10:17,339 --> 00:10:20,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">through search engines you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can do it</font>

00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:22,620
through<font color="#E5E5E5"> certificate searches you know</font>

312
00:10:20,339 --> 00:10:24,420
fierce is a great tool as well you want

313
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:25,589
to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that text akka numeration with</font>

314
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:27,149
applications there's tons of

00:10:25,589 --> 00:10:29,310
technologies<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> always in use in</font>

316
00:10:27,149 --> 00:10:30,329
collaborating together you want to try

317
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:31,709
and see<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you can get the versioning</font>

318
00:10:30,329 --> 00:10:33,269
information as well and<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's are some</font>

319
00:10:31,709 --> 00:10:35,008
good things you can use right there and

320
00:10:33,269 --> 00:10:36,420
you want to do your open-source

321
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:38,370
intelligence-gathering and that's when

322
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:40,380
you really are playing<font color="#E5E5E5"> detective you're</font>

324
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:43,319
you're doing the assessment for if they

00:10:42,029 --> 00:10:45,000
have acquired other companies recently

326
00:10:43,319 --> 00:10:47,279
that they may be forgot to address in

that<font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe that they do first initial</font>

332
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:58,740
so you're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to really play o sin so</font>

336
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:05,640
better than I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it</font>

what<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so it's not going to not many</font>

these port scans in the service

00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:25,349
just query it and look it up since this

349
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:32,339
it for heavy searches in its API if you

350
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:34,680
do active scanning we all pretty much

351
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:36,810
use n map here I imagine which is a

352
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:38,939
great port scanner service enumeration

353
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:40,500
tool you can use it<font color="#E5E5E5"> for many other</font>

354
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:43,530
different things it also has its

355
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:45,290
scripting language great tool but let's

356
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:48,030
say for example you're in a jam and

357
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:50,490
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> running a / 6 you run against the</font>

358
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:52,709
/ 16 see the range and that may take

359
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:54,990
several hours to get you back data well

360
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:57,420
try mask scan on your next assessment it

361
00:11:54,990 --> 00:12:00,030
may<font color="#CCCCCC"> take you only a minute and get you</font>

362
00:11:57,420 --> 00:12:01,620
results that are pretty comparable and

363
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:03,030
the thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's nice about that is when</font>

364
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:04,500
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> are in a jam you're going against a</font>

365
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:06,449
big range it'll pull that information

366
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:08,850
for you and there's not too much of a

367
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:10,740
variance in the results another thing

368
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:12,510
here we created<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a simple show dance</font>

369
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:14,430
searcher<font color="#E5E5E5"> where essentially we gave</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

370
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:16,020
the domain the top-level domain it

371
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:17,250
pulled out the cedar ranges here so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

372
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:19,530
is like it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a way you can use</font>

375
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:27,360
system enumeration so subdomain

376
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:29,520
enumeration you can use<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google you</font>

377
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:31,710
showed an use the search engines to try

378
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:34,350
and find subdomains off the main domain

379
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:36,960
of the organization you can use CRT de

380
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:38,910
SH and look at certificates you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

381
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:40,710
different various applications you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

382
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:43,290
use recon ng as a framework it's great

383
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:44,550
at doing all types of things and Jason

384
00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:47,189
<font color="#CCCCCC">Haddix actually wrote a script called</font>

385
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:48,540
enum all that Sh for recon energy so

00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:50,850
feel free<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use that in your next</font>

387
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:53,760
assessment and you can use fierce it's a

388
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:56,340
golden tool that basically does you know

389
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:57,930
Dina tries to DNS zone transfer it tries

390
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:59,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">to do brute forcing and enumerate</font>

391
00:12:57,930 --> 00:13:02,939
subdomains so it's a really<font color="#E5E5E5"> good golden</font>

392
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:05,400
tool to use text akka numeration this is

393
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:07,140
really important as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we're going</font>

394
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:09,150
against applications there's various

395
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:11,069
ways we can go about this if we want to

396
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:12,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">just go across a list or just do a</font>

397
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:14,640
simple request we could use a tool like

398
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:16,740
what web it's a command-line tool you

399
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:17,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically going to you know use what web</font>

400
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:19,920
to do a banner

401

versioning if it can write in the

00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:27,300
command line webalizer is really cool if

405

you use<font color="#CCCCCC"> chrome or firefox as your main</font>

00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:34,170
just a<font color="#CCCCCC"> plug-in as soon as you type</font>

something into the URL run line on the

409
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:38,130
far right will be a you can click a

410
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:39,839
button and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it essentially</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> give you a</font>

visiting right now on your browser and

414
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:46,440
any versioning information if it can

415
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:48,120
pull it I witness is a great thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

416
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:50,520
when you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going against a big</font>

organization or a list of ips or a list

this report where it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to try and</font>

00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:59,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">get that service technology information</font>

421
00:13:56,910 --> 00:14:01,260
from doing a banner grab and then show

422
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:03,390
you a screenshot of the landing page it

423
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:05,220
gets so you can kind of go okay well you

424
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:07,110
know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> their owa server here</font>

425
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:09,420
and that's their main site here and it's

426
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:10,770
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> SharePoint site and has a login I see</font>

429
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:15,750
just see default is at pages so you kind

430
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:17,970
of get an<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea of what should be your</font>

your key priorities to target at first

432
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:24,090
and then Oh sent this is where a lot of

00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:26,130
times<font color="#E5E5E5"> but not a lot of times a few times</font>

00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:31,170
organization right and when we do a

436
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:32,910
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of searching and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> digging we</font>

437
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:35,699
find that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's stuff posted on the</font>

438
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:37,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">Internet creds you know different things</font>

439
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:39,300
they've been popped and they have no

440
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:41,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">idea they just have absolutely no idea</font>

441
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:42,599
but no one has ever told<font color="#E5E5E5"> them and it's a</font>

442
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:45,120
scary thing so you always need to do

443
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:46,710
your detective work there you want to

444
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,870
try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to figure out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the username scheme</font>

445
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:49,980
and the handles of different users and

446
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:51,480
developers that work for these

447
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:53,070
organizations and then you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

448
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:54,810
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of creepy and you look them up on</font>

449
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:56,400
YouTube and social<font color="#CCCCCC"> media platforms but</font>

450
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:57,989
really what you're doing is you're doing

451
00:14:56,400 --> 00:15:00,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">your due diligence as an attacker and</font>

overflow and their kit hub and their

457
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:12,240
paste bin you can start to look and see

458
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:13,590
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> they actually post any code from the</font>

460
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:16,230
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> there are they asking</font>

461
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:17,490
troubleshooting questions that they

464
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:23,970
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> you find source code online so if we</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">go against open source technologies we</font>

466
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:27,900
like to pull down those different<font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font>

467
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:29,939
and try to basically make a lab

468
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:30,990
environment and see where can<font color="#E5E5E5"> we find</font>

469
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:32,190
different holes in

470
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:33,690
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> things in that server side</font>

471
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:35,220
code if it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually available to you</font>

472
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:37,649
online and not commercial if we don't

473
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:39,510
have it<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Andrews going</font>

474
00:15:37,649 --> 00:15:41,490
to jump into mapping now hey guys so

475
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:43,560
carrying<font color="#E5E5E5"> off with Zack talked about with</font>

476
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:44,880
reconnaissance we've built<font color="#E5E5E5"> our list of</font>

477
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:48,180
systems right so we start out<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

478
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:49,980
company name and whoever might be<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

479
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:51,569
we've got a list of systems and you go

480
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:53,310
to a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the pages</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you see default is</font>

481
00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:55,200
stuff because you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> going by IP not by</font>

482
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:57,540
domain and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next step</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> figure</font>

483
00:15:55,200 --> 00:16:00,540
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> what's actually all there because</font>

484
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:02,339
there can be a lot so because we're

485
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:03,810
talking about external assessments we do

486
00:16:02,339 --> 00:16:05,550
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's a lot of web application</font>

487
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:07,050
stuff so mapping is kind of specific to

488
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:08,370
that but you can look at it<font color="#E5E5E5"> as just</font>

489
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:10,020
learning more about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the technology</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

490
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:12,630
defining what's there regardless of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

491
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:14,339
service or protocol but with regards to

492
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:16,020
web applications<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's kind of broken</font>

493
00:16:14,339 --> 00:16:17,640
down to two main ways you have spidering

494
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:19,439
which is you know crawling the links<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

495
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:21,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">the site all those hrs what it wants you</font>

496
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:24,270
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see and you have unlinked content</font>

497
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:25,500
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a land of treasure for us as</font>

498
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:27,089
pen testers and that relies on brute

499
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:28,830
force techniques you know requesting the

500
00:16:27,089 --> 00:16:30,360
resources see if it's there<font color="#CCCCCC"> and look at</font>

501
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:33,209
the status code or the response length

502
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:34,560
and checking it out the other important

503
00:16:33,209 --> 00:16:36,270
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do is we I just see a lot of</font>

504
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:38,630
like junior pen testers do this a lot of

505
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:40,860
your adult judge and I system by its IP

506
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:42,930
you know when we talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about you know you</font>

507
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:44,339
could put your IP in the browser shows

508
00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:46,229
you back very little you might need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

509
00:16:44,339 --> 00:16:47,640
actually know with the the contents

510
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:49,079
living that unlink directory or you may

511
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:50,579
need to reference it by the domain names

512
00:16:49,079 --> 00:16:51,750
like virtual hosting<font color="#CCCCCC"> socially important</font>

513
00:16:50,579 --> 00:16:54,060
things to keep it<font color="#E5E5E5"> out when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we switch</font>

514
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:56,459
<font color="#CCCCCC">from the port scanning option which is</font>

515
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:57,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">more ip-based to the application mapping</font>

516
00:16:56,459 --> 00:17:00,810
which is more a lot of times<font color="#E5E5E5"> Devane</font>

517
00:16:57,690 --> 00:17:02,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">based this is just a quick look at</font>

518
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:03,899
spidering burps our bread and butter

519
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:05,760
tool for a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the stuff we do with</font>

520
00:17:03,899 --> 00:17:07,470
external assessments pretty easy to do

521
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:09,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">right-click spider not going to send a</font>

522
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:11,490
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of time there sitemaps pretty nice</font>

523
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:13,920
we will however talk about some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of burps</font>

524
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:16,109
additional features which going to like

525
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:17,579
the pro version but Brooks pretty cheap

526
00:17:16,109 --> 00:17:20,129
so if your pen test you should probably

527
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:21,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">have burps pro version anyway intruder</font>

528
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:23,490
is really nice intruder can be used for

529
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:24,899
fuzzing we'll talk about later but also

530
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:26,250
for unlike content enumeration because

531
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:27,959
all it does is basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> rapid-fire</font>

532
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:30,360
requests for you based on what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you set</font>

533
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:32,790
up I<font color="#CCCCCC"> use sniper or logic because it's a</font>

534
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:35,040
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> good for the unlink concentration</font>

535
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:37,170
burp also has a discover content feature

536
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:39,149
which tries to dynamically find this

537
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:41,640
content you<font color="#CCCCCC"> also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure you</font>

538
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:43,350
check out web services the ? Wizzle

539
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:44,550
there's other tools out there soap UI

540
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:46,709
for that specific

541
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:48,210
me with all these techniques though you

542
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:50,370
rely<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the brute force method</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

543
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:52,020
mentioned and it's heavily<font color="#E5E5E5"> depend upon</font>

544
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:54,929
your word list I really like the robots

545
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:57,690
disallowed which is the top entries for

546
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:59,070
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> Alexa 100</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> powder k sites and then</font>

547
00:17:57,690 --> 00:18:00,510
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> also set list which has a bunch</font>

548
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:02,129
of good stuff including raft list which

549
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:04,830
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> like an older project that did the</font>

00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:06,360
top<font color="#CCCCCC"> alexa</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 1000 robots at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> x but there's a</font>

551
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:07,740
lot of good<font color="#E5E5E5"> word lists in there and I if</font>

552
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:09,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">you run these things against your</font>

553
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:12,390
applications in your enterprise even if

<font color="#E5E5E5">you're a security guy doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Bolin scans</font>

555
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:17,010
you will find cool stuff I found resumes

556
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,180
with hundreds of thousands of Social

557
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:19,740
Security<font color="#E5E5E5"> numbers just because it was</font>

558
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:21,780
unlink hanging off web directory that

559
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:23,790
nobody knew about so you know little

560
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:27,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">things like that unlike content can be a</font>

561
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:28,470
gold mine now for automated testing

562
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:29,730
we're not going to spend<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of time</font>

563
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:31,020
here with this we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to assume you</font>

564
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:33,660
can do the scan button click the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Scan</font>

565
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:34,800
button what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> say is that it's</font>

566
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:36,000
important<font color="#E5E5E5"> to run that right tool for the</font>

568
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,530
that's really key because what I see a

569
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:41,879
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of times is people will rely on one</font>

570
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:43,710
or<font color="#CCCCCC"> two sets of tools to do their big</font>

571
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:45,270
guns vulnerability scans when I say that

00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:46,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">is I have organizations at just use</font>

00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:49,409
network one ability scanning but it

575
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,930
doesn't address web apps very well at

576
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:53,190
all or they'll just use web inspect and

577
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:54,420
they just you know if it passes the web

578
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:56,610
inspect scan and the web inspect doesn't

579
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:57,690
have any red stuff then we're good but

580
00:18:56,610 --> 00:18:59,100
what if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to give us a wordpress</font>

581
00:18:57,690 --> 00:19:00,930
site you don't confirm if you want to

582
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:02,370
run like WP scan which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a script</font>

583
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:04,020
that it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find you a lot better</font>

584
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:05,310
data so just understand the technology

585
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:06,360
you're running against and making sure

586
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:07,590
you're running the appropriate tool

587
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:09,540
because there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of times there's</font>

588
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:11,250
these CMS scanners out there that are a

589
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:13,500
lot better to identifying these specific

590
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:15,510
vulnerabilities but a<font color="#E5E5E5"> few</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> keep</font>

591
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:16,620
in mind you know Kim miss stuff it can

592
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:18,720
break stuff I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know if you've ever</font>

593
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:21,629
you know run at scan and getting some

594
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:23,130
503 service unavailable or it can take a

595
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:24,420
long<font color="#CCCCCC"> time have you pulled</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up a web</font>

596
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:26,610
inspect scan it says it's going to take

597
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:28,830
53 days I don't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> that long time in</font>

598
00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:29,850
the to wait for it sometimes automated

00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:31,800
testing<font color="#E5E5E5"> just isn't going to be the</font>

600
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:34,379
solution<font color="#E5E5E5"> for you have to fall back to</font>

601
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:36,030
your manual testing which is the next

602
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:37,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">portion of the talk we're actually going</font>

603
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:39,210
to run<font color="#CCCCCC"> into a quick overview of manual</font>

604
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:40,649
testing and dive into some examples that

605
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:42,960
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of illustrate what we're talking</font>

606
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:44,910
about we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have five examples so but for</font>

607
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,680
us manual testing is about these four

608
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:48,060
main things kind of broken down on<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

609
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:49,620
high level we kind of talked about them

610
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:51,870
a little bit already but the<font color="#CCCCCC"> big thing</font>

611
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:54,209
is you know identify all the areas of

612
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:55,500
user input these are we call injection

613
00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:56,670
points and we want to fuzz them you know

614
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:58,380
we like to use burps intruder for that

615
00:19:56,670 --> 00:20:00,720
you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to also identify</font>

616
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:02,310
any features and have used them like an

617
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:04,080
attacker I'm a big advocate of like

618
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:05,790
feature abuse when we talk about pen

619
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:08,010
testing and hacking what I mean by that

620
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:09,360
is I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a login page how can</font>

621
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:10,530
I views that feature well maybe there's

622
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:13,139
a password<font color="#CCCCCC"> reset and I can get username</font>

623
00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:14,940
enumeration we have a file upload for an

624
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:16,260
avatar maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can upload a shell it's</font>

625
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:18,180
essentially trying to figure out what

626
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:19,410
does<font color="#E5E5E5"> this technology let you do and then</font>

627
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:21,240
what could it an attacker do with that

628
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:23,640
feature and you can use your mind map to

629
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:24,960
kind of map that out for you you also

630
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:26,280
want to find the systems and content

631
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:28,320
that others have missed because you

632
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:29,820
can't test what you don't know about we

633
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">get a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of wins on our pen test not</font>

634
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:32,429
because they were like super cool

635
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:33,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">O'Day's crazy stuff but a lot of times</font>

636
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:35,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">just because you know oh I didn't know</font>

637
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:38,070
that that directory had stuff from 1999

638
00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:39,570
PHP code from a 99 last pen test I got

639
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:41,879
code execution across the enterprise

640
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:44,040
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> a PHP code was living in some</font>

641
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:45,600
weird directory from 1999 I got<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

642
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:47,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">excited copyright night and I was like</font>

643
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:49,139
oh yeah yes but<font color="#CCCCCC"> um you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know so it</font>

644
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:50,250
doesn't have to be some crazy just have

645
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:51,540
to find what's there that was on the

646
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:53,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">internet you know just you just have to</font>

647
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:54,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">look for it and then continue to ask</font>

648
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:56,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">yourself what happens if I try this you</font>

649
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:57,300
have to be creative I think like we go

650
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:58,740
back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the whole</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing we're gonna fail</font>

651
00:20:57,300 --> 00:21:00,899
thousand times you have to keep<font color="#CCCCCC"> asking</font>

652
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:02,100
yourself because it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very easy to say</font>

653
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:04,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">something's not vulnerable and go back</font>

654
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:05,969
to Facebook or YouTube and as a tester

655
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:07,950
we need to like isolate ourselves and

656
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:10,380
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the zone and do that John wick</font>

657
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:13,200
you know mode and keep<font color="#CCCCCC"> asking yourself</font>

658
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:15,690
these questions here is another example

659
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,980
of how you<font color="#E5E5E5"> might identify how your</font>

660
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:18,720
inputs being leveraged to fuzz

661
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:20,310
appropriately this does not cover all

662
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,630
vulnerabilities but to cover some some

663
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:23,610
pretty pretty pretty high ones pretty

664
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:25,140
common one so is your input landing on

665
00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:26,129
the screen<font color="#E5E5E5"> right that that's something</font>

666
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:27,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm going to look at that and say if my</font>

667

inputs on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the screen I'm a test for XSS</font>

668
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:30,720
you know script alert script and work

669
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:32,250
maybe a<font color="#E5E5E5"> JavaScript event handler I</font>

670
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,930
didn't work all right then I'll throw it

671
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:36,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">at burp and I'll use like a custom</font>

couple of these a file inclusion example

681
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:52,860
really cool but<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is exactly just</font>

682
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,360
essentially start to think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about how</font>

683
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:55,800
your inputs being used so you can fuzz

684
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:56,939
appropriately you're not just like

685
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:58,020
throwing random listed stuff you're

686
00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:02,100
trying to actually figure out<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay how</font>

687
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:03,720
can I misuse it as I mentioned burps are

688
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:06,120
go to<font color="#E5E5E5"> bread-and-butter tool for fuzzing</font>

689
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:07,170
this is a screenshot of burp intruder if

690
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:08,879
you've never used it you basically

691
00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:10,860
define injection points inside the

692
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:12,570
request and then you can later set your

693
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:14,729
word<font color="#E5E5E5"> list for those ejection points</font>

694
00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:16,439
as I mentioned fuzz DB cyclists have got

695
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:18,750
some good options for<font color="#E5E5E5"> you burp s and</font>

696
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:20,159
built in ones as well but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the big thing</font>

697
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:21,509
is just understanding you know how<font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font>

698
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:24,000
the inputs being used so you can you

699
00:22:21,509 --> 00:22:26,130
know misuse appropriately and if you're

700
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,990
not using burp pro entry was going to

701
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:28,980
run<font color="#E5E5E5"> really slow and drive you nuts and</font>

702
00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:32,450
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably not gonna want to use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

703
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:35,460
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> for pro is expensive so all right</font>

704
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:36,990
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> now this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the moment where we're</font>

705
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:38,250
going to get really into what we're

706
00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:40,710
going to talk about Andrew might like

707
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:42,210
break a sweat you might go crazy but

708
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:45,330
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to really go over five cool</font>

709
00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:47,759
manual testing techniques of how you can

710
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:48,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">go above and beyond automated testing so</font>

00:22:47,759 --> 00:22:51,269
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is when we're going in our wreck-it</font>

712

Ralph mode<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so example one</font>

713
00:22:51,269 --> 00:22:55,799
feature abuse all right applications a

714
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:57,120
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of times developers and just people</font>

00:22:55,799 --> 00:22:59,250
in general content management systems

716
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:01,289
they try to get crazy they try to go all

right<font color="#E5E5E5"> well you know I really want to</font>

00:23:01,289 --> 00:23:04,679
handle I want to make some form based

719
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:06,480
contact us page and have my application

720
00:23:04,679 --> 00:23:08,309
send an email on behalf of these people

721
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:10,980
and not just<font color="#E5E5E5"> do a simple mail to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> write</font>

722
00:23:08,309 --> 00:23:13,620
well that happens a lot so contact us

723
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:15,480
fields feedback forms look for all<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

724
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:17,279
different things capture that post

725
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:18,809
request it's making when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> submit</font>

726
00:23:17,279 --> 00:23:20,519
these different form fields in the UI

727
00:23:18,809 --> 00:23:21,870
and sometimes you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to see some</font>

728
00:23:20,519 --> 00:23:23,519
hidden parameters or different things

729
00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:25,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">that our client side being passed as</font>

730
00:23:23,519 --> 00:23:27,090
well that you wouldn't see in the UI and

731
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:28,500
a lot of times people overlook that

732
00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:29,879
because of you know no one's ever going

733
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:32,190
to capture my stuff in a proxy but

734
00:23:29,879 --> 00:23:33,949
attackers will so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need to look at</font>

735
00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:36,059
that and it sounds<font color="#E5E5E5"> very simple and it is</font>

736
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:38,009
essentially we're going to do smtp

737
00:23:36,059 --> 00:23:40,649
injection so how excited would<font color="#CCCCCC"> i be if i</font>

738
00:23:38,009 --> 00:23:42,539
told<font color="#CCCCCC"> you i found a site where i can send</font>

739
00:23:40,649 --> 00:23:44,639
an email on behalf of that site and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

740
00:23:42,539 --> 00:23:46,590
can control it says I<font color="#E5E5E5"> can control the</font>

741
00:23:44,639 --> 00:23:48,000
two line you know in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the UI i can send</font>

742
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:49,500
to anybody<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> control the</font>

743
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,110
from line and i can send it from

744
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:55,110
probably the CEO<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that company i'm</font>

745
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:57,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">pretty excited right ok so i find that</font>

746
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:59,399
there's a site admin and a subject

747
00:23:57,059 --> 00:24:02,490
parameter being passed in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the post</font>

748
00:23:59,399 --> 00:24:04,590
request<font color="#E5E5E5"> client-side but it's not in the</font>

749
00:24:02,490 --> 00:24:06,539
UI it scrapped in our proxy and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can</font>

750
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:09,928
essentially send it from anyone<font color="#CCCCCC"> i want</font>

751
00:24:06,539 --> 00:24:12,629
and change the subject line to anybody I

752
00:24:09,929 --> 00:24:15,509
want on behalf of your web server so

753
00:24:12,629 --> 00:24:17,399
thank you very much you didn't do a

754
00:24:15,509 --> 00:24:21,600
simple mail to you<font color="#CCCCCC"> try to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go above and</font>

755
00:24:17,399 --> 00:24:22,709
beyond example to essentially here this

756
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,779
is where we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to combine our</font>

757
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:25,950
several findings<font color="#E5E5E5"> right so we're going to</font>

758
00:24:24,779 --> 00:24:27,870
say all<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

759
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:29,850
our vulnerability scanner said we can

760
00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:32,760
get a<font color="#CCCCCC"> user name enumeration from the</font>

761
00:24:29,850 --> 00:24:34,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">login we there's no automation control</font>

762
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:37,019
so there's no<font color="#E5E5E5"> lockout in place for the</font>

763
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:39,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">login and maybe the password complexity</font>

764
00:24:37,019 --> 00:24:40,830
was low we<font color="#E5E5E5"> found that out from crawling</font>

765
00:24:39,179 --> 00:24:42,929
the site and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we saw</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that only eight</font>

766
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:45,750
characters and two<font color="#E5E5E5"> numbers</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are you know</font>

767
00:24:42,929 --> 00:24:47,340
required for the complexity we piece all

768
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:48,870
these three things together they're all

769
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:50,279
low findings or separate findings and

770
00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:51,809
maybe an automated vulnerability scanner

771
00:24:50,279 --> 00:24:53,190
but when we piece them together we do

772
00:24:51,809 --> 00:24:54,779
our manual testing we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

773
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:56,490
create the perfect storm of an account

774
00:24:54,779 --> 00:24:58,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">compromise and this is where it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gets fun</font>

775
00:24:56,490 --> 00:25:01,889
so ways to identify these things is you

776
00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:04,529
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> password reset features basically</font>

777
00:25:01,889 --> 00:25:06,418
saying<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know I want to reset this</font>

778
00:25:04,529 --> 00:25:09,840
admin<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> try admin as user</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> name</font>

779
00:25:06,419 --> 00:25:11,909
and in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> password reset it says email</font>

780
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:13,649
address not found well if I try Bob and

781
00:25:11,909 --> 00:25:15,929
it says email<font color="#CCCCCC"> sent I know Bob's a user</font>

782
00:25:13,649 --> 00:25:17,729
now add them to my list login error

783
00:25:15,929 --> 00:25:20,220
messages rather than<font color="#E5E5E5"> being generic</font>

784
00:25:17,730 --> 00:25:21,419
sometimes applications are very<font color="#CCCCCC"> specific</font>

785
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:23,460
and they shouldn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> be they should be</font>

786
00:25:21,419 --> 00:25:27,090
more generic whether you fail<font color="#CCCCCC"> to pass</font>

787
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:29,250
the test contact us features I've had<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

788
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:31,408
once where it said which admin and gave

789
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:33,269
me a drop-down<font color="#E5E5E5"> list of all the admins</font>

790
00:25:31,409 --> 00:25:35,730
for the site do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to send this to</font>

791
00:25:33,269 --> 00:25:37,830
thank you very much contact us page you

792
00:25:35,730 --> 00:25:40,470
just told me all your admins adding it

793
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:42,210
to the list time for login attempts so

794
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:43,740
this is when you look at your your burp

795
00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:44,639
you know your intruder your things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

796
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:46,559
you're running when you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing these</font>

797
00:25:44,639 --> 00:25:47,760
brute force attempts and you're going to

798
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:49,590
see if there's a variance of time

799
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:51,419
sometimes the status code won't change

800
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:53,549
but there's other ways to<font color="#E5E5E5"> identify it we</font>

801
00:25:51,419 --> 00:25:55,529
can look at our intruder session and see

802
00:25:53,549 --> 00:25:57,330
if maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> we get a valid login it</font>

803
00:25:55,529 --> 00:25:59,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually has a smaller variance of time</font>

804
00:25:57,330 --> 00:26:01,830
than an invalid login for the response

805
00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:04,019
user registration that user name already

806
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:06,510
exists a lot of applications have this

807
00:26:04,019 --> 00:26:08,010
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just no way around it unless</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

808
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:10,230
want to make generic error messaging but

809
00:26:08,010 --> 00:26:11,940
you know if let's say for example on<font color="#E5E5E5"> say</font>

810
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:14,279
I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Zack on this site well you</font>

811
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:16,500
can't be Zack all right why no Zacks a

812
00:26:14,279 --> 00:26:18,570
user now I guess I got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be Zack one so</font>

813
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:20,250
various error messages look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the HTML</font>

814
00:26:18,570 --> 00:26:23,189
source code sometimes developers forget

815
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:24,539
what they put in there and comments just

816
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:26,580
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> things with google hacking you</font>

817
00:26:24,539 --> 00:26:28,350
know sent you can find a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> username</font>

818
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:30,059
structure and things of that nature on

819
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:33,120
these different forms whether it's

820
00:26:30,059 --> 00:26:34,830
pastebin stack overflow youtube you can

821
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:36,899
sometimes people<font color="#E5E5E5"> will make youtube</font>

822
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:39,250
videos of hey this is how you use my

823
00:26:36,899 --> 00:26:41,080
application log in they show

824
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:42,460
that Bob's logged in and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Akane you know</font>

825
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:44,110
just different things<font color="#CCCCCC"> like that you know</font>

826
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:45,970
and they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> just doing it for for good</font>

827
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:48,429
nature but you know attackers have no

828
00:26:45,970 --> 00:26:49,960
good nature sometimes<font color="#CCCCCC"> the application</font>

829
00:26:48,430 --> 00:26:52,300
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> flat-out tells you WordPress is</font>

830
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:54,010
guilty of this PHP<font color="#E5E5E5"> BB is guilty of this</font>

831
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:56,290
it'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> who is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the last person</font>

832
00:26:54,010 --> 00:26:58,420
that made a comment or logged in so fun

833
00:26:56,290 --> 00:27:00,730
stuff right so we got<font color="#E5E5E5"> our username</font>

834
00:26:58,420 --> 00:27:03,820
enumeration we're building that list we

835
00:27:00,730 --> 00:27:05,920
now find out that the login has no anti

836
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:08,080
automation controls in place basically I

837
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:09,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't want to deal with unlocking users</font>

838
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:11,620
I don't want to deal with account

839
00:27:09,790 --> 00:27:14,200
lockouts or having some automated

840
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:15,639
process so yeah people can just log in

841
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:17,890
as many times<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want well that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bad</font>

842
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:20,320
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very bad practice if there's no</font>

843
00:27:17,890 --> 00:27:21,760
sign of anti automation controls<font color="#CCCCCC"> root</font>

844
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:24,250
forces on the table<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's going to</font>

845
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:26,530
happen until you're successful or

846
00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:28,390
heavier that determine but no account

847
00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:30,040
lockout if there's no caption place this

848
00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:32,980
is another way to thwart the you know

849
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:34,510
the issue even like I'm not a robot with

850
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:36,010
Google that's a simple thing where you

851
00:27:34,510 --> 00:27:37,540
just click a couple images and it goes

852
00:27:36,010 --> 00:27:40,690
hey is this a railroad is this a

853
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:42,040
railroad<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay you pass the test those</font>

854
00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:43,780
kind of things can<font color="#E5E5E5"> really help and</font>

855
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:45,820
having a count lock account<font color="#E5E5E5"> lockouts</font>

856
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:48,730
maybe after five bad tries<font color="#E5E5E5"> really can</font>

857
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:50,439
help thwart the enemy but<font color="#E5E5E5"> sometimes</font>

858
00:27:48,730 --> 00:27:52,630
developers will say<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright my main</font>

859
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:54,460
login is locked down all right they

860
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:56,230
forget about their API and they also

861
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:57,430
forget about their mobile interfaces and

862
00:27:56,230 --> 00:27:58,630
they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the same controls in</font>

863
00:27:57,430 --> 00:28:01,920
place so always look at all these

864
00:27:58,630 --> 00:28:04,570
different login vectors and finally

865
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:06,610
we're just bad everyone here is<font color="#E5E5E5"> bad I</font>

866
00:28:04,570 --> 00:28:08,050
mean it's not everyone most people are

867
00:28:06,610 --> 00:28:10,570
just bad at passwords<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know what I</font>

868
00:28:08,050 --> 00:28:12,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">mean it's it's sad it's very true that</font>

869
00:28:10,570 --> 00:28:14,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know you look every year</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they post</font>

870
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:16,360
the top<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten you know passwords and then</font>

871
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:18,340
they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> change very much they're</font>

872
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:20,169
always just you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> password or some</font>

873
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:22,360
variation of it or maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> the year and</font>

874
00:28:20,170 --> 00:28:24,100
the season and the company's name in the

875
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:25,330
year keyboard walks and people think

876
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:26,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're getting tricky but no they're</font>

877
00:28:25,330 --> 00:28:29,830
not there's password lists out there

878
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:31,090
with keyboard walks always keep in mind

879
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:33,070
that there's tons of password lists out

880
00:28:31,090 --> 00:28:35,139
there like fuzz DB and<font color="#E5E5E5"> sec let's have at</font>

881
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:37,000
your<font color="#CCCCCC"> pre-built you can use in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your route</font>

882
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:39,730
for sessions and you also want to just

883
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:41,110
kind of maybe research different<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

884
00:28:39,730 --> 00:28:44,440
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're going after like maybe you</font>

885
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:46,600
do find out that<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bob Seymour is a valid</font>

886
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:47,860
user well look in Bob's social media

887
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:50,020
platform is start to figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out here</font>

888
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:51,669
Washington Redskins fan and then start

889
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:53,080
building different<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know variations</font>

890
00:28:51,670 --> 00:28:55,360
of word lists of interests

891
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:56,830
that maybe that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> his password that's</font>

892
00:28:55,360 --> 00:29:00,219
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get really creepy I guess too</font>

893
00:28:56,830 --> 00:29:02,080
yeah exactly right you can also use cool

894
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:03,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">two tools like cool where they're going</font>

895
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:05,980
to crawl the site's content and try and

896
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:07,630
pull like extract<font color="#CCCCCC"> keywords of interest</font>

897
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:09,250
and try<font color="#E5E5E5"> and build word variation list</font>

898
00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:10,930
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> tons of tools out there but feel</font>

899
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:12,190
free<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at all those and those are</font>

900
00:29:10,930 --> 00:29:13,720
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> three things that can really build</font>

901
00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:15,850
that perfect storm and get you those

902
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:17,590
account compromises that are just truly

903
00:29:15,850 --> 00:29:20,500
high impact especially when you get

904
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:23,379
someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> with higher privileges so</font>

905
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:26,500
example<font color="#CCCCCC"> 3 I was going against a map</font>

906
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:29,280
application and I then unlink content

907
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:33,280
enumeration and I came<font color="#CCCCCC"> across this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> proxy</font>

908
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:35,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">ashs so essentially</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what this this</font>

909
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:36,850
resources for is if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't have a</font>

910
00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:38,680
course policy in place with this map

911
00:29:36,850 --> 00:29:41,260
application you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> then make</font>

912
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:42,820
connections to other domains and have

913
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:45,010
their content load and see if a new

914
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:46,960
connection work so i basically appended

915
00:29:45,010 --> 00:29:48,760
a question mark<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the end and then you</font>

916
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:50,650
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> i put</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> google as an example just</font>

917
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:52,890
trying to reach out to another external

918
00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:57,340
internet facing site and lo and behold

919
00:29:52,890 --> 00:29:59,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">Google's HTML content is loaded while in</font>

920
00:29:57,340 --> 00:30:01,929
incentive that proxy and then relayed

921
00:29:59,770 --> 00:30:03,790
back into the page while<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm still there</font>

922
00:30:01,930 --> 00:30:05,380
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that resource and it loads</font>

923
00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:07,300
Google within the page and I'm still at

924
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:10,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">the map site and I'm like okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

925
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:12,220
interesting maybe I haven't opened

926
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:13,750
redirect on my hands<font color="#E5E5E5"> and from there you</font>

927
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:16,510
could do two different<font color="#E5E5E5"> things and the</font>

928
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:18,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">first thing you know simple phishing you</font>

929
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:20,080
could basically put a malicious link you

930
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:21,340
can obfuscate the link and then try and

931
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">make that in your campaign and</font>

932
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:24,310
distribute malware<font color="#CCCCCC"> or distribute</font>

933
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:26,200
whatever you're trying to do through

934
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:27,790
this resource because you're trusting

935
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:29,490
that map application but really you're

936
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:32,290
putting bad<font color="#E5E5E5"> boy said at the end of it</font>

937
00:30:29,490 --> 00:30:34,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">other cool</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things so now I requested</font>

938
00:30:32,290 --> 00:30:37,680
Google right what if I start requesting

939
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:41,050
internal IP space what if I can bypass

940
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:44,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">the firewall and make some TCP</font>

941
00:30:41,050 --> 00:30:47,050
connections to systems internal well we

942
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:49,690
tried it<font color="#CCCCCC"> and made an automated Python</font>

943
00:30:47,050 --> 00:30:52,510
script to try this and lo and behold it

944
00:30:49,690 --> 00:30:54,360
worked very cool right this is out on

945
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:56,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> internet some resource and</font>

946
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:59,439
essentially if I just depends some

947
00:30:56,440 --> 00:31:01,330
internal common web ports I'm starting

948
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:02,890
to basically map out your internal

949
00:31:01,330 --> 00:31:05,260
infrastructure and starting to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get an</font>

950
00:31:02,890 --> 00:31:06,500
idea of what is going<font color="#CCCCCC"> on behind the</font>

951
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:08,300
scenes

952
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:10,700
and if I'm doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> an external and</font>

953
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:11,899
internal pen test I'm you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know basically</font>

954
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:13,730
starting to map you out a little bit

955
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:15,050
before<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> jump into the internal portion</font>

956
00:31:13,730 --> 00:31:17,300
but here you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> see there there's a</font>

957
00:31:15,050 --> 00:31:18,860
cisco email security appliance I got the

958
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:20,720
versioning information on the login<font color="#E5E5E5"> page</font>

959
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:22,370
and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just kind of cool how you can</font>

960
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:24,080
convey that and that's a real attack

961
00:31:22,370 --> 00:31:26,750
scenario that we came across and it's

962
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:28,460
just definitely interesting so Andrews

963
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:31,010
going to jump into example for here

964
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:32,480
because he did this yeah so file

965
00:31:31,010 --> 00:31:33,920
inclusion<font color="#E5E5E5"> to shell this is always a good</font>

966
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:35,330
one if you've never done<font color="#CCCCCC"> it I'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

967
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:37,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">walk you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> through</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> step-by-step</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on how you</font>

968
00:31:35,330 --> 00:31:39,860
would massage file inclusion to shell

969
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:43,010
which if you are interested this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the</font>

970
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:46,790
best way to pick<font color="#CCCCCC"> up chicks</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at a bar it</font>

971
00:31:43,010 --> 00:31:48,170
works I trust me so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> how I</font>

972
00:31:46,790 --> 00:31:50,480
actually broke into an organization

973
00:31:48,170 --> 00:31:52,190
highly secured organization I was you

974
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:53,090
know we spent a while on a lot of their

975
00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:54,410
main apps a lot of our main

976
00:31:53,090 --> 00:31:56,209
infrastructure and we're bashing her

977
00:31:54,410 --> 00:31:58,250
heads failing that thousand times right

978
00:31:56,210 --> 00:31:59,810
and i finally<font color="#E5E5E5"> stumbled upon a resource</font>

979
00:31:58,250 --> 00:32:01,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">that got me code execution</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm gonna</font>

980
00:31:59,810 --> 00:32:03,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">walk you through it but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a little backup</font>

981
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:06,230
on file inclusion for those who aren't

982
00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:08,330
familiar file inclusion phones can lead

983
00:32:06,230 --> 00:32:09,920
to code execution or they may be maybe

984
00:32:08,330 --> 00:32:12,290
they can't an example of<font color="#CCCCCC"> a code</font>

985
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:13,430
execution would be like a PHP include it

986
00:32:12,290 --> 00:32:15,350
really depends upon the function that's

987
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:16,940
being called an example of a file

988
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:21,409
inclusion that's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to like cat</font>

989
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:22,790
files the screen is a PHP echo<font color="#E5E5E5"> you also</font>

990
00:32:21,410 --> 00:32:24,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">have local file inclusion and remote</font>

991
00:32:22,790 --> 00:32:25,820
file inclusion so local file inclusion

992
00:32:24,290 --> 00:32:28,370
is exactly that you're including local

993
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:29,629
files and with that particular type of

994
00:32:28,370 --> 00:32:31,340
vulnerability it takes a little more

995
00:32:29,630 --> 00:32:32,420
work and magic to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get your code</font>

996
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:34,399
execution because you'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font>

997
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:35,690
your input into like a log file or

998
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:37,820
somewhere<font color="#CCCCCC"> else on disk and then include</font>

999
00:32:35,690 --> 00:32:39,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">that file and that inputs code log</font>

1000
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:41,149
poisoning is a common term for that

1001
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:42,260
remote file inclusions are a whole lot

1002
00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:44,060
easier because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just point it</font>

1003
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:45,950
back to you say<font color="#E5E5E5"> grab</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my code run it and</font>

1004
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:48,110
it runs it and it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> awesome so we're</font>

1005
00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:49,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to go through</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an example</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of this</font>

1006
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:51,709
here now this is an example I like

1007
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:53,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">because for this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk especially because</font>

1008
00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:56,120
it water ability<font color="#E5E5E5"> scanner is not going to</font>

1009
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:59,689
find<font color="#E5E5E5"> this even big guns vulnerability</font>

1010
00:32:56,120 --> 00:33:01,669
scanner wet web inspect a kinetics you

1011
00:32:59,690 --> 00:33:03,230
name it the reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> being is that debug</font>

1012
00:33:01,670 --> 00:33:05,300
dot PHP was living out in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the web server</font>

1013
00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:06,560
wasn't linked so first off unlink

1014
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:08,210
content we talked<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that if you</font>

1015
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:10,010
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually map your app and find</font>

1016
00:33:08,210 --> 00:33:11,600
these cool little interesting resources

1017
00:33:10,010 --> 00:33:13,580
you're not going to fight you're not

1018
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:15,290
going to fuzz now the second reason is i

1019
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:16,428
go to debug dot PHP it i think<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

1020
00:33:15,290 --> 00:33:18,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually did this and then i went to</font>

1021
00:33:16,429 --> 00:33:19,340
lunch at blank screen you're always like

1022
00:33:18,050 --> 00:33:19,779
me a blank screen nothing here what's

1023
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:21,309
going on

1024
00:33:19,779 --> 00:33:22,809
I came<font color="#E5E5E5"> back I was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like all right you</font>

1025
00:33:21,309 --> 00:33:24,279
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> what are we going to do next I'm</font>

1026
00:33:22,809 --> 00:33:26,619
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to try</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to figure out my</font>

1027
00:33:24,279 --> 00:33:28,299
inputs now commonly you know you're

1028
00:33:26,619 --> 00:33:29,529
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find inputs by a parameter</font>

1029
00:33:28,299 --> 00:33:31,479
whether it be a get parameter post

1030
00:33:29,529 --> 00:33:34,029
parameter I just started with get as we

1031
00:33:31,479 --> 00:33:37,029
put a dollar sign hour ? equals

1032
00:33:34,029 --> 00:33:38,499
parameter name and I started to flood

1033
00:33:37,029 --> 00:33:40,809
with burps intruder right so I set up

1034
00:33:38,499 --> 00:33:42,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">the sniper and I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> said</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay let me go</font>

1035
00:33:40,809 --> 00:33:43,779
through common parameter dams which you

1036
00:33:42,219 --> 00:33:46,929
can't see they're probably in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the URL</font>

1037
00:33:43,779 --> 00:33:48,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">bar is ? page equals test gave back a</font>

1038
00:33:46,929 --> 00:33:49,989
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> response so i started a thumb</font>

1039
00:33:48,429 --> 00:33:52,269
through and you can sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> by length and</font>

1040
00:33:49,989 --> 00:33:54,580
burps intruder results I got 193 on

1041
00:33:52,269 --> 00:33:57,429
everything else page equals test<font color="#CCCCCC"> Gabey</font>

1042
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:58,928
633 am i cool let me<font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> check it out so</font>

1043
00:33:57,429 --> 00:34:00,339
I go over i'm getting a PHP warning<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font>

1044
00:33:58,929 --> 00:34:01,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">getting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very excited right now because</font>

1045
00:34:00,339 --> 00:34:02,619
it says function including if you

1046
00:34:01,719 --> 00:34:04,690
remember we talked<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the slide</font>

1047
00:34:02,619 --> 00:34:06,369
before include means code execution so

1048
00:34:04,690 --> 00:34:08,950
we're getting its awesome and we see

1049
00:34:06,369 --> 00:34:10,569
test is there now if you fed this

1050
00:34:08,949 --> 00:34:12,730
parameter to a vulnerability scanner it

1051
00:34:10,569 --> 00:34:14,409
knew about the parameter it might land

1052
00:34:12,730 --> 00:34:15,909
you with with with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the vulnerability but</font>

1053
00:34:14,409 --> 00:34:17,169
you have to really get<font color="#CCCCCC"> to that point and</font>

1054
00:34:15,909 --> 00:34:18,339
the water bill a scanner is not just

1055
00:34:17,168 --> 00:34:20,500
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> like get you there all the way</font>

1056
00:34:18,339 --> 00:34:21,879
there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of manual features that</font>

1057
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:23,409
may know testing it to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get to this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> point</font>

1058
00:34:21,879 --> 00:34:27,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">but from here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I can get code execution</font>

1059
00:34:23,409 --> 00:34:28,960
and the way being is this is an RFI you

1060
00:34:27,489 --> 00:34:31,000
could test<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a local file inclusion</font>

1061
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:33,490
you know direction reversal up etsy

1062
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:35,260
password cool and the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing is to</font>

1063
00:34:33,489 --> 00:34:36,759
test for raw file inclusion so I just

1064
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:39,460
pointed it back to<font color="#CCCCCC"> myself my attacker</font>

1065
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:40,929
box set up a little Python simple HTTP

1066
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:44,349
server if your pen testers is a great

1067
00:34:40,929 --> 00:34:45,819
way to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a quick web server up so the</font>

1068
00:34:44,349 --> 00:34:47,740
first one there number<font color="#CCCCCC"> one is the</font>

1069
00:34:45,819 --> 00:34:49,599
request on making to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the server number</font>

1070
00:34:47,739 --> 00:34:50,979
two is<font color="#CCCCCC"> it fetching my code from me and</font>

1071
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:52,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">number three is it running and telling</font>

1072
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:53,918
<font color="#E5E5E5">me the result the quote the code I was</font>

1073
00:34:52,359 --> 00:34:56,020
just running<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a quick system ID</font>

1074
00:34:53,918 --> 00:34:58,990
command and I'm getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> code execution</font>

1075
00:34:56,020 --> 00:35:00,400
which is really<font color="#CCCCCC"> awesome in real</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> life</font>

1076
00:34:58,990 --> 00:35:02,529
this was<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually running a system on a</font>

1077
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:03,819
windows box so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like mini cats and</font>

1078
00:35:02,529 --> 00:35:05,049
spray everywhere at that point it's

1079
00:35:03,819 --> 00:35:08,500
awesome<font color="#CCCCCC"> because that was on a web server</font>

1080
00:35:05,049 --> 00:35:10,210
for like a really long<font color="#CCCCCC"> time and had gone</font>

1081
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:11,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">through many pen tests many security</font>

1082
00:35:10,210 --> 00:35:13,089
assessments many bones can<font color="#CCCCCC"> xand never</font>

1083
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:15,490
been found but these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the kind of</font>

1084
00:35:13,089 --> 00:35:17,349
things that your manual testing and your

1085
00:35:15,490 --> 00:35:20,049
kind of hunting mentality<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're not</font>

1086
00:35:17,349 --> 00:35:21,279
giving up confine you these gems that

1087
00:35:20,049 --> 00:35:22,630
just you know aren't that hard

1088
00:35:21,279 --> 00:35:23,920
necessarily when we look at on the

1089
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:25,480
slides there but it just doesn't get

1090
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:28,869
pieced together without the human

1091
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:30,069
interaction the next and last example is

1092
00:35:28,869 --> 00:35:32,380
email spoofing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I bring this up because</font>

1093
00:35:30,069 --> 00:35:33,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm not I find this a lot actually</font>

1094
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:35,080
believe or not

1095
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:36,520
and valen scanners don't do a lot of

1096
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:38,770
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> testing very well because you need</font>

1097
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:39,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">to have an email server setup to</font>

1098
00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:41,770
interpret it so you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to able to</font>

1099
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:43,510
basically see if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm sending in some</font>

1100
00:35:41,770 --> 00:35:44,860
input can I get<font color="#E5E5E5"> an email back and how</font>

1101
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:46,180
many volunteer see yourself there an

1102
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:47,770
email to see if they're receiving email

1103
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:49,629
in the inbox not a whole lot i don't

1104
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:51,070
know of any could be that with some out

1105
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:53,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">there but the first step to do email</font>

1106
00:35:51,070 --> 00:35:54,880
spoofing this is a quick slide step 1

1107
00:35:53,650 --> 00:35:56,590
i'll find the mail servers<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'll</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> run a</font>

1108
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:58,750
host command get the mail servers and

1109
00:35:56,590 --> 00:36:00,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">i'm actually hacking myself here with</font>

00:35:58,750 --> 00:36:03,100
primal security blog<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think it</font>

1111
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:05,620
actually still vulnerable you can tell

1112
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:08,080
that to the mail services google and i'm

1113
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:09,910
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm setting up the the smtp</font>

1114
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:11,110
commands mail mail from recipient to

1115
00:36:09,910 --> 00:36:13,540
this is what your mail servers are going

1116
00:36:11,110 --> 00:36:14,590
to actually partially and not what the

1117
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:16,390
outlook<font color="#CCCCCC"> clients necessarily</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

1118
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:17,350
show you unless you view the headers<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

1119
00:36:16,390 --> 00:36:18,250
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what your mail</font>

1120
00:36:17,350 --> 00:36:20,860
servers are going to par so here<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font>

1121
00:36:18,250 --> 00:36:23,050
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> putting a ridiculously fake data at</font>

1122
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:24,760
primal security net and then I'm do i

1123
00:36:23,050 --> 00:36:26,320
type data and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm going to actually put</font>

1124
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:28,870
the email together<font color="#E5E5E5"> which is what's going</font>

1125
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:30,070
to get parsed by outlook client and i'm

1126
00:36:28,870 --> 00:36:31,660
putting<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> additional headers that the</font>

1127
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:32,830
from header the to header the stuff your

1128
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:35,109
users are<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the subject</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> line</font>

1129
00:36:32,830 --> 00:36:37,600
demo for con talk take a look I spoof

1130
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:38,890
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> email this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I find this a</font>

1131
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:40,600
lot and<font color="#CCCCCC"> what I'll do is I'll play around</font>

1132
00:36:38,890 --> 00:36:42,160
with sometimes I can't spoof<font color="#CCCCCC"> the step</font>

1133
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:43,870
three hitters if I can spoof<font color="#CCCCCC"> the set for</font>

1134
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:46,149
headers and the users to<font color="#E5E5E5"> click stuff so</font>

1135
00:36:43,870 --> 00:36:48,430
it's cool and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the slides are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> online</font>

1136
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:50,170
already so the steps there you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1137
00:36:48,430 --> 00:36:53,109
memorize<font color="#E5E5E5"> here's what it would look like</font>

1138
00:36:50,170 --> 00:36:54,370
in my inbox demo for con talk you know

1139
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:56,920
you can see it came right through this

1140
00:36:54,370 --> 00:36:59,589
is Google Apps for work works<font color="#CCCCCC"> just fine</font>

1141
00:36:56,920 --> 00:37:03,220
to a user this is actually sent by gmail

1142
00:36:59,590 --> 00:37:05,560
so in my actual testing I found<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I</font>

1143
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:07,930
can't spoof the the smtp actual headers

1144
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:09,759
that I said in for the mail server but I

1145
00:37:07,930 --> 00:37:10,870
could control the stuff that the outlook

1146
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,640
clients<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to parse and I wanted to</font>

1147
00:37:10,870 --> 00:37:13,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">model legitimate communications and make</font>

1148
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:16,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">sure that everybody has to change your</font>

1149
00:37:13,570 --> 00:37:19,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">password click my link a highly</font>

1150
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:21,040
successful fishing I'm sure it goes

1151
00:37:19,690 --> 00:37:22,270
without saying they're from help desk

1152
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:24,610
but you can see just<font color="#E5E5E5"> says help desk</font>

1153
00:37:22,270 --> 00:37:26,410
support looks legitimate really cool

1154
00:37:24,610 --> 00:37:28,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">stuff the scary thing here is this</font>

1155
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:30,759
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually works if you are using Google</font>

1156
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:32,770
Apps for work right<font color="#E5E5E5"> now and you have not</font>

1157
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:34,570
set up dns txt records for spfd k md

1158
00:37:32,770 --> 00:37:36,430
mark you were vulnerable<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can actually</font>

1159
00:37:34,570 --> 00:37:38,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">use your organization and spoof to a lot</font>

1160
00:37:36,430 --> 00:37:39,609
of other<font color="#E5E5E5"> places right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now through you</font>

1161
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:41,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">because it doesn't have to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> romain i</font>

1162
00:37:39,610 --> 00:37:42,730
could do like at whitehouse.gov and

1163
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:43,960
Google will sent to you<font color="#E5E5E5"> people trust</font>

1164
00:37:42,730 --> 00:37:45,640
Google's mail servers when it comes to

1165
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:46,170
their infrastructure their stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1166
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:49,560
can

1167
00:37:46,170 --> 00:37:51,810
miss use Google Apps for work and in a

1168
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:52,950
dirty way so my finding is a google

1169
00:37:51,810 --> 00:37:53,970
doesn't really tell you<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do this you</font>

1170
00:37:52,950 --> 00:37:55,520
go to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google Apps for work you get your</font>

1171
00:37:53,970 --> 00:37:57,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">five dollar email per month it's awesome</font>

1172
00:37:55,520 --> 00:38:00,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">really good service but you have to set</font>

1173
00:37:57,660 --> 00:38:02,640
these DNX test<font color="#E5E5E5"> wreck txt records to</font>

1174
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:04,530
prevent spoofing attacks and they don't

1175
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:05,460
like tell you out of the box though if

1176
00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:08,190
you call them the walk you through it's

1177
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:10,380
pretty easy but it's when I come across

1178
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:12,390
a organization<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's using Google Apps</font>

1179
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:14,730
for work nine times out of ten they are

1180
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:18,890
vulnerable to spoofing attacks not to

1181
00:38:14,730 --> 00:38:21,300
themselves<font color="#E5E5E5"> but also as a proxy to others</font>

1182
00:38:18,890 --> 00:38:23,220
and now the final stage reporting like

1183
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:24,540
Zach said this is our favorite part who

1184
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:26,399
cares about<font color="#E5E5E5"> shells and spoofing emails</font>

1185
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:27,630
and stuff and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can we can get in word</font>

1186
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,860
and getting power point I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

1187
00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:32,940
that's why I went that's why I got in

1188
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:34,560
this industry right we we like leverage

1189
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:36,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">markdown if you've never used markdown</font>

1190
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:37,860
it's like HTML shorthand if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> would to</font>

1191
00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:40,740
get from it to github you can looks

1192
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:42,480
really clean like that muaks has<font color="#E5E5E5"> common</font>

1193
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:45,029
findings database project on github

1194
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:47,010
which is basically markdown templates

1195
00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:48,510
for vulnerabilities so you can like grab

1196
00:38:47,010 --> 00:38:50,580
them to build your ports up really nice

1197
00:38:48,510 --> 00:38:51,750
make sure you talk to your customers you

1198
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:53,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">can spend a lot of time make it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font>

1199
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:56,100
birdie markdown report which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is an HTML</font>

1200
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:57,120
it looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in PDF and they come back</font>

1201
00:38:56,100 --> 00:39:00,210
and they say they<font color="#CCCCCC"> want a word doc you</font>

1202
00:38:57,120 --> 00:39:01,740
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh shoot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I debated in markdown so</font>

1203
00:39:00,210 --> 00:39:03,030
make sure you talk to about the

1204
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:04,649
formatting what they expect and what

1205
00:39:03,030 --> 00:39:06,330
they need he may just<font color="#E5E5E5"> may need a</font>

1206
00:39:04,650 --> 00:39:07,710
spreadsheet that may need word doc PDF

1207
00:39:06,330 --> 00:39:11,310
what have you so just<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure you land</font>

1208
00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:12,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">that free start using markdown reporting</font>

1209
00:39:11,310 --> 00:39:14,160
another piece<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we talked about we</font>

1210
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:15,870
talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the pen test means</font>

1211
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:17,069
different things different people we get

1212
00:39:15,870 --> 00:39:18,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">this a lot where it's like it's a pen</font>

1213
00:39:17,070 --> 00:39:21,480
test but don't hack anything okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1214
00:39:18,810 --> 00:39:23,250
gotcha all right I'll do that so if you

1215
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:25,050
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> exploit a cool write it up if you</font>

1216
00:39:23,250 --> 00:39:26,970
can't exploit it what could<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have</font>

1217
00:39:25,050 --> 00:39:28,350
done include an attack<font color="#CCCCCC"> or a narrative we</font>

1218
00:39:26,970 --> 00:39:29,790
like to do that so if we cannot exploit

1219
00:39:28,350 --> 00:39:32,580
it they say no no not rules of

1220
00:39:29,790 --> 00:39:33,930
engagement I'll say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay to land the</font>

1221
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:35,580
impact<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the customer I will</font>

1222
00:39:33,930 --> 00:39:36,750
replicate the environmental lab take

1223
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:39,480
some screenshots and show what I could

1224
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:40,920
have done and a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot often times than not</font>

1225
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:42,240
they may come<font color="#E5E5E5"> back and say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right you</font>

1226
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:45,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">really can't do that now say okay well</font>

1227
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:46,770
let me try and that that can be helpful

1228
00:39:45,390 --> 00:39:49,170
to plan the impact and get things fixed

1229
00:39:46,770 --> 00:39:51,210
ultimately that's what we're here also

1230
00:39:49,170 --> 00:39:53,070
highlight business impact I've had exact

1231
00:39:51,210 --> 00:39:54,990
said I've had customers that wolf if you

1232
00:39:53,070 --> 00:39:58,170
know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make what keeps them up</font>

1233
00:39:54,990 --> 00:39:59,529
tonight and what gets<font color="#E5E5E5"> them afraid you</font>

1234
00:39:58,170 --> 00:40:00,970
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> really find the right boner</font>

1235
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:02,560
for them like legs access availability

1236
00:40:00,970 --> 00:40:03,819
is key you know when you<font color="#CCCCCC"> find</font>

1237
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:05,980
vulnerabilities it's going to take their

1238
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:07,150
their point of sale systems down that

1239
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:09,010
can be some that might be critical to

1240
00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:10,600
them if it's coming up a medium on the

1241
00:40:09,010 --> 00:40:13,720
bone scanner you know so keep that in

1242
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:14,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">mind and also include a detailed right</font>

1243
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:15,910
up on what you did I think that's

1244
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:17,710
getting more more important as you talk

1245
00:40:15,910 --> 00:40:19,000
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> about red team's and you are about</font>

1246
00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:20,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">Penn tests and other types of security</font>

1247
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,540
assessments but it's important talk

1248
00:40:20,470 --> 00:40:24,910
about what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you did as a tester because</font>

1249
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:26,200
that can be leveraged<font color="#E5E5E5"> from a you know</font>

1250
00:40:24,910 --> 00:40:27,520
further for the fenders they can go back

1251
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:29,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">and say</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay what did I see what didn't</font>

1252
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:30,730
I see what tools did you<font color="#E5E5E5"> run when G what</font>

1253
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:33,070
time were they run at and I can go<font color="#E5E5E5"> back</font>

1254
00:40:30,730 --> 00:40:34,120
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at my is sim my vet logs and</font>

1255
00:40:33,070 --> 00:40:36,220
you can work<font color="#CCCCCC"> with them after the fact</font>

1256
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:38,440
say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay you know as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you can see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I ran</font>

1257
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:41,109
this on Wednesday and I we popped that

1258
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:43,240
pop that LF I you know wednesday night

1259
00:40:41,110 --> 00:40:44,710
and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can go back</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and help them and</font>

1260
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:46,060
see so you got to<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that involves</font>

1261
00:40:44,710 --> 00:40:48,190
keeping detailed notes as<font color="#CCCCCC"> you test which</font>

1262
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:50,259
is not fun but it can be<font color="#CCCCCC"> very helpful</font>

1263
00:40:48,190 --> 00:40:52,030
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then it finally include that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> high</font>

1264
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:53,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">level summary you know to land home</font>

1265
00:40:52,030 --> 00:40:55,060
those metrics find out whatever metrics

1266
00:40:53,710 --> 00:40:57,220
they need you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what I'd like to do</font>

1267
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:58,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">is find out what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it you know take the</font>

1268
00:40:57,220 --> 00:40:59,919
industry<font color="#CCCCCC"> therein and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> compare them to</font>

1269
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:01,360
other like<font color="#E5E5E5"> industries select it's a</font>

1270
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:03,280
school<font color="#E5E5E5"> because of other schools kind of</font>

1271
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:07,570
thing see where they land up in their

1272
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:09,670
market offer remediation testing this is

1273
00:41:07,570 --> 00:41:11,440
very important because you know

1274
00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:13,180
especially talk about whether it bones I

1275
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:16,140
can be complex to fix it's not often

1276
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:16,140
just a yep sorry

1277
00:41:21,070 --> 00:41:25,220
we don't usually put the links directly

1278
00:41:23,810 --> 00:41:26,630
there will break the link though so they

1279
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:27,830
can they can go there themselves yeah

1280
00:41:26,630 --> 00:41:29,210
but it's not like<font color="#E5E5E5"> hyperlinked in the</font>

1281
00:41:27,830 --> 00:41:31,040
report or anything but they break the

1282
00:41:29,210 --> 00:41:32,570
link with like brackets we take<font color="#E5E5E5"> that DoD</font>

1283
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:35,750
mindset we always break<font color="#CCCCCC"> wings you know</font>

1284
00:41:32,570 --> 00:41:37,400
but we will include the pile give<font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

1285
00:41:35,750 --> 00:41:39,320
code to all right<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll write a little</font>

1286
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:41,240
Python script if it's applicable on a

1287
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:43,280
given code to retest but it kind of

1288
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:44,540
bounces in<font color="#CCCCCC"> there mediation testing we</font>

1289
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:46,790
definitely provide you know as much

1290
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:48,560
detail as I can to the to the customer

1291
00:41:46,790 --> 00:41:49,910
on what vulnerability found and how to

1292
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:51,980
pet exploited how could be exploited

1293
00:41:49,910 --> 00:41:54,020
kind of thing and then offer remediation

1294
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:55,790
testing so if they fix it you know that

1295
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:57,140
script alert scripts blacklisted but a

1296
00:41:55,790 --> 00:41:59,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">JavaScript event handler is it you know</font>

1297
00:41:57,140 --> 00:42:00,770
just reevaluate finding so you're making

1298
00:41:59,210 --> 00:42:01,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">sure they're not fixing an instance of</font>

1299
00:42:00,770 --> 00:42:04,040
the problem they're actually fixing the

1300
00:42:01,850 --> 00:42:05,390
entire problem so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you often have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to go</font>

1301
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:08,150
back and all your key findings and

1302
00:42:05,390 --> 00:42:09,799
retest them like you would<font color="#E5E5E5"> have from</font>

1303
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:11,480
from scratch and it can lead to

1304
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:13,490
additional testing obviously that strong

1305
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:15,560
relationship with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the customer I've</font>

1306
00:42:13,490 --> 00:42:17,419
actually had a situation<font color="#E5E5E5"> where they</font>

1307
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:19,040
fixed a file upload example I popped a

1308
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:20,900
shell through file upload as a trivial

1309

meme type bypass just<font color="#E5E5E5"> change meme type</font>

1310
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:24,800

1312
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:30,230

00:42:27,050 --> 00:42:31,670
a file upload one dot PHP and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

1315
00:42:31,670 --> 00:42:34,040
upload didn't take it off so<font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

1316
00:42:33,110 --> 00:42:35,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">things like that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you got to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be creative</font>
