1
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:07,899
did anyone get any flags

2
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:13,790
you found the easiest flagamer I think

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,920
every only one I've heard of so far so

4
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:23,049
some of you may have found an audio file

5
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:23,050
of a website did anyone get that flag no

6
00:00:23,649 --> 00:00:31,759
there was a flag on there so this was

7
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:35,180
created for us and just going to show

8
00:00:31,759 --> 00:00:39,040
you all the retro magnet that I magic

9
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:39,040
that I was showing a few days ago

10
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:58,869
a big little close for Tom at the back

11
00:01:49,390 --> 00:02:02,649
please you say that is just cause okay

12
00:01:58,869 --> 00:02:06,270
so um let's see if this works there we

13
00:02:02,649 --> 00:02:09,840
go so we've had I think a stellar year

14
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:15,540
but be sizing Leeds I don't disagree

15
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:17,500
good and it would agree so we add

16
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:19,989
something of the range of three tracks

17
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:21,160
plus one workshop track I'm really

18
00:02:19,989 --> 00:02:25,110
pleased what we actually managed to

19
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:28,989
bring in the CFP was really really hard

20
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:30,610
to actually sort of work out what was

21
00:02:28,989 --> 00:02:32,530
going on in terms of like which picklist

22
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:35,049
we've talked to be big so many talks

23
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:36,400
where it was so close in terms of you

24
00:02:35,049 --> 00:02:38,290
know there the scores and things we had

25
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,060
to really sort of go over things they'll

26
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:42,910
do to pull out then talk to me actually

27

couldn't make it because his train was

39
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:21,549
broken down now when you're trans broke

40
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:22,809
him down you can't get off because

41
00:03:21,549 --> 00:03:24,310
you're on a train in the middle of

42
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:25,930
nowhere and it's broken down and it's

43
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:27,790
going nowhere so because he couldn't

44
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:29,230
move off the train he couldn't actually

45
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:30,970
get onto the plane and cuz he couldn't

46
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:35,619

47
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:41,920

there and we will do our best to sort of

55
00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:03,030
help encourage that last year we had

56
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:04,710
nine thousand two hundred views in the

57
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:07,140
last twelve months on the YouTube

58
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:08,970
channel of which the most viewed was

59
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:11,820
with the gentleman who just walked in J

60
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:18,089
I had one point four thousand so

61
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:20,370
Universal have although of course it

62
00:04:18,089 --> 00:04:23,669
happens to be the only video on YouTube

63
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:25,530
about losing Freda on Android so you

64
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:28,380
know that really hit it off but other

65
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:30,030
talks got several hundred to just shy of

66
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:32,010
a thousand views so we're doing really

67
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:34,320
well the talks are producing art of

68
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:36,480
interested people far and beyond a my

69
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,849
save use the average viewing length is

70
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:40,110
something in the region of ten minutes

71
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:41,400
which if you know how the averages work

72
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:42,810
on YouTube that means that actually a

73
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:44,789
lot of people of those views are

74
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:46,650
actually watching everything or watching

75
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:49,200
the bulk of everything so that's really

76
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:50,880
really good hopefully we can do better

77
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:52,770
this year why not let's try the

78
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,719
reference b-sides London has one hundred

79
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:56,760
six thousand views over their years

80
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:59,120
operation so I think we just need to

81
00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:02,430
here keep going and get competitive

82
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:05,280
absolutely yeah but not do that in like

83
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:07,830
nine years or something anyway so yours

84
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:10,919
had three villages this happened

85
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:13,800
completely by accident it began with a

86
00:05:10,919 --> 00:05:15,650
conversation between me and Ian in ran

87
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:20,010
the kind with it thank you very much in

88
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:21,599
and it began with her or so show me to a

89
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:23,849
workshop and then there's a person of

90
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,140
work I go to a workshop on a car when

91
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:26,550
you know you've got a car in a box and

92
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:28,260
then the logistics and working

93
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:30,090
everything out and then we're like why

94
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:33,240
I've got a spare room why don't you use

95
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:36,270
that and we'll make a village so now we

96
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:38,419
have car hacking village UK as a support

97
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:41,010
from kind village which possesseth calm

98
00:05:38,419 --> 00:05:42,299
so it's going to be a really cool thing

99
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:45,240
I think I think you've got some really

100
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:47,630
special thank you very much - Colin -

101
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,630
here

102
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:55,440
so I thought well we've got one I've got

103
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:57,390
other small rooms and I now control

104
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:59,370
because I booked out the whole venue

105
00:05:57,390 --> 00:06:03,120
except with that one room that we

106
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:05,220
couldn't get but I have these other

107
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,630
small rooms I was like okay why don't we

108
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:08,400
try and get another one

109
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:10,020
so I think it was Matt horse adjacent

110
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:13,919
when he was lock-picking village Steve

111
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:16,349
said yes so Steve Tim you and Lara and

112
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:17,820
Max sake have all been running this this

113
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:24,450
week this year Val applause for them as

114
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:26,610
well pleased with what people and then

115
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:28,560
came the subject that's very close to my

116
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:32,400
heart for reasons that Amanda alluded to

117
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:35,250
in her own talk we've we've lost too

118
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:39,060
many good and dear friends to the black

119
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:40,560
dawn and you just wish you could whisper

120
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:42,660
in their ear do not go gentle into that

121
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,570
good night and to rage rage against the

122
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:47,070
dying of the light

123
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:49,170
mental health is something that we stick

124
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:53,030
seriously and I am absolutely indebted

125
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:56,010
to Amanda but a friends and helpers or

126
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:57,719
Lizzie as well as James you also

127
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:58,830
instrumental and lots of other friends

128
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:01,770
at the Erin you were doing a lot there

129
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:04,640
as well a big big big thank you for me

130
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:04,640
to you guys thank you

131
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:13,620
dude everyone managed because everybody

132
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:16,240
wanted to manage to get a massage

133
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:18,760
absolutely so I think I think it was a

134
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,740
success I think that this is laid the

135
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:22,510
groundwork for something very very

136
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:24,490
special and I really do hope like catch

137
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:26,320
his arm you know I really hope that we

138
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:27,760
can push both not to mental health but

139
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,960
going by their janmaat big village as

140
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:31,810
well we can really push things forward

141
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:35,140
there so that was kind of like sort of

142
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:38,980
the things that we were doing I can't do

143
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:41,830
this all by myself I get way too many

144
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:43,900
volunteers because I want them to have

145
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:45,430
an easy day in terms of not doing too

146
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:47,620
much but also if they want to go to sea

147
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:50,770
at all they should be able to to that

148
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:54,070
end I get a group this year it was 22

149
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:56,049
volunteers in total and most of those

150
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:58,270
were students and they're sort of sat

151
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:59,340
around in there very partly in the

152
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:01,630

00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:10,570

156
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:12,669

157
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:14,500

my gums like wow so I'd like to tell you

246
00:12:22,029 --> 00:12:26,920

247
00:12:24,519 --> 00:12:29,310
you the cheaper lanyards I got you the

248

249
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:35,290

fine

252
00:12:36,279 --> 00:12:40,689
but also rather than having a piece of

253
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:42,790
card and you're an attempt to the name

254

on it I've got you a nice PCB so that's

255
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:46,630
where the money went and the remaining

256
00:12:44,139 --> 00:12:48,459
eight and a half P or something went

257
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:52,180
towards making sure there was enough

258
00:12:48,459 --> 00:12:54,279
coffee in the venue so I'd like to thank

259
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:57,550
once again Anna who's at the back there

260
00:12:54,279 --> 00:12:59,500
her design is the owl that you all see

261
00:12:57,550 --> 00:13:01,420
everywhere it's actually becoming a

262
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:04,209
little bit iconic I think I'm very

263
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:06,550
grateful to her so please thank you all

264

266
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:14,979
handed out plentiful amounts of tickets

267
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:16,540
that's a really really really good

268
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:19,000
turnout poor Vania the whole story

269
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:22,980
hundred so thank you everyone for

270
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,980
actually getting down here thank you

271
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:33,100
we're now in the moments of

272
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:35,050
annihilations wait one moment the world

273
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:37,029
of life to taste the stars are setting

274
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:40,390
and the caravan stands for the dawn of

275
00:13:37,029 --> 00:13:43,029
nothing Oh make haste what you look like

276
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:44,079
Persian poetry whatever anyway so it's

277
00:13:43,029 --> 00:13:46,060
translated I know

278
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:48,310
goodbye to Omar Khayyam if you're

279
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:50,619
actually curious and the after-party is

280
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:53,140
going to be at the upper little dot so

281
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:55,209
literally as you fall out of one

282
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:57,279
entrance and just go down the road you

283
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:58,029
will find the spire and then that is

284
00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:00,399
where the party is

285
00:13:58,029 --> 00:14:02,139
but what could we be doing at this party

286
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:03,399
surely Rinat is just going to be

287
00:14:02,139 --> 00:14:05,769
drinking although I think that will be

288
00:14:03,399 --> 00:14:08,019
plentiful no no no no no no no no no we

289
00:14:05,769 --> 00:14:10,210
have a real treat we have had a

290
00:14:08,019 --> 00:14:14,210
blockbusters

291
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:16,100
this is at once the most wonderful and

292
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:19,670
shittiest photo shop I have seen in

293
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:21,110

00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:38,060
this evening mascots everyone so thank

298
00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:40,520
you to everyone for being here it's been

299
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:42,650
an incredible experience I could not

300
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:44,329
have asked for it to be better and it

301
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:48,350
kind of remains to be said what shall we

302
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:54,260
do in 2020 sure we'll get the whole

303
00:14:48,350 --> 00:15:00,520
building though provisional date 24th of

304
00:14:54,260 --> 00:15:04,760
January I've already booked it so yes

305
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:06,470
it's provisionally definite yes subject

306
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:08,569
to I don't know something falling down

307
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:10,460
or something so we will go again next

308
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:13,790
year we'll have an even better time I

309
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:16,460
hope I would like to entertain the idea

310
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:18,170
and solve the problem of maybe expanding

311
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:19,190
it a little bit the waiting list for

312
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:22,000
this event was something in the region

313
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:24,380
of a hundred and sixty people long I

314
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,750
think we can grow it a little bit I did

315
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:30,140
we can keep it cool keep it happy keep

316
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:32,060
it fun if people aren't for that let's

317
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:33,980
do that thank you very much for everyone

318
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:37,479
being here I think we should go for the

319
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:37,480
party thank you

320
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:45,310
