1
00:00:03,609 --> 00:00:08,320
my background is ethical hacking

2
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:11,410
architecture I actually got into

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:14,540
technology about ten years ago through

4
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:16,670
network architecture and so I like

5
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:19,220
networks more than I like people or at

6
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:21,680
least that's how I started and actually

7
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:27,200
through security I learned to understand

8
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:30,220
and enjoy people and my most successful

9
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:32,899
achievement is I have a favourite mum

10
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:36,170
yes those are my two favorites they're

11
00:00:32,899 --> 00:00:38,570
absolutely beautiful um and I did a Venn

12
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:42,590
diagram to understand which ones you may

13
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:45,160
want to cut on which ones you don't they

14
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:48,440
like biting toes and that's about it um

15
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:50,000
okay so today we're going to take a

16
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:52,160
little bit of a different approach than

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,550
I traditionally do when it comes to

18
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:57,589
talking about cybersecurity um it's not

19
00:00:55,550 --> 00:01:00,709
gonna be a highly technical talk it's

20
00:00:57,590 --> 00:01:03,980
actually gonna talk about humans because

21
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:07,220
what I've learned in my 10 nurse know

22
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:10,490
odd years of experience is we build

23
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:12,800
programs and solutions for humans but

24
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:14,960
then we actually forget the humans and

25
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:17,420
it doesn't actually work for them so

26
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:19,580
we're gonna try and reset that and

27
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:22,120
approach it from a different point of

28
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:24,979
view so we're gonna start with the brain

29
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:28,280
how it develops we're gonna talk about

30
00:01:24,979 --> 00:01:30,260
how we go from learning a skill to being

31
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:33,380
skilled and we're going to talk about

32
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:36,350
types of learning our motivations and

33
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:38,000
how to keep people motivated and then

34
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:39,350
building the holistic meaning the

35
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,060
overall program that actually

36
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:42,740
incorporates everything and then I'm

37
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:45,979
actually going to touch on traumatic

38
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:47,449
situations only because it's actually

39
00:01:45,979 --> 00:01:49,820
really beneficial when it comes to

40
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:51,920
building your Incident Response Teams is

41
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:55,460
actually choosing the people that work

42
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:57,290
in those situations because nothing

43
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:59,210
worse than having a brilliant team

44
00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:02,930
that's highly skilled that then has to

45
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:07,369
deal with PTSD after the incident has

46
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:11,540
occurred so keeping that in mind so my

47
00:02:07,369 --> 00:02:14,540
talk I developed through I've done a bit

48
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:15,209
of research in the last year on how we

49
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:17,400
function

50
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:19,500
we develop and how our brain works

51
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:22,980
mainly because I wanted to get to know

52
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:23,880
myself and understand why I am the way I

53
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:27,060
am

54
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:29,160
David David Eagleman created a brilliant

55
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:30,540
book called the brain so a lot of the

56
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:34,280
content that I'm bringing up today's

57
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:37,769
from that book and he's quite was them

58
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:40,380
as you can read it basically your brain

59
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:42,630
the way it develops is the synapses of

60
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:45,840
the connections are strengthened through

61
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:48,870
repeated connections so as you do it

62
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:51,870
it's continuously strengthening those

63
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:53,490
synapses and so actually the way you are

64
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:55,860
is based on what you're not doing

65
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:59,400
because that's what's getting removed

66
00:02:55,860 --> 00:03:01,620
from your brain so the way the brain

67
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:05,130
develops when you're born you're

68
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:08,010
actually born with a very simple lacking

69
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:10,380
of connections in your brain and and I

70
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:12,060
always thought growing up that horses

71
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:14,250
map must be more intelligent than humans

72
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:16,230
because they're born and then they can

73
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:18,780
walk right away whereas we're quite

74
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:22,220
pathetic for quite a few years and the

75
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:24,960
truth actually is is they're they're pre

76
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:26,640
fond to the pre connected and so they

77
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:29,040
actually have a limited capability to

78
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:32,519
grow versus us which are born with a

79
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:35,310
very boring lack of connection pain

80
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:38,370
gives us more opportunities to grow and

81
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:40,500
change and create different solutions

82
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:42,150
for different scenarios basically it

83
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:44,580
makes us different based on our

84
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:47,370
experiences and then that two years old

85
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:49,410
that's actually the peak so you have an

86
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:51,810
exceptional amount of synapses so that's

87
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:53,400
connections see it's up to I think 100

88
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:56,070
trillion is what you said in the book

89
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:57,930
and that means actually then you're

90
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:59,280
going to start scaling back and by the

91
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:04,050
time you're an adult you actually have

92
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:06,990
50% less that are repaired off and again

93
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:09,120
how it strengthened is repeating how its

94
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:14,300
weakened in and then eventually removed

95
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:14,300
is you're not doing it so for example

96
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:18,829
like if you to just play screamed

97
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:29,049
I'm going to top that slides and I'll

98
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:32,919
give you slides after and Twitter but

99
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:34,330
basically the way are this is not your

100
00:04:32,919 --> 00:04:36,669
work okay

101
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:39,340
the way our brain works is as we repeat

102
00:04:36,669 --> 00:04:42,340
something connections are strengthened

103
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:44,758
as we don't do it their weekends and so

104
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:47,229
that's why we all have different skills

105
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:48,999
when people tell me you know users are

106
00:04:47,229 --> 00:04:51,159
stupid they're not doing something or

107
00:04:48,999 --> 00:04:53,590
they don't understand something the

108
00:04:51,159 --> 00:04:55,840
reality is it's because they haven't

109
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:58,299
repeated that thing over and over again

110
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:00,340
to create that connection I'm going to

111
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:01,419
use my phone for my slides so I know

112
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:07,750
where I am

113
00:05:01,419 --> 00:05:12,430
give me one second apologies yeah don't

114
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:13,659
like me that's brilliant

115
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:18,490
I've actually never had my computer

116
00:05:13,659 --> 00:05:20,620
freeze competitive and it's amazing it's

117
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:32,500
my work computer to you I'm gonna

118
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:54,879
complain universe I promise I have

119
00:05:32,500 --> 00:06:17,379
actually quite cool slides probably my

120
00:05:54,879 --> 00:06:18,819
password so um before I continue I'm

121
00:06:17,379 --> 00:06:21,069
just gonna say that I actually bought

122
00:06:18,819 --> 00:06:23,020
prizes if you ask me questions so you

123
00:06:21,069 --> 00:06:26,370
kind of have to pay attention because

124
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:26,370
the prices are kind of cute and

125
00:06:27,259 --> 00:06:35,729
hey I don't know if that's gonna work so

126
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:38,220
I have a pretty cipher to show you in a

127
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:40,740
minute but basically when you're

128
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:44,100
learning a skill your brain is in

129
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:47,039
something called the bait of wavelengths

130
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:49,500
frequency and then when you're skilled

131
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:51,539
is in the Alpha and the difference there

132
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:53,060
is a base a wavelength

133
00:06:51,539 --> 00:06:55,380
means your brain is constantly

134
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:58,680
troubleshooting is expanding a lot of

135
00:06:55,380 --> 00:07:00,900
energy and it's it's trying to visit

136
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:05,750
like manually think through each step

137
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:08,219
that looks good and verses in the Alpha

138
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:11,810
wavelength frequency your brains

139
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:19,229
actually at rest and so think of it as

140
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:21,750
when you're I think of it as when you're

141
00:07:19,229 --> 00:07:24,840
learning a skill and it's really

142
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:28,139
challenging it's really tiring and you

143
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:30,948
feel kind of clunky if that makes sense

144
00:07:28,139 --> 00:07:32,699
so I recently picked up something called

145
00:07:30,949 --> 00:07:34,770
Brazilian Jujitsu

146
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:37,770
I'm absolutely terrible but it's a lot

147
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:41,400
of fun it's like aggressive cuddling you

148
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:46,799
end up with a lot of bruises but when I

149
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:49,500
started and I am I mean I'm still

150
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:51,990
but I was really slow and everything I

151
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:54,180
was doing help Mike I mean when I say I

152
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:57,599
started I mean a second of January so

153
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:59,310
I'm really experienced at this point but

154
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:01,650
I would do something gonna be really

155
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:03,030
slow arrest as my partner he's black

156
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:04,530
belt and he'd do it and he'd make it

157
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:08,309
look really easy and I just get really

158
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:10,409
angry at him mainly but um it's because

159
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:12,539
in my I'm thinking in the face of

160
00:08:10,409 --> 00:08:14,430
wavelength I'm manually thinking of each

161
00:08:12,539 --> 00:08:16,800
step on counting okay this now this now

162
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:18,599
there's not this versus him it's

163
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:21,810
actually in his subconscious and he's

164
00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:26,550
not actually thinking about it and so

165
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:30,210
he's at rest he's very relaxed and he

166
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:32,250
can do something without without

167
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:34,679
thinking and that actually opens more

168
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:36,719
opportunities for them which is why when

169
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:38,250
you come to cyber security and you're

170
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:40,620
training people they get

171
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:42,179
frustrated or they're really tired at

172
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:44,580
the end of the day because they've been

173
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:47,550
thinking about every single step that

174
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:49,470
they have to walk through mass is you it

175
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:52,410
comes naturally you don't even think

176
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:56,190
about it I think this is going to work

177
00:08:52,410 --> 00:09:00,120
now I'm and so one thing I like to

178
00:08:56,190 --> 00:09:04,860
remind people is when they are doing

179
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:07,160
that is this gonna work amazing when

180
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:09,900
they're teaching you have to give them

181
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:12,449
you have to be patient with people and

182
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:14,880
give them the time to actually develop

183
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:17,420
that skill and slowly think about it and

184
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:20,310
understand and make those connections

185
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:22,319
versus just being like okay drop you in

186
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:24,030
the deep end just know how to do this

187
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,950
and do it within a certain amount of

188
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:27,390
time and if you don't do it properly

189
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:29,670
you're going to be punished because

190
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:32,430
that's just going to create a lot of

191
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:34,439
anxiety and a lot of stress and a lot of

192
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:38,599
actually we're gonna do it our way and

193
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:41,270
find ways around your solution so again

194
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:44,790
when you're learning think of it as a

195
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:46,370
software-based process your brain is

196
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:48,510
making these connections and

197
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:51,360
strengthening them but there's nothing

198
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:53,550
hard-coded in yet versus when you're

199
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:56,100
skilled at something it's actually a

200
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:57,599
physical change in your brain and

201
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:59,460
there's actually it's almost like it's a

202
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,140
hardware so it's working without you

203
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:06,150
thinking it's in your subconscious brain

204
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:07,980
and it's a lot quicker I'm in the

205
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:10,740
learning you're using your prefrontal

206
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:14,490
cortex parietal cortex cerebellum the

207
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:17,750
cerebellum is a it's basically the flow

208
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:20,100
of movement accuracy and perfect timing

209
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:22,170
if your man will be thinking through all

210
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:25,290
of this is using these expens and like I

211
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:27,360
said it's a lot of energy versus in the

212
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:30,630
hardware it's actually below your

213
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:32,670
subconscious and it can be so hard coded

214
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:35,750
in that it actually is making the

215
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:38,069
decisions in your spinal cord um they

216
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:41,010
unfortunately did an experiment I don't

217
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:43,110
know when years ago where these cats had

218
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:45,030
a massive amount of their brain removed

219
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:46,530
but they still knew how to walk and

220
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:48,209
that's because it wasn't actually the

221
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:51,240
brain that was doing the thinking about

222
00:10:48,209 --> 00:10:51,689
walking it was their spinal cord think

223
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,100
of

224
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:55,140
you're walking upstairs and you're

225
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:56,670
talking you're not thinking about each

226
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:58,650
and every step each and every movement

227
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:59,969
to get up the stairs you're not thinking

228
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:01,079
about how your tongue is working you're

229
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:05,490
not thinking about how your lips are

230
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:07,980
working you're just doing it and then

231
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:10,890
the last thing I want to mention on this

232
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:13,530
side was a lot of times when I go into

233
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:16,020
an organization people that are maybe

234
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:18,540
are from the older generation or maybe

235
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:20,880
they're they've been doing what they do

236
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:21,930
for a very long time and they say you

237
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,420
know what I'm too old to learn something

238
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:26,640
new I don't I don't know how to do this

239
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:30,569
I don't understand it then you can refer

240
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:32,280
them to London taxi drivers and learn

241
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:35,400
the taxi drivers if you don't know they

242
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:40,100
have to memorize an exceptional amount

243
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:42,630
of routes in London like common

244
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:46,410
attractions where tourists may want to

245
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:49,650
go to and they're learning that as an

246
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:52,380
adult and in their brain it's actually

247
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:54,959
physically changing there something

248
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:57,150
called the hippocampus which is for your

249
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:58,650
memory and your it's your spatial memory

250
00:11:57,150 --> 00:12:02,280
part of your brain it actually

251
00:11:58,650 --> 00:12:04,170
physically grows in size so that's an

252
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:06,780
exceptional talent if you ask me because

253
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:08,280
I'm at remembering things but the

254
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:10,110
fact that they can actually do that as

255
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:12,900
the older as their brain has already

256
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:15,780
fully developed means that somebody

257
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:18,810
learning how to create a secure password

258
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:20,670
or use a VPN service for example it is

259
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:25,589
possible for them to do it you just have

260
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:29,370
to support them in that process types of

261
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:33,750
learning so I like this because I am NOT

262
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:36,900
a traditional way of learning I ia I

263
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:39,360
pick up things I really like and I mimic

264
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:42,240
people or I do this or do that and I

265
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:44,400
learn random skills and so in my opinion

266
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,380
I don't feel like I'm overall really

267
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:47,100
skilled but I've got a lot of random

268
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:49,230
things I'm good at

269
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:51,600
and it's because without realizing I'll

270
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:53,910
pick up these different things depending

271
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:56,520
on my motivation and then I'll actually

272
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:58,530
memorize certain random processes if

273
00:12:56,520 --> 00:13:00,600
that makes sense but anyway classical

274
00:12:58,530 --> 00:13:05,579
conditioning this is what you think of

275
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:08,460
in training so you think stimuli one and

276
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:11,310
I to create a relationship and so that

277
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:16,140
actually at at the end of it because

278
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:19,739
it's such a strong relationship you can

279
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:22,110
do semi to which will actually produce

280
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:24,450
Errol I one think of Pavlov's dog if

281
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:28,950
that makes sense so he would feed them

282
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:31,560
and make a bell sound and so the food

283
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:33,240
stimuli one the Bell was stimuli to and

284
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:35,219
then he would ring a bell and their

285
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:38,640
saliva glands would start to produce

286
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:40,680
extra saliva because it's in their brain

287
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:43,319
it's made that connection that that Bell

288
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:44,939
means food

289
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:47,580
I'm not saying train your employees that

290
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:51,410
way but I mean you could people like

291
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:55,860
food but that's one way that we learn

292
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:57,120
another one is operant conditioning so

293
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:59,910
this one to me I thought was quite

294
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:01,740
interesting because it's actually

295
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:03,510
talking about positive and negative

296
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:06,300
reinforcement and positive and negative

297
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:08,370
punishment which in my mind punishment

298
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:12,750
sounds negative but actually isn't

299
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:15,510
necessarily so again it's association

300
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:18,060
between behavior and consequences so

301
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:21,480
positive reinforcement for example is

302
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:25,890
when a favorable outcome event or reward

303
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:27,810
occurs after an action think of if

304
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:29,699
anyone that has children or maybe

305
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:31,170
younger siblings and that and they were

306
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:33,510
going to learning how to be potty

307
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:35,430
trained I'm I know when I taught

308
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:37,350
children how to be potty trained I give

309
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:39,239
them a little gold star sticker because

310
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:40,920
I love stars and all I love stickers and

311
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:42,510
in my mind that makes sense but every

312
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:44,160
time they would go movie in the toilet

313
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:46,290
they get a star and that was really

314
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:48,209
exciting so they'd be really excited and

315
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:51,360
start bragging about going to the

316
00:14:48,210 --> 00:14:52,350
washroom which is interesting but they

317
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:55,560
get to stuff

318
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:58,850
I think of providing a treat for a dog

319
00:14:55,560 --> 00:15:01,560
that's done a trick so after you have

320
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:02,760
associated that you say roll over they

321
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:05,369
roll over because they know that that's

322
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:08,069
gonna give them a treat negative

323
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:11,550
reinforcement is actually strengthened

324
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:15,199
by stopping removing or avoiding a

325
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:19,309
negative outcome or adverse awesomeness

326
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:21,079
think of when you are teaching your

327
00:15:19,309 --> 00:15:23,329
child again potty training because

328
00:15:21,079 --> 00:15:24,649
that's an easy example you know they

329
00:15:23,329 --> 00:15:27,319
wash they were going to wash your hands

330
00:15:24,649 --> 00:15:29,839
and hands are wet how do they dry it so

331
00:15:27,319 --> 00:15:31,669
you say okay wash hands your hands are

332
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:33,439
wet you can from a tower they rub their

333
00:15:31,669 --> 00:15:35,569
hands in the towel and then they have

334
00:15:33,439 --> 00:15:37,939
dry hands I don't like having one hand

335
00:15:35,569 --> 00:15:40,878
so that's me is a negatives tonight and

336
00:15:37,939 --> 00:15:42,498
that's removing it so in the future when

337
00:15:40,879 --> 00:15:44,509
they have wet hands for other any other

338
00:15:42,499 --> 00:15:46,609
reason to actually rub them because that

339
00:15:44,509 --> 00:15:49,899
is that association to that's going to

340
00:15:46,609 --> 00:15:52,279
remove the water think of crying and

341
00:15:49,899 --> 00:15:54,350
when you don't want to do something

342
00:15:52,279 --> 00:15:57,819
maybe I'm like really and angry at you

343
00:15:54,350 --> 00:16:01,939
and I cry you probably leaves me alone

344
00:15:57,819 --> 00:16:03,949
so in three that's a way of asserting oh

345
00:16:01,939 --> 00:16:06,559
wow I don't want to talk to you or maybe

346
00:16:03,949 --> 00:16:08,649
I don't want to eat mushy peas so I mean

347
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:11,719
that makes more sense for children but

348
00:16:08,649 --> 00:16:13,999
maybe I'm really emotional and so that

349
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:16,749
stimuli would then be removed and then I

350
00:16:13,999 --> 00:16:20,649
could be happy again now thinking of

351
00:16:16,749 --> 00:16:24,829
punishment so positive punishment is

352
00:16:20,649 --> 00:16:25,819
adding something unpleasant so I don't

353
00:16:24,829 --> 00:16:28,758
know if we're allowed to spank children

354
00:16:25,819 --> 00:16:30,709
anymore but that's an example um or

355
00:16:28,759 --> 00:16:34,309
think of when somebody commits a crime

356
00:16:30,709 --> 00:16:36,768
they get a prison sentence maybe it's I

357
00:16:34,309 --> 00:16:39,049
don't know or they get me a sentence

358
00:16:36,769 --> 00:16:41,269
necessarily prison so maybe they get a

359
00:16:39,049 --> 00:16:45,470
fine or something and so they're adding

360
00:16:41,269 --> 00:16:47,660
in a negative punishment the positive is

361
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:49,879
actually not being positive in happy

362
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:51,649
positive in adding the negative

363
00:16:49,879 --> 00:16:56,029
punishment is actually taking something

364
00:16:51,649 --> 00:16:57,470
away that's a negative such as you're in

365
00:16:56,029 --> 00:16:59,779
jail but you have really positive

366
00:16:57,470 --> 00:17:03,759
behavior you're being really helpful or

367
00:16:59,779 --> 00:17:03,759
something they'll reduce your sentence

368
00:17:04,929 --> 00:17:09,889
sorry I'm a bit sick and and then

369
00:17:07,819 --> 00:17:12,438
observational learning that is where you

370
00:17:09,888 --> 00:17:14,719
you view an action you store it in your

371
00:17:12,439 --> 00:17:16,639
memory and then you mimic it and the

372
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:19,579
reason you continue mimicking it is

373
00:17:16,638 --> 00:17:21,769
because after you've done it it becomes

374
00:17:19,579 --> 00:17:25,638
a positive outcome for you so think back

375
00:17:21,769 --> 00:17:28,930
to my adventures with jiu-jitsu I watch

376
00:17:25,638 --> 00:17:31,959
the instructor present something to

377
00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:35,740
I'm a store it my memory and then I

378
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:38,830
mimic it on the person that I'm rolling

379
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:41,590
with and if it's successful I'll then

380
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:44,590
continue mimicking it later on when I'm

381
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:46,689
doing more sparring personal experiences

382
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:49,120
I think the guy tripping is a brilliant

383
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:51,870
icon for that because it's how we

384
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:54,699
perceive them and react to the world

385
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:57,189
think of a situation what you that

386
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:59,050
you've been in where it's had a negative

387
00:17:57,190 --> 00:18:01,170
outcome or it has a positive outcome and

388
00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:07,590
you've either repeated or removed that

389
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:10,360
action sorry now I'm going to talk about

390
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:13,060
motivations quickly and then watch the

391
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:15,939
fit into the fun stuff of what the hook

392
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:19,830
like this talking is but yeah so

393
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:22,780
intrinsic and extrinsic motivations so

394
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:25,020
how are you motivated think of when you

395
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:27,370
want to do something why do you do it

396
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:32,080
there is something called extrinsic

397
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:34,479
which is an external thing that I want

398
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:35,860
Mickey you want to do something like the

399
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:38,410
example I think that's supposed to be

400
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:42,340
money so maybe you'll get a reward for

401
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:44,620
providing inflation or maybe it's you'll

402
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:46,929
be punished for not doing something such

403
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:50,320
as you know falling victim to a phishing

404
00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:52,810
campaign maybe you get punished for that

405
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:54,850
or maybe you forget to enter your time

406
00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:56,620
sheet and you work for one of these big

407
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:58,030
force that announcer if you don't enter

408
00:18:56,620 --> 00:19:01,629
your time sheet you get docked at that

409
00:18:58,030 --> 00:19:06,330
verb 100 quid that's a point negative so

410
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:09,730
you probably enter your time on time or

411
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:10,929
one company I work for if I sent a name

412
00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:13,570
to them and they ended up actually

413
00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:17,200
hiring that person I would be paid quite

414
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:18,760
a large amount so I'll likely add a lot

415
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:21,940
of names so that they don't have to go

416
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:24,940
through recruiters intrinsic motivation

417
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:26,920
is as you can imagine internal this is

418
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:28,480
feeling a part of something bigger

419
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:30,520
feeling like you're making a difference

420
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:36,090
in the world it's it's what's motivating

421
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:39,060
you inside I speak out and do talks on

422
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:41,879
domestic abuse and violence helping the

423
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:43,830
victims and survivors abuse

424
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:46,140
I'm intrinsically motivated because I

425
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:47,639
have been that survivor I've been in

426
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:50,700
that situation and I want to make a

427
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:52,380
difference in the world and so generally

428
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:54,900
I don't get paid for those talks but I

429
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:58,190
still am motivated to do it because for

430
00:19:54,900 --> 00:20:00,630
me it's a it's a big part of my life

431
00:19:58,190 --> 00:20:01,710
extrinsically if I was paid awesome but

432
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:06,210
that's not actually what's going to

433
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:07,770
motivate me in the long term so how did

434
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:11,190
we get here in the world of technology

435
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:13,290
that is more of a field by design than

436
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:15,090
security by design so now we're going

437
00:20:13,290 --> 00:20:16,670
into actually what the point of this

438
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:18,959
talk is and why we've talked about

439
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:21,840
motivations learning types and how our

440
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:24,750
brain works you probably know all this

441
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:27,030
as of what you guys do in your field but

442
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:31,140
when I do this talk at more corporate

443
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:33,480
events the c-suites are like ah that

444
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:38,809
makes so much sense why didn't we think

445
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:41,309
of that and the thing is we when we buy

446
00:20:38,809 --> 00:20:45,139
technology we employ software when we

447
00:20:41,309 --> 00:20:48,540
buy hardware we generally want to spend

448
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:50,220
under certain amounts or you know within

449
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:52,559
our budget but we want the best of the

450
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:54,450
newest and the most exciting well that

451
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:57,540
kind of motivates the organization's to

452
00:20:54,450 --> 00:21:00,690
say okay well we need something quick to

453
00:20:57,540 --> 00:21:04,110
market that is affordable and everybody

454
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:06,420
likes to buy which actually leads to our

455
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:10,350
forgetting or not incorporating maybe

456
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:12,030
security controls reviews validations

457
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:14,699
throughout the development process and

458
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:16,550
so that it's like the quick to market

459
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:20,850
you've to market and then we have these

460
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:25,790
failure by design technology IOT that is

461
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:29,669
more successful as a botnet than camera

462
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:31,980
the reason I bring that up is in my mind

463
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:34,820
the future is actually moving to a

464
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:37,920
situation where you have two outcomes

465
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:40,290
you have the organizations that care for

466
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:42,420
their users and when they're breech for

467
00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:45,360
example and it's okay because they put

468
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:47,730
motor mitigations in place and the users

469
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:49,379
worst they may be still impacted it's

470
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:50,100
not as exceptional as something like

471
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:52,200
Equifax

472
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:54,990
and then you have the second situation

473
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:57,059
where when an organized

474
00:21:54,990 --> 00:21:59,820
station is breached they didn't put any

475
00:21:57,059 --> 00:22:01,770
controls in place and hello Equifax and

476
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:06,120
and that's going to make a huge

477
00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:08,790
difference in our world because if you

478
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:11,459
were a British citizen you might not

479
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:14,850
understand but I bring up a Koufax

480
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:19,200
because in the US and Canada I'm

481
00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:21,750
Canadian I don't sound it but and if my

482
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:23,640
social insurance number is taken or in

483
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:28,200
the US I think it's social security

484
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:31,290
number my life can be ruined and there's

485
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:33,059
children in the u.s. that are bankrupt

486
00:22:31,290 --> 00:22:34,980
and they're not old enough to take out a

487
00:22:33,059 --> 00:22:37,440
credit card for example and it's because

488
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:39,450
their family had that number that social

489
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:41,880
insurance number or the Friends of

490
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:43,410
somebody had that number and was able to

491
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:45,750
take out credit in their name before

492
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:49,290
they were able to walk for example and

493
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:51,720
so in that situation when that company

494
00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:52,590
was breached for the people that you

495
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:54,179
know are older

496
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:57,629
that's rooms that that ruins their lives

497
00:22:54,179 --> 00:23:00,059
so if you look at my future images world

498
00:22:57,630 --> 00:23:03,450
if Equifax had put those controls in

499
00:23:00,059 --> 00:23:06,389
place and maybe prioritized those that

500
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:09,150
data effectively those people wouldn't

501
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:10,920
be as impacted versus they were the

502
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:12,620
cause weren't in place and that's

503
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:18,330
changed their life for quite a negative

504
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:21,059
situation that's kind of how I see your

505
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:23,899
responsibility as the tax in industry

506
00:23:21,059 --> 00:23:26,730
and the reason I say that is because

507
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:30,000
you're the person at the front minds

508
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:33,630
that maybe you're developers or your

509
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:36,090
network architects or your I have to

510
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:39,420
know whatever else there is out there

511
00:23:36,090 --> 00:23:41,610
other things that I'm not skilled in um

512
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:43,440
you're the one that has the ability to

513
00:23:41,610 --> 00:23:45,780
say wait this isn't right we can make

514
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:47,610
this change it's simple stuff from the

515
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:49,649
beginning let's make a change in their

516
00:23:47,610 --> 00:23:52,678
architectural design before it goes to

517
00:23:49,650 --> 00:23:55,290
production because think of the very

518
00:23:52,679 --> 00:23:57,540
first vehicle I think it was Ford

519
00:23:55,290 --> 00:24:00,120
they built a car they realized after

520
00:23:57,540 --> 00:24:03,360
mass production that people die really

521
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:05,300
easily when they get hit Ford was like

522
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:07,469
or it might not be a Ford I might be

523
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:08,570
saying wrong company say don't cut me a

524
00:24:07,470 --> 00:24:11,520
letter

525
00:24:08,570 --> 00:24:13,560
it's actually cheaper for us to pay the

526
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:16,470
lawsuits of the people's horrendous

527
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:19,020
deaths than it is to change it's just

528
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:20,460
like a software and a hardware if you

529
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:22,650
don't start from the beginning it

530
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:24,600
actually can be cheaper to just deal

531
00:24:22,650 --> 00:24:27,000
with the consequences and it is change

532
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:29,969
it so it's actually your job to then

533
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:32,730
incorporate security by design and the

534
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:34,530
culture and awareness from the beginning

535
00:24:32,730 --> 00:24:36,990
so that's why I think this is very

536
00:24:34,530 --> 00:24:41,340
important top creating a holistic

537
00:24:36,990 --> 00:24:43,610
program in three steps what time is it

538
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:49,679
how much time do I have

539
00:24:43,610 --> 00:24:52,530
yes lovely okay perfect yeah fair enough

540
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:55,560
so step one have the right people step

541
00:24:52,530 --> 00:25:01,200
two is speak the same language and step

542
00:24:55,560 --> 00:25:04,230
three is maintained your program so step

543
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:05,520
one have the right people I attended it

544
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:09,600
well I guess I spoke at a conference

545
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:13,320
last year a belief and I think she was

546
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:15,389
the keynote this lady can't remember her

547
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:17,700
name but I wrote a blog post on her so

548
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:21,360
asked me after but she said we need to

549
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:24,600
stop hiring in our own image I'm guilty

550
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:26,550
of that and I think network architects

551
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:29,879
are brilliant I think people that care

552
00:25:26,550 --> 00:25:30,510
about the network awesome developers are

553
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:34,080
cool

554
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:37,230
Oh network architects they're brilliant

555
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:38,639
and that's really unfair and can lead to

556
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:42,480
really really really insecure

557
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:44,850
environment because I have sand bits of

558
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:47,850
the architecture I understand the

559
00:25:44,850 --> 00:25:50,490
physical layer also great ah the other

560
00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:53,340
layers because I prioritize my things

561
00:25:50,490 --> 00:25:56,370
accordingly when I hire in my own image

562
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:58,590
I look at people that focus on that

563
00:25:56,370 --> 00:26:03,389
maybe not so much on things I think are

564
00:25:58,590 --> 00:26:05,220
boring and I become very focused on one

565
00:26:03,390 --> 00:26:08,420
thing and forget everything around me

566
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:11,850
which as you command is not very skill

567
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:15,840
diversity in skill sets and points of

568
00:26:11,850 --> 00:26:17,879
view in culture that's going to make us

569
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:21,689
more secure so hiring the right people

570
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:22,440
is meaning not just gender and although

571
00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:24,240
you

572
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:27,090
that's important you know hiring people

573
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:28,289
that are male female and non-binary

574
00:26:27,090 --> 00:26:29,158
that's going to make a difference

575
00:26:28,289 --> 00:26:32,450
because they're going to have a

576
00:26:29,159 --> 00:26:34,789
different point of view as well but also

577
00:26:32,450 --> 00:26:37,169
hiring somebody with a different skill

578
00:26:34,789 --> 00:26:39,059
or a different point of view different

579
00:26:37,169 --> 00:26:41,639
life experiences going back to how we

580
00:26:39,059 --> 00:26:43,710
learn our brain is physically different

581
00:26:41,639 --> 00:26:45,719
from each other and so having that

582
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:47,850
layered approach not just in our

583
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:50,759
technology but also in our humans going

584
00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:54,899
to make a difference and when I started

585
00:26:50,759 --> 00:26:56,549
I had this short term project years and

586
00:26:54,899 --> 00:26:59,129
years ago at a software development

587
00:26:56,549 --> 00:27:02,940
company not a developer I don't know how

588
00:26:59,129 --> 00:27:05,759
to do that to me it's magic um but they

589
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:07,889
hired me because I was in the interview

590
00:27:05,759 --> 00:27:09,779
and they're like okay here's your really

591
00:27:07,889 --> 00:27:13,830
really really challenging technical

592
00:27:09,779 --> 00:27:16,500
questions say you're in a situation or

593
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:18,178
your switch dies just like okay and

594
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:21,059
they're like and you only have two

595
00:27:18,179 --> 00:27:23,009
switches to replace it but they're small

596
00:27:21,059 --> 00:27:25,408
so you have to use both of them and also

597
00:27:23,009 --> 00:27:27,269
okay so do you have the configuration

598
00:27:25,409 --> 00:27:29,129
backed up do you have spanning tree

599
00:27:27,269 --> 00:27:31,679
protocol turned on and they just looked

600
00:27:29,129 --> 00:27:35,269
at me and the eyes were like a glass

601
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:38,340
seven they're like that's the solution

602
00:27:35,269 --> 00:27:41,730
has took us three bloody days to solve

603
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:42,658
that that was my technical question and

604
00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:44,220
it wasn't because they weren't

605
00:27:42,659 --> 00:27:46,980
intelligent they built this amazing

606
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:50,250
software they could do things that I

607
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:52,350
could not even imagine and without even

608
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:56,009
thinking this how do you think googling

609
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:57,928
I mean talk about skill but is because

610
00:27:56,009 --> 00:27:59,639
that's what they understood they didn't

611
00:27:57,929 --> 00:28:03,899
understand the physical layer and they

612
00:27:59,639 --> 00:28:05,100
hired me to fill that gap um and in my

613
00:28:03,899 --> 00:28:07,559
opinion that was a really simple

614
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:09,149
technical question but his took as as

615
00:28:07,559 --> 00:28:13,019
you said as I said three days for them

616
00:28:09,149 --> 00:28:13,830
to solve it's not again because I was

617
00:28:13,019 --> 00:28:16,590
magical

618
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:17,580
I was quite new to industry but I had a

619
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:22,158
different point of view different

620
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:24,990
experience of different talent as well

621
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:27,090
hiring the right people is awesome maybe

622
00:28:24,990 --> 00:28:30,570
you hire a diverse team you know you

623
00:28:27,090 --> 00:28:33,149
hire a diverse skills you hire I don't

624
00:28:30,570 --> 00:28:34,850
know really cool exciting people but you

625
00:28:33,149 --> 00:28:36,418
don't support them at all and they leave

626
00:28:34,850 --> 00:28:40,619
that's not having

627
00:28:36,419 --> 00:28:43,109
people you need to invest in your talent

628
00:28:40,619 --> 00:28:46,199
so maybe you're a team lead and you have

629
00:28:43,109 --> 00:28:47,879
the ability to tell your senior

630
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:50,489
leadership we need to pay for this map

631
00:28:47,879 --> 00:28:52,619
training we need to invest in this

632
00:28:50,489 --> 00:28:54,869
person in this skill and this person in

633
00:28:52,619 --> 00:28:55,949
that skill because that's going to make

634
00:28:54,869 --> 00:28:57,959
a difference because they're going to

635
00:28:55,950 --> 00:29:00,210
want to continue staying with you

636
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:01,919
because again you're extremely

637
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:03,480
motivating them in the sense that you

638
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:05,489
know you got to pay them properly but

639
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:06,659
also intrinsically motivating them in

640
00:29:05,489 --> 00:29:08,100
the sense that they feel like they're

641
00:29:06,659 --> 00:29:10,009
making a difference and they're learning

642
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:13,259
and they have a sense of mastery and

643
00:29:10,009 --> 00:29:16,080
think of gamification principles one of

644
00:29:13,259 --> 00:29:17,340
those things is mastery and it's you're

645
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,960
learning a skill and you're getting

646
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:21,119
really good at it and that's a great way

647
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:26,399
to motivate people and a great way to

648
00:29:21,119 --> 00:29:28,350
even retain your talent speak the same

649
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:30,629
language this I feel like you've

650
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:33,119
probably run into a lot I know ideas

651
00:29:30,629 --> 00:29:35,759
especially when I started I still do and

652
00:29:33,119 --> 00:29:38,908
I get annoyed but it's really simple and

653
00:29:35,759 --> 00:29:40,769
when I look at solutions I say oh you

654
00:29:38,909 --> 00:29:43,980
know this is the solution I looked at

655
00:29:40,769 --> 00:29:46,440
the budget I looked at the you know key

656
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:48,359
points for success at this organization

657
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:50,999
I looked at our challenges this is my

658
00:29:48,359 --> 00:29:53,369
solution but I don't give them that

659
00:29:50,999 --> 00:29:57,950
whole background I just say this is a

660
00:29:53,369 --> 00:30:01,139
solution give me money and they say no

661
00:29:57,950 --> 00:30:04,019
and it's because I'm not speaking their

662
00:30:01,139 --> 00:30:05,789
language I'm not saying this is my risk

663
00:30:04,019 --> 00:30:08,340
based approach this is how I approached

664
00:30:05,789 --> 00:30:10,889
it this is my evidence and this is why

665
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:14,189
you should trust me to give me a heck of

666
00:30:10,889 --> 00:30:17,309
a lot more money this is why I view the

667
00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:22,499
budget as two million versus one million

668
00:30:17,309 --> 00:30:26,129
and you view it as five hundred you have

669
00:30:22,499 --> 00:30:26,850
to speak the language that they

670
00:30:26,129 --> 00:30:29,789
understand

671
00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:31,830
you can't expect your senior leadership

672
00:30:29,789 --> 00:30:33,389
if they're not technical to understand

673
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:35,699
the technical requirements you can't

674
00:30:33,389 --> 00:30:38,039
expect them to trust you right off the

675
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:39,690
bat you have to look at it from their

676
00:30:38,039 --> 00:30:41,970
point of view you have to provide them

677
00:30:39,690 --> 00:30:44,309
with your background because as you

678
00:30:41,970 --> 00:30:46,470
build that trust they're not gonna have

679
00:30:44,309 --> 00:30:48,359
to see as much evidence over time which

680
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:50,320
is fine but they'll be more confident

681
00:30:48,359 --> 00:30:52,369
when they're making their decision

682
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:54,499
but you also have to think of it from a

683
00:30:52,369 --> 00:30:56,299
risk point of view because as I see in

684
00:30:54,499 --> 00:30:58,579
the bottom one of my colleagues created

685
00:30:56,299 --> 00:31:01,609
this slide it's beautiful not my typical

686
00:30:58,579 --> 00:31:03,739
side because it makes more sense but he

687
00:31:01,609 --> 00:31:05,809
said that a lot of executives say are we

688
00:31:03,739 --> 00:31:07,249
secure and there's no attack in the

689
00:31:05,809 --> 00:31:10,789
right mind that would be like yeah

690
00:31:07,249 --> 00:31:12,499
totally work - oh Lisa care because no

691
00:31:10,789 --> 00:31:17,029
you're not you never will be there's no

692
00:31:12,499 --> 00:31:21,200
such thing as perfect security it's just

693
00:31:17,029 --> 00:31:23,570
not that simple it's well I mean kind of

694
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:25,399
secure but if you say that to an exact

695
00:31:23,570 --> 00:31:28,070
they're gonna be like well I mean you

696
00:31:25,399 --> 00:31:30,439
don't really need that money I'm you

697
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:34,129
have to find a solution that's going to

698
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:37,039
work for the execs work for the users

699
00:31:34,129 --> 00:31:41,299
and actually you know allow you to sleep

700
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:45,259
at night step3

701
00:31:41,299 --> 00:31:47,389
for maintaining your program and it's

702
00:31:45,259 --> 00:31:51,099
all fine and dandy if you create a

703
00:31:47,389 --> 00:31:54,728
solution has proper metrics it has a

704
00:31:51,099 --> 00:31:58,458
baseline it has a solution that actually

705
00:31:54,729 --> 00:32:01,190
works for the organization and then you

706
00:31:58,459 --> 00:32:04,249
send it to the people and then you walk

707
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:05,779
away because that's not going to be

708
00:32:04,249 --> 00:32:07,579
maintained and that's actually not

709
00:32:05,779 --> 00:32:09,079
ultimately going to be successful and

710
00:32:07,579 --> 00:32:11,178
then it's gonna make you look a bit

711
00:32:09,079 --> 00:32:13,009
foolish because you're like I've got the

712
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:15,200
best solution and then six months

713
00:32:13,009 --> 00:32:17,719
downline it doesn't solve anything and

714
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:19,820
you end up where your company has

715
00:32:17,719 --> 00:32:21,859
received phishing email or victim to the

716
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:24,049
phishing email and not investigated for

717
00:32:21,859 --> 00:32:26,119
two months I've been in that environment

718
00:32:24,049 --> 00:32:28,009
I've seen what it does to an

719
00:32:26,119 --> 00:32:30,289
organization and I've had to help them

720
00:32:28,009 --> 00:32:33,019
afterwards and they're like you know we

721
00:32:30,289 --> 00:32:36,229
invested so much money our budget went

722
00:32:33,019 --> 00:32:38,269
from here to here and it keeps going up

723
00:32:36,229 --> 00:32:39,709
and I dunno why it's happening and it's

724
00:32:38,269 --> 00:32:41,389
simply because they weren't maintaining

725
00:32:39,709 --> 00:32:43,339
it they weren't maintaining their skill

726
00:32:41,389 --> 00:32:45,529
of their employees their technical

727
00:32:43,339 --> 00:32:49,059
controls they were spending a lot of

728
00:32:45,529 --> 00:32:52,519
money and they said fancy sexy hardware

729
00:32:49,059 --> 00:32:56,059
that worked about 20% of its requirement

730
00:32:52,519 --> 00:32:57,440
um and they didn't actually know if it

731
00:32:56,059 --> 00:32:59,089
was working because they were actually

732
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:02,040
monitoring the performance or the

733
00:32:59,089 --> 00:33:05,159
success and failures

734
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:08,149
so whenever you add a solution you build

735
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:11,730
a problem a awareness program for your

736
00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:13,710
company you build a program that works

737
00:33:11,730 --> 00:33:15,540
with the controls and the people and

738
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:18,990
everything brilliant you have to

739
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:21,360
actually seek assurance and what you're

740
00:33:18,990 --> 00:33:23,790
doing is it done correctly and is it

741
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:27,870
actually as lining with what success

742
00:33:23,790 --> 00:33:29,820
means to both the text and the high ups

743
00:33:27,870 --> 00:33:33,719
that maybe aren't necessarily as

744
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:36,870
technical and is the training you're

745
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:38,340
providing is that actually addressing

746
00:33:36,870 --> 00:33:40,350
the human behaviors that we need to

747
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:43,949
change and is it motivating them to

748
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:47,090
continue again the monitoring

749
00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:50,070
performance build proper metrics and

750
00:33:47,090 --> 00:33:51,300
actually baseline your organization

751
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:53,159
because how are you going to know if

752
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:55,800
you're succeeding is if you have no idea

753
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:58,500
where you're at and then continuously

754
00:33:55,800 --> 00:34:00,960
improve the goal is actually to just get

755
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:02,490
1% better every day you don't have to

756
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:04,650
have the best solutions you'll have to

757
00:34:02,490 --> 00:34:07,290
have the sexiest tools or the coolest

758
00:34:04,650 --> 00:34:10,470
people I mean obviously you guys are the

759
00:34:07,290 --> 00:34:12,840
course people but um you just have to

760
00:34:10,469 --> 00:34:18,509
continue trying to be better than you

761
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:20,399
were yesterday culture of security so

762
00:34:18,510 --> 00:34:25,429
this is basically what I just talked

763
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:28,859
through um and I think it looks simple

764
00:34:25,429 --> 00:34:33,600
but I think a lot of people forget have

765
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:35,909
simple debts so the first step in your I

766
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:38,969
actually have this listed really nicely

767
00:34:35,909 --> 00:34:41,159
in the next slide but basically what

768
00:34:38,969 --> 00:34:44,489
does success look like to you as the

769
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:46,139
tech what does success look like to your

770
00:34:44,489 --> 00:34:49,168
business and what does success look like

771
00:34:46,139 --> 00:34:52,379
to the execs that maybe aren't as

772
00:34:49,168 --> 00:34:55,888
technical or aren't focused on security

773
00:34:52,379 --> 00:34:59,370
and you line that all up and then you

774
00:34:55,889 --> 00:35:01,710
build your solution around that and you

775
00:34:59,370 --> 00:35:05,160
monitor it and you build the metrics in

776
00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:07,220
and then you raise awareness because if

777
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:09,660
you try and focus on raising awareness

778
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:11,730
first and don't actually know what

779
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:13,170
success is you probably won't get

780
00:35:11,730 --> 00:35:14,540
anywhere and if you do you won't

781
00:35:13,170 --> 00:35:16,520
actually know

782
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:19,040
and your budget won't continue being

783
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:22,430
funded because nobody knows if you're

784
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:25,070
succeeding or not dan reason why owners

785
00:35:22,430 --> 00:35:29,359
do different channels create creative

786
00:35:25,070 --> 00:35:31,550
content and don't shame people because

787
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:34,430
if you want people to shut down and not

788
00:35:31,550 --> 00:35:37,160
focus tell them that they're stupid tell

789
00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:39,049
them do fear-mongering tell them that

790
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:40,759
they're not going to succeed and instead

791
00:35:39,050 --> 00:35:44,410
they're using the social proof in a

792
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:46,820
positive way of being like you know

793
00:35:44,410 --> 00:35:48,589
ninety percent you fail in my phishing

794
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:51,590
campaign because that in their mind

795
00:35:48,590 --> 00:35:53,500
that's going to say um well they failed

796
00:35:51,590 --> 00:35:56,090
and they failed so I'll probably fail -

797
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:58,190
versus saying ten percent of you

798
00:35:56,090 --> 00:36:01,400
succeeded in catching the phishing email

799
00:35:58,190 --> 00:36:03,590
ten percent of you actually knew what to

800
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:05,900
look for cuz then in their mind of like

801
00:36:03,590 --> 00:36:09,140
bloody hell that this is not that's why

802
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:11,750
I could do it and oh you know it I have

803
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:14,569
C I can I can succeed because that

804
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:16,550
person succeeded and it's actually think

805
00:36:14,570 --> 00:36:18,890
of it as using social engineering in a

806
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:21,760
positive light to you commit to people

807
00:36:18,890 --> 00:36:27,589
to actually care and understand and grow

808
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:32,630
influence behavior and a big problem I

809
00:36:27,590 --> 00:36:34,250
have with organizations is they say you

810
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:36,110
have to do this this and this and then I

811
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:38,780
go and do a passive crackling exercise

812
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:41,870
and realize the security team are using

813
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:44,630
password 1 as their password you laugh

814
00:36:41,870 --> 00:36:47,839
but I've actually seen that on highly

815
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:50,480
sensitive systems and you need to

816
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:52,460
influence behaviors by being the example

817
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:54,260
so think back to the different types of

818
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:56,000
learning type different types of

819
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:59,360
learning types yeah that makes sense I

820
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,410
am the one in the top right I can't

821
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:03,200
remember what it's called but basically

822
00:37:00,410 --> 00:37:05,540
that one's the seeing and mimicking and

823
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:08,330
their continuous motivation to mimic

824
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:11,060
that is because that person you respect

825
00:37:08,330 --> 00:37:14,000
and it's leads positively to your

826
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:15,920
environment if you're like oh don't you

827
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,150
 passwords but I'm gonna use

828
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:19,640
password 1 because I'm lazy

829
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:21,710
you're not going to probably have very

830
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:23,270
secure other people because they're

831
00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:25,870
gonna see that and be like wow you do it

832
00:37:23,270 --> 00:37:25,870
so why do I need

833
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:36,270
change habits um when we have a habit it

834
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:38,970
takes I think it's two weeks to change

835
00:37:36,270 --> 00:37:41,610
that and the minute you fail at changing

836
00:37:38,970 --> 00:37:46,939
app it goes back to the way it was

837
00:37:41,610 --> 00:37:50,700
before think for me and I as I said

838
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:53,700
Saturday Jets ooh because of a person in

839
00:37:50,700 --> 00:38:00,569
this body and this is fault it's

840
00:37:53,700 --> 00:38:02,189
brilliant but sorry it takes effort for

841
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:05,430
me to remember to actually go to class

842
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:09,630
and build into my habit to eat healthy

843
00:38:05,430 --> 00:38:12,600
and eat one time and actually wash my ID

844
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:14,220
to actually get to class and and I have

845
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:17,009
to consciously work at that intel

846
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:20,419
becomes routine for me I'm motivated to

847
00:38:17,010 --> 00:38:22,800
do it because apparently I like pain but

848
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:25,050
but if it's something that I don't

849
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:28,080
necessarily like it's even harder to

850
00:38:25,050 --> 00:38:30,150
motivate them now going into security in

851
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:32,009
your environment if you're like okay

852
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:37,080
make this change now they're gonna be

853
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:38,550
like hmm no and it's not gonna be habit

854
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:40,620
for them they're going to find ways

855
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:42,690
around it and they're not going to be

856
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:44,609
motivated and it's going to be really

857
00:38:42,690 --> 00:38:48,930
really really really hard to change that

858
00:38:44,610 --> 00:38:50,610
that behavior if you encourage it by

859
00:38:48,930 --> 00:38:53,520
again focusing on types of learning

860
00:38:50,610 --> 00:38:56,040
focusing on motivations and actually

861
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:57,930
encouraging and supporting it by saying

862
00:38:56,040 --> 00:39:00,060
things like if you attended the day of

863
00:38:57,930 --> 00:39:01,799
training maybe the next day you have a

864
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:04,650
lighter schedule because that's a lot of

865
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:05,880
energy being expanded or if you're going

866
00:39:04,650 --> 00:39:08,070
to training that day maybe you don't

867
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:10,320
have to be on call that evening you know

868
00:39:08,070 --> 00:39:13,320
supporting them to actually be able to

869
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:14,970
make that change and then in the end you

870
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:19,200
just magically end up with this secure

871
00:39:14,970 --> 00:39:21,560
culture um again this is something that

872
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:24,270
you continuously need to work on and

873
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:26,640
I've found a lot of the organizations

874
00:39:24,270 --> 00:39:28,530
that invest a ton of money into their

875
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:31,109
secure culture into their holistic

876
00:39:28,530 --> 00:39:32,910
program and then they kind of just leave

877
00:39:31,110 --> 00:39:38,330
it to do its own thing and expect it to

878
00:39:32,910 --> 00:39:39,480
stay think of culture of an organization

879
00:39:38,330 --> 00:39:41,160
you

880
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:43,470
have these people that think alike and

881
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:45,600
as you grow you hire that one person

882
00:39:43,470 --> 00:39:47,459
that's completely different and maybe

883
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:49,319
they're really negative for example that

884
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:51,030
can change your entire culture so if

885
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:54,450
you're not encouraging it through

886
00:39:51,030 --> 00:39:56,910
everyone and to every single part of

887
00:39:54,450 --> 00:39:57,960
your business and you know incorporating

888
00:39:56,910 --> 00:40:00,660
privacy and security by design

889
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:02,910
throughout everything your culture is

890
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:11,609
not going to be supported in that and it

891
00:40:02,910 --> 00:40:13,560
won't be maintained again this is

892
00:40:11,609 --> 00:40:15,000
basically what I went through I made

893
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:16,320
sure to change the coloring because the

894
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:21,000
first time it looked like something

895
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:24,150
really inappropriate yeah but so now we

896
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:25,859
have blue and purple but again starting

897
00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:27,900
off I'm gonna keep repeating this

898
00:40:25,859 --> 00:40:29,340
because you have to actually say

899
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:32,010
something five times before somebody

900
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:34,590
learns it to find success for your

901
00:40:32,010 --> 00:40:38,420
organization build a factory affective

902
00:40:34,590 --> 00:40:40,650
metrics focus that syllabus baseline

903
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:44,520
incorporate motivations and learning

904
00:40:40,650 --> 00:40:47,490
types and the last thing is definitely

905
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:49,590
build an intuitive dashboard because

906
00:40:47,490 --> 00:40:51,569
your exact sar going to be like are you

907
00:40:49,590 --> 00:40:53,760
succeeding and you're gonna be like I

908
00:40:51,570 --> 00:40:56,520
think so and they're gonna be like well

909
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:58,530
I don't need that money I'm I knew what

910
00:40:56,520 --> 00:41:00,420
you could do actually is have this

911
00:40:58,530 --> 00:41:02,070
dashboard that works for the text so

912
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:05,910
they can see all of the like the

913
00:41:02,070 --> 00:41:07,440
breakdown of anything from for example

914
00:41:05,910 --> 00:41:09,509
you're running a phishing campaign and

915
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:12,030
you're monitoring things like people

916
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:14,010
that fall victim but also people that

917
00:41:12,030 --> 00:41:17,570
fall victim and report it because not in

918
00:41:14,010 --> 00:41:20,730
my mind that's a success or people that

919
00:41:17,570 --> 00:41:23,310
for victim and don't ever report it

920
00:41:20,730 --> 00:41:24,930
because that is a huge failure or people

921
00:41:23,310 --> 00:41:26,490
that fall victim and continually seek

922
00:41:24,930 --> 00:41:28,799
for victim like those are metrics that

923
00:41:26,490 --> 00:41:30,330
you need to continuously monitor and put

924
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:32,190
on the dashboard for the text so that

925
00:41:30,330 --> 00:41:35,430
they can kind of incorporate that into

926
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:36,390
the training versus you know the exact

927
00:41:35,430 --> 00:41:39,480
they're not gonna want to see those

928
00:41:36,390 --> 00:41:41,940
stats so you want something a bit simple

929
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:45,450
eyes and pretty graphs and stuff that

930
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:47,400
they actually care about and you know

931
00:41:45,450 --> 00:41:50,160
monitor culture and behavior and all

932
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:53,010
that fun stuff so last thing I'm going

933
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:54,569
to touch on is traumatic situations

934
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:57,180
and the reason I'm touch on this is

935
00:41:54,570 --> 00:42:00,630
because I'm back in the beginning of my

936
00:41:57,180 --> 00:42:02,310
title it says professional soccer so the

937
00:42:00,630 --> 00:42:04,440
reason I say that is because I've done

938
00:42:02,310 --> 00:42:07,470
intelligence work it's bloody brilliant

939
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:11,280
it's so much fun to stock people who

940
00:42:07,470 --> 00:42:13,560
knew and get paid for it but it can lead

941
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:15,869
to some really negative in situations

942
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:18,900
and incident response highly highly

943
00:42:15,869 --> 00:42:23,070
stressful you know spray the moment

944
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:24,300
usually in 3 in the morning on Christmas

945
00:42:23,070 --> 00:42:25,980
Day or something you have to deal with

946
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:30,450
it I swear

947
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:32,550
but um you have to have people that can

948
00:42:30,450 --> 00:42:35,700
actually grow from that and be able to

949
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:38,640
handle that kind of stress and I was in

950
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:41,689
a situation where as I mentioned earlier

951
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:42,740
I'm a survivor of domestic abuse and

952
00:42:41,690 --> 00:42:46,619
[Music]

953
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:51,959
sexual assault and I had to do an

954
00:42:46,619 --> 00:42:53,550
investigation a rape victim and it was

955
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:55,490
an investigation to support this very

956
00:42:53,550 --> 00:42:58,890
victim it was investigation against her

957
00:42:55,490 --> 00:43:01,709
and I can't do that I can't because I've

958
00:42:58,890 --> 00:43:04,049
been that person and so for me that is

959
00:43:01,710 --> 00:43:05,850
not something that I can do so far never

960
00:43:04,050 --> 00:43:08,220
in that situation I have to hand it off

961
00:43:05,850 --> 00:43:10,740
to someone and the only reason that I am

962
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:12,779
able to do that is because my bosses or

963
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:14,669
managers or wherever they know that

964
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:16,350
about me and they know that they either

965
00:43:14,670 --> 00:43:18,510
won't give me that content or they'll

966
00:43:16,350 --> 00:43:19,830
support me when I say I can't do this

967
00:43:18,510 --> 00:43:25,590
and they'll hand it someone else and

968
00:43:19,830 --> 00:43:27,690
I've investigated possible suicides I'm

969
00:43:25,590 --> 00:43:29,010
investigated I've had friends I've not

970
00:43:27,690 --> 00:43:33,810
had you but I've had friends that have

971
00:43:29,010 --> 00:43:36,930
investigated child abuse and not

972
00:43:33,810 --> 00:43:40,590
preferable is the word exploitation and

973
00:43:36,930 --> 00:43:42,810
and for them they can handle that it

974
00:43:40,590 --> 00:43:44,520
sucks but they can handle it they were

975
00:43:42,810 --> 00:43:47,490
able to I probably wouldn't be able to

976
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:49,619
do that children and animals abuse

977
00:43:47,490 --> 00:43:52,229
against them I can't handle but I can

978
00:43:49,619 --> 00:43:54,660
handle like people hurting each other I

979
00:43:52,230 --> 00:43:58,590
don't know why I'm gonna weird but and

980
00:43:54,660 --> 00:44:00,899
what I'm saying is you need to know your

981
00:43:58,590 --> 00:44:02,640
people you need to know what environment

982
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:04,859
you're in because it's all fine and

983
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:07,020
dandy to train them but if they end up

984
00:44:04,859 --> 00:44:09,420
with post-traumatic stress

985
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:10,890
from their work you're not gonna have a

986
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:13,680
successful team you're not gonna have a

987
00:44:10,890 --> 00:44:15,750
successful environment and program get

988
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:18,240
people leaving and you're probably gonna

989
00:44:15,750 --> 00:44:21,180
I mean you can actually cause damage to

990
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:22,979
those people's lives think of social

991
00:44:21,180 --> 00:44:24,419
media sites that are like oh it's okay

992
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:26,340
you know we don't need to care about

993
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:29,100
algorithms we'll have physical people

994
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:30,900
monitoring all these posts make sure

995
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:32,460
that they're okay well those people are

996
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:34,770
gonna have to deal with that stress and

997
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:36,870
that trauma after so when you build your

998
00:44:34,770 --> 00:44:38,870
incident response team when you build

999
00:44:36,870 --> 00:44:41,910
your people with highly stressful jobs

1000
00:44:38,870 --> 00:44:43,950
you have to consider are they somebody

1001
00:44:41,910 --> 00:44:46,799
that can grow from that environment or

1002
00:44:43,950 --> 00:44:49,049
they somebody that actually can be Meg

1003
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:55,230
negatively impacted for the rest of

1004
00:44:49,050 --> 00:44:58,800
their lives because PTSD is hard I was

1005
00:44:55,230 --> 00:45:02,670
diagnosed with that in 2013 and to hype

1006
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:05,190
so based on an abuse of a I was in

1007
00:45:02,670 --> 00:45:10,620
domestic abuse but I also had abuse as I

1008
00:45:05,190 --> 00:45:12,300
was as a child and the first one I can

1009
00:45:10,620 --> 00:45:14,400
deal with and get through the second one

1010
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:16,590
I've had to receive treatment on

1011
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:18,480
building relationships and how I can

1012
00:45:16,590 --> 00:45:20,280
actually function and connect with

1013
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:27,030
people because I couldn't actually do

1014
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:29,280
that especially not healthily and it's a

1015
00:45:27,030 --> 00:45:32,280
long-term thing it's not something that

1016
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:34,140
just goes away and and in a work

1017
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:36,240
environment you might think oh well it's

1018
00:45:34,140 --> 00:45:38,370
just work it's not a big deal but it is

1019
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:40,319
because it's a huge part of your life so

1020
00:45:38,370 --> 00:45:42,359
if you're actually causing problems to

1021
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:45,180
your employees in the long term you're

1022
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:48,150
doing it wrong so again post-traumatic

1023
00:45:45,180 --> 00:45:49,950
growth great it's positive it's

1024
00:45:48,150 --> 00:45:50,790
stressful and traumatic yeah but you can

1025
00:45:49,950 --> 00:45:52,470
actually grow from it

1026
00:45:50,790 --> 00:45:55,980
I've learned and developed new skills

1027
00:45:52,470 --> 00:45:59,370
and I did a talk last year in Sri Lanka

1028
00:45:55,980 --> 00:46:02,460
for young people getting into security

1029
00:45:59,370 --> 00:46:03,990
and one thing I mentioned was the skills

1030
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:06,840
I learned for ethical hacking for

1031
00:46:03,990 --> 00:46:08,939
swapping that actually I learned through

1032
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:11,970
my life experiences like operational

1033
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:14,430
security I learned from being in a

1034
00:46:11,970 --> 00:46:16,410
controlling relationship I learned you

1035
00:46:14,430 --> 00:46:17,640
know that point of view these different

1036
00:46:16,410 --> 00:46:20,450
methods and

1037
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:23,460
grew from that truck plumber

1038
00:46:20,450 --> 00:46:25,348
post-traumatic stress disorder is a very

1039
00:46:23,460 --> 00:46:28,680
negative as you can imagine the sound

1040
00:46:25,349 --> 00:46:32,339
positive and you actually kind of go

1041
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:35,430
backwards it's possible to have both

1042
00:46:32,339 --> 00:46:38,160
reactions so building your instant

1043
00:46:35,430 --> 00:46:40,529
response building your and your teams

1044
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:42,509
make sure to understand who they are and

1045
00:46:40,529 --> 00:46:44,309
how to support them and if they start

1046
00:46:42,510 --> 00:46:46,470
going into the negative support them

1047
00:46:44,309 --> 00:46:48,960
further if there's somebody that really

1048
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:50,519
really does well in these kind of highly

1049
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:52,319
stressful environments you know you

1050
00:46:50,519 --> 00:46:54,269
still support them but have them also

1051
00:46:52,319 --> 00:46:57,740
support their teams and monitor to make

1052
00:46:54,269 --> 00:47:01,439
sure that you know it doesn't get worse

1053
00:46:57,740 --> 00:47:03,689
again this is how you can do it you want

1054
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:05,549
to look for people who are putting a

1055
00:47:03,690 --> 00:47:08,880
stick people that cope with negative

1056
00:47:05,549 --> 00:47:12,059
events in a positive way and they can

1057
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:14,690
change and they're flexible and a big

1058
00:47:12,059 --> 00:47:17,460
one that people don't realize is

1059
00:47:14,690 --> 00:47:20,670
somebody that's able to ignore something

1060
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:22,170
and at that time like something really

1061
00:47:20,670 --> 00:47:24,390
stressful or something really negative

1062
00:47:22,170 --> 00:47:26,160
and just get something done and then

1063
00:47:24,390 --> 00:47:29,279
come back to it after it's actually

1064
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:31,049
really positive for something that is I

1065
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:32,309
keep saying something and for highly

1066
00:47:31,049 --> 00:47:33,869
stressful environments because you can't

1067
00:47:32,309 --> 00:47:37,069
focus on everything at all the time you

1068
00:47:33,869 --> 00:47:39,240
have to be able to prioritize um

1069
00:47:37,069 --> 00:47:41,329
basically you want to know who your

1070
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:45,589
teams are how they learn how they think

1071
00:47:41,329 --> 00:47:50,940
but also most importantly how they react

1072
00:47:45,589 --> 00:47:51,930
more wisdom hmm so do we cap this is

1073
00:47:50,940 --> 00:47:54,450
what you learned today

1074
00:47:51,930 --> 00:47:58,680
you learned how to support your users to

1075
00:47:54,450 --> 00:48:03,029
learn new skills such as giving them

1076
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:04,950
time allowing them that to recover and

1077
00:48:03,029 --> 00:48:08,099
allowing them to be motivated and

1078
00:48:04,950 --> 00:48:10,500
supporting them you can you've learned

1079
00:48:08,099 --> 00:48:13,980
how to incorporate a variety of learning

1080
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:15,720
methods and think of okay well how does

1081
00:48:13,980 --> 00:48:18,420
this press alone how can I build the

1082
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:19,919
syllabus around that and and a variety

1083
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:21,390
ones because you know you're gonna hire

1084
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:23,460
different people not everyone your own

1085
00:48:21,390 --> 00:48:25,640
image and to do that effectively you

1086
00:48:23,460 --> 00:48:29,270
looks at our intrinsic and extrinsic

1087
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:31,700
motivations and you understood what what

1088
00:48:29,270 --> 00:48:33,170
successful look for look like for your

1089
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:36,169
business before you actually try and

1090
00:48:33,170 --> 00:48:39,200
solve it and considering the budget in

1091
00:48:36,170 --> 00:48:41,480
continuation measurements and the last

1092
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:44,180
and most important thing is understand

1093
00:48:41,480 --> 00:49:23,680
your people and actually care about them

1094
00:48:44,180 --> 00:49:38,720
because if you don't that is my

1095
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:41,299
colleagues yeah definitely so the

1096
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:43,430
question was them if you change how you

1097
00:49:41,300 --> 00:49:45,890
think about other people and how you

1098
00:49:43,430 --> 00:49:47,629
like instead of saying users calling

1099
00:49:45,890 --> 00:49:50,660
them colleagues is that going to make a

1100
00:49:47,630 --> 00:49:54,400
difference and yes that's going huge

1101
00:49:50,660 --> 00:49:58,310
difference language is very strong and

1102
00:49:54,400 --> 00:50:01,520
when when I was going to the hall

1103
00:49:58,310 --> 00:50:05,420
domestic abuse domestic like survivor

1104
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:07,070
and victim simply changing it from your

1105
00:50:05,420 --> 00:50:09,230
victim to your survivor does actually

1106
00:50:07,070 --> 00:50:11,090
make you feel stronger if you call

1107
00:50:09,230 --> 00:50:12,800
people or yo just to user you know

1108
00:50:11,090 --> 00:50:15,560
you're you're being condescending by

1109
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:17,480
default you're saying like in your mind

1110
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:19,970
you're saying wow they're not quite as

1111
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:22,040
smart as I am you know but they are

1112
00:50:19,970 --> 00:50:24,259
they're just differently skilled so

1113
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:26,090
changing your perception of how you view

1114
00:50:24,260 --> 00:50:29,600
your colleagues is highly effective

1115
00:50:26,090 --> 00:50:32,330
because it will it's like think of it in

1116
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:34,580
war you know people can't hurt people

1117
00:50:32,330 --> 00:50:36,770
but they can if they dehumanize them you

1118
00:50:34,580 --> 00:50:39,770
know make them less than human less than

1119
00:50:36,770 --> 00:50:40,660
you you know securities have a warfare

1120
00:50:39,770 --> 00:50:42,580
and

1121
00:50:40,660 --> 00:50:45,970
don't call them users Gotham colleagues

1122
00:50:42,580 --> 00:50:48,040
call them you know skilled people that

1123
00:50:45,970 --> 00:50:49,839
are intelligent but have to learn these

1124
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:52,779
skills specifically so yes I think it's

1125
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:55,270
highly effective I would also say muscle

1126
00:50:52,780 --> 00:50:56,260
memory is actually and when I talked

1127
00:50:55,270 --> 00:50:57,850
about the hard-coated

1128
00:50:56,260 --> 00:51:00,760
it's actually not your muscles that are

1129
00:50:57,850 --> 00:51:02,319
remembering it it's your brain physical

1130
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:04,540
hardware and actually your spinal cord

1131
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:07,090
and I do that by searching your back but

1132
00:51:04,540 --> 00:51:09,130
that's ok and it's not actually your

1133
00:51:07,090 --> 00:51:11,500
muscles memorizing it it's I don't know

1134
00:51:09,130 --> 00:51:13,720
for me that I like to correct those

1135
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:16,210
things but yes I think changing the way

1136
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:18,339
you perceive your colleagues and even

1137
00:51:16,210 --> 00:51:21,790
just down to how you think does make a

1138
00:51:18,340 --> 00:51:26,590
difference do you want a prize Oh a few

1139
00:51:21,790 --> 00:51:28,450
I like to motivate see in extrinsic

1140
00:51:26,590 --> 00:51:32,410
motivation I even have a little like

1141
00:51:28,450 --> 00:51:36,629
Guinness patch I came from Dublin

1142
00:51:32,410 --> 00:51:39,310
I got you choose corneas things yeah

1143
00:51:36,630 --> 00:51:41,440
yeah it's a it's basically books that

1144
00:51:39,310 --> 00:51:43,029
every day you write something positive

1145
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:44,770
that you've done and it reminds you and

1146
00:51:43,030 --> 00:51:45,760
it changes the way you perceive the

1147
00:51:44,770 --> 00:51:48,700
world is brilliant

1148
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:55,650
any other questions I mean I've got one

1149
00:51:48,700 --> 00:51:55,649
two three four five other prizes yeah

1150
00:52:05,250 --> 00:52:12,070
yeah so the question one is how do you

1151
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:13,690
change culture how do you go from having

1152
00:52:12,070 --> 00:52:17,440
a very toxic environment to a very

1153
00:52:13,690 --> 00:52:18,670
positive environment and there's a lot

1154
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:22,180
of different things that you could do

1155
00:52:18,670 --> 00:52:24,700
one thing that's worked for me is hiring

1156
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:25,810
the right ahead of the person that's

1157
00:52:24,700 --> 00:52:28,390
actually going to make the biggest

1158
00:52:25,810 --> 00:52:30,730
impact is not necessarily the partner

1159
00:52:28,390 --> 00:52:32,589
but its leader the person that actually

1160
00:52:30,730 --> 00:52:35,320
works directly with the teams and

1161
00:52:32,590 --> 00:52:36,850
changing the way they think like the way

1162
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:38,920
they think of users the way they think

1163
00:52:36,850 --> 00:52:42,430
of each other and team-building

1164
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:44,320
exercises must sound really cheesy are

1165
00:52:42,430 --> 00:52:46,810
actually really beneficial we need to

1166
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:49,030
have to feel connection to our team to

1167
00:52:46,810 --> 00:52:51,670
work effectively with them we need to

1168
00:52:49,030 --> 00:52:53,800
build our trust with our colleagues to

1169
00:52:51,670 --> 00:52:54,170
be like I trust you to do your work I

1170
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:55,880
trust

1171
00:52:54,170 --> 00:52:57,590
you to succeed I trust you to be able to

1172
00:52:55,880 --> 00:53:03,140
hand off my work to you and it actually

1173
00:52:57,590 --> 00:53:04,820
to get done I think that the biggest

1174
00:53:03,140 --> 00:53:07,009
thing is not trying to change culture

1175
00:53:04,820 --> 00:53:11,630
itself all together right away is to

1176
00:53:07,010 --> 00:53:16,280
change small behaviors as it happens if

1177
00:53:11,630 --> 00:53:20,960
you not haven't noticed I am female and

1178
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:24,440
I feel I'm still female and I've found

1179
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:29,570
in security sometimes it could be quite

1180
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:31,910
negative I I interviewed at a place many

1181
00:53:29,570 --> 00:53:33,620
years ago and they told me oh you know

1182
00:53:31,910 --> 00:53:37,850
we don't hire women because they're

1183
00:53:33,620 --> 00:53:43,790
distracting to men I don't have to stop

1184
00:53:37,850 --> 00:53:46,759
hiring it or boys but you know that's me

1185
00:53:43,790 --> 00:53:48,230
obviously that's very toxic and you're

1186
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:52,010
not gonna change that coarser because

1187
00:53:48,230 --> 00:53:54,560
that's the owner of the business but and

1188
00:53:52,010 --> 00:53:56,630
if that happened in your environment for

1189
00:53:54,560 --> 00:54:01,000
example and you had the authority to

1190
00:53:56,630 --> 00:54:03,410
change that or you know you had the

1191
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:05,630
strength to be able to say action that's

1192
00:54:03,410 --> 00:54:07,759
wrong and changing little things like

1193
00:54:05,630 --> 00:54:11,480
that as they happen can actually make a

1194
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:14,120
difference making sure people feel

1195
00:54:11,480 --> 00:54:16,460
supported so if you know doctor Jessica

1196
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:19,810
Parker on Twitter she's bloody brilliant

1197
00:54:16,460 --> 00:54:22,100
but I one thing she said is she had a

1198
00:54:19,810 --> 00:54:23,750
awareness program that she was

1199
00:54:22,100 --> 00:54:26,509
implementing at this organization and

1200
00:54:23,750 --> 00:54:27,560
this woman came into her training and

1201
00:54:26,510 --> 00:54:30,530
said you know I'm really embarrassed

1202
00:54:27,560 --> 00:54:34,100
this is I'm the worst person for your

1203
00:54:30,530 --> 00:54:36,980
training because I caused a breach it

1204
00:54:34,100 --> 00:54:40,100
was really awful he took a really long

1205
00:54:36,980 --> 00:54:42,830
time to get past it so I'm the worst

1206
00:54:40,100 --> 00:54:45,110
person to be here and Jessica said

1207
00:54:42,830 --> 00:54:46,640
actually you're the best you're the best

1208
00:54:45,110 --> 00:54:48,530
person because you've you've been in

1209
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:51,350
that situation you have the personal

1210
00:54:48,530 --> 00:54:53,240
real-life experience you know beginning

1211
00:54:51,350 --> 00:54:55,700
to end how to deal with that and it was

1212
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:57,910
actually changing it from her coming in

1213
00:54:55,700 --> 00:55:00,980
with a ton of shame embarrassment

1214
00:54:57,910 --> 00:55:02,149
anxiety digested it being like no you

1215
00:55:00,980 --> 00:55:04,910
know you know what you're doing you're

1216
00:55:02,150 --> 00:55:07,220
good you're experienced this is positive

1217
00:55:04,910 --> 00:55:09,109
and adding a positive spin to

1218
00:55:07,220 --> 00:55:13,569
it and set people feel more motivated

1219
00:55:09,109 --> 00:55:16,578
that also helps um hi I created this

1220
00:55:13,569 --> 00:55:18,890
awareness program that teaches

1221
00:55:16,579 --> 00:55:20,750
non-technical people how to hack so it

1222
00:55:18,890 --> 00:55:23,259
can better understand I'm not

1223
00:55:20,750 --> 00:55:26,150
like I'm not building a mini hacker army

1224
00:55:23,260 --> 00:55:27,500
I'm teaching people like foundational

1225
00:55:26,150 --> 00:55:29,810
skills like how to use the social

1226
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:32,900
engineering toolkit like press number

1227
00:55:29,810 --> 00:55:35,150
one press number two like very basic but

1228
00:55:32,900 --> 00:55:38,720
it's just a demystify do you mystifying

1229
00:55:35,150 --> 00:55:41,599
hackers and its really positive and had

1230
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:44,629
big change on culture because it took

1231
00:55:41,599 --> 00:55:46,910
away the anxiety of the unknown it took

1232
00:55:44,630 --> 00:55:49,220
away the negative and reset everyone on

1233
00:55:46,910 --> 00:55:50,899
the same page and got them really

1234
00:55:49,220 --> 00:55:53,180
excited because they got to talk about

1235
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:55,460
the sexy parts of security in a safe

1236
00:55:53,180 --> 00:55:57,740
environment to ask questions that

1237
00:55:55,460 --> 00:56:21,290
answers your question yeah lovely what a

1238
00:55:57,740 --> 00:56:22,640
prize okay way back there today and so

1239
00:56:21,290 --> 00:56:25,279
question wise when you're talking to the

1240
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:27,140
board how do you create that Authority

1241
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:28,910
so the first thing is if you're the one

1242
00:56:27,140 --> 00:56:30,740
talking to the board and you don't have

1243
00:56:28,910 --> 00:56:33,200
that authority then maybe not at the

1244
00:56:30,740 --> 00:56:35,149
right place not because they don't trust

1245
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:36,680
you but because if your job title means

1246
00:56:35,150 --> 00:56:38,450
you're supposed to be making the budget

1247
00:56:36,680 --> 00:56:40,460
and they're supposed to be approving it

1248
00:56:38,450 --> 00:56:43,700
and they are like actually we don't give

1249
00:56:40,460 --> 00:56:47,180
it what you say then anything you do is

1250
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:48,828
probably going to be negative but and if

1251
00:56:47,180 --> 00:56:53,109
you're in that and you need to build the

1252
00:56:48,829 --> 00:56:56,119
trust like set early of creating those

1253
00:56:53,109 --> 00:56:59,000
dashboards creating that background

1254
00:56:56,119 --> 00:57:02,750
information and speaking their language

1255
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:05,060
per se saying like this is why I need

1256
00:57:02,750 --> 00:57:06,319
this budget you know these are these are

1257
00:57:05,060 --> 00:57:09,020
the things that we've fallen victim to

1258
00:57:06,319 --> 00:57:11,359
you in the past these are the likely

1259
00:57:09,020 --> 00:57:14,329
this is the trends in industry these are

1260
00:57:11,359 --> 00:57:16,549
the things that are in our sector are

1261
00:57:14,329 --> 00:57:19,400
highly important these are the

1262
00:57:16,550 --> 00:57:20,570
regulatory standards if you want to talk

1263
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:24,650
to the board and get

1264
00:57:20,570 --> 00:57:29,120
quickly talk about gdpr it's brilliant

1265
00:57:24,650 --> 00:57:31,370
and for if they're in the industrial

1266
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:34,040
control systems are like critical

1267
00:57:31,370 --> 00:57:37,220
infrastructure talk about the NIS

1268
00:57:34,040 --> 00:57:39,920
directive also brilliant maybe not as

1269
00:57:37,220 --> 00:57:41,720
publicized but basically it's a network

1270
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:43,850
information systems directive it's

1271
00:57:41,720 --> 00:57:46,160
talking about security for critical

1272
00:57:43,850 --> 00:57:49,549
infrastructure also important also has a

1273
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:51,920
lot of fees if you fail and you know

1274
00:57:49,550 --> 00:57:54,470
incorporating things like these are

1275
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:56,480
examples that you see in the news these

1276
00:57:54,470 --> 00:57:58,939
are examples that actually happen for

1277
00:57:56,480 --> 00:58:01,820
you and this is ways that we can make a

1278
00:57:58,940 --> 00:58:02,960
change you know building that trust that

1279
00:58:01,820 --> 00:58:04,970
you know what you're talking about

1280
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:09,140
actually will make it easier later

1281
00:58:04,970 --> 00:58:11,089
because they trust that you OneNote you

1282
00:58:09,140 --> 00:58:15,670
talking about and to actually are paying

1283
00:58:11,090 --> 00:58:19,610
attention another thing I like to do is

1284
00:58:15,670 --> 00:58:21,320
focusing on the personal side so when I

1285
00:58:19,610 --> 00:58:23,000
do awareness training it really really

1286
00:58:21,320 --> 00:58:26,900
really challenging places that nobody

1287
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:30,890
really wants to care I incorporate pizza

1288
00:58:26,900 --> 00:58:32,330
because everybody likes pizza but also I

1289
00:58:30,890 --> 00:58:33,799
talk about personal security how to

1290
00:58:32,330 --> 00:58:36,860
protect you how to protect your children

1291
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:40,940
and maybe your friends or family because

1292
00:58:36,860 --> 00:58:43,310
when people or and it's personal they

1293
00:58:40,940 --> 00:58:46,340
listen more and I talk about stories

1294
00:58:43,310 --> 00:58:49,009
because humans are emotionally invested

1295
00:58:46,340 --> 00:58:52,580
in stories and so maybe it's a big thing

1296
00:58:49,010 --> 00:58:54,050
happen in the news or I'm something

1297
00:58:52,580 --> 00:58:56,180
they've been through they'll actually

1298
00:58:54,050 --> 00:58:59,420
follow that story more closely and be

1299
00:58:56,180 --> 00:59:01,549
more positively impacted or negatively I

1300
00:58:59,420 --> 00:59:04,720
guess because they're going to pay more

1301
00:59:01,550 --> 00:59:07,370
attention and so building that trust

1302
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:08,899
doesn't necessarily mean coming in being

1303
00:59:07,370 --> 00:59:10,279
like I have all these certifications

1304
00:59:08,900 --> 00:59:11,390
they actually need to trust that you

1305
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:13,760
know what you're talking about and they

1306
00:59:11,390 --> 00:59:17,270
can relate to it and again speak their

1307
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:19,550
language etc etc I mean I don't like to

1308
00:59:17,270 --> 00:59:22,970
say fear-mongering but an interesting

1309
00:59:19,550 --> 00:59:25,280
thing is that if somebody scared yes

1310
00:59:22,970 --> 00:59:27,709
they shut down but if you're going

1311
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:30,290
through an instant an incident and

1312
00:59:27,710 --> 00:59:34,070
there's a lot of adrenaline in it like

1313
00:59:30,290 --> 00:59:34,490
you're anxious your brain actually takes

1314
00:59:34,070 --> 00:59:37,490
more

1315
00:59:34,490 --> 00:59:39,919
details it's why we think our situation

1316
00:59:37,490 --> 00:59:41,899
is going in slow motion is because we're

1317
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:43,940
taking in more details than we actually

1318
00:59:41,900 --> 00:59:46,130
are used to and our brain thinks what

1319
00:59:43,940 --> 00:59:47,450
must be happening very slowly so it's

1320
00:59:46,130 --> 00:59:52,100
not the slow motion at the time but the

1321
00:59:47,450 --> 00:59:53,839
way we remember it is kind of so I mean

1322
00:59:52,100 --> 00:59:54,950
if you have an instant that's a great

1323
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:56,330
way to walk them through it

1324
00:59:54,950 --> 00:59:58,819
because they'll be anxious and then

1325
00:59:56,330 --> 01:00:00,440
maybe they'll retain more I don't know

1326
00:59:58,820 --> 01:00:00,860
if that answers your question yeah okay

1327
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:19,910
cool

1328
01:00:00,860 --> 01:00:23,630
there what's three more presents so the

1329
01:00:19,910 --> 01:00:26,149
question is do I think that it should be

1330
01:00:23,630 --> 01:00:27,770
expected that tax should always have to

1331
01:00:26,150 --> 01:00:30,590
be able to translate to the business

1332
01:00:27,770 --> 01:00:32,210
language and not backwards or the

1333
01:00:30,590 --> 01:00:34,310
business heart attack I think in the

1334
01:00:32,210 --> 01:00:36,800
beginning to get them interested in it

1335
01:00:34,310 --> 01:00:39,859
you kind of have to it's a bit unfair of

1336
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:42,050
requirement for them but over time what

1337
01:00:39,859 --> 01:00:44,540
you'll find is as they build trust and

1338
01:00:42,050 --> 01:00:46,609
as they kind of understand it and you've

1339
01:00:44,540 --> 01:00:48,140
taken away that negativity they actually

1340
01:00:46,609 --> 01:00:52,040
start to understand more about security

1341
01:00:48,140 --> 01:00:55,160
in the first place in the ID ideal world

1342
01:00:52,040 --> 01:00:59,570
and I should be able to go to my attack

1343
01:00:55,160 --> 01:01:01,910
my exact can be like you know this is

1344
01:00:59,570 --> 01:01:04,790
the situation these are the controls I

1345
01:01:01,910 --> 01:01:07,790
want these are what I want and while

1346
01:01:04,790 --> 01:01:11,290
some incorporating risk I'm also talking

1347
01:01:07,790 --> 01:01:15,710
tax stuff yeah that'd be lovely and

1348
01:01:11,290 --> 01:01:17,330
whether that will happen or - no but you

1349
01:01:15,710 --> 01:01:20,630
do have to remember when you're building

1350
01:01:17,330 --> 01:01:22,040
a security solution and you're going to

1351
01:01:20,630 --> 01:01:23,900
have to take a risk based approach

1352
01:01:22,040 --> 01:01:27,580
anyway because at the end of the day

1353
01:01:23,900 --> 01:01:32,359
budgets are not infinite in in it

1354
01:01:27,580 --> 01:01:34,160
however the word they do end and so you

1355
01:01:32,359 --> 01:01:35,840
need to prioritize certain things anyway

1356
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:38,270
so you just kind of have to think in a

1357
01:01:35,840 --> 01:01:40,760
risk-based approach to begin with I

1358
01:01:38,270 --> 01:01:43,250
think it might I think in the beginning

1359
01:01:40,760 --> 01:01:45,980
it can be a little bit unfair like a

1360
01:01:43,250 --> 01:01:47,630
one-sided relationship and don't break

1361
01:01:45,980 --> 01:01:49,520
up with them right away

1362
01:01:47,630 --> 01:01:52,430
kind of support them into learning how

1363
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:54,259
to speak to you effectively and how you

1364
01:01:52,430 --> 01:01:57,770
can speak to them effectively because it

1365
01:01:54,260 --> 01:01:59,330
should be both ways definitely um but it

1366
01:01:57,770 --> 01:02:02,300
might not be in the beginning does that

1367
01:01:59,330 --> 01:02:07,270
make sense yeah okay so now I have two

1368
01:02:02,300 --> 01:02:24,890
more prizes are we at time 1 minute Keo

1369
01:02:07,270 --> 01:02:27,200
30 seconds okay so I said we're in

1370
01:02:24,890 --> 01:02:28,910
scooty there's a lot more stick than

1371
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:32,390
characters a lot have more punishment

1372
01:02:28,910 --> 01:02:35,240
than rewards and going back to you that

1373
01:02:32,390 --> 01:02:37,910
would program I built I I like to use

1374
01:02:35,240 --> 01:02:40,490
gamification principles I like to

1375
01:02:37,910 --> 01:02:43,009
motivate people to be motivated so

1376
01:02:40,490 --> 01:02:44,990
extrinsic motivation great for

1377
01:02:43,010 --> 01:02:47,680
short-term you know giving them prizes

1378
01:02:44,990 --> 01:02:49,790
giving them like I'm basically

1379
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:53,149
extrinsically motivated you guys to ask

1380
01:02:49,790 --> 01:02:56,240
questions and but for long-term it's

1381
01:02:53,150 --> 01:02:57,800
actually internal intrinsic so people

1382
01:02:56,240 --> 01:02:59,180
will be motivated long-term because they

1383
01:02:57,800 --> 01:03:01,430
feel like this sense of mastery they

1384
01:02:59,180 --> 01:03:05,259
feel like they're learning something so

1385
01:03:01,430 --> 01:03:07,790
and I think to remove the negative

1386
01:03:05,260 --> 01:03:09,980
stigma of you know cybersecurity is just

1387
01:03:07,790 --> 01:03:13,190
a negative and you need to create a

1388
01:03:09,980 --> 01:03:15,620
culture like said short-term motivations

1389
01:03:13,190 --> 01:03:18,170
with pizza money beer I'd be careful

1390
01:03:15,620 --> 01:03:21,650
though I had a awareness program where I

1391
01:03:18,170 --> 01:03:23,300
had beer and pizza and they drank a bit

1392
01:03:21,650 --> 01:03:25,460
too much where the security team was

1393
01:03:23,300 --> 01:03:28,730
entering the wrong questions and it was

1394
01:03:25,460 --> 01:03:32,180
bit embarrassing for me but um be

1395
01:03:28,730 --> 01:03:35,360
mindful that but yeah just kind of

1396
01:03:32,180 --> 01:03:37,819
resetting the mindset of security is

1397
01:03:35,360 --> 01:03:41,120
going to make a difference and making

1398
01:03:37,820 --> 01:03:42,860
sure your policies address that so not

1399
01:03:41,120 --> 01:03:44,600
gonna name names but there is a big four

1400
01:03:42,860 --> 01:03:46,910
that said if you don't submit your

1401
01:03:44,600 --> 01:03:48,740
timesheets on time you get you it cost

1402
01:03:46,910 --> 01:03:52,490
you a hundred quid that's me is a

1403
01:03:48,740 --> 01:03:54,500
horrendous um and I just agree with it

1404
01:03:52,490 --> 01:03:57,790
maybe it works for them that's fine I

1405
01:03:54,500 --> 01:04:00,290
don't know the situation but kind of

1406
01:03:57,790 --> 01:04:01,369
incorporating the culture but also the

1407
01:04:00,290 --> 01:04:03,380
policies and

1408
01:04:01,369 --> 01:04:06,229
regulations and the requirements to

1409
01:04:03,380 --> 01:04:07,789
actually support that positivity he's

1410
01:04:06,229 --> 01:04:09,710
going to make a difference having the

1411
01:04:07,789 --> 01:04:11,869
top-down support and the bottom-up and

1412
01:04:09,710 --> 01:04:14,269
another thing I did in that awareness

1413
01:04:11,869 --> 01:04:18,319
program is I said it's not required to

1414
01:04:14,269 --> 01:04:20,149
attend and I didn't actually say you you

1415
01:04:18,319 --> 01:04:22,249
had to come I didn't ever make it

1416
01:04:20,150 --> 01:04:24,499
required it was just a point system if

1417
01:04:22,249 --> 01:04:26,299
you did come you get achievements and

1418
01:04:24,499 --> 01:04:28,488
tell me until you became a cyber warrior

1419
01:04:26,299 --> 01:04:31,940
who doesn't want to be a cyber warrior

1420
01:04:28,489 --> 01:04:34,509
and and it actually had people anywhere

1421
01:04:31,940 --> 01:04:37,519
from paralegals to partners coming and

1422
01:04:34,509 --> 01:04:38,839
because people saw their partners coming

1423
01:04:37,519 --> 01:04:40,488
and because the partner saw their

1424
01:04:38,839 --> 01:04:43,339
paralegals coming there was the

1425
01:04:40,489 --> 01:04:46,880
perception that it was a it was cool and

1426
01:04:43,339 --> 01:04:48,440
I actually it became hugely beneficial

1427
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:49,969
because people wanted to come they

1428
01:04:48,440 --> 01:04:50,359
weren't required to come that makes

1429
01:04:49,969 --> 01:04:54,079
sense

1430
01:04:50,359 --> 01:04:57,999
I think that's all I'm allowed ok I'm

1431
01:04:54,079 --> 01:04:57,999
glad my computer came back thank you
