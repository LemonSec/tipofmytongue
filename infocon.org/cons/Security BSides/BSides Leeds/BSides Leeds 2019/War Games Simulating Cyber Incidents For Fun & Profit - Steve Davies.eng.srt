independent scary consoling bit obsessed

7
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,759
with critical security controls

8
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:29,550
networking in monitoring and the

9
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:35,980
co-founder of DC one five one

10
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:40,360
I'm Matt Hall at this month with I'm a

11
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:43,019
consultant of clarinet I have about 18

12
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:46,980
or so years experience in the

13
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:53,050
cybersecurity vision spirit world and

14
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:55,959
professionally and due to that amount of

15
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:57,578
time I'm a bit of a cynic but at the

16
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:01,390
same time bit and it's a lot to missed

17
00:00:57,579 --> 00:01:07,299
and so I'm also the co-founder DeSimone

18
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:09,549
1 DC one flag one and its social

19
00:01:07,299 --> 00:01:15,490
government is Def Con group its

20
00:01:09,549 --> 00:01:18,520
Alice one and not the contrary 3 yeah we

21
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:23,140
get stick for that but it's a regular

22
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:24,780
meeting of hackers majors breakers both

23
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:29,799
and blue team red team

24
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:32,829
and when we first spoke about doing it

25
00:01:29,799 --> 00:01:35,729
and I said I was bit by side the carry

26
00:01:32,829 --> 00:01:38,770
look is why people get up another chap

27
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:41,020
but everyone's welcome is every second

28
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:42,369
Wednesday of the month currently at the

29
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:46,179
Cross Keys pub which is where the

30
00:01:42,369 --> 00:01:48,100
prescience was last night and format

31
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:51,100
anything girls mostly the moment it is

32
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:55,059
sort of talks and we'd like to get some

33
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:58,329
more workshops in this year 30 to 45

34
00:01:55,060 --> 00:02:01,750
minutes or when it drugs on the right to

35
00:01:58,329 --> 00:02:03,850
hours if you want to get in contact with

36
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:05,350
his followers on Twitter it is a message

37
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:13,150
if you're wanting to talk or a workshop

38
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:15,819
a little bit see it okay so in this talk

39
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:18,430
and introduce

40
00:02:15,819 --> 00:02:20,469
that's a concept in the idea of wall

41
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:22,989
gaming and specifically been explore the

42
00:02:20,469 --> 00:02:24,930
use of wall gaming as a means of fly

43
00:02:22,989 --> 00:02:29,739
simulate and incident response and

44
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:31,870
high-level will explain what aids why

45
00:02:29,739 --> 00:02:33,969
you should be doing it after planet and

46
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:37,510
basically outside deliver the plane and

47
00:02:33,969 --> 00:02:40,209
the toughts structured of the very

48
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:42,700
logically now and final edits in the pub

49
00:02:40,209 --> 00:02:44,079
in Bodega and it should make for a

50
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:45,369
relatively useful surprise so we're

51
00:02:44,079 --> 00:02:47,609
going to measure slides available top

52
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:51,010
notes the things being filmed as well

53
00:02:47,609 --> 00:02:52,150
I'm reachable so any questions I would

54
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:56,108
might help of anything please get in

55
00:02:52,150 --> 00:03:02,889
touch and cool concept

56
00:02:56,109 --> 00:03:04,090
what is it ball game yeah so yeah so

57
00:03:02,889 --> 00:03:07,239
what would what would mean by wargaming

58
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:09,909
so there's the mandatory sort of wiki

59
00:03:07,239 --> 00:03:12,250
exception there and for the purposes of

60
00:03:09,909 --> 00:03:13,840
this talk this introductory top to the

61
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:16,150
concept in the use of it around spy and

62
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,189
I are and it's essentially a training

63
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:20,829
exercise that's high definition for this

64
00:03:18,189 --> 00:03:24,698
just talk and basically that's you test

65
00:03:20,829 --> 00:03:26,139
stuff people against you know a

66
00:03:24,699 --> 00:03:30,849
realistic scenario and give you some

67
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:33,519
idea of how well you fare and now the

68
00:03:30,849 --> 00:03:35,828
concept of wargaming isn't new if you've

69
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:39,609
ever worked in the military and they

70
00:03:35,829 --> 00:03:44,769
were live rubber bullet simulated

71
00:03:39,609 --> 00:03:46,239
exercises video tabletops as well if

72
00:03:44,769 --> 00:03:48,220
you're old enough pyramid the warning to

73
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:50,500
film the mutton Broderick the war

74
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:52,840
operations Punk response computer and

75
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:56,169
wasn't too far from the truth of its

76
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:58,479
time various intelligence organizations

77
00:03:56,169 --> 00:04:01,409
as well the big learnings of cyber ball

78
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:05,049
games quite some time

79
00:04:01,409 --> 00:04:07,689
well this talk is really from both our

80
00:04:05,049 --> 00:04:10,599
experiences and there seems to be

81
00:04:07,689 --> 00:04:13,569
relatively little or few private

82
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:16,478
organizations to run a ball game let

83
00:04:13,569 --> 00:04:19,358
alone have a comprehensive incident

84
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:23,320
response plan they have any at all so

85
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:28,900
today we're talking about these supposed

86
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:29,719
immature organizations yes I guess the

87
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:32,060
reason I really like

88
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:34,280
I want to talk about is you know it's an

89
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:36,800
incredibly powerful tool for a whole

90
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:39,080
bunch of reasons and I guess the thing

91
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,910
we want to get across is one of those

92
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:43,159
one of the bigger reasons is the

93
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:44,930
accessibility you know you can basically

94
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:48,110
play is probably one of those greatest

95
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:51,500
strengths you don't need a lot to do

96
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:53,420
this there's no like super comp sis for

97
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:56,210
while gaming like whatever like you know

98
00:04:53,420 --> 00:05:00,380
you put in a bit a bit of planning this

99
00:04:56,210 --> 00:05:03,109
out of the nod to do it you can make

100
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:06,890
this thing happen it's extremely useful

101
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:09,200
in the real world you know I think we're

102
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:10,940
all hopefully all I'm sure that all are

103
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:14,060
coming to terms with the fact that in

104
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:15,070
quite security-wise and can't stop

105
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:18,860
must've happening

106
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:21,020
cat builds walls high enough or thick

107
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:21,500
enough to start stuff the bad stuff from

108
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:27,590
happening

109
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:30,500
and yes quick show of hands who has done

110
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:33,650
any sort of incident on scenario testing

111
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:36,300
the pot one two three four five six

112
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:38,140
eight nine

113
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:44,600
[Music]

114
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:47,719
you've done it organizing one part sits

115
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:52,750
and as our participant that'll be dealer

116
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:56,710
three discussing that stats Linden

117
00:05:52,750 --> 00:06:00,350
so I want to talk about why you should

118
00:05:56,710 --> 00:06:03,680
login why should you care why you're

119
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:06,200
here why should we go really I'm a pen

120
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:10,460
tester at the moment I have been for

121
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:13,210
several years I previously done odd it

122
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:17,090
give us a I service in that in one I

123
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:21,140
built defensive systems ids/ips

124
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:24,250
firewalls so I've gone all the way from

125
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:26,719
blue teaming in auditing - technically

126
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:31,250
rocking up brick in a network right near

127
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:33,890
port which wash rinse repeat and you

128
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:36,190
know not all real-world threats can be

129
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:41,630
covered it depends s they're very useful

130
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:43,610
so this is about helping your company of

131
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:47,360
your customer become mob

132
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:49,550
against the tongue it applies to both

133
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,919
red jeans blue teams are meeting

134
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:55,219
students looking into their careers I'm

135
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:57,099
scary because your next job may depend

136
00:06:55,219 --> 00:07:00,439
on it

137
00:06:57,099 --> 00:07:03,770
ever saw the internal fight and battle

138
00:07:00,439 --> 00:07:08,180
if if you have a Cecil and you're

139
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:09,770
choosing new Cecil which type of Cecil

140
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:12,770
wouldn't choose would you choose the

141
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:16,878
person that never experienced a sound

142
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:18,878
breach or one who had and you know was a

143
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:24,169
disease Laurel when it happened

144
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:24,740
Sagittarians gain ability we'll see you

145
00:07:24,169 --> 00:07:27,080
later

146
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:28,789
so why should you care and credits here

147
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:30,560
to solve you from his twenty seventeen

148
00:07:28,789 --> 00:07:37,639
hours a pumpkin stop but this slide it's

149
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:39,979
out completely and what it is is I've

150
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:42,889
been around since the early eighties out

151
00:07:39,979 --> 00:07:46,370
born in 1918 so I go into computing in

152
00:07:42,889 --> 00:07:51,169
the early nineties were in terms of

153
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:58,330
hacking scene in the mid mountains so

154
00:07:51,169 --> 00:08:01,520
we've seen lots of rise of computers and

155
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:03,800
solutions we announced the security that

156
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:06,219
keep adding to each other from one year

157
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:10,639
to the next

158
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:12,439
veera the top is actually us joins the

159
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:15,969
NIST cybersecurity framework which is

160
00:08:12,439 --> 00:08:19,520
initiative response standard suppose

161
00:08:15,969 --> 00:08:24,169
originally created for SCADA networks

162
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:27,339
and us and thinking the 2017 was

163
00:08:24,169 --> 00:08:30,740
accessible to every organization ble

164
00:08:27,339 --> 00:08:34,338
but yet in the 90s it wasn't really home

165
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:36,320
ec markets fierce sort of group and at

166
00:08:34,339 --> 00:08:39,260
that time most small businesses with

167
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:44,089
slope and paper and a few staff to

168
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:49,399
digitize and internet politicians around

169
00:08:44,089 --> 00:08:51,279
slow and if you thought walked into a PC

170
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:57,530
world in the 90s or a membrane you have

171
00:08:51,279 --> 00:09:01,310
shelf upon shelf of Windows NT by

172
00:08:57,530 --> 00:09:04,970
or 3.1 still on right at the end you

173
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:08,510
have a football of Av products with a

174
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:10,910
Fiat something I'm not not plugging the

175
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:15,680
company but it's maybe some personal

176
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:20,449
file and software that's all tall people

177
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:24,949
got scared as a pellet bit goodbye cars

178
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:28,280
would go on three years the end point

179
00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:31,120
defense stuff with air be moved into la

180
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:34,160
detective monitoring systems IDs

181
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:37,670
security is an event monitoring you'll

182
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:43,010
start building socks where we have now

183
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:46,819
and we are in that Europe of the soup

184
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:49,210
bridge and in the security solution were

185
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:53,510
looking at endpoint detection response

186
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:55,670
Irish access management we've got debit

187
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:57,800
dedicated side the business units within

188
00:09:55,670 --> 00:10:03,349
organizations now I'm season it with

189
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:12,349
c-level roles and that's pretty much the

190
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:15,710
advanced persistent threat die and it's

191
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:17,540
kind of scary really high this is I've

192
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:20,390
been working in industry for a while

193
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:22,310
just the amount of Beach is now telling

194
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:24,860
us about all of our technological

195
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:28,520
solutions aren't solving the problem

196
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:29,660
probably got this wrong so recently

197
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:33,319
Singh one five one near you

198
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:36,230
Weaver stood our friend in the back son

199
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:38,420
of son zoo on Twitter and his talk

200
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:40,960
lessons from the region in which Nick

201
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:44,300
asked this question which stop with me

202
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:46,790
if we're all so smart which we are and

203
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:50,089
we all web so hard which we do why is

204
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:53,120
everything so awful getting worse so in

205
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:53,930
the last few years we've seen hand emic

206
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:58,390
propulsion

207
00:10:53,930 --> 00:11:05,390
tax and hey wash turns around the world

208
00:10:58,390 --> 00:11:07,180
the fall sort of sentences on the

209
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:09,650
right-hand side there the four major

210
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:11,329
cyber threats that the NCSE put together

211
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:15,500
in their twenty

212
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:17,570
it 18 signed a report and we have we've

213
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:21,200
seen live features involving attackers

214
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:25,209
who assisted upon a targets network the

215
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:29,029
years to come area or several months

216
00:11:25,209 --> 00:11:31,310
Equifax and yeah but who can find

217
00:11:29,029 --> 00:11:33,560
Equifax quickly where is it

218
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:37,069
yep you got it yeah now look that last

219
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:39,880
year cut slide was small to different so

220
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:42,950
it should be fairly obvious people now

221
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:45,589
that we are in the agency the breach

222
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:48,410
so we're talking here about testing

223
00:11:45,589 --> 00:11:50,630
without pens and how to successfully

224
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:54,290
wargame an organization to help prepare

225
00:11:50,630 --> 00:12:09,439
them for the coming age of resilience

226
00:11:54,290 --> 00:12:13,250
and recovery this is the map of the

227
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:18,680
World Economic Forum's Global Risk

228
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:25,430
landscape for 2018 the risks we have

229
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:27,380
sieve breaches show what will be living

230
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:30,380
in right now we've got cyber attacks up

231
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:33,500
in the top right hand corner in the same

232
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:35,990
region in terms of impact level and

233
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:38,589
likelihood of natural disasters and

234
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:38,589
climate change

235
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:46,880
see ya so well what also right like the

236
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:51,020
tax not working the addition of

237
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:56,959
different Assyrian bridge we're all good

238
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:58,490
no one's I share in that kind of bit

239
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:00,890
pretty clear that those a thing isn't it

240
00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:03,740
way to sell and the idea of wargaming

241
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:08,899
because we can't rely on that assume

242
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:12,920
breach message to be all yeah and agreed

243
00:13:08,899 --> 00:13:14,449
with yeah you know you will for any

244
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:17,209
organization that probably invested

245
00:13:14,449 --> 00:13:19,010
millions they like cyber stealth and

246
00:13:17,209 --> 00:13:22,420
telling them that it was always designed

247
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:24,569
problems not known but I would say well

248
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:27,959
cliche time

249
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:32,190
take them whoever they are on the

250
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:34,740
journey but destination really is we

251
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:36,420
want to get them thinking about breaches

252
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:40,050
like the up to the breach the response

253
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:43,110
of breach to breach start to Brett down

254
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:45,719
the hole like I've got a perimeter I'm

255
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:48,530
okay man tower they need to get them to

256
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:52,790
think about how they're going to respond

257
00:13:48,530 --> 00:14:01,490
and what they'll need to respond to

258
00:13:52,790 --> 00:14:04,140
investment and bootstrap up once or yeah

259
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:05,730
the Jerry thing it's one of the

260
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:07,949
consequences are not doing texting not

261
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:10,470
doing incident madness testing that can

262
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:13,560
help us sell it but you know life's bit

263
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:15,060
complicated down as you know if any of

264
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:17,250
you turns away you find do this at work

265
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:18,719
with a client whatever there are

266
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:20,850
consequences are actually doing this are

267
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:24,470
tensions test in and so we're gonna call

268
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:24,470
those out so you don't trip yourself up

269
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:28,530
business keywords alright so this is how

270
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:30,780
we sell it this is how you sell it as a

271
00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:35,160
people process the technology leadership

272
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:37,550
for people to first thing me to really

273
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:40,589
exercise we initiate want to get them

274
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:43,109
doing the critical thinking exercising

275
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:45,210
decision making in those less than

276
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:46,740
optimal bare you conditions know when

277
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:48,420
things go sideways and you get a call at

278
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:49,530
five o'clock on the morning you're on

279
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:51,689
your leisure things to be able to make

280
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:53,459
quick decisions the right decisions the

281
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:55,680
best decisions we've little without

282
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:56,420
perfect information as quickly as

283
00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:00,180
possible

284
00:14:56,420 --> 00:15:02,729
you want to get them working together to

285
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:04,560
make decisions the comp can you know you

286
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:06,870
your organization's probably up got one

287
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:09,329
king or queen our Emperor the top that's

288
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:11,760
you know but the general you know tied

289
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:13,620
everyone to new and is entail power

290
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:16,470
dynamics all economists often might not

291
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:17,580
have that authority and the abstract

292
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:19,350
enough like the whole we need to

293
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:21,240
exercise our leaders and being able to

294
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:22,710
make decisions about that's information

295
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:24,990
because a lot of the cyber stuff for the

296
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:26,460
let's in technology I think there's this

297
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:28,350
assumption that these challenging that

298
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:29,040
like you can send you know push back on

299
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:30,990
the tacky

300
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,099
getting back in server room and getting

301
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:33,270
to come back with the perfect

302
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:33,810
information so you can make the right

303
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:36,150
call

304
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:37,439
it's balance like we don't know what's

305
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:39,360
going on most of the time we

306
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,770
the information we've got there's no

307
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:43,290
single source of information that you

308
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:45,000
can pull on to get absolute clarity when

309
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:49,349
everything goes sideways everything hits

310
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:51,030
the wall like Mindy even though at

311
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:53,070
leadership wise if you know who needs to

312
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:55,260
be involved like you know it's not just

313
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:58,290
your managers you know you've got

314
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:59,220
general counsel detection offices you

315
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:01,260
know the leadership in your organization

316
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:05,160
is probably bigger than I've seen where

317
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:07,530
the management need staff skin all the

318
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:09,569
time have you got the right people in

319
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:12,500
the room can identify the right people

320
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:16,680
can you identify that's the wrong people

321
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:18,240
can you can you easily put together that

322
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:20,430
short list of people that usually about

323
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:22,440
representation across the business

324
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:24,390
across technology across products

325
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:27,060
however your organization's structured

326
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:28,770
you need to break it down and can you

327
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:31,410
identify all the relevant skills and

328
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:34,260
knowledge like I mean I'm large

329
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:35,670
international organization but they have

330
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:37,080
a challenge of come at it if I haven't

331
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:39,420
got the right people who can speak all

332
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:45,300
the languages in the room that's what

333
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:47,069
might apply to you supplies MSSP suck

334
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:50,870
that software vendor that might be

335
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:50,870
involved retail at the cloud whatever

336
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:59,760
yeah I mean process stuff right so

337
00:16:54,810 --> 00:17:02,280
people leadership and everybody know

338
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:04,410
what they should be doing like you know

339
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:07,189
chances are your organisation might have

340
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:09,390
some just a plan for Incident Response

341
00:17:07,189 --> 00:17:11,670
you know I like on the shelf some works

342
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:13,920
that have been touched and probably got

343
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:15,780
some archaic Tom's plan in there you

344
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:17,130
know I've send fax to whoever what nurse

345
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:19,230
that's you know pass the time in and

346
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:20,579
that everything looks simple when

347
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:21,959
objects of the testing might be do you

348
00:17:20,579 --> 00:17:25,680
know if we've got that stuff and where

349
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:26,699
it is enough to get to it do we have the

350
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:28,470
right do we know what the processes are

351
00:17:26,699 --> 00:17:29,880
to get the right people in the room or

352
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:31,410
please speak with those critical

353
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:32,760
supplies and third parties directly or

354
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:35,790
do they have that secret list of people

355
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:37,350
that the law inspector got process to

356
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:40,139
the interpol to keep people in the room

357
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:42,090
bad stuff can happen anytime like if you

358
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:45,060
things go sideways on Christmas Eve like

359
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:47,040
how are you getting overtime so I was

360
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:49,649
like how'd you get this far exercise I

361
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:51,290
guess control then people's arms get to

362
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:53,490
keep them in that room

363
00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:55,200
do you have processes for capturing

364
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:57,090
evidence and document in what you do in

365
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:59,610
like you know some of this stuff you

366
00:17:57,090 --> 00:18:01,110
might rely on it immediately it's all

367
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:03,389
going to be useful in the long term but

368
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:05,810
yeah is it rules you have to follow up

369
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:08,340
and shopping at regulators or anyone who

370
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:09,750
external scrutiny might have a very

371
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:11,220
strong opinion on how you should

372
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:15,390
document stuff as you deal with a

373
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:20,730
problem and technology wise do you have

374
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:23,280
the basics a hard but the analysis yeah

375
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:26,190
firewalling locks whatever are you

376
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:28,800
logging everything to work with can you

377
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:32,090
answer the NCATS incident questions you

378
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:34,620
don't want to you know just sure about

379
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:40,409
yesterday's like who doesn't test they

380
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:41,610
open up let's hear that right so they

381
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:46,380
don't come across time in certain

382
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:49,290
questions then two three okay so that's

383
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:51,600
a cyber police where you care sure they

384
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:52,889
haven't bet with is subscribed and they

385
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,419
put together back to logging and

386
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:56,340
monitoring like basically if you just

387
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:57,720
like landed from another planet and you

388
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:59,340
have to describe love your mother into

389
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:02,190
something why they should do it they

390
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:04,350
have a nice two-page article the details

391
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:06,870
all up and right at the bottom is a

392
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:08,459
super useful table of these are the

393
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:11,159
questions you need to be able to answer

394
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:13,500
than things go sideways will expect it

395
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:15,420
if we get called in I think there's a

396
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:17,400
fairly natural expectation that someone

397
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:18,810
like the ICO would expect to be able to

398
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:21,480
answer those questions if they've got

399
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:23,700
involved I can use you know where the

400
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:27,930
vendor what and seriously recommend

401
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:32,190
checking out gives me all the bad news

402
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:35,430
man right horrible fact of life is toxin

403
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:37,020
are all super positive very and for some

404
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:41,010
people everything boils down to money

405
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:43,860
and all security stuff whatever your

406
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:45,330
sort of view of the industry is probably

407
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:47,580
for the organisation you work for unless

408
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:49,199
you're a vendor there see also carry

409
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:51,449
stuff as an overhead right where a cost

410
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:54,600
we add complexity to the business and

411
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:56,880
that probably been asked and ever worked

412
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:57,750
blue team if you ever worked like car

413
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,160
InfoSec

414
00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:01,140
you've probably have to play the

415
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:02,880
justification game you know I can eat

416
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:03,650
five analysts because I've got shift to

417
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,540
them

418
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:07,250
you can have three what does that mean

419
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:09,830
like will not do Wednesdays and Sundays

420
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:13,520
and put that into the bad guys well as

421
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:16,970
those days and so horrible change the

422
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:19,129
same sort of logic around London attack

423
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:21,950
money I get supplied to people and girls

424
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:24,830
they always need justified justification

425
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:26,690
to people in a jury at Boltzmann and one

426
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:30,080
of the extra value adds a ball game and

427
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:32,180
is generating you know the context of a

428
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:33,860
very real-world problem the value of

429
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:35,840
those people and those roles and

430
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:42,969
sometimes versus the technology is that

431
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:45,050
they've already had in place for

432
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:48,070
demonstrating alignment internally there

433
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:52,639
we've got C sores now that's a thing

434
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:55,730
some of them a seat at the big table

435
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:58,430
with the rest of the sea levels exist so

436
00:20:55,730 --> 00:21:01,730
wargaming can arm those Caesars with

437
00:20:58,430 --> 00:21:06,380
quite a tangible example what state is

438
00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:08,810
and how it can respond to this to they

439
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:10,190
can you see results from the exercise to

440
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:21,020
support their basically investing in

441
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:22,340
technology or people although it can

442
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:26,030
demonstrate the maturity of the

443
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:29,860
organization to external parties ensure

444
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:31,399
effective was positively affected Rand

445
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:34,250
internally if you can somehow

446
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:37,900
demonstrate that online draws attention

447
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:37,900
to the competence of the leadership team

448
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:45,110
on the flip side there are some

449
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:47,780
potential negatives and it's not

450
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:51,169
pleasant when an incident happens head

451
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:53,629
Steve start to roll and usually to see

452
00:21:51,170 --> 00:21:55,880
so hence the question about what do you

453
00:21:53,630 --> 00:21:59,510
want to see said who has experience

454
00:21:55,880 --> 00:22:01,970
speech I'll not and yeah how did the

455
00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:07,790
first show hands and he went to break

456
00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:12,040
first rage he would hire a receipt so he

457
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:12,040
was in roles he saw in a major breach

458
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:17,510
right and everyone else just know we're

459
00:22:15,890 --> 00:22:22,040
not hiring but listen he

460
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:23,960
of a solver bridge okay well yeah so

461
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:27,110
this is us goes here gets shifted in

462
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:29,750
with someone else who's green stop start

463
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:31,428
to worry the news respect to the

464
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:36,650
business the Luke respect the management

465
00:22:31,429 --> 00:22:40,760
and they walk out to and on the public

466
00:22:36,650 --> 00:22:42,860
Internet history does tell us that if

467
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:47,030
you have a breach and it gets out into

468
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:49,040
the news people will talk more about how

469
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:51,799
you responded to that breach rather than

470
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:53,540
the size of it a lot Dayton is involved

471
00:22:51,799 --> 00:22:55,309
they don't see that chat about whether

472
00:22:53,540 --> 00:23:00,020
or not they see iron or credit card data

473
00:22:55,309 --> 00:23:03,230
etc unfunctional intersect Twitter you

474
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:16,220
will likely get a free pen test all the

475
00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:18,679
sudden and them so another one if you

476
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:21,350
review start to war game and discovered

477
00:23:18,679 --> 00:23:22,520
about really no one's got clue

478
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:24,918
what's going on

479
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:31,730
you better you've got two options now a

480
00:23:24,919 --> 00:23:33,260
Dodge or buckle up the Spartans yeah you

481
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:36,260
can either went run away I'll just like

482
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:38,720
that said of it so state wants panic

483
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:40,700
right I've given him a little bit yes

484
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:42,950
zoom alien sections at the top the

485
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:45,950
really dry kind of death by PowerPoint

486
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:47,660
bits and so yeah it's a pawn in like

487
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:49,190
these items over up and up and down

488
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:51,410
essentially into two bits about the

489
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:56,210
designing the war game and then basic

490
00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:57,919
way and the right peephole in together

491
00:23:56,210 --> 00:24:02,620
selecting the how and the way and the

492
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:06,230
final top by execution and so planning

493
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:08,840
guest farm major building blocks which

494
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:11,000
is a gap on the Nexus of thing but you

495
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:13,280
know we need some objectives of the test

496
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:15,290
we want to do the testing we want to try

497
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:16,940
and put together and we're going to need

498
00:24:15,290 --> 00:24:19,970
to select some realistic scenario of the

499
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:22,100
side of shrine draw those out thoughts

500
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:24,679
on those objectives we never break that

501
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:26,570
scenario down into chunks or what tends

502
00:24:24,679 --> 00:24:30,140
to get bounded rounding I are testing

503
00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:31,120
wonders in jets and you want to put

504
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:33,700
together some guiding

505
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:35,020
optional guidance around the injects to

506
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:36,520
sort of I guess

507
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:42,220
pile the wheels and keep it running

508
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:45,010
smoothly and planning like it's a very

509
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:46,870
high level question but you know what do

510
00:24:45,010 --> 00:24:48,070
you want to know like why is it you're

511
00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:51,489
actually testing what do you want to

512
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:52,929
verify what do you have enough

513
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:56,410
information to answer the question that

514
00:24:52,930 --> 00:24:59,470
you can use testing to sort out and you

515
00:24:56,410 --> 00:25:01,720
can focus on themes like can we just do

516
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:03,970
we know what we're doing I might be one

517
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:06,580
of those themes and can't be testy

518
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:07,330
specific yeah like do we have firewall

519
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:09,580
logs father

520
00:25:07,330 --> 00:25:14,439
that's strange satellite office in the

521
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:16,389
Middle East if there comes up in AWS can

522
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:17,860
we work out which one of our I guess

523
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:20,410
internal customers but there probably

524
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:22,000
belongs to you know whatever it is it's

525
00:25:20,410 --> 00:25:23,260
quite generic so everyone can get used

526
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,260
to this but you need to work out what it

527
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:28,090
is you want to test before you start and

528
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:30,250
you're gonna get the opportunity to sort

529
00:25:28,090 --> 00:25:34,090
of you know Mick is perfect narrative to

530
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:36,490
focus on these things and like I guess

531
00:25:34,090 --> 00:25:41,169
make the testing happen the way you want

532
00:25:36,490 --> 00:25:43,150
and hopefully the the questions you have

533
00:25:41,170 --> 00:25:44,110
are impossible to answer otherwise I

534
00:25:43,150 --> 00:25:47,260
guess you're just going to met people

535
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:48,790
forced read and you don't normally share

536
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:51,250
the objectives we possessed in

537
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:53,409
participants like you might not even

538
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:55,240
share that the details that you're going

539
00:25:53,410 --> 00:25:58,530
to do testing with them until the very

540
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:58,530
last minute and we'll put onto that

541
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:04,510
selecting scenario yeah picking a

542
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:06,100
scenario unique to every organization

543
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:08,379
but you should have to go really far for

544
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:10,330
inspiration and ask people or to keep

545
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:14,830
them in the work where can i at night

546
00:26:10,330 --> 00:26:16,600
and if you focus in on some concern your

547
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:20,110
sponsors actually have you not only

548
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:21,850
probably going to get and guarantee

549
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:25,090
they're buying probably going to fight

550
00:26:21,850 --> 00:26:26,169
for it more and that's passionate way is

551
00:26:25,090 --> 00:26:28,320
probably going to do the business or

552
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:31,420
organization good in the grill

553
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:33,669
scheme of things news and phone app news

554
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:35,580
and media we're ten minutes chats with

555
00:26:33,670 --> 00:26:37,870
us or more probably other breach right

556
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:40,500
you might have customers clients are

557
00:26:37,870 --> 00:26:42,760
regulars are very specific concerns like

558
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:44,770
they might ask the party question is

559
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:46,720
someone in our industry has had

560
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:49,030
some kind of incident and it's not

561
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:53,260
public knowledge maybe think about how

562
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:55,000
you can solve those impulse filling all

563
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:59,170
out these bad things de león's which is

564
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:01,570
basically speed of crap scenario ideas

565
00:26:59,170 --> 00:27:06,700
like no I'm attacking from the real from

566
00:27:01,570 --> 00:27:08,950
real life super useful staff small

567
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:11,290
especially if you've not you know first

568
00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:12,880
because this Newton is new to most of

569
00:27:11,290 --> 00:27:14,770
you like start simple I don't go out

570
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:16,690
full Bandersnatch of the first one we

571
00:27:14,770 --> 00:27:18,490
like the multiple you know you out

572
00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:20,410
Netflix I don't want them to Netflix

573
00:27:18,490 --> 00:27:22,750
kind of which old isn't but yeah you

574
00:27:20,410 --> 00:27:25,240
know just stop something small us a very

575
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:26,740
specific question if you can't and doing

576
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:28,540
on this ripped if to start with like

577
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:30,190
getting people around the room in your

578
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:33,010
organization and not doing a day job

579
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:34,450
might be a big ask anywhere keeping them

580
00:27:33,010 --> 00:27:36,400
in the room is probably not too much an

581
00:27:34,450 --> 00:27:37,929
extension of that when you if you have a

582
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:40,390
scenario a posting people off the

583
00:27:37,929 --> 00:27:41,230
following lines all the data center it's

584
00:27:40,390 --> 00:27:44,260
probably gonna get a bit more

585
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:45,730
complicated and the objective of start

586
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:46,990
and testing should be keeping testing

587
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:48,790
you're looking for hopefully through an

588
00:27:46,990 --> 00:27:50,650
improvement over time the more

589
00:27:48,790 --> 00:27:53,200
complicated these things get or the

590
00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:58,690
better your responsibilities respond

591
00:27:53,200 --> 00:28:00,840
will be pub secure name we share some

592
00:27:58,690 --> 00:28:03,070
example scenario is like Boompa Park

593
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:06,100
Tesla's value incident scenarios what

594
00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:07,960
everyone to call in and very cyber are

595
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:09,669
inside appreciate I figured that derive

596
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:11,500
for the audience like if if your

597
00:28:09,670 --> 00:28:14,410
principal concern just like physical

598
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:16,090
like that's totally great as well like

599
00:28:14,410 --> 00:28:19,420
you know someone finds a must require

600
00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:20,860
comms cabinet well I think yeah it sort

601
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:22,330
of finds one those you can plant USB

602
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:26,639
cables and it turns out to be a farm but

603
00:28:22,330 --> 00:28:26,639
like bus yeah that's a good it as well

604
00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:34,240
okay into injects yeah they need to be

605
00:28:32,650 --> 00:28:37,559
like the major plot points and twists

606
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:40,240
and in the scenario if you have in mind

607
00:28:37,559 --> 00:28:42,490
try not to give away anything if you can

608
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:45,429
you know just provide enough information

609
00:28:42,490 --> 00:28:47,920
to move the story along maybe promote

610
00:28:45,429 --> 00:28:49,480
some of those kind of next step

611
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:52,809
questions that you can cover off in your

612
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:56,230
guidance but and people's about five

613
00:28:52,809 --> 00:28:58,330
yeah is it one day made if I like the

614
00:28:56,230 --> 00:29:00,850
idea of the ones we inject by

615
00:28:58,330 --> 00:29:06,850
haha but there are no extreme formation

616
00:29:00,850 --> 00:29:10,510
like Tibet in principle and real with

617
00:29:06,850 --> 00:29:12,850
them in a full one day scenario I'll

618
00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:15,480
have to burn through about five injects

619
00:29:12,850 --> 00:29:18,820
with people going on and doing stuff and

620
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:21,130
that's you know if you tell say star in

621
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:22,480
five chance and if you somehow get sign

622
00:29:21,130 --> 00:29:24,040
off for like a month long thing like

623
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:30,370
writes me up and all that works

624
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:33,129
I play it out and guidance yes each

625
00:29:30,370 --> 00:29:35,649
inject will have some like natural

626
00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:38,350
questions which will arise yeah so you

627
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:42,160
should really P prepare for them but it

628
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:43,419
shouldn't affect the should each other -

629
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:45,210
yeah I should lead a truck yeah I should

630
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:48,310
they trap from attach them you you know

631
00:29:45,210 --> 00:29:48,730
they saw it on and do they tell us

632
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:53,310
anything

633
00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:55,030
if the inject isn't specific enough I

634
00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:57,490
don't know it's unique to your

635
00:29:55,030 --> 00:29:58,360
organization but you can confirm the

636
00:29:57,490 --> 00:29:59,890
whole like no there's no actual

637
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:01,750
information like a bit impulsive

638
00:29:59,890 --> 00:30:03,760
guidance can be or if you have it

639
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:05,910
it's natural follow-on questions that

640
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:08,890
you'd want to provide the answer to like

641
00:30:05,910 --> 00:30:10,150
you think it was like if y'all depends

642
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:12,610
on your organisation and I are you

643
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:14,170
internal search points work if you

644
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:15,429
always get certain information with

645
00:30:14,170 --> 00:30:17,800
someone who possibly know certain where

646
00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:20,050
I pump up drafted like I've had draft

647
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:23,129
service desk tickets to support things

648
00:30:20,050 --> 00:30:26,080
like printed out and it looks legit and

649
00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:29,530
it happens we allocate to the scenario

650
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:32,530
as well and again we're do scenario is

651
00:30:29,530 --> 00:30:34,649
however your organization works and yet

652
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:37,360
the guidance is quite specific to you

653
00:30:34,650 --> 00:30:40,030
ultimately they'll get your testes to do

654
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:43,419
all the work and that's what yeah don't

655
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:45,100
let the guidance be that easy way out so

656
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:48,250
start a lower level then when you've got

657
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:49,629
this thing written up you should end up

658
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:53,190
with something like this obviously not

659
00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:56,200
in these weird super bright colors but

660
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:57,820
index other things you share the

661
00:30:56,200 --> 00:31:00,550
guidance probably keep that in your back

662
00:30:57,820 --> 00:31:02,050
pocket and provide it specifically to

663
00:31:00,550 --> 00:31:02,649
each question that's asked you know

664
00:31:02,050 --> 00:31:04,000
objectives

665
00:31:02,650 --> 00:31:05,650
you probably don't share that with

666
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,000
anyone over on the sponsor if they're

667
00:31:05,650 --> 00:31:10,990
not involved and in

668
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:12,910
partly right at the end and his

669
00:31:10,990 --> 00:31:14,110
shriveling sort of conceptual ends kind

670
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:17,320
of probably how it will work

671
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:19,510
yeah I'm storing the index kind of

672
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:21,370
relate to that this guidance to support

673
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:24,160
and but the thing I really want in to

674
00:31:21,370 --> 00:31:26,320
pull out is the response like what

675
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:28,110
people do and the decisions around what

676
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:29,950
they should be doing I decide to do and

677
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:31,540
you want to tie that up to your

678
00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:33,970
objectives and the timing of your

679
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:35,800
injects can be important as well we've

680
00:31:33,970 --> 00:31:38,080
got a narrative bullying people are

681
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:39,639
halfway through their farm process we've

682
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:41,199
got an inject in there and just screw

683
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:46,510
everything up basically just an asshole

684
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:51,700
for there and so following to actual

685
00:31:46,510 --> 00:31:53,379
planning part sponsorships sponsorship

686
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:56,200
is he finds someone within the

687
00:31:53,380 --> 00:32:00,700
organization who is going to be your key

688
00:31:56,200 --> 00:32:03,010
player identify the participants and you

689
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:08,520
looking to find really everyone in the

690
00:32:03,010 --> 00:32:14,050
business you want IT ops devs HR PR

691
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:16,960
legal senior management team you got

692
00:32:14,050 --> 00:32:21,460
overseers and check the schedule for

693
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:23,230
major conflicts yeah this monster thing

694
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:24,010
like you do license to operate like at

695
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:27,070
the end of the day this thing's

696
00:32:24,010 --> 00:32:28,960
disruptive like like anything when you

697
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:30,700
take people away from their day job is

698
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:33,340
like the business of the organizations

699
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:34,870
and carry an additional cost that you

700
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:37,360
need to get this thing signed off for

701
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:39,879
guests with enough authority to so that

702
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:41,590
one way get the okay to admit to let it

703
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:45,040
happen they're also then the support to

704
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:46,929
make it happen and without it like the

705
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:49,659
things not happening like you you know I

706
00:32:46,930 --> 00:32:51,850
guess there's the opportunity for the

707
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:53,290
non committed sponsor to get you to go

708
00:32:51,850 --> 00:32:54,939
away and do all the planning but if you

709
00:32:53,290 --> 00:32:57,100
don't let you know basically back you up

710
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:59,710
on the day where you got twice the

711
00:32:57,100 --> 00:33:00,969
people's time like it's going to be you

712
00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:02,970
in the road in the room when your own

713
00:33:00,970 --> 00:33:08,710
with some pacer possibly not bad thing

714
00:33:02,970 --> 00:33:10,960
yeah yeah the sponsor you you might be

715
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:13,540
pushing you for something if not you get

716
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:15,190
explode into like sellout benefits

717
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:18,010
break it down into these kind of like

718
00:33:15,190 --> 00:33:20,619
building block components walk and walk

719
00:33:18,010 --> 00:33:23,230
it through within two or three times

720
00:33:20,619 --> 00:33:25,999
but yet you really even it's a bucket

721
00:33:23,230 --> 00:33:29,029
and it will be the notice the low drift

722
00:33:25,999 --> 00:33:31,220
yeah cuz now if this tabletop you know

723
00:33:29,029 --> 00:33:35,049
it is literally supposed to happen there

724
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:38,480
also a certain piece of let's face it

725
00:33:35,049 --> 00:33:40,340
comparable I may I've seen some good

726
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:41,720
wide Road just a lot of

727
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:46,389
information-sharing just willingly

728
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:48,799
colleagues who also I didn't know that

729
00:33:46,389 --> 00:33:50,178
right well we didn't have a pond for

730
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:51,679
that all we have an office in that

731
00:33:50,179 --> 00:33:55,340
country yeah that's that's the kind

732
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:59,029
because yeah your participants then like

733
00:33:55,340 --> 00:34:01,330
you know identify who you want in the

734
00:33:59,029 --> 00:34:03,980
room I guess at least to start with and

735
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:05,899
the sponsor by whoever is kind of

736
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:07,279
bucking you on this thing and probably

737
00:34:05,899 --> 00:34:09,469
have some opinions on what they might

738
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:10,790
want to I guess depending on your

739
00:34:09,469 --> 00:34:12,168
scenario they might want to test their

740
00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:13,879
business function capability in a

741
00:34:12,168 --> 00:34:17,328
certain area or the certain move it move

742
00:34:13,879 --> 00:34:18,649
it and if you don't know who needs to be

743
00:34:17,329 --> 00:34:20,450
in the room and the sponsor can't give

744
00:34:18,649 --> 00:34:23,270
you the player stare I boom that some

745
00:34:20,449 --> 00:34:26,000
Jets had one like inject battling

746
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:27,679
happened tasks one word right find out

747
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:33,530
where we get in the room like do you

748
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:36,049
know okay in the room is still obviously

749
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:39,349
is the Judah cares referees you want to

750
00:34:36,049 --> 00:34:41,929
call and and probably do but this whole

751
00:34:39,349 --> 00:34:44,059
thing needs like support and someone's

752
00:34:41,929 --> 00:34:46,399
who really I think I had it Tracy last

753
00:34:44,059 --> 00:34:47,359
night as the White team right Roger

754
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:49,638
Roger

755
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:52,129
hundreds of people involved vested

756
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:54,679
there's a dedicated team the minimum for

757
00:34:52,129 --> 00:34:58,250
these kind of feedback loops a little

758
00:34:54,679 --> 00:34:59,510
team and conflict so destruction up on

759
00:34:58,250 --> 00:35:02,059
these things when there's an office move

760
00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:04,760
on all the world's cup like something

761
00:35:02,059 --> 00:35:07,069
really sensitive like you're closing a

762
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:10,990
branch again in Moscow is it's going to

763
00:35:07,069 --> 00:35:10,990
just time for the whole thing and

764
00:35:11,890 --> 00:35:17,720
logistics yet you know so I've grown up

765
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:20,480
stuff I felt and preach but yeah yeah

766
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:24,890
well the room they're getting a navy and

767
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:26,420
like naughty they yeah print stuff out

768
00:35:24,890 --> 00:35:28,700
air box if you need it and be conscious

769
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:30,260
about how you do put in my dirt does you

770
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:31,669
feel that reprographics department

771
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:33,650
conducts send all this kind of stuff to

772
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:35,120
them in advance because right known

773
00:35:33,650 --> 00:35:37,970
turned up surprise on the day is going

774
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:41,240
to have got out yeah

775

Peter snacks and the last thing wet on

776
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:47,330
the planning stuff is basically sending

777
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:48,529
up limitations and obviously based on

778
00:35:47,330 --> 00:35:50,090
the support respond certain type of

779
00:35:48,530 --> 00:35:51,440
organization you in you're probably

780
00:35:50,090 --> 00:35:53,660
going to become dead and tell people

781
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:56,060
what this is like I assess whatever blah

782
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:57,859
blah blah this ribbon is their response

783
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:59,540
to might not want you to do that had a

784
00:35:57,860 --> 00:36:01,730
bitten up on an engagement where you

785
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:03,590
basically said I'm free kick and invite

786
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:10,730
a lot of people and it's like boom the

787
00:36:03,590 --> 00:36:15,790
dunlop it's such a peptide that and when

788
00:36:10,730 --> 00:36:18,320
you do send us invitations

789
00:36:15,790 --> 00:36:20,380
people are gonna complain like not

790
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:26,180
everyone's gonna be on board with this

791
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:27,890
expect it you probably already know who

792
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:30,589
those people yeah you've probably got a

793
00:36:27,890 --> 00:36:33,830
good failing and the sponsor might even

794
00:36:30,590 --> 00:36:35,660
have specific concerns and want to

795
00:36:33,830 --> 00:36:37,690
validate that as part of what they get

796
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:41,830
out of this you know we've got a

797
00:36:37,690 --> 00:36:44,390
whatever team responses in their remit

798
00:36:41,830 --> 00:36:46,819
we've got a tester response they're not

799
00:36:44,390 --> 00:36:49,089
happy they're kicked off but I think

800
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:51,860
it's the best use of that time you know

801
00:36:49,090 --> 00:36:53,720
expect it and start to think if you can

802
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:56,120
in advance of how you handle those

803
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:58,459
people team might not be your problem I

804
00:36:56,120 --> 00:37:02,089
love your fight like find out who raised

805
00:36:58,460 --> 00:37:04,250
and admitted Aires try and be

806
00:37:02,090 --> 00:37:06,500
sympathetic but I have to remind myself

807
00:37:04,250 --> 00:37:08,930
not to fidget yeah I'll probably oil

808
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:11,000
care like like influence over

809
00:37:08,930 --> 00:37:12,649
instructure and haven't worked up from

810
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:17,150
but their best if we try and get people

811
00:37:12,650 --> 00:37:19,220
involved and if you can and offer them

812
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:20,780
the reality check but this is the kind

813
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:22,759
of mantra I go everywhere as big as

814
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:24,410
people than have better self thing you

815
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:26,180
know bit reality is never 10 be a good

816
00:37:24,410 --> 00:37:29,629
time for this thing now should be no

817
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:31,759
different I know you're busy you're

818
00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:34,610
super important without your thing this

819
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:36,230
company will just fall over but we need

820
00:37:34,610 --> 00:37:39,980
you like the boss says you've got to be

821
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:40,580
in the part of expecting yeah like

822
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:42,890
seriously

823
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:44,690
Branson Esther you get wet like you just

824
00:37:42,890 --> 00:37:45,350
got to be you just think up and without

825
00:37:44,690 --> 00:37:47,010
you

826
00:37:45,350 --> 00:37:52,589
it's our value bear that

827
00:37:47,010 --> 00:37:56,190
and when it did the game asses how try

828
00:37:52,590 --> 00:37:58,710
not to be like dick yeah one bill uh

829
00:37:56,190 --> 00:38:00,120
yeah one nose is my new like default

830
00:37:58,710 --> 00:38:01,950
response to people that complain so much

831
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:04,500
the big thing is head Korea protects

832
00:38:01,950 --> 00:38:06,029
always like if you do end up with anyone

833
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:07,890
in the room that's just there because of

834
00:38:06,030 --> 00:38:09,750
some JFDI oh that has come down from on

835
00:38:07,890 --> 00:38:11,790
high but they're not really in the room

836
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:15,330
like they're not there I got something

837
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:17,640
fall asleep on again but they'll

838
00:38:15,330 --> 00:38:19,230
probably be disruptive for probably be a

839
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:21,299
jerk for probably mess it up for

840
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:22,530
everyone else and detracts from the

841
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:25,440
whole thing they'll get in people's

842
00:38:22,530 --> 00:38:28,200
where they might try and derail the

843
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:29,880
whole thing like getting out find

844
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:35,270
someone else we can still do on Friday

845
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:35,270
would pop in yeah definitely not I was

846
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:44,730
so broke up and take everyone's names

847
00:38:42,690 --> 00:38:49,530
keeps enough who's that you didn't go

848
00:38:44,730 --> 00:38:51,270
and explain what is going on so reminded

849
00:38:49,530 --> 00:38:55,560
why today trying to get it into the

850
00:38:51,270 --> 00:38:57,750
spirit of things it can be fun it's not

851
00:38:55,560 --> 00:39:02,690
all doom and gloom despite my previous

852
00:38:57,750 --> 00:39:05,070
slide this but do set some ground rules

853
00:39:02,690 --> 00:39:07,620
not arguing in between to that and

854
00:39:05,070 --> 00:39:10,920
remind them about the sponsor will have

855
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:15,060
some expectations of them of their mini

856
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:16,650
post some ground rules can help people

857
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:20,700
get into it so it's about saying the

858
00:39:16,650 --> 00:39:24,420
scenario I'm keeping within keeping and

859
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:26,160
we did begin not fight in this area if

860
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:30,630
you have one ground rule as that base

861
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:33,089
like you can't write the perfect text

862
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:37,020
maybe you can which can again message me

863
00:39:33,090 --> 00:39:38,460
but looking out but however you code how

864
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:40,590
much research you put into this thing

865
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:43,080
even if your based on previous incidents

866
00:39:40,590 --> 00:39:44,760
you got and say on the day someone's

867
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:46,500
going to find exception of the details

868
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:47,970
well that guide to work on Wednesdays

869
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:49,470
and we've got that thing login forever

870
00:39:47,970 --> 00:39:51,419
but you know just those things the

871
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:54,000
Tractatus is apply to our environment

872
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:56,580
yeah yeah don't matter if you email

873
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:59,520
volume or on site honking the client you

874
00:39:56,580 --> 00:40:00,630
know like email goes down deal if if you

875
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:03,420
can get people not

876
00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:05,610
in the scenario you've pretty much

877
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:07,470
cracked it even if they know that the

878
00:40:05,610 --> 00:40:08,310
thing you're up against will probably

879
00:40:07,470 --> 00:40:10,290
never happen

880
00:40:08,310 --> 00:40:11,910
you're getting all the benefit you

881
00:40:10,290 --> 00:40:15,120
testing up thinking you're testing them

882
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:16,770
so you make and you know it's you still

883
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:19,500
get the value even if they can't

884
00:40:16,770 --> 00:40:21,380
immediately go we're right open nothing

885
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:24,510
ever happens they can solve views on it

886
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:26,430
so game over and you gotta formally

887
00:40:24,510 --> 00:40:30,440
concluded start sundown you take and

888
00:40:26,430 --> 00:40:32,730
they'll send out answers whatever and

889
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:35,880
get any feedback to be learning polls

890
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:37,530
and note down the highs and your lows

891
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:39,510
and things like that

892
00:40:37,530 --> 00:40:42,210
you yes we'll probably have to write a

893
00:40:39,510 --> 00:40:45,150
true apart and best in conjunction with

894
00:40:42,210 --> 00:40:47,760
your sponsor observations

895
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:54,870
recommendations like review dates with

896
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:59,130
response plan for what and gaps captured

897
00:40:54,870 --> 00:41:01,080
in secular and share those with the

898
00:40:59,130 --> 00:41:02,760
sponsor yet don't do this thing I mean

899
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:05,100
like get around to finishing the report

900
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:07,560
six weeks later and then tell people

901
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:09,870
it's you uncovered some horror show like

902
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:12,090
you mouth coverage here we identified

903
00:41:09,870 --> 00:41:13,350
some horrible desk you found some office

904
00:41:12,090 --> 00:41:15,600
that you didn't know you actually how to

905
00:41:13,350 --> 00:41:18,569
fight you know if you if you spot those

906
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:20,520
big things like straight up anyone

907
00:41:18,570 --> 00:41:23,760
sponsor any five minutes each time boxes

908
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:26,820
well found get it into their mindset and

909
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:28,680
let them work and if you can do some

910
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:31,500
high-level presentations and sea levels

911
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:34,350
about what happened then Prospero right

912
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:36,660
little our polls in mind and so the

913
00:41:34,350 --> 00:41:39,750
start is like all about how he will

914
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:42,029
stand eco nice response plan the next

915
00:41:39,750 --> 00:41:45,240
scenario and then just look at the

916
00:41:42,030 --> 00:41:48,420
changes start with the end see people

917
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:51,000
change on just do again let's keep doing

918
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:53,190
it assume it wasn't a complete pilot

919
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:54,840
firing like you know you've not burn

920
00:41:53,190 --> 00:41:56,730
every Bridge that you can say like that

921
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:58,770
initial logic is the best time to start

922
00:41:56,730 --> 00:42:01,230
gets on the ship for keeping doing this

923
00:41:58,770 --> 00:42:03,540
as a thing and if the first one sucks

924
00:42:01,230 --> 00:42:07,200
and you burn all your you know political

925
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:10,890
collateral probably just to go another

926
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:14,368
one so coming to the end some

927
00:42:10,890 --> 00:42:16,710
conclusions about fifteen minutes

928
00:42:14,369 --> 00:42:21,030
nothing brings people together our

929
00:42:16,710 --> 00:42:26,310
shared experience either real will

930
00:42:21,030 --> 00:42:28,070
incident all simulated one the analogy I

931
00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:31,440
met for the benefits of doing the

932
00:42:28,070 --> 00:42:33,090
wargaming is sort of the fire alarm

933
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:35,610
drills or it gave me a very well

934
00:42:33,090 --> 00:42:38,460
aspiring with in part it's about muscle

935
00:42:35,610 --> 00:42:40,650
memory and if you were downstairs and

936
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:42,660
songs over stop this moment keynote and

937
00:42:40,650 --> 00:42:46,200
the concept of war game does apply there

938
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:50,868
so getting that training mind the active

939
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:54,689
thinking when you eat it with mind

940
00:42:50,869 --> 00:42:59,730
- it's just intrinsic it is responding

941
00:42:54,690 --> 00:43:02,340
afterwards because as well in a line

942
00:42:59,730 --> 00:43:04,410
incident goes back since it was taught

943
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:06,660
you can have people you know something

944
00:43:04,410 --> 00:43:07,170
post-traumatic stress for things like

945
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:08,730
this

946
00:43:07,170 --> 00:43:11,750
see you want a while so I don't buy the

947
00:43:08,730 --> 00:43:14,430
people about camp on your watch and you

948
00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:21,619
understand that some people can't deal

949
00:43:14,430 --> 00:43:25,649
with all the issues that might arise so

950
00:43:21,619 --> 00:43:31,680
technology does it not even readiness

951
00:43:25,650 --> 00:43:34,050
all capabilities we have in looking at

952
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:36,450
the beaches four or five decades worth

953
00:43:34,050 --> 00:43:38,700
of buying another product buying another

954
00:43:36,450 --> 00:43:40,710
product sitting on the network Miller

955
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:43,080
but pops doing very much nothing is no

956
00:43:40,710 --> 00:43:43,830
one's looking at it and that's gone on

957
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:48,779
far too long

958
00:43:43,830 --> 00:43:51,569
and we're going into the age of recovery

959
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:54,140
and resilience we've got a beautiful

960
00:43:51,570 --> 00:43:55,770
into from immutable infrastructure

961
00:43:54,140 --> 00:43:56,670
containerization things like that way

962
00:43:55,770 --> 00:43:58,859
reducing

963
00:43:56,670 --> 00:44:03,090
attackers persistence on your network

964
00:43:58,859 --> 00:44:04,560
hopefully but if your data gets out you

965
00:44:03,090 --> 00:44:06,960
get out of regions as breaches will

966
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:09,900
continue to happen it will totally it

967
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:12,060
would be more breaches but I doesn't

968
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:16,440
even solve that problem in my lifetime

969
00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:19,410
pass pessimist it to keep their lying

970
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:21,090
cheating line it's challenging that

971
00:44:19,410 --> 00:44:24,600
primitive mindset no matter how many

972
00:44:21,090 --> 00:44:25,500
files been by second 2 segmented

973
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:26,880
networks

974
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:27,530
someone's in the patrol and that

975
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:30,590
firewall

976
00:44:27,530 --> 00:44:32,270
some freak'll at their agency in about

977
00:44:30,590 --> 00:44:34,850
hardware in plan to get us to air gap

978
00:44:32,270 --> 00:44:37,490
network so we're about preaching

979
00:44:34,850 --> 00:44:39,170
resilience on promoting that Redis there

980
00:44:37,490 --> 00:44:41,990
is a balance of technology be brought in

981
00:44:39,170 --> 00:44:47,630
foot student and said on the TVs it's

982
00:44:41,990 --> 00:44:49,729
coming to the end we wondered run so far

983
00:44:47,630 --> 00:44:51,920
have been quite simple for organizations

984
00:44:49,730 --> 00:44:54,710
just entering into the idea with

985
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:58,370
wargaming graph is quite materia some

986
00:44:54,710 --> 00:45:01,010
organizations our approach has been very

987
00:44:58,370 --> 00:45:03,470
linear very train tracks is next step

988
00:45:01,010 --> 00:45:06,740
and go on the train and there's a next

989
00:45:03,470 --> 00:45:08,620
step so the future sort of direction

990
00:45:06,740 --> 00:45:13,279
that we want to go it is the usual

991
00:45:08,620 --> 00:45:16,630
friendship understand China speaking

992
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:18,800
with a class now have a good shop in one

993
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:21,230
what method of viewing it might be how

994
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:24,500
many like a red team in one room a blue

995
00:45:21,230 --> 00:45:26,660
team little room red team makeup and

996
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:29,210
inject on spot and that's been fed

997
00:45:26,660 --> 00:45:30,980
through the blue team rule room and we

998
00:45:29,210 --> 00:45:36,260
just go back and forth about no active

999
00:45:30,980 --> 00:45:39,730
testings all on the tabletop I think

1000
00:45:36,260 --> 00:45:42,410
that choose your own adventure style

1001
00:45:39,730 --> 00:45:45,350
scenario might also work well with

1002
00:45:42,410 --> 00:45:48,080
c-level execs if you basically give sea

1003
00:45:45,350 --> 00:45:51,160
level is X a financial decision to make

1004
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:54,770
do you put more compact zoom technology

1005
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:58,250
and put more up heads in in people

1006
00:45:54,770 --> 00:46:02,390
process and then sort of oh look now you

1007
00:45:58,250 --> 00:46:06,740
the next sector of X we might look about

1008
00:46:02,390 --> 00:46:09,529
that I'm not committed thank you for

1009
00:46:06,740 --> 00:46:12,020
listening to us and we will take any

1010
00:46:09,530 --> 00:46:13,660
questions on any happen right now yeah

1011
00:46:12,020 --> 00:46:16,750
target a beer

1012
00:46:13,660 --> 00:46:16,750
[Music]

1013
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:29,260
like with your time I appreciate

1014
00:46:27,070 --> 00:46:31,090
somebody over here half an hour airway

1015
00:46:29,260 --> 00:46:38,980
but I don't know any question about

1016
00:46:31,090 --> 00:46:46,150
something it left his company would you

1017
00:46:38,980 --> 00:46:50,380
think this Minds work with local beach

1018
00:46:46,150 --> 00:46:52,510
or councils and this smallest

1019
00:46:50,380 --> 00:46:56,700
organization I will be doing it for debt

1020
00:46:52,510 --> 00:46:59,710
management agency with proximately

1021
00:46:56,700 --> 00:47:03,549
hundred staff which would be call center

1022
00:46:59,710 --> 00:47:10,450
agents I am on an intersect team of

1023
00:47:03,550 --> 00:47:13,420
about one it's about testing that I like

1024
00:47:10,450 --> 00:47:15,580
how he responds I mean there's no rules

1025
00:47:13,420 --> 00:47:19,000
on whether you're a five-month company

1026
00:47:15,580 --> 00:47:21,460
are 2010 like probably going to get the

1027
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:23,800
call at some point there's foam scan a

1028
00:47:21,460 --> 00:47:26,500
debate structured and really involved it

1029
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:28,000
can be as much as I guess realization

1030
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:46,450
they pull the phone so he a say all the

1031
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:49,660
girls questions over whether she began

1032
00:47:46,450 --> 00:47:54,189
yeah he said I think the current state

1033
00:47:49,660 --> 00:47:55,779
of IR and like is I guess partly to is

1034
00:47:54,190 --> 00:47:58,690
to believe audience related to the

1035
00:47:55,780 --> 00:48:00,700
current said dr bc pay like they are in

1036
00:47:58,690 --> 00:48:02,500
basically pay at the moment for a lot of

1037
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:04,870
organizations i'm not ringbinder

1038
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:06,970
on a folder there's no hasn't been

1039
00:48:04,870 --> 00:48:09,970
updated many years and just off pull out

1040
00:48:06,970 --> 00:48:11,770
and the right wonder he'd every but i

1041
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:14,259
think i asking a similar stare i think

1042
00:48:11,770 --> 00:48:15,730
it's i ours being kind of prepared for

1043
00:48:14,260 --> 00:48:18,040
in this ml and will have a very rigid

1044
00:48:15,730 --> 00:48:19,990
plan will have a mastery incident

1045
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:21,490
process like some really sexy rhetoric

1046
00:48:19,990 --> 00:48:24,310
around up and underneath the hood it's

1047
00:48:21,490 --> 00:48:26,049
just step one two three hit the coal

1048
00:48:24,310 --> 00:48:28,810
plant send text messages cause the

1049
00:48:26,050 --> 00:48:31,990
office of their cv i think that it's

1050
00:48:28,810 --> 00:48:33,950
this immature and maybe it's immature is

1051
00:48:31,990 --> 00:48:37,129
directly related so that one base

1052
00:48:33,950 --> 00:48:40,819
yikes even some organizations not been

1053
00:48:37,130 --> 00:48:42,380
places why they should be the biggest

1054
00:48:40,820 --> 00:48:44,150
continent upon it and it's because we

1055
00:48:42,380 --> 00:48:47,839
did hunt being able to show they've got

1056
00:48:44,150 --> 00:48:50,720
an office in Christchurch and in an

1057
00:48:47,839 --> 00:48:52,670
earthquake in recent history and they

1058
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:55,040
lost people on facility and being able

1059
00:48:52,670 --> 00:48:59,510
to recover on the story they could tell

1060
00:48:55,040 --> 00:49:01,970
was amazing and that one organisation

1061
00:48:59,510 --> 00:49:04,460
backing about that can recall who busy

1062
00:49:01,970 --> 00:49:06,618
feeding us so like I think I are is I

1063
00:49:04,460 --> 00:49:08,960
was just a branch of business common

1064
00:49:06,619 --> 00:49:13,579
area I think you bring up or it's a

1065
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:14,960
biblical blip sibling yeah I don't know

1066
00:49:13,579 --> 00:49:38,030
it depends on which structure this table

1067
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:40,460
gets on YouTube does he question iswhat

1068
00:49:38,030 --> 00:49:43,819
initiate looking thanks what industry

1069
00:49:40,460 --> 00:49:46,250
would yeah I think the tangible things

1070
00:49:43,819 --> 00:49:48,109
that one of its biggest benefits is Yuki

1071
00:49:46,250 --> 00:49:50,210
Kendall these conclusions and

1072
00:49:48,109 --> 00:49:52,160
observations that you don't there's no

1073
00:49:50,210 --> 00:49:54,859
other lines that Bend is invisible and

1074
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:57,049
you know like the whole have an office

1075
00:49:54,859 --> 00:49:57,680
in that country like that's there's some

1076
00:49:57,050 --> 00:50:00,470
truth to that

1077
00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:02,930
like is handed out a little bit but you

1078
00:50:00,470 --> 00:50:05,598
don't stressing something you get very

1079
00:50:02,930 --> 00:50:08,810
different result and just saw relying on

1080
00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:12,849
what you've been sold and you know it's

1081
00:50:08,810 --> 00:50:12,849
the trust but verify things nothing oh

1082
00:50:15,490 --> 00:50:32,000
yes yeah definitely this is like

1083
00:50:29,660 --> 00:50:34,129
definitely first steps it because we all

1084
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:36,650
have been interested in I mean this talk

1085
00:50:34,130 --> 00:50:38,150
actually originated Steve's first Orkut

1086
00:50:36,650 --> 00:50:43,640
do you see when I'm starting up to over

1087
00:50:38,150 --> 00:50:45,770
27 and you know so I'm getting into it

1088
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:48,680
and my level in a pen testing something

1089
00:50:45,770 --> 00:50:50,030
Neptune like seeing all these beaches in

1090
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:51,410
Kenai Patterson's not solving the

1091
00:50:50,030 --> 00:50:58,340
problem I'm just going and wrecking the

1092
00:50:51,410 --> 00:51:00,140
net-lib so yeah I think you can make it

1093
00:50:58,340 --> 00:51:01,610
cut like a scenario you can make it's

1094
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:04,069
complicated and is the scope of our

1095
00:51:01,610 --> 00:51:06,620
organization if you want to know you

1096
00:51:04,070 --> 00:51:09,680
want to drop a rogue instance cc7 button

1097
00:51:06,620 --> 00:51:13,069
yeah you know that departments VPC in ed

1098
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:14,540
of us and like see if we spy when it

1099
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:16,430
starts interacting we still see if they

1100
00:51:14,540 --> 00:51:19,700
know what to do about yeah if that works

1101
00:51:16,430 --> 00:51:22,750
for you like there's no rules but that's

1102
00:51:19,700 --> 00:51:25,960
the point you make it was like the

1103
00:51:22,750 --> 00:51:28,640
purple team style exercises that will do

1104
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:30,230
rights not full-on like no one knows

1105
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:32,750
that something going on will pop someone

1106
00:51:30,230 --> 00:51:36,740
on site and drop an axe as part of the

1107
00:51:32,750 --> 00:51:37,900
network see if the wireless IDs and it's

1108
00:51:36,740 --> 00:51:41,089
not watching them do what they do

1109
00:51:37,900 --> 00:51:42,650
respond to that so it's not this won't

1110
00:51:41,090 --> 00:51:45,440
blur the line into the real test

1111
00:51:42,650 --> 00:51:47,750
this is testing without any pens but

1112
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:49,700
yeah I think it does work yes they're

1113
00:51:47,750 --> 00:51:53,200
very much you saw I've introduction to

1114
00:51:49,700 --> 00:51:56,810
the concept I think and doing some song

1115
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:59,060
some coverage and some fathers Marvin

1116
00:51:56,810 --> 00:52:01,850
bunts tested with yeah technical

1117
00:51:59,060 --> 00:52:03,320
specifics and he injects don't have to

1118
00:52:01,850 --> 00:52:07,819
be narrative best that could be

1119
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:09,710
offensive general on the wire offices

1120
00:52:07,820 --> 00:52:12,080
you close people you dismiss and send

1121
00:52:09,710 --> 00:52:14,060
and account for as casual as are

1122
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:15,680
dispersed or whatever but whatever works

1123
00:52:14,060 --> 00:52:19,779
for you it's going to take a lot more

1124
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:19,779
planning of this can be very disruptive
