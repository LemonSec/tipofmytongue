1
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:10,050
and hello besides leads thanks for

2
00:00:07,139 --> 00:00:12,539
coming to my talk which if you have read

3
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:15,119
through the abstract is not that

4
00:00:12,539 --> 00:00:17,400
technical in nature but I think it is

5
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:20,520
still very relevant to us as the

6
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:23,099
security industry and the fun thing if

7
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:25,320
you just have attended so eesti note is

8
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:27,660
that I think some of the parts I'm

9
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:32,369
talking about will fit in nicely with

10
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:34,530
what she was talking about so I think if

11
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:37,350
you have been in the industry long

12
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:41,850
enough you've heard people calling users

13
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:44,220
losers users layer eight problem PAP CAC

14
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:46,860
which is problem exists between keyboard

15
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:50,100
and chair we found a lot of

16
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:52,829
condescending ways to talk about the

17
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:56,130
funny antics of those people without

18
00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:58,800
really ever thinking about how to make

19
00:00:56,130 --> 00:01:04,799
it better or how to make them relevant

20
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:07,350
for security so putting box after box

21
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:09,530
after box in your network is something

22
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:12,658
that when does info security and other

23
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:14,250
conferences want you to do because it's

24
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:17,250
the next box it's going to address your

25
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:19,320
next problem and so on and so forth if

26
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:21,270
you're on the happy position that your

27
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:23,548
company is doing that and buying box

28
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:27,270
after box then your Security Operations

29
00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:30,420
Center will look a lot like that some

30
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:32,070
people with lots of dashboards with some

31
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:35,159
kind of information that might be

32
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:38,580
relevant or it might not be relevant and

33
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:40,710
I don't see an end to this cycle because

34
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:44,009
there's a new books coming out every

35
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:48,350
year probably every every month and in

36
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:51,360
the end I think that humans matter this

37
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:54,839
is a talk I archana did with Brian fight

38
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:59,520
and this is also his motto for for his

39
00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:01,500
conference and humans matter in a lot of

40
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,360
different ways and they are our users

41
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:06,720
they are our police and we need to get

42
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:08,818
them on board and I'm going to use the

43
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:11,790
word cyber and I know that some of you

44
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:14,760
in the industry hate the word cyber that

45
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:16,290
I can only kindly ask you to watch a

46
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:22,200
talk by dr. Jessica

47
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:27,540
Parker from visas London in 2016 I think

48
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:29,790
and it is about us the InfoSec industry

49
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:32,489
not really embracing that word but all

50
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:34,620
our customers using that word mostly

51
00:02:32,489 --> 00:02:38,489
exclusively and trying to meet them

52
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:42,420
halfway and this is also how wet where

53
00:02:38,489 --> 00:02:45,480
this talk is roughly going so you might

54
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:48,500
not have heard about the big pizza wars

55
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:52,578
in Germany about five years ago

56
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:55,439
so the thing was when you try to order

57
00:02:52,579 --> 00:02:58,889
some fast food why are the internet why

58
00:02:55,439 --> 00:03:01,980
the web on a Saturday chances right well

59
00:02:58,889 --> 00:03:04,590
where you didn't get any because the

60
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:07,409
biggest chains were ddosing each other

61
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:11,370
at prime time so that they could get the

62
00:03:07,409 --> 00:03:13,980
orders but they were all doing it so as

63
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:18,599
an effective person who was hungry you

64
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:21,599
couldn't get any food and of course

65
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:26,310
there was one a cry or still is I guess

66
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:31,828
which effects lives as well mainly it

67
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:33,810
hit hospitals in Britain but there were

68
00:03:31,829 --> 00:03:36,720
a lot of people affected by that as well

69
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:40,489
and one very specific example I would

70
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:43,978
like to tell you is it's about swatting

71
00:03:40,489 --> 00:03:47,659
so swatting is a word I didn't really

72
00:03:43,979 --> 00:03:50,370
know existed until a few years ago and

73
00:03:47,659 --> 00:03:53,970
swat is for the special weapons and the

74
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:56,400
small teams in the United States and the

75
00:03:53,970 --> 00:04:00,389
act of swatting is you call the SWAT

76
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:03,540
team on somebody else so to be fair when

77
00:04:00,389 --> 00:04:07,620
I was young it was funny to call

78
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:10,168
something some delivery service see them

79
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:11,579
how they pulled up at the neighbor's

80
00:04:10,169 --> 00:04:12,900
driveway and the neighbor was very

81
00:04:11,579 --> 00:04:15,090
confused because he didn't know or

82
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:18,930
anything that's fun when you're 14 years

83
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:23,729
old but in this case two people person a

84
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:27,000
and person B were heckling about one

85
00:04:23,729 --> 00:04:30,150
dollar and fifty over a skin for call of

86
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,460
duty which is an online game

87
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:34,650
personally was so disgruntled that

88
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:37,620
person B didn't pay up that he hired

89
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:41,520
person C to swat that's me

90
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:44,160
what person C did he called the police

91
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:45,960
he acted as if it was a very violent

92
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:49,050
situation as if the Sun had already

93
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:51,060
murdered parts of his family I think his

94
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:54,210
father and was now threatening to kill

95
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:56,850
the rest so if you are the police you

96
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:58,859
don't have a choice you have to act upon

97
00:04:56,850 --> 00:05:01,229
that because you don't know whether it's

98
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:02,880
a prank or not and usually this is the

99
00:05:01,229 --> 00:05:06,150
kind of prank that nobody in their right

100
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:10,770
mind does so they pulled up to a house

101
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:13,260
and they rang the bell or knocked and

102
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:15,120
somebody opened and that somebody was

103
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:17,280
very surprised because it was not person

104
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,770
B because person B give it false address

105
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:22,049
basically so it was a dope innocent

106
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:24,840
person and he saw the police staring at

107
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:26,580
him and for reasons unknown he reached

108
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:28,320
for his waistband maybe to stretch his

109
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:30,510
ass or something like that but people

110
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:35,210
thought he was reaching for a gun so

111
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:38,849
they killed him so you have a situation

112
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:41,219
about $1 in 50 where somebody who was

113
00:05:38,849 --> 00:05:42,930
not even playing online games who I

114
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:45,720
think he owned a computer but he didn't

115
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:47,490
do a lot with her with it who was

116
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:50,280
totally innocent got shot by a police

117
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:52,260
officer and to be fair that police

118
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:55,710
officer has to deal with a trauma as

119
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:58,740
well so you impact a lot of innocent

120
00:05:55,710 --> 00:06:01,229
lives so it's not a question of how

121
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:04,289
cyber impacts the physical domain it

122
00:06:01,229 --> 00:06:07,680
does and it doesn't matter whether you

123
00:06:04,289 --> 00:06:10,260
are online or not because in the case of

124
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:12,419
wanna cry and others you are affected

125
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:17,870
whether you are a person who likes to

126
00:06:12,419 --> 00:06:20,909
surf the internet or not the thing is

127
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:25,410
the one thing where I think we can make

128
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:27,150
a difference is to give our police and I

129
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:29,250
still call them users in the

130
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:31,198
presentation but the point that Zoe made

131
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:34,349
or that the person asking the question

132
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:36,300
made was very good it should be

133
00:06:34,349 --> 00:06:39,419
empowering colleagues because users has

134
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:41,280
this negative connotation to it this is

135
00:06:39,419 --> 00:06:43,390
our way out this is our way out of the

136
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:45,099
misery that we face in the secured

137
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:47,260
industry we really need to get those

138
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:50,050
people on board or we will constantly

139
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:52,990
fail because basically I don't know

140
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:54,820
whether you agree with me but as doing

141
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:57,250
security for everything and securing

142
00:06:54,820 --> 00:07:00,340
everything we are kind of in a rat race

143
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:03,100
and we are not really succeeding in

144
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:05,289
winning and putting an end to it and

145
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:07,750
saying hey now we are secure we don't

146
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:09,640
need to do anything anymore and I think

147
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:13,540
getting the users on board is a big step

148
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:15,520
so how do we do work to do that I'm

149
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:18,610
guessing that a lot of you have heard

150
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:20,530
that pentesters tail off if you want to

151
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:21,940
get into a network you just drop a USB

152
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:24,460
Drive at the parking lot

153
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:26,860
somebody will plug it in and you get

154
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:30,039
access to the network has more or less

155
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:31,540
everybody heard that story I hope so

156
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:35,920
at least some of you are not in I take

157
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:39,340
that SAS so what do you do when you find

158
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:42,670
something like a USB Drive as an

159
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:44,950
attacker you can be very creative so you

160
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:48,310
can target different kinds of emotions

161
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:51,039
first thing would be you put a little

162
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:54,100
plushie a little teddy bear to the USB

163
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:57,730
Drive and a set of keys so people will

164
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:59,860
think that is the key chain of somebody

165
00:07:57,730 --> 00:08:01,990
who lost just his key stays home and

166
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:04,330
will try to return it how do you do that

167
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:06,490
you have a look at the USB drive to see

168
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:09,520
what's on it maybe there are photos

169
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:13,180
names something to help you to help the

170
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:15,669
person because I also think that humans

171
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:19,360
at the basic level will try to help each

172
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:23,650
other normally nobody is going to agree

173
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:26,430
on that and that's fine but it's okay or

174
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:31,450
you can target greed so label it

175
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:34,510
dispenses yeah that's so 2018 label it

176
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:38,559
no its 2017 actually I was going to say

177
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:40,689
label it Bitcoin wallet but I'm not

178
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:43,719
really sure whether a Bitcoin plays such

179
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:44,800
a big role but last year at that time if

180
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:47,710
you were playing with a Bitcoin wallet

181
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:49,959
somebody would plug it in and you know

182
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:52,360
without a show of hands just go inside

183
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:55,030
yourself and ask yourself a question if

184
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:57,250
I found a USB Drive that piques my

185
00:08:55,030 --> 00:09:00,819
interest would I plug it in Oh

186
00:08:57,250 --> 00:09:02,199
yeah of course but you in this room and

187
00:09:00,819 --> 00:09:04,599
others would do it in a very safe

188
00:09:02,199 --> 00:09:07,508
environment and our users probably

189
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:10,569
wouldn't do that so why not give them

190
00:09:07,509 --> 00:09:13,300
the safe environment this is something

191
00:09:10,569 --> 00:09:16,810
we built at our company so apologies

192
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:20,589
because it's German desktop it says

193
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:24,638
wires detention station more or less so

194
00:09:20,589 --> 00:09:26,740
we built this not to deter attackers but

195
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:30,279
this is a very positive and good side

196
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:33,279
effect the initial idea is a tale of

197
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:36,459
very unnecessary complicated processes

198
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:39,600
and I'm giving you insight into the pain

199
00:09:36,459 --> 00:09:41,859
of working for a really big company so

200
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:45,449
when you were preparing a presentation

201
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:48,579
on a USB Drive for example at home and

202
00:09:45,449 --> 00:09:51,459
you brought the drive with you to the

203
00:09:48,579 --> 00:09:53,680
office on the next day you couldn't plug

204
00:09:51,459 --> 00:09:56,979
it in because it's forbidden to plug in

205
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:59,229
USB drives to your PC which is sensible

206
00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:01,029
which is good so you put it in an

207
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:04,059
envelope you handed it over to the

208
00:10:01,029 --> 00:10:06,430
secretary she handed it over or he threw

209
00:10:04,059 --> 00:10:08,980
the internal postal service's they would

210
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:11,229
drive it to a different building it

211
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:14,350
would be scanned some magic would happen

212
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:17,050
and the process would go vice versa

213
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:21,220
and the USB Drive would land safely on

214
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:23,800
your desk about for workplace later so

215
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:26,110
when we're talking for work days that is

216
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:28,660
not really a trial that is not really

217
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:31,449
something you want to deal with I mean

218
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:35,139
we are slow in our processes but this

219
00:10:31,449 --> 00:10:37,269
was ridiculous so police came up with

220
00:10:35,139 --> 00:10:40,720
the idea of that armoires detention

221
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:42,970
station where basically you plug in any

222
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:45,129
kind of USB Drive if you see then you

223
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:47,680
can list the contents and you can say

224
00:10:45,129 --> 00:10:50,379
this file and that file I'd like to have

225
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:53,859
in my inbox at work or a link to a

226
00:10:50,379 --> 00:10:56,170
network share basically and then it gets

227
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:58,319
transported by our sandbox is why our

228
00:10:56,170 --> 00:11:00,969
virus scanners and why different ways

229
00:10:58,319 --> 00:11:02,680
the magic that happened here basically

230
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:04,750
happens elsewhere without human

231
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:07,839
involvement and the time it takes you

232
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:10,840
from going upstairs from that wires

233
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:12,550
detention station to your workplace

234
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:15,820
you would already have the link so you

235
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:17,859
can just continue to work and we found

236
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:20,200
out hey that's cool because basically

237
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:22,510
now people can plug in any drive they

238
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:24,970
want even if they found it even if this

239
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:27,189
is a pen testers or an attackers attempt

240
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:30,850
to get into the network they could do

241
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:34,900
that so because we're a big company let

242
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:38,400
me tell you what our current processes

243
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:40,930
if somebody finds an unknown USB Drive

244
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:44,410
they are supposed to hand it over to

245
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:46,530
building security so what's your guess

246
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:53,140
what building security will do with that

247
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:54,760
looking no it's far more ridiculous they

248
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:58,510
are going to hand it over to the local

249
00:11:54,760 --> 00:12:00,130
lost and found which is about don't know

250
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:01,900
two or three miles away and nobody will

251
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:03,850
bother to go there and say you know I've

252
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:08,470
lost my USB Drive yeah what does it look

253
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:10,360
like blank so we are trying it

254
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:12,760
apparently we are trying to get that

255
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:14,470
process to work that they actually plug

256
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:19,120
it in into the virus detention station

257
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:23,260
so because it's it's perfectly safe the

258
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:25,810
next thing we are doing wrong since a

259
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:31,210
long time is the handling of phishing

260
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:33,339
emails I think so if I ask you which of

261
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:38,380
those links was malicious what's your

262
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:41,260
answer potentially all but basically

263
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:44,800
none because I forgot what the first one

264
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:46,300
is I just remembered it is safe so you

265
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:49,000
have to take my word on that and I know

266
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:52,060
that he won't do that that Amazon come

267
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:54,520
with a zero instead of a no is actually

268
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:57,969
redirecting Jamison and the last one is

269
00:12:54,520 --> 00:13:01,060
just the IP address of our website from

270
00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:03,280
our company so the point I'm trying to

271
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:06,699
make is even as researchers even as

272
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:08,980
people who know this their stuff it has

273
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:11,230
become terribly hard to say what is the

274
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:13,890
phishing link and what is not because if

275
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:17,110
you go to link shorteners like bitly or

276
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:19,540
others how can you actually tell without

277
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:23,050
clicking it where it we are redirects to

278
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:24,380
you basically can't so Brian and I came

279
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:27,010
up with something

280
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:29,930
we like to call indicators of I

281
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:31,340
apologize for the language but if you

282
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:37,069
know me and talk to me in person

283
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:39,080
I'm very mild on this presentation so

284
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:43,960
one of the indicators of and

285
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:46,670
this is meant to be for our employees

286
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:49,100
when you get an email you don't look at

287
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:51,979
the headers you don't try to force them

288
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:54,200
to read in May and headers because yeah

289
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:55,970
that could help you understand whether

290
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:58,070
it's a fish or not but it's a skill they

291
00:13:55,970 --> 00:14:01,250
don't want to have and they don't want

292
00:13:58,070 --> 00:14:04,280
to learn so why force them to but as

293
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:06,710
soon as there's money involved anywhere

294
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:09,020
in that email that is one indicator of

295
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:11,720
 and why is that so because at

296
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:14,480
the end of the day all the bad guys want

297
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:16,820
money in one form or the other maybe

298
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:19,750
they want your data that's different

299
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:24,050
piece that very often money is involved

300
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:26,990
and the next indicator of course are

301
00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:29,329
threats very often combined with with

302
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:31,430
money they might be subtle because it

303
00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:33,440
might be something like yeah you know we

304
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:37,160
found out you were streaming this and

305
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:41,060
that video which is illegal but we are

306
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:44,839
going for a settlement of just 150 euros

307
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:48,020
or pounds sterling or Thomas whatever if

308
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:49,760
you just pay now else we have to go to

309
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:53,420
the court and it will potentially cost

310
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:55,700
you two thousand years or well that's

311
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:57,650
very subtle but it is a threat and if

312
00:14:55,700 --> 00:15:00,740
you reflect on the regular business

313
00:14:57,650 --> 00:15:03,530
emails you get threats are very rarely

314
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:06,950
involved and if they are then you know

315
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:11,170
why so this comes when this comes out of

316
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:14,960
the blue this is an indicator and

317
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:20,510
another thing and I use the word very

318
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:22,730
loosely Romans assuming you get an email

319
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:25,939
out of the blue from a nice Russian lady

320
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:27,740
with pictures attached that she really

321
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:30,430
is she found your profile online which

322
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:35,060
one I've got thousands of sock puppets

323
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:37,160
should be specific and if you get that

324
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:37,959
email you also know you know in a

325
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:41,030
business

326
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:44,690
that's probably not really something

327
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:47,959
that's going to be real even if I wanted

328
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:50,810
to maybe but it's not and I forgot to

329
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:54,350
say something in the beginning when we

330
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:56,689
talk to our users and kalise very often

331
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:58,820
we give them tips and hints for their

332
00:15:56,690 --> 00:16:00,860
private cybersecurity it's not really

333
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:03,200
business-related it's just you know if

334
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:04,610
you get spam or phishing emails at home

335
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:06,590
they look the same

336
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:08,290
and probably you get more at home

337
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:11,300
because we're filtering stuff in

338
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:14,380
corporate email already and if you know

339
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:16,400
how to how to differentiate them from

340
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:19,100
regular emails from emails you are

341
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:20,780
expecting then you have that skill and

342
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:24,470
you will use that skill at work as well

343
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:27,589
and people tend to listen a lot lot

344
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:30,860
closer if they think they are personally

345
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:34,310
affected they have more interest so it's

346
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:38,450
more likely you get a romance email at

347
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:42,160
home and finally the fourth and last

348
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:46,310
indicator is always some kind of urgency

349
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:48,439
because the way our brains work is they

350
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:51,760
shut down a little bit if you put

351
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:55,040
pressure on them if you ask somebody

352
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:56,630
what is your favorite color then they

353
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:58,610
will think about that and they will give

354
00:16:56,630 --> 00:17:00,439
you an answer eventually but if you say

355
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:02,150
something like what is your favorite

356
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:03,650
color you've got three seconds three two

357
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:06,349
one

358
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:07,940
brain just shuts down and if you need to

359
00:17:06,349 --> 00:17:09,530
say something you will yell something

360
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:12,980
because it doesn't matter in the end and

361
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:14,960
again with the urgency if you tie it in

362
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:16,880
with the threats and the money if you

363
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:20,569
say you know if you don't pay chess now

364
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:24,950
if you pay any later than in 24 hours

365
00:17:20,569 --> 00:17:28,879
it's going to be $2,000 yours but you

366
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:31,460
get pictures and if you have one two or

367
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:33,740
three of those indicators of in

368
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:36,050
an email just throw it away

369
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:40,870
and throwing away part is also very

370
00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:44,720
interesting I still have not found to

371
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:46,729
have not managed to find a psychological

372
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:50,410
study on this I believe this to be true

373
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:51,730
and all the people I'd talk to about

374
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:54,460
believe that should be true but I have

375
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:57,400
no scientific foundation for that just

376
00:17:54,460 --> 00:18:00,580
now but we trained our users to click

377
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:02,020
things basically the world wide web is a

378
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:03,760
collection of things that you can't

379
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:07,000
click they lead you to other things that

380
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:10,840
you can click a bit of info here there

381
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:13,360
and in an email for the internal to-do

382
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:15,730
list for most likely OCD in our minds

383
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:18,429
you want to do something with the email

384
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:20,380
you if some email comes in

385
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:22,690
even with those indicators of

386
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:25,480
and wants you to force to click

387
00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:27,850
something you have a slight craving to

388
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:30,490
click something so just add a button

389
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:33,159
that you can click with every email in

390
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:35,230
the business context that forwards the

391
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:37,030
suspicious email to your sock team or

392
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:38,950
the relevance of your G team that's

393
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:41,500
going to deal with it you will satisfy

394
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:44,110
the craving for the user because he or

395
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:47,590
she has clicked something and has dealt

396
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:49,929
with the email can take an internal box

397
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:50,470
that email has been dealt with one way

398
00:18:49,930 --> 00:18:54,280
or the other

399
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:56,500
and of course basically if you're

400
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:58,389
working in that security team that gets

401
00:18:56,500 --> 00:19:00,880
all the fishing in spam emails your

402
00:18:58,390 --> 00:19:03,730
first reaction might be what do I do

403
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:06,730
with them we found because we have

404
00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:10,420
something similar to that that is

405
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:13,630
massively helpful all the newest scam

406
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:16,000
outbreaks new IP addresses new email

407
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:17,620
addresses they are getting forwarded to

408
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,470
the team that can actually implement

409
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:22,899
them into a black mist scam block them

410
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:25,620
and connect upon them although they have

411
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:28,420
to look at spam and phishing emails

412
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:30,760
unfortunate but part of the job and it

413
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:32,560
gives it a lot of helpful insights and I

414
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:34,360
don't think I'm completely alone with

415
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:36,220
that because most of the companies

416
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:38,560
running awareness trainings with

417
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:41,260
phishing links and so on they offer that

418
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:50,409
button as well to mark that as as a fish

419
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:51,940
or scam or whatever next thing I would

420
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:55,570
like to talk about is the reverse social

421
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:59,500
engineer and again this is something I

422
00:19:55,570 --> 00:20:02,620
really like this is a story a lot have

423
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:03,210
you heard about the CEO thought which is

424
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:06,600
no

425
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:10,110
technicals can but it's something where

426
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:11,789
companies lose a lot of money if you

427
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:14,428
haven't heard about that it basically

428
00:20:11,789 --> 00:20:18,390
works like that an employee in the

429
00:20:14,429 --> 00:20:21,779
company higher up or at least someone

430
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:24,320
who is able to make huge payments gets

431
00:20:21,779 --> 00:20:28,200
an email supposedly from the CEO that

432
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:30,570
email says hello your boss said you are

433
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:33,500
the most trustworthy employee I'm in

434
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:36,689
country X we want to buy a company set

435
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:37,409
can we make a transfer of five hundred

436
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:43,140
thousand years

437
00:20:37,409 --> 00:20:44,789
pound sterling today if we can then my

438
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:47,220
lawyer will contact you with all the

439
00:20:44,789 --> 00:20:49,260
contact details it's a little bit more

440
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:53,960
complicated than that but on the other

441
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:56,970
hand it works so you get the pressure of

442
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:58,409
hierarchy you target somebody in the

443
00:20:56,970 --> 00:21:02,700
hierarchy who can make those payments

444
00:20:58,409 --> 00:21:05,070
but it's probably not authorized to but

445
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:08,549
technically able and then you get them

446
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:10,470
to transfer the money and you know you

447
00:21:08,549 --> 00:21:12,330
might think that's pretty stupid who's

448
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:14,580
going to fall for that and I can tell

449
00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:18,029
you for example Google Facebook together

450
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:19,439
for 100 million dollars a company in

451
00:21:18,029 --> 00:21:22,140
Nuremberg where I live

452
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:25,950
fell for it for 40 million dollars so

453
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:27,990
this really works and there's no tech

454
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:30,149
involved so while I'm talking about that

455
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:32,279
here because another company in

456
00:21:30,149 --> 00:21:36,870
Nuremberg had a very bright idea and I

457
00:21:32,279 --> 00:21:41,100
love that so it is important to talk to

458
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:43,559
the employees though so the CEO said you

459
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:46,020
know you will never ever get an email

460
00:21:43,559 --> 00:21:49,559
from me asking for that kind of money

461
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:51,809
transactions if you do you take the

462
00:21:49,559 --> 00:21:54,090
email you forward it to your secure

463
00:21:51,809 --> 00:21:56,850
operation center and what they do in

464
00:21:54,090 --> 00:22:00,840
return they slightly all the water the

465
00:21:56,850 --> 00:22:02,428
email address so they get the new emails

466
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:06,928
that the scammer is sending them and

467
00:22:02,429 --> 00:22:09,149
they reply with oh hello CEO I'm sorry

468
00:22:06,929 --> 00:22:11,940
but you probably forgot we have that new

469
00:22:09,149 --> 00:22:13,799
fabulous payment portal where you can do

470
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:16,260
all the transactions yourself because

471
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:16,980
I'm really technically I'm not allowed

472
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:18,570
to

473
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:21,990
but you can do it have you lost your

474
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:24,419
login so as a scammer you go

475
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:26,430
that's no it's good yeah I've lost my

476
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:28,620
login and you get login credentials and

477
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:30,660
you get redirected to a payment portal

478
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:34,199
on the website of that company that

479
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:37,020
looks legit and it kind of is so you

480
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:39,750
fill in like half a million million

481
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:42,480
let's go for to millions and most

482
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:45,870
importantly you fill out the field of

483
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:48,720
the iben which is the account where the

484
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:50,669
money should be transferred to and what

485
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,290
happens of course you don't get any

486
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:55,410
money that would be stupid

487
00:22:52,290 --> 00:22:59,580
of course this Ivan gets on a blacklist

488
00:22:55,410 --> 00:23:02,010
it gets not only blocked in that company

489
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:04,470
but the bank that has that Ivan gets

490
00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:07,920
notified that this is the account of a

491
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:10,680
scammer the account gets deleted or put

492
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:12,720
on ice or things like that and this

493
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:15,240
camera loses access to that account and

494
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:17,970
that is much more hurtful than losing

495
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:20,310
access to an email address or a server

496
00:23:17,970 --> 00:23:23,330
or whatever because getting a new bank

497
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:26,300
account up and running is more work and

498
00:23:23,330 --> 00:23:29,460
it's much more difficult if you have

499
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:31,889
illegal intentions and I like that

500
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:33,930
because it's just really using social

501
00:23:31,890 --> 00:23:37,670
engineering techniques in order to fool

502
00:23:33,930 --> 00:23:40,620
those who are going to attack you and

503
00:23:37,670 --> 00:23:44,070
I'm briefly talking about passwords

504
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:47,520
because they are important thing as well

505
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:50,340
at the company please and you know all

506
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:53,520
know that use strong passwords user

507
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:55,679
password safe and the reason why I'm

508
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:58,080
saying that is there are still companies

509
00:23:55,680 --> 00:24:01,050
who don't allow password safes because

510
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:04,980
they can't yeah can't be bothered to buy

511
00:24:01,050 --> 00:24:07,470
them or support them or whatever but the

512
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:10,290
possible to the left except that it is

513
00:24:07,470 --> 00:24:13,050
on a slide in a talk at a security

514
00:24:10,290 --> 00:24:16,020
conference but it is much better

515
00:24:13,050 --> 00:24:18,000
password than password one and I hope

516
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:20,160
you agree to that but this is nothing I

517
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,500
would want to type so I want to 1/2 a

518
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:23,970
password manager that actually remembers

519
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:29,370
the password and types it in for me

520
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:30,720
because I can't be bothered but as a as

521
00:24:29,370 --> 00:24:33,899
a shot

522
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:36,119
as a short sight note basically you've

523
00:24:33,899 --> 00:24:40,199
maybe heard about collection one which

524
00:24:36,119 --> 00:24:43,559
was in the news last week where Troy

525
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:46,649
hunt said 778 million user accounts with

526
00:24:43,559 --> 00:24:49,859
passwords have been found which is nice

527
00:24:46,649 --> 00:24:51,748
and I'm not trying to incite fear or

528
00:24:49,859 --> 00:24:54,228
anything but collection one is the first

529
00:24:51,749 --> 00:24:57,929
one in the collections that we found and

530
00:24:54,229 --> 00:24:59,759
it's one of the smaller ones and all in

531
00:24:57,929 --> 00:25:02,460
all it's way more than seven hundred

532
00:24:59,759 --> 00:25:06,479
seventy eight billion a million all in

533
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:08,460
all without checking whether it makes

534
00:25:06,479 --> 00:25:12,029
sense or not it was something like 30

535
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:14,309
million passwords and the trouble with

536
00:25:12,029 --> 00:25:16,409
that is your new password that you're

537
00:25:14,309 --> 00:25:19,499
thinking of competes with all the

538
00:25:16,409 --> 00:25:21,450
passwords that are known not your

539
00:25:19,499 --> 00:25:23,940
passwords but somebody somebody else

540
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:26,059
came up with because the hash is known

541
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:28,349
if the hash is in salted you can just

542
00:25:26,059 --> 00:25:29,700
check it up in a database and even if

543
00:25:28,349 --> 00:25:31,439
it's a good password if somebody else

544
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:34,200
used it then basically you're screwed

545
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:36,840
and that's again something you should

546
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:41,759
use a password manager and complex long

547
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:44,399
passwords in the company now if you have

548
00:25:41,759 --> 00:25:46,619
tar and feathers then I totally expect

549
00:25:44,399 --> 00:25:50,789
some of you to use them on me after that

550
00:25:46,619 --> 00:25:54,869
but in your family with your granddad

551
00:25:50,789 --> 00:25:57,809
with your mother elderly people friends

552
00:25:54,869 --> 00:26:00,869
who are not as internet savvy as you how

553
00:25:57,809 --> 00:26:02,729
to do you passwords sure

554
00:26:00,869 --> 00:26:07,769
still strong passwords possible safes

555
00:26:02,729 --> 00:26:11,599
are great still but my point is let them

556
00:26:07,769 --> 00:26:14,519
write them down in a notebook because

557
00:26:11,599 --> 00:26:17,489
this is not an advice for your workplace

558
00:26:14,519 --> 00:26:19,229
it is a bad shitty arise for a workplace

559
00:26:17,489 --> 00:26:21,899
that's why I want to make it clear that

560
00:26:19,229 --> 00:26:24,720
is for private house if you write down

561
00:26:21,899 --> 00:26:28,649
passwords they tend to be better than

562
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:30,629
password 1 or Apple 1 2 3 or 1 2 3 4 or

563
00:26:28,649 --> 00:26:34,619
if you really want to be very secure 1 2

564
00:26:30,629 --> 00:26:36,418
3 4 5 if you let them write down

565
00:26:34,619 --> 00:26:37,918
passwords you get the chance that they

566
00:26:36,419 --> 00:26:42,179
use a different password for different

567
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:44,370
websites and that it is good and let's

568
00:26:42,179 --> 00:26:47,130
think about that if there's a person

569
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:49,350
standing next to your granny's computer

570
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:51,630
having her password book in hand they

571
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:54,659
are not after the passwords they broke

572
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:56,220
in to steal valuables they are not

573
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:58,880
really interested in them in the

574
00:26:56,220 --> 00:27:02,390
Facebook password of those friends and

575
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:04,980
even if there was a break-in and

576
00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:06,630
somebody stole the password account then

577
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:08,880
you can start replacing all the

578
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:10,620
passwords of course and work that's a

579
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:12,360
different kind of story because many

580
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:15,409
people will pass by your desk and you

581
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:19,439
can't do that but for private reasons

582
00:27:15,410 --> 00:27:21,030
many people in the industry bash stuff

583
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:24,240
like that and I think you know you have

584
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:26,250
to take a step in the direction of where

585
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:29,160
your users are or where those people are

586
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:31,500
in order to get a result otherwise they

587
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:33,120
will use pass with one everywhere where

588
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:37,230
they can because they can't write it

589
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:38,850
down and they have to remember it and if

590
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:40,830
you can get them to get two factor

591
00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:42,659
authentication that's great this by the

592
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:44,580
way is a fully functioning mobile phone

593
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:47,640
you can use that for two-factor

594
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:52,970
authentication this I've been told is

595
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:56,250
very popular in prisons I wonder why and

596
00:27:52,970 --> 00:27:59,760
at the end I'm I can't believe that I'm

597
00:27:56,250 --> 00:28:01,860
using that person as a SNe sample but if

598
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:06,830
you think your granny's security is not

599
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:09,719
good enough then just think about that

600
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:14,370
and he's the presser is he still

601
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:17,130
president I think I think so right

602
00:28:14,370 --> 00:28:18,629
one other thing we are working on but I

603
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:20,730
haven't seen that in the wild yet

604
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:23,059
because there are legal reasons why this

605
00:28:20,730 --> 00:28:26,760
could be problematic

606
00:28:23,059 --> 00:28:30,300
Smail forward as a service so we

607
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:32,580
identified or we say that for private

608
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:34,379
people their email address they very

609
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:38,340
often just have one email address and

610
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:40,350
that is the most valuable digital asset

611
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:42,720
because if you have access to the email

612
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:45,510
account you can reset all the other

613
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:49,679
counts on any platform whatsoever you

614
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:52,800
get the reset notifications and then you

615
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:54,810
can just log in so if you have someone's

616
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:56,889
email account then it's pretty much game

617
00:28:54,810 --> 00:29:02,350
over for the person if they only have

618
00:28:56,890 --> 00:29:05,110
in private so the idea was to register a

619
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:06,639
domain as the company it doesn't have to

620
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:08,979
do something that doesn't heat you have

621
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:11,710
to do something with extra company name

622
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:15,630
just any domain and use it as a mail

623
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:19,390
forward so your user a at my home email

624
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:22,840
comm would have a ad the company's

625
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:25,929
domain comm or email me the questions

626
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:27,760
why it's very easy if you register with

627
00:29:25,929 --> 00:29:30,100
that email address at different portals

628
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:31,960
and this portal gets breached then they

629
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:34,840
only have before water email address and

630
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:37,900
this is of no use of somebody who wants

631
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:40,959
to reset other platforms so it might be

632
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:43,240
another level of security but if you

633
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:44,799
have a bright idea about that just let

634
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:46,600
me know because the problems we have at

635
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:49,270
the moment is we are in discussion with

636
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:51,399
what happens when that person leaves the

637
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:53,080
company will they still get access to

638
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:56,200
that email address will it still be

639
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:59,559
forwarded and the administrative

640
00:29:56,200 --> 00:30:03,309
overhead to that is not even funny for a

641
00:29:59,559 --> 00:30:08,559
channel so yeah so we haven't done that

642
00:30:03,309 --> 00:30:11,649
yet and one thing so we in her keynote

643
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:14,168
was also talking about and I'm again I'm

644
00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:16,090
very happy I she had a few points that

645
00:30:14,169 --> 00:30:17,980
I'm going to make as well but I didn't

646
00:30:16,090 --> 00:30:21,220
rewrite the slides just in the last 10

647
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:25,929
minutes is making awareness training

648
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:28,570
interesting I hope that none of you have

649
00:30:25,929 --> 00:30:31,780
to sit through shaky awareness trainings

650
00:30:28,570 --> 00:30:34,178
at work I'm pretty sure a lot of you

651
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:39,690
have to sit through shitty awareness

652
00:30:34,179 --> 00:30:42,760
trainings at work but the thing is we I

653
00:30:39,690 --> 00:30:45,250
just think that we do but most of us

654
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:48,429
like security else we wouldn't be here

655
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:51,940
at besides I guess and even we find

656
00:30:48,429 --> 00:30:53,980
security trainings exhausting sometimes

657
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:56,980
especially when they are done wrong and

658
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:58,540
believe me you've got nothing on wrong

659
00:30:56,980 --> 00:31:01,960
security awareness trainings when it

660
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:04,178
comes to some stuff my company does as I

661
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:06,520
said we are changing that because it's

662
00:31:04,179 --> 00:31:09,790
really not working but it's a different

663
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:12,790
department so I can bash them

664
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:15,550
first thing of course is avoiding fear

665
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:17,590
uncertainty and doubt s whether with a

666
00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:20,700
collection one and everything this is

667
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:24,010
something that can easily lead to fear

668
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:27,040
but on the other hand sometimes some

669
00:31:24,010 --> 00:31:29,350
people need to have the facts and it's

670
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:31,510
the way they are presented whether you

671
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:33,429
can actually create the facts and create

672
00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:36,040
the understanding of the danger that is

673
00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:38,620
out there without actually saying we are

674
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:43,120
all doomed use password1 because doesn't

675
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:45,909
matter anyway uncertainty and doubt much

676
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:48,070
of the same if you can try to avoid that

677
00:31:45,910 --> 00:31:50,230
then people get a ration get to make a

678
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:53,080
rational decision about what they are

679
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:55,810
doing and can have a look at it in a

680
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:57,340
very different way if you have a sat

681
00:31:55,810 --> 00:31:59,560
through a multiple choice click vest

682
00:31:57,340 --> 00:32:02,860
then you know that this isn't working

683
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:05,020
for security this is just there so that

684
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:07,149
one department can tick off a box

685
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:09,520
yes we do security awareness trainings

686
00:32:07,150 --> 00:32:13,960
for employees and I check the box and I

687
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:16,420
get the certification use is zero in my

688
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:18,340
opinion I can tell you that at our

689
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:21,970
company somebody had the idea of

690
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:24,280
gamification so you need to walk

691
00:32:21,970 --> 00:32:25,710
virtually through a virtual training

692
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:27,399
company it's not even ours and for

693
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:29,590
example if there's a fire extinguisher

694
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:31,900
you need to click it and they need to

695
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:37,060
answer questions about it somebody

696
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:38,470
thought that would be fun it's not it

697
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:42,690
doesn't change we have to do that every

698
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:46,420
year so it's every year the same stuff

699
00:32:42,690 --> 00:32:49,780
but we found a shortcut or no we didn't

700
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:51,190
find it people were yelling so loud for

701
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:52,600
a shortcut that they wouldn't have to

702
00:32:51,190 --> 00:32:54,670
walk the corridors of the virtual

703
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:56,409
training company because that sucks they

704
00:32:54,670 --> 00:32:58,000
just wanted to have the questions and

705
00:32:56,410 --> 00:33:00,280
the answers but still you can't get

706
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,590
there without reading through all the

707
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:05,980
text that is attached to the various

708
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:08,379
stations and you could do that training

709
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:10,330
in a short amount of time but since you

710
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:13,300
need to read all that and click yes I

711
00:33:10,330 --> 00:33:18,159
read that yes I read that you it takes

712
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:20,050
time and usually nobody likes it so we

713
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:22,690
started to have different kind of

714
00:33:20,050 --> 00:33:23,700
engagements with the users and those are

715
00:33:22,690 --> 00:33:27,340
very open

716
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:29,020
meaning you're free to attend if you

717
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:32,080
want to attend and very often it's it's

718
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:33,400
an open space so maybe I would talk

719
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:35,110
about something that happened in

720
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:38,590
security in the last few weeks and

721
00:33:35,110 --> 00:33:41,260
people could come and go as they pleased

722
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:44,770
because it's it doesn't have a door it's

723
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:46,420
in an open office and so if you went

724
00:33:44,770 --> 00:33:49,960
there and listened to me and you found

725
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:52,840
out that I'm really boring that unlike

726
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:55,450
here where you are sitting down and it's

727
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:57,429
it's awkward to leave in that situation

728
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:58,810
so you just can leave and we are

729
00:33:57,430 --> 00:34:00,670
engaging with the public as well the

730
00:33:58,810 --> 00:34:03,820
left is a picture where we opened the

731
00:34:00,670 --> 00:34:07,120
doors we have the thing it's called long

732
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:09,069
night of the sciences in Nuremberg every

733
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:10,870
two years where lots of big companies

734
00:34:09,070 --> 00:34:13,149
open the doors and show what they're

735
00:34:10,870 --> 00:34:15,520
doing to the public and that's where we

736
00:34:13,149 --> 00:34:17,799
try to get people to understand what

737
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:20,259
we're doing security wise and I never

738
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:22,379
thought that I never thought about the

739
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:25,540
effect that has but we are getting

740
00:34:22,379 --> 00:34:27,699
apprentice in September who said that

741
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:29,409
specifically she went to our company

742
00:34:27,699 --> 00:34:32,589
because she liked what we were doing

743
00:34:29,409 --> 00:34:37,179
there so it helps overall that is my

744
00:34:32,590 --> 00:34:39,280
point and use different channels I'm

745
00:34:37,179 --> 00:34:41,500
writing blog articles we're doing this

746
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:45,879
open space that we're doing after our

747
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:48,850
stuff so if you can offer security

748
00:34:45,879 --> 00:34:50,290
training in various formats then

749
00:34:48,850 --> 00:34:52,149
somebody will like one format better

750
00:34:50,290 --> 00:34:55,120
than the other and you get more people

751
00:34:52,149 --> 00:34:58,210
to engage with you and for the love of

752
00:34:55,120 --> 00:35:00,490
everything if you do stuff after hours

753
00:34:58,210 --> 00:35:03,910
be a decent human being and buy the

754
00:35:00,490 --> 00:35:08,439
drinks because otherwise you will be

755
00:35:03,910 --> 00:35:13,629
there alone and it's perfectly

756
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:16,030
understandable and stopping yourself is

757
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:20,290
something I think is very important as

758
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:22,660
well um what I mean by that sure you

759
00:35:20,290 --> 00:35:24,940
already pay money to get pen tested you

760
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:27,160
probably have red team engagements every

761
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:30,220
now and then but on the other hand

762
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:34,509
sometimes depending on the scope it

763
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:36,540
might not really work that well and on

764
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:38,610
another note very often you chest

765
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:41,250
at the network side of face you are not

766
00:35:38,610 --> 00:35:46,080
looking at the social media side of

767
00:35:41,250 --> 00:35:48,990
things so you should have a keen eye on

768
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:51,630
social media as well you should

769
00:35:48,990 --> 00:35:53,220
hopefully try to monitor what is being

770
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:56,100
said about your company in social media

771
00:35:53,220 --> 00:36:00,509
or have a team but you should also

772
00:35:56,100 --> 00:36:04,080
monitor sites like LinkedIn for example

773
00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:06,030
and the these are a lot of examples from

774
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:07,529
the company where I work from because

775
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:11,160
I'm giving you these examples because

776
00:36:07,530 --> 00:36:14,040
they work or I think they work we had

777
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:16,920
one person on LinkedIn are claiming to

778
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:19,380
be from our company and sending a lot of

779
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:21,810
connecting requests to other people in

780
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:24,540
our company and since our people in the

781
00:36:21,810 --> 00:36:26,640
company are trained in security and are

782
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:29,430
interested in that they forwarded that

783
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:32,069
to us and said we find don't find that

784
00:36:29,430 --> 00:36:34,109
person in our internal directory are

785
00:36:32,070 --> 00:36:36,210
they for real and we found out no they

786
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:38,370
are not they are probably not preparing

787
00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:40,560
an attack on our company but on one of

788
00:36:38,370 --> 00:36:43,410
our customers and would like to pose as

789
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:45,900
somebody from our company so we got that

790
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:48,149
account shut down rather quickly and you

791
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:52,130
can only do that if your people are

792
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:55,500
going to give you the info you know and

793
00:36:52,130 --> 00:36:57,930
that ties in with cyber risk management

794
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:59,760
as a whole if you are interested in that

795
00:36:57,930 --> 00:37:02,879
it's not going to be a presentation

796
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:06,590
about the other company I'm I'm working

797
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:09,270
with but cyber risk is basically not

798
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:12,210
threats because threats are too

799
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:12,600
immediate and they might be it could be

800
00:37:12,210 --> 00:37:15,150
too late

801
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:17,549
cyber risk is stuff like the social

802
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:20,880
media and see what reached accounts you

803
00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:25,440
have and to prepare accordingly if there

804
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:27,810
is something coming up from there so

805
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:30,210
finding the right language again

806
00:37:27,810 --> 00:37:33,420
something so it was talking about it I'm

807
00:37:30,210 --> 00:37:35,670
so really sorry if this is not that new

808
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:38,150
if you listen to an hour ago but it's

809
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:41,670
got a new perspective I'm not as well

810
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:45,270
talking to people always works best if

811
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:50,160
you talk from eye to eye and I mean that

812
00:37:45,270 --> 00:37:52,710
in in a way that is not Condor

813
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:54,450
that you let the other person stand as

814
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:56,609
they are even if you don't agree with

815
00:37:54,450 --> 00:38:00,058
them but you just respect them as a

816
00:37:56,609 --> 00:38:02,519
human and you just talk to them and you

817
00:38:00,059 --> 00:38:04,769
express you think and they express what

818
00:38:02,519 --> 00:38:07,109
they think and you don't talk down to

819
00:38:04,769 --> 00:38:10,049
them so you don't try to be better than

820
00:38:07,109 --> 00:38:12,660
them or insult them you might do that

821
00:38:10,049 --> 00:38:15,329
but with friends but if you really want

822
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:18,240
to get your point across you need to be

823
00:38:15,329 --> 00:38:20,549
taken seriously and nobody well not

824
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:22,979
nobody but most people won't take people

825
00:38:20,549 --> 00:38:25,319
seriously when they are just saying you

826
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:27,779
have to do that and you have to be there

827
00:38:25,319 --> 00:38:29,670
at seven and so on and so forth because

828
00:38:27,779 --> 00:38:32,970
human beings and hackers especially if

829
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:36,420
you tell them you have to be X then what

830
00:38:32,970 --> 00:38:38,368
are they going to do not be X finding

831
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:41,339
the right language this is a tweet from

832
00:38:38,369 --> 00:38:44,369
last year from Def Con I kind of blurred

833
00:38:41,339 --> 00:38:46,828
it out because I don't know whether they

834
00:38:44,369 --> 00:38:49,980
are that happy yeah I mean it's still

835
00:38:46,829 --> 00:38:52,319
online but I still blurt it out so there

836
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:53,789
was a person during Def Con saying if

837
00:38:52,319 --> 00:38:55,890
they have the time but shouldn't motive

838
00:38:53,789 --> 00:38:57,720
to launch really good at X in Vegas they

839
00:38:55,890 --> 00:38:59,788
would attack wouldn't attack random deaf

840
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:01,980
converts because they are powerless and

841
00:38:59,789 --> 00:39:03,960
broke anyway they would go for a black

842
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:06,809
hat at least because they have money and

843
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:10,140
power what happened this person got

844
00:39:06,809 --> 00:39:12,779
evicted from hotel security they later

845
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:14,549
got back because Def Con organizers

846
00:39:12,779 --> 00:39:17,309
worked hard with hotel security to say

847
00:39:14,549 --> 00:39:20,038
you know this guy was not talking about

848
00:39:17,309 --> 00:39:22,740
buying an assault rifle and killing

849
00:39:20,039 --> 00:39:26,910
people like what happened in Vegas just

850
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:28,979
a few months before but yeah Vegas was

851
00:39:26,910 --> 00:39:31,799
on edge and if you write something like

852
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:34,710
that and someone reads this without

853
00:39:31,799 --> 00:39:36,990
knowing its cybersecurity and not a

854
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:41,759
regular attack then they might get

855
00:39:36,990 --> 00:39:42,328
nervous so yeah avoid talking from the

856
00:39:41,759 --> 00:39:45,569
top down

857
00:39:42,329 --> 00:39:48,180
and this is another tweet from I think

858
00:39:45,569 --> 00:39:50,519
last week with Videoland

859
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:54,089
I think it's still up but I blurred out

860
00:39:50,519 --> 00:39:57,930
Scott helm as well and they were going

861
00:39:54,089 --> 00:40:00,328
on about how they perceive the security

862
00:39:57,930 --> 00:40:02,848
industry and that they really don't like

863
00:40:00,329 --> 00:40:03,680
them and Scott asked well come on we're

864
00:40:02,849 --> 00:40:07,309
not that bad

865
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:10,279
we fan they answered with that yes you

866
00:40:07,309 --> 00:40:11,869
are a world very bad and I think that is

867
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:14,359
one of the problems that when we engage

868
00:40:11,869 --> 00:40:16,520
with others we don't take their problem

869
00:40:14,359 --> 00:40:19,040
seriously we try to for security upon

870
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:20,839
them without thinking whether this is

871
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:23,180
something they want because security is

872
00:40:20,839 --> 00:40:26,540
so important to us we need to find a way

873
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:29,180
to better deal with people and if that

874
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:31,880
means learning their language and going

875
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:34,339
half way to where they are then I think

876
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:36,440
that's the case nobody who is not

877
00:40:34,339 --> 00:40:38,210
totally deeply interest security will

878
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:40,190
come to where we are because all of us

879
00:40:38,210 --> 00:40:45,520
are already here if that makes sense

880
00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:51,740
and then there's ritual for actions sake

881
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:55,059
so I thought about an example that will

882
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:57,169
illustrate that I think if you think

883
00:40:55,059 --> 00:40:58,910
about that you will come up with

884
00:40:57,170 --> 00:41:01,849
examples in your company where

885
00:40:58,910 --> 00:41:04,009
somebody's following following some kind

886
00:41:01,849 --> 00:41:06,650
of procedure not necessarily security

887
00:41:04,010 --> 00:41:09,020
but some kind of process procedure that

888
00:41:06,650 --> 00:41:11,839
doesn't make sense at all even if you

889
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:14,390
look at the background maybe it had made

890
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:16,910
sense in the past but it didn't get

891
00:41:14,390 --> 00:41:20,990
abundant and so people are still doing

892
00:41:16,910 --> 00:41:26,569
it and I found that one from a few weeks

893
00:41:20,990 --> 00:41:28,819
ago and this is I think a brilliant

894
00:41:26,569 --> 00:41:31,400
example why you shouldn't follow what

895
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:33,650
their ritual which is for the sake of it

896
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:35,630
you know um it doesn't make sense and

897
00:41:33,650 --> 00:41:37,809
everybody sees it doesn't make sense but

898
00:41:35,630 --> 00:41:40,490
somebody said you know people have to

899
00:41:37,809 --> 00:41:42,740
check that box because when they buy the

900
00:41:40,490 --> 00:41:45,069
car online they check the box and we

901
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:51,410
have both processes should be the same

902
00:41:45,069 --> 00:41:52,910
just make sense another small thing is

903
00:41:51,410 --> 00:41:54,980
get people to lock their screens because

904
00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:57,799
apart from having the password next to

905
00:41:54,980 --> 00:42:00,020
it if you don't lock your screen it

906
00:41:57,799 --> 00:42:02,809
doesn't take long to take away your

907
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:04,640
computer if I'm an adversary and it

908
00:42:02,809 --> 00:42:06,920
doesn't mean I'm typing fast it just

909
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:09,440
means I've got to use be rubber ducky or

910
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:11,630
any other device that can put in

911
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:13,940
keystrokes at three thousand characters

912
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:17,390
per second and where can install the

913
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:19,040
backdoor within seconds so even if you

914
00:42:17,390 --> 00:42:21,950
going to the loo and you're alone in the

915
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:25,060
office or somewhere just try to lock

916
00:42:21,950 --> 00:42:27,560
your screen so how do we do it um

917
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:30,980
actually I'm not saying how we do it

918
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:33,470
because it's a little bit less good than

919
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:36,130
what I heard from a former colleague at

920
00:42:33,470 --> 00:42:40,120
a different company they have a macro

921
00:42:36,130 --> 00:42:42,110
and that macro actually it's just

922
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:43,850
executed very quickly in their Windows

923
00:42:42,110 --> 00:42:46,370
environment and it sends a mayor to

924
00:42:43,850 --> 00:42:48,230
their team that they are inviting them

925
00:42:46,370 --> 00:42:51,049
to have a cake the next day they are

926
00:42:48,230 --> 00:42:52,490
going to bring cake and this is the

927
00:42:51,050 --> 00:42:55,580
takeaway you know if you send a mail to

928
00:42:52,490 --> 00:42:58,520
your team from an unlocked screen I'm

929
00:42:55,580 --> 00:43:01,340
buying beer I'm buying a cake something

930
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:02,810
like that something small then if you

931
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:05,030
are the affected party that didn't lock

932
00:43:02,810 --> 00:43:08,540
the screen usually you go along with it

933
00:43:05,030 --> 00:43:11,780
if you say you know if you say another

934
00:43:08,540 --> 00:43:15,620
major of the CEO like haha you've got a

935
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:17,290
hairy ass that might not be the way to

936
00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:20,240
do it

937
00:43:17,290 --> 00:43:22,220
but if you do it in a small small way

938
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:24,350
like buying cake or something people go

939
00:43:22,220 --> 00:43:26,480
along with it but it is hurtful enough

940
00:43:24,350 --> 00:43:30,799
that next time they will lock their

941
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:34,220
screens I mean usually or they buy cake

942
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:37,940
again I mean we shall see and the

943
00:43:34,220 --> 00:43:39,740
importance of that is really making the

944
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:42,230
message transparent if somebody asks why

945
00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:44,859
should i lock my screen we have that USB

946
00:43:42,230 --> 00:43:47,150
rubber ducky that will well it won't

947
00:43:44,860 --> 00:43:49,580
encrypt your files but it will encrypt

948
00:43:47,150 --> 00:43:52,250
some files that it created beforehand

949
00:43:49,580 --> 00:43:57,310
just to demonstrate what you could do

950
00:43:52,250 --> 00:44:00,410
with an unlocked PC within seconds and

951
00:43:57,310 --> 00:44:03,980
you should always make a point of

952
00:44:00,410 --> 00:44:05,960
educating each individual there are

953
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:10,130
companies who say yeah our secured

954
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:11,750
person in Team X that is her and it

955
00:44:10,130 --> 00:44:14,420
doesn't work like that because there's

956
00:44:11,750 --> 00:44:17,270
not one person doing security for all of

957
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:18,980
the people in the department everybody

958
00:44:17,270 --> 00:44:21,080
needs to have some kind of basic

959
00:44:18,980 --> 00:44:24,260
education about it and it doesn't mean

960
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:27,470
they need to be knee-deep in it but as

961
00:44:24,260 --> 00:44:30,050
you probably know cyber security has

962
00:44:27,470 --> 00:44:31,040
taken off and now as part of a business

963
00:44:30,050 --> 00:44:34,180
process it's

964
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:38,090
thing that has to happen it's crucial to

965
00:44:34,180 --> 00:44:40,399
the business and if security is bad and

966
00:44:38,090 --> 00:44:43,370
your company gets attacked and gets

967
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:47,750
taken down then you will lose revenue so

968
00:44:43,370 --> 00:44:49,850
since it's a it's a business process you

969
00:44:47,750 --> 00:44:51,830
really have the option to educate

970
00:44:49,850 --> 00:44:54,799
everybody and say you know apart from

971
00:44:51,830 --> 00:44:56,870
teaching you what we do generally as a

972
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:59,180
company we also need to teach you a

973
00:44:56,870 --> 00:45:01,549
little bit about security and if you do

974
00:44:59,180 --> 00:45:04,370
then hopefully you now have a few

975
00:45:01,550 --> 00:45:07,660
pointers how to do it in a better way

976
00:45:04,370 --> 00:45:11,540
than just a multiple-choice click test

977
00:45:07,660 --> 00:45:14,509
so that's 45 minutes I think I'm more or

978
00:45:11,540 --> 00:45:17,720
less I'm nearly at the end because as

979
00:45:14,510 --> 00:45:18,550
always I'm speaking way faster than when

980
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:21,730
I try that at home

981
00:45:18,550 --> 00:45:26,500
so never try it at home just go for it

982
00:45:21,730 --> 00:45:29,930
the conclusion to all that is again that

983
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:31,820
we need to get into dialogue I know that

984
00:45:29,930 --> 00:45:34,970
not everybody in the info security

985
00:45:31,820 --> 00:45:38,150
industry likes to talk to other people

986
00:45:34,970 --> 00:45:41,089
and that's fine you don't have to but

987
00:45:38,150 --> 00:45:43,610
find people who know security on the one

988
00:45:41,090 --> 00:45:45,350
hand and who also want to talk to people

989
00:45:43,610 --> 00:45:47,410
like the sea level on the other hand

990
00:45:45,350 --> 00:45:50,810
because the discussion that so we had

991
00:45:47,410 --> 00:45:52,520
how do I approach the sea level that is

992
00:45:50,810 --> 00:45:55,610
very interesting because they won't get

993
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:57,560
down to your technical level and be

994
00:45:55,610 --> 00:46:00,040
interested in what you do as she said

995
00:45:57,560 --> 00:46:02,840
they are going to ask are we secure and

996
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:08,690
picking up on that what so he said again

997
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:11,570
is most techies won't say yes we are but

998
00:46:08,690 --> 00:46:15,070
if you can say well we reasonably are

999
00:46:11,570 --> 00:46:17,330
but we have this risk and we think it's

1000
00:46:15,070 --> 00:46:19,310
well you just describe it in business

1001
00:46:17,330 --> 00:46:21,140
terms with probability or what you can

1002
00:46:19,310 --> 00:46:23,029
do against it then they can insure

1003
00:46:21,140 --> 00:46:25,009
against the risk and then you can say

1004
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:26,870
from an overall perspective not from a

1005
00:46:25,010 --> 00:46:28,840
technical perspective because we always

1006
00:46:26,870 --> 00:46:31,819
will have box and holes and everything

1007
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:34,490
but you can say yeah from a business

1008
00:46:31,820 --> 00:46:37,670
perspective we are as secure as we can

1009
00:46:34,490 --> 00:46:39,109
be at the moment we could be more secure

1010
00:46:37,670 --> 00:46:41,360
but then we would have to spend more

1011
00:46:39,110 --> 00:46:43,550
money for that and basically we would

1012
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:45,020
close the company you need to reach that

1013
00:46:43,550 --> 00:46:47,450
point and as a tech

1014
00:46:45,020 --> 00:46:49,040
and that is a hot pot you need to reach

1015
00:46:47,450 --> 00:46:52,910
the point within yourself where you can

1016
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:56,270
say yeah I think we're reasonably secure

1017
00:46:52,910 --> 00:47:01,460
because basically if you want to be 100%

1018
00:46:56,270 --> 00:47:03,470
secure then you need to write how to do

1019
00:47:01,460 --> 00:47:07,580
it because a lot of people would buy the

1020
00:47:03,470 --> 00:47:10,040
book most people in the industry will

1021
00:47:07,580 --> 00:47:13,100
tell you you can never be 100% secure

1022
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:14,720
and I've heard the funny well it's not

1023
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:17,390
really funny yeah but that's German

1024
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:19,310
humour for you the funny guy 10 years

1025
00:47:17,390 --> 00:47:20,930
ago who always said when somebody said

1026
00:47:19,310 --> 00:47:23,660
yeah we are we want to be 100 percent

1027
00:47:20,930 --> 00:47:25,569
secure and he said to the client ha ha

1028
00:47:23,660 --> 00:47:27,859
then we take your server dig a hole

1029
00:47:25,570 --> 00:47:29,450
think you sir put yourself in that hole

1030
00:47:27,860 --> 00:47:31,550
and filled out with cement then you are

1031
00:47:29,450 --> 00:47:35,330
secure it's exactly what the client

1032
00:47:31,550 --> 00:47:38,090
wants to hear I can tell you that and we

1033
00:47:35,330 --> 00:47:42,080
need to really get there with our

1034
00:47:38,090 --> 00:47:44,960
language and we need to find out what

1035
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:47,029
our users want and how to empower them

1036
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:50,570
to do that with the best security

1037
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:52,670
possible I don't think it will work when

1038
00:47:50,570 --> 00:47:55,580
we always say we want to be as secure as

1039
00:47:52,670 --> 00:47:58,040
possible and whatever you want to do has

1040
00:47:55,580 --> 00:48:04,420
to adapt to that we have also chaired up

1041
00:47:58,040 --> 00:48:07,400
to them and that is I think my point so

1042
00:48:04,420 --> 00:48:09,440
yeah key takeaways conclusion more or

1043
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:12,640
less the same I've put a few links in

1044
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:16,430
there for you but I'm also on Twitter

1045
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:18,710
info shortly if you have any further

1046
00:48:16,430 --> 00:48:20,480
questions and I'd like to talk to you if

1047
00:48:18,710 --> 00:48:22,670
you have any other ideas how to empower

1048
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:25,190
your users or if you're interested in

1049
00:48:22,670 --> 00:48:26,930
exchanging fraudulent eivin's we are

1050
00:48:25,190 --> 00:48:28,910
still trying to figure out without with

1051
00:48:26,930 --> 00:48:31,430
a reverse social engineering

1052
00:48:28,910 --> 00:48:34,609
we're still trying to figure out a legal

1053
00:48:31,430 --> 00:48:37,310
way where our data protection officer is

1054
00:48:34,609 --> 00:48:40,609
happy when we share fraudulent eivin's

1055
00:48:37,310 --> 00:48:43,430
with other people because you know the

1056
00:48:40,609 --> 00:48:45,680
bad guys can't break laws and they don't

1057
00:48:43,430 --> 00:48:48,859
care about data protection and they are

1058
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:51,710
so very very well-connected whereas the

1059
00:48:48,859 --> 00:48:54,920
good guys so people working legally have

1060
00:48:51,710 --> 00:48:57,200
the utmost trouble to actually share a

1061
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:57,720
fraudulent Aylin that just belongs to

1062
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:59,430
someone

1063
00:48:57,720 --> 00:49:01,200
a criminal but we can't give up the

1064
00:48:59,430 --> 00:49:05,520
island because we didn't ask the

1065
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:08,100
criminal if he's okay with that these

1066
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:09,960
are some funny things but again if you

1067
00:49:08,100 --> 00:49:14,759
want to have a conversation about that

1068
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:16,980
I'm going to be around the only thing I

1069
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:18,900
want to mention as well as the same

1070
00:49:16,980 --> 00:49:20,430
security podcast if you enjoyed what I'm

1071
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:23,100
talking about there's more on that

1072
00:49:20,430 --> 00:49:26,160
together with Mike Attica from active

1073
00:49:23,100 --> 00:49:28,230
net and thank you very much for

1074
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:29,790
listening I put that slide at the end

1075
00:49:28,230 --> 00:49:32,400
because if you made it through here then

1076
00:49:29,790 --> 00:49:35,610
you probably need to know who I am if

1077
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:38,190
you want to send me an email or a tweet

1078
00:49:35,610 --> 00:49:41,280
I'm my name is Stefan Hager I go by the

1079
00:49:38,190 --> 00:49:43,830
lady by the head of Kate I work for a

1080
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:47,850
company called dot F in Germany we are

1081
00:49:43,830 --> 00:49:49,680
doing software for tax accountants which

1082
00:49:47,850 --> 00:49:52,980
sounds like the most boring shop in the

1083
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:56,430
world you have to imagine that this

1084
00:49:52,980 --> 00:49:58,890
company has 7,000 employees and the 1

1085
00:49:56,430 --> 00:50:02,609
billion euro turnover per year because

1086
00:49:58,890 --> 00:50:05,759
yay Texas I mean Germany laughs taxes

1087
00:50:02,610 --> 00:50:09,240
and taxing they say that 80% of world

1088
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:11,820
litter on text is in German yay so

1089
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:14,990
that's what I do I'm with a team for

1090
00:50:11,820 --> 00:50:17,160
internet security and I'd like to thank

1091
00:50:14,990 --> 00:50:19,560
Brian fight for the original

1092
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:21,120
contributions and most of all you and

1093
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:21,750
mrs. Leeds for having me and you for

1094
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:24,500
listening to me

1095
00:50:21,750 --> 00:50:24,500
thank you very much

1096
00:50:25,110 --> 00:50:34,350
[Applause]

1097
00:50:30,830 --> 00:50:35,340
are there any questions I don't have

1098
00:50:34,350 --> 00:51:14,670
anything to give away

1099
00:50:35,340 --> 00:51:16,740
apart from my love so just to repeat you

1100
00:51:14,670 --> 00:51:19,500
can't we use the Ivan as a knife

1101
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:22,259
indicator of compromise and then shared

1102
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:25,520
with others we probably could but my

1103
00:51:22,260 --> 00:51:31,410
company is different from others so

1104
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:34,320
whenever 99 lawyers say this is not

1105
00:51:31,410 --> 00:51:37,529
something that needs to be protected our

1106
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:39,390
company says well we think it is so this

1107
00:51:37,530 --> 00:51:43,860
is for other companies it might be

1108
00:51:39,390 --> 00:51:47,460
easier than for us okay

1109
00:51:43,860 --> 00:51:47,970
thank you more questions oh yeah she

1110
00:51:47,460 --> 00:51:50,040
cried

1111
00:51:47,970 --> 00:51:53,549
two questions one of them is around the

1112
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:57,180
nation yet each attorney catharsis which

1113
00:51:53,550 --> 00:52:00,170
is ntsc like a little baby

1114
00:51:57,180 --> 00:52:02,040
obviously brand awareness of an

1115
00:52:00,170 --> 00:52:04,140
organization the party will compete in

1116
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:06,990
data into it you get a lot of protection

1117
00:52:04,140 --> 00:52:08,520
back from from them and making your

1118
00:52:06,990 --> 00:52:10,859
sharing so I'm just wondering whether

1119
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:12,420
from your perspective on the German

1120
00:52:10,860 --> 00:52:14,520
version of that will be a better way to

1121
00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:16,410
disseminate matrixyl is a very close

1122
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:18,240
group the people who receive Mountain

1123
00:52:16,410 --> 00:52:19,740
facial images whatever

1124
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:21,419
they're very close to the people who

1125
00:52:19,740 --> 00:52:24,930
then going to do something that's actual

1126
00:52:21,420 --> 00:52:26,580
intelligence and that's capable exactly

1127
00:52:24,930 --> 00:52:30,779
the second is it is the question village

1128
00:52:26,580 --> 00:52:33,450
about your age when to program the

1129
00:52:30,780 --> 00:52:35,940
reason why businesses take continuity

1130
00:52:33,450 --> 00:52:37,770
when to programs about ABCD these four

1131
00:52:35,940 --> 00:52:40,640
metrics because the bottom top of the

1132
00:52:37,770 --> 00:52:42,920
tree needs to say this year 200 people

1133
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:45,920
and we have now better than last night

1134
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:48,079
there may be lots more I think fluffier

1135
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:50,240
don't mean that despite the kind of

1136
00:52:48,079 --> 00:52:53,299
training modeling this is all what we

1137
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:55,339
need to kind of know how does the FAFSA

1138
00:52:53,299 --> 00:52:56,750
possibly go and now we're more see folks

1139
00:52:55,339 --> 00:53:02,569
have spent more money on this training

1140
00:52:56,750 --> 00:53:05,240
budget yeah to your first question I

1141
00:53:02,569 --> 00:53:07,160
think again it would be easier to share

1142
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:09,200
information but our company is different

1143
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:13,549
in that way because we do have miss

1144
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:17,029
sharing as well and that with a few

1145
00:53:13,549 --> 00:53:19,880
things like the Iban it is difficult and

1146
00:53:17,029 --> 00:53:22,309
the other thing is it's not our CEO he

1147
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:24,200
who's after that metrics it's the people

1148
00:53:22,309 --> 00:53:26,900
responsible for internal security who

1149
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:28,669
have no clue about security at all and I

1150
00:53:26,900 --> 00:53:31,700
hope I didn't say that while the magnet

1151
00:53:28,670 --> 00:53:34,730
was still open but who are challenged

1152
00:53:31,700 --> 00:53:39,759
with some aspects of security let me say

1153
00:53:34,730 --> 00:53:42,529
say like that but we are seeing that we

1154
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:44,059
still do both so it's the multiple

1155
00:53:42,529 --> 00:53:46,609
choice click fests and the virtual

1156
00:53:44,059 --> 00:53:49,549
training company which is mandatory and

1157
00:53:46,609 --> 00:53:51,710
our department does those other

1158
00:53:49,549 --> 00:53:55,038
trainings and we see an effect of both

1159
00:53:51,710 --> 00:53:58,339
well we like to think that our effect is

1160
00:53:55,039 --> 00:54:01,670
higher in in the end and that it just

1161
00:53:58,339 --> 00:54:06,788
doesn't only contribute your list and to

1162
00:54:01,670 --> 00:54:10,970
a number at the end of the day all right

1163
00:54:06,789 --> 00:54:14,470
any more questions ok I'll be around

1164
00:54:10,970 --> 00:54:14,470
thank you again for your patience
