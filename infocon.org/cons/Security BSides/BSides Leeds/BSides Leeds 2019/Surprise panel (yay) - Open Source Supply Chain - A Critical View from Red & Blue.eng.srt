1
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:10,179
hi everybody my name is Aaron Lynch my

2
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:12,700
handles linz I'll I'm we're here today

3
00:00:10,179 --> 00:00:16,440
to talk a little bit about a problem

4
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:19,290
that was elucidated over the last year

5
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:22,900
specifically about open source software

6
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:26,320
all of the projects that end up going

7
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:29,979
out tend to utilize the good the good

8
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:31,750
practices of componentized software many

9
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:34,239
of them produced by you know the

10
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:37,050
community as well as you know some

11
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:39,879
existing code from different sources

12
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:43,959
yeah one one last name where we're not

13
00:00:39,879 --> 00:00:46,718
McFly unfortunately his train was late

14
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:49,170
and then he misses flight so we're

15
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:52,929
throwing this slot with the discussion

16
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:56,289
software I'm the two scientists at an

17
00:00:52,929 --> 00:00:57,999
application security company so my team

18
00:00:56,289 --> 00:00:59,920
and I do a lot of research about the

19
00:00:57,999 --> 00:01:02,199
composition of software and how to keep

20
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:04,330
it secure wherever it games so that's

21
00:01:02,199 --> 00:01:07,960
sort of my perspective on this

22
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:20,469
I'll let the fellow panelists introduce

23
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:22,389
themselves and but just to kind of give

24
00:01:20,469 --> 00:01:23,649
their perspective on this and then we'll

25
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:25,899
talk through some of the issues and

26
00:01:23,649 --> 00:01:28,360
challenges that we've seen on the way to

27
00:01:25,899 --> 00:01:31,420
talk hi say it my name is Tasha nerds I

28
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:34,450
am a senior coaster engineer effects

29
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:36,880
group which is a European and by

30
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:38,920
management and e-commerce group of sites

31
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:42,310
today and my boom pick my part of

32
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:44,770
huffman great since others and I work

33
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:46,719
with quite a small security team for

34
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:50,649
quite a large business across Europe

35
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:52,298
where I help with various and I guess

36
00:01:50,649 --> 00:01:53,560
conversations with us and our

37
00:01:52,299 --> 00:01:55,179
engineering teams to help them build

38
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:58,479
security and that involves threat

39
00:01:55,179 --> 00:02:00,539
modeling and tree architecture reviews a

40
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:05,649
whole range of stuff quite often just

41
00:02:00,539 --> 00:02:07,979
education as well and that's me I'm Mark

42
00:02:05,649 --> 00:02:11,440
Carney in addition to being the

43
00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:13,090
organizers of this austere gathering I'm

44
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:15,130
for mayor purpose too

45
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:17,319
that one limited also for Maneri

46
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:19,900
researcher a security research labs in

47
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:22,030
Berlin are now a full-time PhD students

48
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:24,220
at the University of Leeds my

49
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:25,660
specialization is hardware hacking so

50
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:28,989
when it comes down to supply chain

51
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:31,150
issues there's a lot to be said when it

52
00:02:28,989 --> 00:02:33,280
comes to the security devices and

53
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:36,220
harbours and the way that we sometimes

54
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:39,130
just don't unload it will come to

55
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:41,560
challenge the levels of using the SDKs

56
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:43,690
so my experience comes from a more

57
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:46,600
offensive side as a postal traffic new

58
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:48,400
team side but obviously I've done a lot

59
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:49,900
of remediation advisory work and all

60
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,970
that kind of thing for current clients

61
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:55,510
and companies as well as producing

62
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:59,620
public disclosures are and public

63
00:02:55,510 --> 00:03:02,470
releases a great thank you now so I

64
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:04,810
intend this to be a fairly informal

65
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:08,590
discussion I've somebody sort of in the

66
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:10,510
middle of a rant or something please try

67
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:12,430
not to interrupt however if we come to a

68
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:15,399
logical breaking point and you think it

69
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:17,170
would be a good time for a question I'm

70
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:19,420
happy to recognize you and we'll go from

71
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:21,369
there everybody good with that great um

72
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:24,458
so you know I know we said we're gonna

73
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:27,549
start with with with - but mark I

74
00:03:24,459 --> 00:03:29,680
actually sort of want to start from the

75
00:03:27,549 --> 00:03:32,380
red team sign for the perspective so

76
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:35,680
when you come across a piece of software

77
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:39,400
or piece of infrastructure that has no

78
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:41,530
open-source components in it just just

79
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:43,569
talk for a minute about the sorts of

80
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:45,910
things that you look for is a pen tester

81
00:03:43,569 --> 00:03:48,458
or has somebody that's looking to you

82
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:49,569
know accessible construction so when it

83
00:03:48,459 --> 00:03:55,239
comes down to it once you've identified

84
00:03:49,569 --> 00:03:57,790
some open source things now we have in

85
00:03:55,239 --> 00:04:00,220
many ways improves the odds of pleasant

86
00:03:57,790 --> 00:04:02,138
and so the first thing I would do when I

87
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:03,489
move everybody on were little so concept

88
00:04:02,139 --> 00:04:04,989
of closing right I think most people

89
00:04:03,489 --> 00:04:07,660
will be but to give you an overview you

90
00:04:04,989 --> 00:04:09,220
can look at me in the eye

91
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:12,400
you have to raise your hand awful didn't

92
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:13,030
point at the person yes very worried

93
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:17,170
about

94
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:18,790
so I weave fussing maybe seven or eight

95
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:20,230
years ago was you know kind of a niche

96
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:23,200
thing but now it's teased everywhere

97
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:25,600
everyone that I know certainly research

98
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:27,789
of any kind is okay with how you do

99
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,380
fuzzing and how you into that would mean

100
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:31,630
software and a lot of bugs can be

101
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:33,880
covered off by having a decent living

102
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:36,130
engine are American fuzzy larvae FL is a

103
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:37,810
particularly one undertaken Egret engine

104
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:40,030
so if I know there's a little sauce

105
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:41,470
component one of the things I can do is

106
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:44,320
find that component point my own

107
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:47,530
instrumentation and then starts actually

108
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:49,320
fuzzing that components and then seeing

109
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:51,760
if it actually implies that conical

110
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:53,469
interdependently so when it comes to

111
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:55,420
looking at supply chain issues from a

112
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:57,610
pen testing point of view if I intend to

113
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:59,140
buy something early enough I will then

114
00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:01,450
use that information whatever the

115
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:04,120
process you go through to identify it's

116
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:05,469
it's a you know a piece of software it's

117
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:08,110
it's out there like a million web app

118
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:10,600
maybe some sort of a guide how would you

119
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:14,770
go about identifying the open-source

120
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:16,480
components apart so um you sometimes you

121
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:19,330
can't obviously sometimes you just you

122
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:20,800
have you kind of guessed but other times

123
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:23,200
you have good clues there's often the

124
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:25,600
cruising headers in will fingerprint

125
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:26,830
student compared to so far the mice a

126
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,810
lot of library of fingerprints and

127
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:30,550
different services and things like so

128
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:32,860
even though you know it says it's Apache

129
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:35,980
one point six he actually knows what

130
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:38,910
about you know so he he and I have done

131
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:41,020
some work on trying to bring things

132
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:44,770
together than that point of view other

133
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:47,200
than that it comes down to either

134
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:48,700
intuition or trying to work out looking

135
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:52,270
at the websites underway up okay see

136
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:54,760
what a my favorite minor Jake you're one

137
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:56,409
of my favorite tricks about figuring out

138
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:58,590
what open-source components are part of

139
00:05:56,410 --> 00:06:01,900
the piece of software is that many

140
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:03,669
knowing the licensure of open source

141
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:06,969
component is actually a big deal here

142
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:08,980
because under a certain licenses the

143
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:10,840
user of that software is often required

144
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:12,880
to publish that to comply with a nice

145
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:14,409
and similar and so you can actually end

146
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,940
up looking at the documentation of the

147
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:18,630
software and figure out all the time you

148
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:20,219
live long yeah so so let's let's

149
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:22,230
here's a little bit this as you know is

150
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:25,710
a company that obviously uses a lot of

151
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:28,530
these in the products now can talk about

152
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:31,049
sort of your process with open-source

153
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:36,419
software and how you select components

154
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:37,920
and vetting that you did say with with

155
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:40,140
any group it's looking to use open

156
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:41,930
source software key parties is education

157
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:45,030
and creating the right culture where

158
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:46,530
engineering teams can ask questions

159
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:48,989
about the tools they're using and really

160
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:50,400
understand what they're for and but also

161
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:52,320
we receive the right level of support

162
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,729
from security and operations teams to

163
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:57,920
understand what they should be looking

164
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:59,760
for and what I guess what the

165
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:01,470
opportunities there are we've been using

166
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:03,480
open source software and I'm a great

167
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:04,650
advocate of going with open source I

168
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:06,690
think that if you use it you should

169
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:08,909
contribute to it but ultimately why

170
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:10,560
should we the investing some of these

171
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:12,480
really big companies and great tools

172
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,490
when actually this communities run some

173
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:16,830
really great projects and I think that

174
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:18,060
it generates a lot of collaboration with

175
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:19,530
people you might not collaborate with

176
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:21,840
that you're a great great advocate for

177
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:24,419
it but there's a few things that I've

178
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:28,640
seen a lot of across my career so far

179
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:31,290
with open source one is misspelling and

180
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:34,229
like Oliver a colleague who purposely

181
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:35,970
wrote malicious pregnant - my race

182
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:37,860
specifically for drinkers I'm actually

183
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:40,800
in the description this is malicious

184
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:44,070
don't use it and he created it for topic

185
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:45,780
he did it dev second last year and he

186
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:47,909
did it about two weeks before him was

187
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:49,349
like I or them you know it might get up

188
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:51,170
and down ice and it'll be a great tool

189
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:54,570
and condemnatory brothers really did it

190
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:56,180
10,000 downloads later and ten days we

191
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:59,070
took it up like because he was like

192
00:07:56,180 --> 00:08:01,260
actual research or whatever they're

193
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:03,270
doing I mean I think all it did was just

194
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:04,620
pull any parameters you passed Jenkins

195
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:06,990
because we know that a lot of people

196
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:09,780
pass potentials and Gorge encounters and

197
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:12,690
it'll be a secret access easily seems

198
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:14,599
together a lot and it wasn't as bad as

199
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:18,180
it could've been but it was good enough

200
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:21,300
and for me it demonstrated that quite

201
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:24,180
often we are we're in teams ourselves as

202
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:26,010
truly experts where our street people

203
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:28,200
were ever made my level of whatever

204
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:30,419
level we may be or our engineers are

205
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:31,950
also into news that push deliver quickly

206
00:08:30,419 --> 00:08:33,689
and really fast and off

207
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:35,340
we're looking for tools that can help

208
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:38,040
facilitate that we don't always have the

209
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:38,669
right support to be able to understand

210
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:41,669
what we're using

211
00:08:38,669 --> 00:08:44,640
so having teams that are shooting that

212
00:08:41,669 --> 00:08:46,470
give great I guess educational resources

213
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:48,090
and training and bite size and quick

214
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:50,130
chunks of things to look for and make

215
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:51,480
sure your spelling differences right

216
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:53,760
make sure you know where you're getting

217
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:58,350
it from so let's not be pulling them

218
00:08:53,760 --> 00:09:07,560
from some random bit URL and I get it

219
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:08,880
from this source so the training is

220
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:10,709
absolutely an important thing in

221
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,600
education is really important do you do

222
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:15,150
anything the are you flows anything

223
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:18,330
automated any sort of verification steps

224
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:20,490
that that you take as you put out

225
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:23,100
software to make sure that it has

226
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:25,950
integrity yes there's some great tools

227
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:28,950
out the SS static analysis and testing

228
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:30,480
and specifically for you're looking at

229
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:32,130
your source code and if some open source

230
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,200
static analysis tools out there as well

231
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:35,430
that will look at your dependencies one

232
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:37,260
of the things that it looks at which a

233
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:39,359
lot people don't always fix you manually

234
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:42,000
it's the dependence of trees so the

235
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,440
dependencies of your dependencies and we

236
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,760
might think that something is solid but

237
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,210
it's also potentially putting in

238
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:49,860
hundreds of other packages in some cases

239
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:51,720
that put abilities or I have never been

240
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:53,730
a teaser so there's some static tools

241
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:55,620
out there it will help to give a level

242
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:57,480
of assurance to what is it using in your

243
00:09:55,620 --> 00:10:02,040
code some of those will show how to

244
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:03,390
identify and future issue so if you keep

245
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:05,579
using those as part of your pipeline

246
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:06,600
you'll be able to keep on top of issues

247
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:08,850
that come up in the future

248
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:10,710
we know that in 2016 we saw the summer

249
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:13,320
footage for WordPress some of you might

250
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:14,610
be familiar and I think there is my

251
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:16,050
favorite thing when that was immensely

252
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:18,390
about using WordPress especially a

253
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:21,209
question is putting up the NIST CV

254
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:24,330
database and just type in my bestest

255
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:29,610
videos and I think there's like 1,800 or

256
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:33,660
CV just not me if you want us to talk a

257
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:36,120
little bit more about what CBDs are so

258
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:38,610
you and these are these are known from

259
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:41,490
abilities that have been published for a

260
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:43,230
specific library or tool and it's also a

261
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:43,750
great way to check your if you don't

262
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:45,370
have

263
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:47,490
access to such analysis tool you just

264
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:50,050
type in a library into the nest database

265
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:52,120
it's just just google it it's really

266
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:53,709
accessible even I think that the current

267
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:56,829
government short that and shut down you

268
00:10:53,709 --> 00:11:04,750
can still get to it as the

269
00:10:56,829 --> 00:11:06,519
representative American yeah it is still

270
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:10,480
it is still up if not there's the mitre

271
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:13,209
databases well how do you assess them

272
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:16,240
Christian for me is so how do you assess

273
00:11:13,209 --> 00:11:20,138
your option because I because there's a

274
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:22,269
whole issue in machine hardware one of

275
00:11:20,139 --> 00:11:27,399
the research projects that I did I was

276
00:11:22,269 --> 00:11:30,370
involved in as our labs was the Baptizer

277
00:11:27,399 --> 00:11:32,769
project which is started by a blow over

278
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:34,300
it's how integrated got the output took

279
00:11:32,769 --> 00:11:37,269
down our integration into scripts which

280
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:41,199
people so the idea of that was to find a

281
00:11:37,269 --> 00:11:43,360
way of assessing how well and from

282
00:11:41,199 --> 00:11:46,300
vendors in particular are dealing with

283
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:48,220
patches from the upstream provider to do

284
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:50,079
people review for those of you don't

285
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:52,209
know about Android because it's kind of

286
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:55,719
a good example this happens all over

287
00:11:52,209 --> 00:11:57,189
Hama Google don't make the Android

288
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:59,709
necessary that you have on the thumb

289
00:11:57,189 --> 00:12:01,360
they make the AOSP the Android Open

290
00:11:59,709 --> 00:12:04,628
Source Project all right

291
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:07,269
era speeding has passed to chip-ins a

292
00:12:04,629 --> 00:12:10,329
polka who create closed source usually

293
00:12:07,269 --> 00:12:13,209
open source drivers to make that was

294
00:12:10,329 --> 00:12:15,459
compensator and baseband chip solace you

295
00:12:13,209 --> 00:12:17,199
use one for the duties were and then

296
00:12:15,459 --> 00:12:18,849
that thing is passed down to phone

297
00:12:17,199 --> 00:12:21,790
manufacturers so you want another layer

298
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:24,399
built in a master HTC has their HTC

299
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:28,660
Samsung Samsung had that immersion Alesi

300
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:31,149
there's their batteries if you saw the

301
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:32,740
recent news story about Samsung in the

302
00:12:31,149 --> 00:12:35,439
phones where you couldn't delete

303
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:38,769
facebook without using ADB that exactly

304
00:12:35,439 --> 00:12:40,149
exactly you know and then Samsung won't

305
00:12:38,769 --> 00:12:43,559
produce firms that are maybe time to the

306
00:12:40,149 --> 00:12:47,620
telco the telco will then have yet more

307
00:12:43,559 --> 00:12:48,850
apps from where whatever to make it work

308
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:51,550
on their network with some other

309
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:53,800
features so they've got four lens and we

310
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:57,020
found this had to be really difficult to

311
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:58,520
assess the upstream because it's you

312
00:12:57,020 --> 00:13:00,529
just a straight line all that port is

313
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:02,120
much easier because it's like Apple make

314
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:04,630
the hardware and where the software is

315
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:06,860
or Apple that's all in houses all there

316
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:09,770
whereas the Android with more

317
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:11,810
disciplines much more dispersed and that

318
00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:13,850
is kind of the master you live until you

319
00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:16,010
look at the upstream tree so I'm

320
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:18,500
wondering what what criteria do you have

321
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:21,020
for assessing it like at what point do

322
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:26,380
you say yeah that's good or what point

323
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:28,399
do you have and so good question so

324
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:31,250
fragmentation is that is a real problem

325
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:32,540
in security right services this problem

326
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:34,339
in Android that you're alluding to it

327
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:36,319
where you've just started to describe

328
00:13:34,339 --> 00:13:39,260
either to let me see it in industry a

329
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:40,940
lot where we have network architecture

330
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:42,529
is a good example of this that what I

331
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:43,520
wear and all the various layers

332
00:13:42,529 --> 00:13:46,910
especially when you've got voice

333
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:50,510
infrastructure plays around and there's

334
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:52,610
too much this one is for the corporate

335
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:55,459
lap having a great support contract in

336
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:56,839
place easily buying some of these people

337
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:59,029
to keep in touch with you and let you

338
00:13:56,839 --> 00:14:01,779
know when there are patches doesn't

339
00:13:59,029 --> 00:14:05,170
legally bind them to release patches

340
00:14:01,779 --> 00:14:07,899
which is where with a meltdown inspector

341
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:11,079
specifically we actually saw that where

342
00:14:07,899 --> 00:14:13,490
they told us they were vulnerable and

343
00:14:11,079 --> 00:14:16,099
publicly so scary did some tweets and

344
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:18,950
actually are related some didn't so they

345
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:23,060
weren't and then they were again and but

346
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:25,220
thatís I think they didn't actually

347
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:27,260
release patches very really long time so

348
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:29,029
when is having great Karma's open with

349
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:31,130
your fighters and knowing what hardware

350
00:14:29,029 --> 00:14:32,270
you're using and actually sometimes that

351
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:35,149
can be really difficult for companies

352
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:36,800
and so having that dialogue open those

353
00:14:35,149 --> 00:14:38,360
you are engineering teams your hybrid

354
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,890
teams whatever that might be is a good

355
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:41,149
part the other bit and I'm going to be a

356
00:14:39,890 --> 00:14:43,250
bit controversial

357
00:14:41,149 --> 00:14:45,410
that's true conference yet you talk

358
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:48,560
about at what point am I like who hurt

359
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:50,750
no I think there's another point which

360
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:53,569
is at what point do I consider what my

361
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:55,399
risk appetite is so depending on what

362
00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:57,740
that Hydra is used for of what the tool

363
00:14:55,399 --> 00:14:59,390
is suffer is what company I'm at

364
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:02,779
there might be a point where I say you

365
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:05,000
know what I can get 70% comfortable that

366
00:15:02,779 --> 00:15:06,529
I know what's happening and I know that

367
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,720
the company Dewey's patches that they

368
00:15:06,529 --> 00:15:10,040
take a really long time in and but

369
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:13,910
actually the toys owning

370
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:16,910
yes and the value it gives me is this

371
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:18,589
high and I'm not regulated so actually

372
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:21,170
I'm gonna accept that risk and I think

373
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:23,660
sometimes in strain x LM being

374
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:25,430
controversial is you know something this

375
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:28,660
100 sets of curious probably look usable

376
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:30,589
you know we love 100 oh yeah um

377
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:33,110
sometimes you have to be really

378
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:35,000
cognizant and realistic about the risk

379
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:37,820
appetite and lots of big things right

380
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:40,160
and I think sometimes is easy for us to

381
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:44,510
ignore that that honest that I WordPress

382
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:45,620
is really hard to get haters and why is

383
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:48,350
that though is that because of that

384
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:51,140
ecosystem because of the agencies or is

385
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:53,960
that more hard I think for me it's a

386
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:56,030
usability perspective which is a usable

387
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:57,680
secured with doesn't exist

388
00:15:56,030 --> 00:16:00,680
you have secure WordPress or usable

389
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:04,010
written and does things for show me too

390
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:06,339
and I think that any great company or

391
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:08,689
group or organization open source or not

392
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:12,230
want to have something that's usable and

393
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:14,750
for me that then introduces a tool it is

394
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:16,730
incredibly unsecured so much the

395
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:18,590
original question of how do I make it

396
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:20,030
happen when is it's just great

397
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:25,210
communication paths and the type of

398
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:25,209
providers so II's know if they have no

399
00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:30,949
so like I at least know what their level

400
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,230
is and pipe that means it when you're

401
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:35,240
looking at purchasing library so I think

402
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:37,730
I'd where is is passion in them a lot

403
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:40,760
surprise pie programs out a lot because

404
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:41,840
it can be a bit boring but I'm me is

405
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:43,790
really understanding what their

406
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:46,190
technical capabilities they have a stop

407
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:48,680
when they aware of series or 0 days when

408
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:50,780
these happen and the other parts of risk

409
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:54,050
appetite like knowing it what they can

410
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:55,910
accept it before I get pushed yeah so

411
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:58,219
that that that's a really good answer

412
00:16:55,910 --> 00:17:00,800
for things that you know are in your

413
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:04,010
software there's been a trend through

414
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:07,389
the way a scale also get a bunch of good

415
00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:07,390
plus like how yeah

416
00:17:07,569 --> 00:17:16,060
the skill one to WordPress in Microsoft

417
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:17,740
Windows is a five but that's about the

418
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:20,220
components that you know about right and

419
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:22,780
from from an organizational perspective

420
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:25,000
one aspect that you often see especially

421
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:27,849
when developers under pressure or doing

422
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:32,290
outsourcing is components make their way

423
00:17:27,849 --> 00:17:34,719
in unannounced where you know there's

424
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:36,940
this there's oh I could employ this or

425
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:39,820
you know pull around the library out of

426
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:42,910
out of the compendium how do you do many

427
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:46,659
processes that identify those sorts of

428
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:48,760
anomalies so I felt like you know what I

429
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:52,990
would want to say which is likely to be

430
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:55,000
lying up to back front Monday and so and

431
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:56,290
there's this thing that I love to do

432
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,090
which is breaking things

433
00:17:56,290 --> 00:18:01,690
there's this thing that I'm allowed to

434
00:17:58,090 --> 00:18:03,040
do now which is sometimes making things

435
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:04,540
so they're almost like theoretically

436
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:06,280
breaking things so for someone that

437
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:08,320
doesn't know how about anyone that

438
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:10,360
doesn't know what front modeling is is a

439
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:13,230
framework or process I won't refer you

440
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:16,570
to ones that are understand an

441
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:18,520
environment whether that's theoretical

442
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:19,750
it's an idea it's an opportunity or it's

443
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:22,600
something it's actually in production

444
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:23,770
and then kind of work through a load of

445
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:25,719
different frameworks to understand what

446
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:27,520
can go wrong and then think about what

447
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:29,290
can I do about things can go wrong and

448
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:31,930
then the panel say check validate I

449
00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:33,940
write tests did I do a good job and I

450
00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:36,490
follow a particular framework which

451
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:39,670
stride there's no doubt there but I run

452
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:44,040
through that one thing and an example

453
00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:46,240
might be so robots group purchased

454
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:47,980
company in Amsterdam early this year

455
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:51,760
unfortunately before joint so I'm mr.

456
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:54,970
John Telegraph and but part of that

457
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:56,770
company are looking to kind of migrate

458
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:58,330
some business processes for then also

459
00:18:56,770 --> 00:19:01,000
combine some business process which is

460
00:18:58,330 --> 00:19:03,370
really exciting and the part of that is

461
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,110
exactly a commitment we're absorbing a

462
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:08,649
company that previously had no knowledge

463
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:10,419
as that weren't part of our street

464
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:12,160
culture or security environment and

465
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:14,410
actually set so there's some things and

466
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:17,320
they've got document it really well but

467
00:19:14,410 --> 00:19:18,110
there's most things as in as it is with

468
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:20,600
any company

469
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:22,699
that aren't documented and that's

470
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:25,549
pervaded all the time so threat modeling

471
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:27,320
is a process I run through with some

472
00:19:25,549 --> 00:19:30,320
engineer's some of them operations

473
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:32,149
I think project managers scrum masters

474
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:34,100
whoever it might be and I get them in a

475
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:35,990
room together for anywhere between like

476
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:38,270
15 minutes two hours

477
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:40,940
hang on how robust something is Google

478
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:45,760
and notice what I do sometimes provide

479
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:49,790
Pizza says oh we had it down is always

480
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:52,100
there in technique it's just a way to

481
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:53,418
kind of have an open conversation and I

482
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:54,678
use framework and tours when people

483
00:19:53,419 --> 00:19:56,240
answer through minded to come up with

484
00:19:54,679 --> 00:19:58,370
fret vectors but it's it's a way for

485
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:00,770
people to air out possible threat

486
00:19:58,370 --> 00:20:02,059
vectors or talk about previous incidents

487
00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:03,168
and they're going like when I think of

488
00:20:02,059 --> 00:20:05,178
all the other things that could have

489
00:20:03,169 --> 00:20:07,250
caused the same incident other vectors

490
00:20:05,179 --> 00:20:10,850
and so for me that's been a really

491
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:14,179
strong tool and then on the other side

492
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:16,939
you know there's a pen tester and how

493
00:20:14,179 --> 00:20:20,480
does that threat modeling process come

494
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:23,179
into your you so um felt lonely for me

495
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:25,760
is I don't do it the way that you do it

496
00:20:23,179 --> 00:20:28,880
because my threat modeling is much more

497
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:30,830
allow that people can I see the pen test

498
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:33,140
what's compaction sometimes like certain

499
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:34,850
I I never get the complete view because

500
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:37,040
I have a scope I'm working to a

501
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:39,379
particular statement of work it might

502
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:40,909
deviate from that I can go to jail you

503
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:44,150
think it could be the miss you sucks

504
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:45,350
so you know there's I do suppose feel a

505
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:47,600
little frustrated with that because

506
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:51,080
unlike this thing here there's a thing

507
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:52,699
here outage it but by and large when I

508
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:56,960
find something I'm assessing it and I'm

509
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:58,460
looking at the way in which I can I'm

510
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,710
always on will help you what are you

511
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:03,770
trusting that you should there's also

512
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:06,530
been the your threats come from some

513
00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:09,168
attack surface which is my the attack so

514
00:21:06,530 --> 00:21:12,200
as I sees the scope and then I look at

515
00:21:09,169 --> 00:21:15,049
that I go okay what malicious acts can I

516
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:16,970
commit that seem to have legs I've seen

517
00:21:15,049 --> 00:21:19,460
to be able to work and I works trying in

518
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:21,679
a little concert so I'm always trying to

519
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:24,380
produce something that is useful to you

520
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:27,530
guys at least in terms of like because I

521
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:29,510
decided being a pen tester to be able to

522
00:21:27,530 --> 00:21:32,360
save like I found this thing

523
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:34,990
I it looks like an exercise but then

524
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:42,560
I'll try and say okay can I actually get

525
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:44,090
okay that can actually get any and when

526
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:46,730
it comes down to identify if it's those

527
00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:49,280
components for example then I will look

528
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:52,490
at again I will look at scenes I will

529
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:54,950
fire I have a tour must line up see I'm

530
00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:57,290
a bit version number just down there I'm

531
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:58,730
just gives me love and then they also

532
00:21:57,290 --> 00:22:01,010
drop cross references and you can

533
00:21:58,730 --> 00:22:04,730
download yes boom b-b-boom I'll give up

534
00:22:01,010 --> 00:22:07,760
my attend a chatbot which he sits on a

535
00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:09,710
slack well I just asked it for CD and if

536
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:12,920
it mine says it was returned the exploit

537
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:15,620
isn't yeah so because I can't always

538
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:17,360
like access things but I can usually get

539
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:19,850
my way to when it slams so if I could do

540
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:23,719
that I have a group up buzzes my little

541
00:22:19,850 --> 00:22:26,060
librarian you know so you know like I I

542
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:28,430
can release five people interested but I

543
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:36,290
am very self-conscious about my shirt so

544
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:38,240
my question so well you know working the

545
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:39,560
Pinterest and Industry on consoles and

546
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:41,180
I'm going to just slip on the

547
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:42,950
non-ethical side of things because

548
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:45,590
that's Jerry's where we come from so

549
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:48,230
from a non ethical side you looking for

550
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:50,629
are staying within es o w7 in scope I

551
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:52,190
want to slide outside the scope we

552
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:55,310
jumpin all right

553
00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:57,440
don't blame me for this but I will look

554
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:59,060
at your develops processes and I will

555
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:02,270
stop folding in through so we've all

556
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:04,570
heard of the LinkedIn episode you're

557
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:06,980
leaning over the next places we were

558
00:23:04,570 --> 00:23:10,010
we're really just going to talk about a

559
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:12,320
case study on you for the LinkedIn

560
00:23:10,010 --> 00:23:14,540
episode about a little something Tim

561
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:16,340
what languages they efficient in what

562
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:16,850
processes what tools that usual

563
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:19,010
everything

564
00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:21,770
then I'll follow them on structure but

565
00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:24,110
now let's be honest most days on a

566
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:26,629
solution sermon because they go suck a

567
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:29,090
photo ever clue what's going on

568
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:31,880
a finance solution copy/paste

569
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:34,850
is now a new code so if I follow them

570
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:36,860
and I'm asking questions of all some

571
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:39,469
others code on stuck over quote because

572
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:41,179
you can it will copy and paste it put it

573
00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:42,290
into your code and then when they

574
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:45,440
download the legs

575
00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:50,389
jQuery is not the Apple version is my

576
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:53,060
version while I'm sleeping well off

577
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:55,880
scope is what the same with our intent

578
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:58,340
as well we use they are but there are

579
00:23:55,880 --> 00:24:01,300
guys outside those walls that are not

580
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:03,709
that cool yeah how everything is so

581
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:06,649
process is I'm able to answer that

582
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:08,750
stride I have reduced stride on an

583
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:11,600
offensive level we do your stride in the

584
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:14,660
effective around the world I understand

585
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:16,669
how you threaten model against normal

586
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:20,150
types of survival how'd you fit moderate

587
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:23,090
length that about coming in one well I

588
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:26,450
so can you talk about really side tunnel

589
00:24:23,090 --> 00:24:29,149
based attacks and so one of the tools

590
00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:31,820
that I've used before is using different

591
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:35,570
attacker profiles and Adam show separate

592
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:37,520
the contract modeling mister design

593
00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:39,860
centered approach mentioned this as well

594
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:41,180
I'm going to kind of get to where you're

595
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:44,179
going out and be taking on a bit of a

596
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:46,820
journey Sydney and I mean it talks about

597
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:48,620
I use like a two by two mentor for

598
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:50,990
back-office really for my type of

599
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:53,090
profiles and I'm not missing the main

600
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:55,610
things because they're super that when I

601
00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:57,230
edit my site a bit rude but I

602
00:24:55,610 --> 00:24:58,729
effectively work through kind of

603
00:24:57,230 --> 00:25:00,380
different great attackers and we start

604
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:02,090
and I've got model really simple blue

605
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:04,370
team aspects we going through strategy

606
00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:05,840
spending on the team's comfort level or

607
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:06,860
experience and might do this with the

608
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,270
team or separately

609
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:10,399
and then work through different attack

610
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:11,690
attacker break so we might start with

611
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,580
your script Kitty someone that's just

612
00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:15,230
going to try stuff a lot of the time

613
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:18,379
it's reconnaissance based attacks or

614
00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:21,620
pretty mobile scripts sequel injection

615
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:22,910
and stuff like that it's useful to do

616
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:26,209
because ultimately that's how tool talk

617
00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:28,100
was hacked and but we start to throw it

618
00:25:26,210 --> 00:25:29,450
polished ride on that specific attacker

619
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:32,570
mindset it's a great way to teacher

620
00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:34,460
engineers I go through I have poor and

621
00:25:32,570 --> 00:25:37,909
abrupt profiles that I follow so then

622
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:39,980
I'll go for you're my next stage up

623
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:41,900
effectively is a pen tester that goes

624
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:44,720
there's a bit rope sort of someone that

625
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:48,140
has more formal training or more formal

626
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:51,080
structure and then follows the same

627
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:52,820
available exploits but more publicly

628
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:55,100
available exploits so still kind of

629
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:57,860
white hat tools but for a bad

630
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:59,629
and these often follow we use our

631
00:25:57,860 --> 00:26:01,159
pencils in sessions to kind of say what

632
00:25:59,630 --> 00:26:02,840
would they do but when they do they kind

633
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:06,250
of fell off the scope a little bit and

634
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:08,949
that happens and my next level up is

635
00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:12,710
happiness for money so they tend to be

636
00:26:08,950 --> 00:26:14,150
more on crime or organized crime and

637
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:15,950
then your next level up is nation today

638
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:19,429
so it depends what I'm looking I talked

639
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:21,169
about my risk appetite earlier off and I

640
00:26:19,429 --> 00:26:23,600
might have pry my risk appetite some

641
00:26:21,169 --> 00:26:25,160
type of attack of profiles I use it's

642
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:27,408
not always easy to do in every threat

643
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:29,780
model because most offer engineers' when

644
00:26:27,409 --> 00:26:32,870
really think about those different types

645
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:34,908
of attacks a great stock great street

646
00:26:32,870 --> 00:26:37,309
operation center will have people or

647
00:26:34,909 --> 00:26:39,140
cyber threat intelligence teams or have

648
00:26:37,309 --> 00:26:40,730
people that specialize in this type of

649
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:43,070
thing in this and information publicly

650
00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:46,039
available and pretty sure they're my own

651
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:48,980
attack groups have tools as well and I'm

652
00:26:46,039 --> 00:26:50,870
the sample profile attackers so stuff

653
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:54,020
like that I use great pen testing

654
00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:55,699
companies and groups will also start to

655
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:59,960
follow it guidance and those type of

656
00:26:55,700 --> 00:27:01,520
attack vectors and bounty programs are a

657
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:03,020
really good way to kind of help with

658
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:05,960
that kind of thing I know you're still

659
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:07,370
giving to scope that often your bounty

660
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:10,640
musicians don't always follow the script

661
00:27:07,370 --> 00:27:12,709
anyway yeah I'm really hard to emmett

662
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:16,280
and we have a bug bounty program out

663
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:18,620
there and we pay altitudes what about if

664
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:20,120
you understand your question what about

665
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:21,559
you know that's really good on a

666
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:23,139
predictive site right where you're

667
00:27:21,559 --> 00:27:25,610
trying to kind of predict the

668
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:28,789
capabilities how about you know in terms

669
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:32,629
of mitigation or detection of these

670
00:27:28,789 --> 00:27:37,010
sorts of attacks what sorts of tools to

671
00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:40,130
use and sort of processes these say I'll

672
00:27:37,010 --> 00:27:42,500
talk about what can known it you guys

673
00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:47,210
are I ever done my job if I have to push

674
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:48,890
somebody to an NDA so there's some great

675
00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:52,700
open source tools out there that do

676
00:27:48,890 --> 00:27:55,580
things like log aggregation and then log

677
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:57,919
interrogation and the thing I'm going to

678
00:27:55,580 --> 00:28:00,350
go kind of back to even more really one

679
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:02,169
thing I talk to it kind of pretty much

680
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:05,570
everywhere I've worked so far is

681
00:28:02,169 --> 00:28:07,460
visibility is really cheap and a lot of

682
00:28:05,570 --> 00:28:08,240
people invest money in these and

683
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:10,970
incredibly

684
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:13,090
sensing Aurora's tools already happens

685
00:28:10,970 --> 00:28:16,010
in here who knows one can credibly well

686
00:28:13,090 --> 00:28:17,780
as an example but you need to make sure

687
00:28:16,010 --> 00:28:19,580
you're capturing those logs first and

688
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:22,700
especially when we look at distributed

689
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:25,540
architectures where we have multi filed

690
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:27,559
environments or hybrid environments and

691
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:31,280
collecting them from every sources to

692
00:28:27,559 --> 00:28:32,899
drop off the map and s3 buckets are a

693
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:34,610
good example people dance in scraps you

694
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:36,380
love to mystery but it's all time your

695
00:28:34,610 --> 00:28:38,990
Lancer functions whatever it like being

696
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:40,850
Google Cloud has some really weird rules

697
00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:41,750
about how you catch the last tricks it's

698
00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:44,240
pretty hard

699
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:45,620
and so visibility is something I would

700
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:47,210
go back to first making sure I'm

701
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:48,979
catching loss from every environment and

702
00:28:47,210 --> 00:28:51,350
then love aggregation is really

703
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:53,600
important to me so I'm making sure that

704
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:56,780
Bristol I have a true sense of my logs

705
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:58,969
and I can have a source of truth that I

706
00:28:56,780 --> 00:29:01,670
trust and in stride we come back to

707
00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:03,410
repudiation and it always makes me think

708
00:29:01,670 --> 00:29:05,630
of a legal term which is that which is

709
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:06,890
decided is to stand I'm gonna throw at

710
00:29:05,630 --> 00:29:10,550
that with my lungs so they need to be

711
00:29:06,890 --> 00:29:12,679
precedent set and so having a good

712
00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:14,120
longer get sore so I'm not really

713
00:29:12,679 --> 00:29:16,900
telling you what tools I use but my

714
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:19,010
process is capture everything

715
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:21,860
centralized make sure I've got a source

716
00:29:19,010 --> 00:29:24,080
of truth and then interrogate and then I

717
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:25,909
can build baselines then I can start to

718
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:28,790
look at what I need to text I can work

719
00:29:25,910 --> 00:29:32,540
with publicly available information the

720
00:29:28,790 --> 00:29:33,830
National Cyber Security Alliance give a

721
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:36,050
lot of guidance some things that you

722
00:29:33,830 --> 00:29:37,939
should be looking for a lot of things

723
00:29:36,050 --> 00:29:40,428
will share stuff social services show

724
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:42,020
data ecommerce groups share date so the

725
00:29:40,429 --> 00:29:45,230
e prime forum is a really great place to

726
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:46,790
get information the initiation look it's

727
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:48,590
a baseline and then you can write lots

728
00:29:46,790 --> 00:29:50,899
of text and learn things I loved in in

729
00:29:48,590 --> 00:29:52,669
threat modeling is write in BDD test or

730
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:54,770
test off the back of the practically

731
00:29:52,670 --> 00:29:57,559
file so we can validate certain use

732
00:29:54,770 --> 00:30:00,170
promoter for loop I'm sorry that absent

733
00:29:57,559 --> 00:30:01,809
behavior driven development and so we

734
00:30:00,170 --> 00:30:05,360
write tests these are human readable

735
00:30:01,809 --> 00:30:08,420
text a - a human or not like software

736
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:11,449
engineer reader bullies are forgive me

737
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:15,290
project manager business leader readable

738
00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:18,750
code and so you write test so a good

739
00:30:15,290 --> 00:30:20,610
example is child from subdomain

740
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:22,290
hijackings a lot of that last year

741
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:25,379
across the whole industry where people

742
00:30:22,290 --> 00:30:27,840
were having today's taken over and no

743
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:29,670
great we're not gonna reward and and in

744
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,990
a threat model we've rolled it out but I

745
00:30:29,670 --> 00:30:32,430
don't want to just forget about that

746
00:30:30,990 --> 00:30:34,410
because we roll it out so we wrote a

747
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:36,060
test to validate that we're continuously

748
00:30:34,410 --> 00:30:37,110
not vulnerable so we know engineers push

749
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:39,750
code all the time

750
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:41,699
and so we might ask the reason of human

751
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:44,240
reader boys I want our business leaders

752
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:46,950
our product owners our project managers

753
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:51,120
understand what we're not vulnerable to

754
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:53,940
I want them to my test tube so can I

755
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:57,330
take my something that I found I think

756
00:30:53,940 --> 00:31:00,060
my whole was also you live here really

757
00:30:57,330 --> 00:31:04,470
friend of mine yeah my brother found the

758
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:06,570
thing which was we all externally remind

759
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:10,560
together shell on the server has an

760
00:31:06,570 --> 00:31:12,330
encryption you know they had Allen

761
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:15,510
looking at him like this looks a bit

762
00:31:12,330 --> 00:31:17,939
like like psycho baloney

763
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:20,160
what's going on they them it was an

764
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:22,070
encryption it wasn't option yeah that's

765
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:24,480
when I searched for that happens people

766
00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:27,510
yeah yeah well we won't meet when you

767
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:29,520
search for options I think that's you

768
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:32,190
say that there was a symbol inside this

769
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:33,720
yard and in the deal yeah and let me

770
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:36,120
find there's a stack overflow article

771
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:38,490
how to implement a BS in this language

772
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:40,199
and then when we looked at it they

773
00:31:38,490 --> 00:31:42,990
actually preserved the keys while it

774
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:45,570
literally copied and pasted and flipping

775
00:31:42,990 --> 00:31:47,580
including the key like so bothered if

776
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:49,830
that's it kinky messing it up like that

777
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:51,510
but also like they just it was a public

778
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:54,659
hearing in the morning is this that like

779
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:56,550
it's there currently like how do you

780
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:57,930
approach that kind of poem this is a

781
00:31:56,550 --> 00:31:59,340
time of extreme emotional bit of like

782
00:31:57,930 --> 00:32:04,080
it's not even that there's malicious

783
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:08,580
thank you of loquacious you see in my

784
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:10,889
mouth that's five years it was like gosh

785
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:13,250
and there are test fit developers can

786
00:32:10,890 --> 00:32:15,420
run lately so it's that video chat and

787
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:17,100
they're all so let me just regular

788
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:18,900
expression check so it'll be a super

789
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:21,120
access keys follow a step warmer you can

790
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:23,430
write a regular expression and it

791
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:25,830
searches for that and and you can have a

792
00:32:23,430 --> 00:32:28,679
a taller script that you were locally

793
00:32:25,830 --> 00:32:32,040
anytime you push food anywhere just

794
00:32:28,679 --> 00:32:32,700
seconds the gear and you can even going

795
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:35,790
to Talladega

796
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:37,260
your github or your work github not to

797
00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:40,649
the wrong one because he can do that to

798
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:42,390
you all the time and local tests are

799
00:32:40,650 --> 00:32:43,460
just as important as your pipeline test

800
00:32:42,390 --> 00:32:46,620
your pen test

801
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:49,830
also check you get history as well oh my

802
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:51,919
gosh so that's the lease today way yeah

803
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:54,689
exactly that there's been a few

804
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:56,010
departments pilot to the git history and

805
00:32:54,690 --> 00:33:00,420
then I have to sort of know someone

806
00:32:56,010 --> 00:33:02,160
going that's a no this was so this is a

807
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:05,700
UK home but this is one of those guys

808
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:07,590
eyes can we think was probably quickly

809
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:09,180
it's also like I know how about spit out

810
00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:11,429
their their business or something i in

811
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:12,600
fact came across myself a couple of

812
00:33:11,430 --> 00:33:15,240
weeks ago where yeah

813
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:16,500
oh no you know so he posted something

814
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:19,890
and get help that they shouldn't have

815
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:22,800
and you know if you don't know you can

816
00:33:19,890 --> 00:33:24,330
actually roll back bike Nick even

817
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:25,980
through the websites you don't have to

818
00:33:24,330 --> 00:33:28,020
even interact with the command line

819
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:31,140
level now you can go commit my commits

820
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:33,840
you find the previous states of things

821
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:35,310
yeah so somebody did publish their

822
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:39,899
source couldn't get them and then

823
00:33:35,310 --> 00:33:41,669
decided times you may be aware that as

824
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:45,150
as you are thing is though is that when

825
00:33:41,670 --> 00:33:46,980
you do to the website you know like CSI

826
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:49,080
cyber and they look for the red code

827
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:55,790
like it literally the bath code it is a

828
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:57,840
reset the Queen code is the cou true but

829
00:33:55,790 --> 00:34:00,840
this actually is really relevant

830
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:04,620
open-source software because even if you

831
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:05,100
update or you know remove that part from

832
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:08,130
your

833
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:14,759
publicly available code a lot of times

834
00:34:08,130 --> 00:34:17,130
those losers yeah all right so I think

835
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:18,450
you're a that was a great question thank

836
00:34:17,130 --> 00:34:23,120
you anybody else have any questions

837
00:34:18,449 --> 00:34:25,408
while we're sort of influence these

838
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:28,230
assessments and people's eyes going

839
00:34:25,409 --> 00:34:34,950
black and secondly after you get people

840
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:37,190
to what great question among oh yeah I'm

841
00:34:34,949 --> 00:34:37,189
it

842
00:34:38,130 --> 00:34:43,290
the first one is when I do if a module

843
00:34:40,050 --> 00:34:44,970
and I really push for the owner

844
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:48,418
patience to be a part of the treble and

845
00:34:44,969 --> 00:34:50,189
like really push for it and the reason I

846
00:34:48,418 --> 00:34:52,199
do that and I don't let them take their

847
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:53,790
laptop to the rim unless they're the one

848
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:55,319
that's right in Deraa tickets they're

849
00:34:53,790 --> 00:34:57,210
things that we find because I want them

850
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:59,550
to understand and comprehend of the day

851
00:34:57,210 --> 00:35:01,140
the reason I push for the owner to come

852
00:34:59,550 --> 00:35:03,360
to the club in fashion is there is

853
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:06,180
nothing like hearing your own engineers

854
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:08,520
say how honest hear something is no use

855
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:10,230
the street coming along and say in like

856
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:11,910
that's very can let's break it and but

857
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:13,980
hear one of their own developers give

858
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:15,600
that message speaks volumes it can be

859
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:20,070
really difficult to get them in the room

860
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:21,270
and I once had quite a struggle I want

861
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:24,030
to do a segment on something that was

862
00:35:21,270 --> 00:35:26,310
quite large and the team where they've

863
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:27,690
had a lot focused on them so they they

864
00:35:26,310 --> 00:35:30,270
effectively little really seen

865
00:35:27,690 --> 00:35:31,980
super-abilities take be exploited and

866
00:35:30,270 --> 00:35:35,520
now they didn't really want anyone else

867
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:37,110
coming in and making fun of them or

868
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:38,220
making them feel bad because threat

869
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:39,840
modeling can feel a little bit like

870
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:41,129
you're punching someone's baby they've

871
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:42,810
worked on something really hard and you

872
00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:44,520
just kind of deep trap out of it and

873
00:35:42,810 --> 00:35:45,990
it's not like that yet exercising a

874
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:48,750
muscle you're building it up you're

875
00:35:45,990 --> 00:35:51,180
making it stronger and more alert and

876
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:53,580
more resilient and I keep very

877
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:58,080
persuasive to get people in a room with

878
00:35:53,580 --> 00:36:00,870
me but ultimately what I I'm a bit

879
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:01,740
sneaky so the way I do it is I I talk to

880
00:36:00,870 --> 00:36:04,230
a couple of people in the engineering

881
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:06,180
and I kind of say hey how cool Italy we

882
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:08,520
got in there we had this session and you

883
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:10,259
guys on training and I kind of cream

884
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:12,240
this Chinese whispers thing startups a

885
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:14,100
puppy love this I'll then pretend in

886
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:15,870
with the tech lead for half an hour

887
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:17,400
and I'll say okay this is what I want to

888
00:36:15,870 --> 00:36:17,759
do I think it would be a really great

889
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,110
idea

890
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:22,410
but go touch your developers and see

891
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:23,850
what they think and then I'll talk to

892
00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:26,040
the product owner as well or whoever

893
00:36:23,850 --> 00:36:27,810
owns the wrist for that application and

894
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:29,310
I'll say I can challenge your team I

895
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:30,840
think this is really valuable but I want

896
00:36:29,310 --> 00:36:32,940
you to come and I want you to be a part

897
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:34,350
of it if you come into session and

898
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:36,960
instead of not having to respond to

899
00:36:34,350 --> 00:36:38,430
emails or resettlements today we're just

900
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:39,870
going to try and cover up as much as we

901
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:42,509
can in this one session and then you

902
00:36:39,870 --> 00:36:44,520
know where you sound and the easiest way

903
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:46,350
for me to ever frame it is being again

904
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:49,200
really honest about that respect type

905
00:36:46,350 --> 00:36:51,960
thing my role at the moment isn't to

906
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:53,970
tell them yes or no it's to give them

907
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:55,530
all the information so that they make an

908
00:36:53,970 --> 00:36:56,450
informed decision and ultimately

909
00:36:55,530 --> 00:37:00,800
severely

910
00:36:56,450 --> 00:37:02,299
violently so that they can make an

911
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:05,360
informed decision and feel like they

912
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:07,880
have the rights to work remain I I

913
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:09,980
struggle with things like risk documents

914
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:11,900
and risk assessments I think once

915
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:16,160
because I had to write one from a person

916
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:17,780
to genuinely 1800 thirds long because

917
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:19,759
that was the way that that particular

918
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:21,500
project works that they wanted

919
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:24,200
everything's documents it but I think

920
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:26,170
anyone ever read it so that's why I feel

921
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:28,399
like threat models are much easier

922
00:37:26,170 --> 00:37:30,350
Mozilla released some an open-source

923
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:33,200
graphic risk assessment form which is

924
00:37:30,350 --> 00:37:34,490
actually not that bad and it starts to

925
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:39,520
address some of those kind of risk

926
00:37:34,490 --> 00:37:44,479
questions but mature risk programs are

927
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:46,130
so varied so fragmented and you have to

928
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:48,950
find what works for your company and at

929
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:51,110
the moment I'm finding that that kind of

930
00:37:48,950 --> 00:37:52,910
kinesthetic that movement that threat

931
00:37:51,110 --> 00:37:55,280
modeling in a room together seems to be

932
00:37:52,910 --> 00:37:56,779
the thing that works for me I imagine

933
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:59,390
and I've got colleagues that come from

934
00:37:56,780 --> 00:38:00,890
BP I imagine that they would feel more

935
00:37:59,390 --> 00:38:03,140
consular deduction in there they can

936
00:38:00,890 --> 00:38:05,810
scan so I think that there's no one

937
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:08,270
right answer to that I'd be curious if

938
00:38:05,810 --> 00:38:10,610
something's really telling when you

939
00:38:08,270 --> 00:38:12,770
started which is it's one thing to hear

940
00:38:10,610 --> 00:38:15,380
my ancestor its lip maintained from

941
00:38:12,770 --> 00:38:18,800
departments I don't mind Amir went tweet

942
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:21,020
from a few days ago video line people

943
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:23,360
which what happens a little bit viable

944
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:25,250
info section to see which was yeah you

945
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:27,020
security guys you are just dual and

946
00:38:25,250 --> 00:38:30,170
gloom on all you do is give as a cat

947
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:31,190
right that is all you do and it kind of

948
00:38:30,170 --> 00:38:34,520
been a lot of people so sit up and go

949
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:35,150
actually yeah so they will not know what

950
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:38,030
I'm talking about

951
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:40,880
that's the VLC tree yeah the PLC to

952
00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:42,350
share okay so yeah that was a different

953
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:44,870
promise HTTP bus station

954
00:38:42,350 --> 00:38:46,850
yes they had their own litigations and

955
00:38:44,870 --> 00:38:47,990
things and whatnot but like I think it

956
00:38:46,850 --> 00:38:50,120
was very telling that you said that it

957
00:38:47,990 --> 00:38:53,060
it comes from Pentos do you find that

958
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:55,940
the pentoses are just like setting fires

959
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:57,680
everywhere by the fans are more welcomed

960
00:38:55,940 --> 00:39:01,550
actually you know our industry is always

961
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:04,790
we've been built ground we keep negative

962
00:39:01,550 --> 00:39:07,250
as well as you know sources and fix it

963
00:39:04,790 --> 00:39:09,200
that's what you really have fun and I

964
00:39:07,250 --> 00:39:11,420
mean I've been doing this seven

965
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:13,430
years and it's always been I'm going to

966
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:15,740
give you some fun news I'm going to feel

967
00:39:13,430 --> 00:39:17,750
great about it but I'm really used to

968
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:19,450
change now that's why tonight it is not

969
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:23,000
like ten years ago

970
00:39:19,450 --> 00:39:25,520
Wow give you the pot news we will work

971
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:28,609
with you to make it better

972
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:30,470
now well the market is don't it still up

973
00:39:28,609 --> 00:39:33,650
this too will give you the same

974
00:39:30,470 --> 00:39:35,209
by the time you could really at all yeah

975
00:39:33,650 --> 00:39:37,550
I will tell you that one of the

976
00:39:35,210 --> 00:39:40,430
techniques I particularly used to wake

977
00:39:37,550 --> 00:39:42,829
up a couple people in this in this area

978
00:39:40,430 --> 00:39:47,270
is that I actually like to demonstrate a

979
00:39:42,829 --> 00:39:49,790
win to begin this Saturday meeting and

980
00:39:47,270 --> 00:39:52,160
I'll give you an example on so in a

981
00:39:49,790 --> 00:39:54,650
previous generation of what we were

982
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:57,410
doing a threat modeling we identified a

983
00:39:54,650 --> 00:40:01,339
ticket we've mitigated that ticket and

984
00:39:57,410 --> 00:40:03,470
it got push the production and the nice

985
00:40:01,339 --> 00:40:05,509
thing about it is is that part of that

986
00:40:03,470 --> 00:40:08,899
ticket we actually have the one-line

987
00:40:05,510 --> 00:40:10,670
repro that was sort of like a very clear

988
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:12,650
thing where I type this in and get the

989
00:40:10,670 --> 00:40:16,130
shell back and I have the ability to

990
00:40:12,650 --> 00:40:18,680
just demonstrate it he look this works

991
00:40:16,130 --> 00:40:19,970
well I actually started that meeting in

992
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:22,098
you know kind of going back to your

993
00:40:19,970 --> 00:40:26,180
question I started the meeting for the

994
00:40:22,099 --> 00:40:28,790
next Rev of that update was showing hey

995
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:30,379
look this used to not this used to work

996
00:40:28,790 --> 00:40:32,690
and could have been really devastating

997
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:34,790
and I actually just put a terminal up

998
00:40:32,690 --> 00:40:37,430
on-screen pasted on command into this

999
00:40:34,790 --> 00:40:40,130
hand and and then and then the guy whom

1000
00:40:37,430 --> 00:40:42,230
actually got a text from our monitoring

1001
00:40:40,130 --> 00:40:44,660
system saying you know this was a

1002
00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:46,400
high-priority thing an attack it

1003
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:48,589
happened from inside the buildings order

1004
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:51,650
to think so so that that force feedback

1005
00:40:48,589 --> 00:40:55,339
of showing a win can be a very effective

1006
00:40:51,650 --> 00:40:57,650
way just be like listen we're all trying

1007
00:40:55,339 --> 00:41:00,500
to pull towards the same goal here you

1008
00:40:57,650 --> 00:41:02,599
know okay this is actually working in an

1009
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:04,069
app people get engaged it's certainly

1010
00:41:02,599 --> 00:41:07,339
the sprint demo for anybody that's

1011
00:41:04,069 --> 00:41:08,960
scribed to agile methodology I think

1012
00:41:07,339 --> 00:41:11,270
about that is like the beginning of like

1013
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:12,220
a sprint down this is show progress and

1014
00:41:11,270 --> 00:41:13,750
show

1015
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:15,819
doesn't come up there's actually a

1016
00:41:13,750 --> 00:41:18,900
notice that there's been a slight moving

1017
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:22,869
Baptistina wondering you read about this

1018
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:24,099
I think you should be in that I find

1019
00:41:22,869 --> 00:41:26,710
that certainly sometimes that's have

1020
00:41:24,099 --> 00:41:28,030
been doing are to fit into a sprint to

1021
00:41:26,710 --> 00:41:29,560
be able to do two things

1022
00:41:28,030 --> 00:41:33,190
while build a relationship with the team

1023
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:36,220
because they're also curious but that's

1024
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:37,599
why I'm that and you know their business

1025
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:39,609
going to be attached was fixing an

1026
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:42,640
exercise you know what was applied by

1027
00:41:39,609 --> 00:41:44,529
political potentially and it gives them

1028
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:48,310
access to be in a more kind of personal

1029
00:41:44,530 --> 00:41:51,430
way but also by doing that it's not just

1030
00:41:48,310 --> 00:41:52,060
a pen test yeah well a pen test every

1031
00:41:51,430 --> 00:41:54,279
six months

1032
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:56,380
it's a hand test that is not really

1033
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:59,050
fantastic it's it's continuing the

1034
00:41:56,380 --> 00:42:01,210
security of serfs most exactly it

1035
00:41:59,050 --> 00:42:03,400
becomes a support network and then you

1036
00:42:01,210 --> 00:42:04,840
get emails like we're gonna do this does

1037
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:06,940
this code black or white other this like

1038
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:09,810
the bottom page any be spoken then email

1039
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:12,520
pharmacies at all of our exercises

1040
00:42:09,810 --> 00:42:14,560
prepare test for how good it feels

1041
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:16,480
feeling because email exactly people

1042
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:19,330
that you built there's been news

1043
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:21,550
printers though I've sat with dev teams

1044
00:42:19,330 --> 00:42:24,430
forging teams and looking good right

1045
00:42:21,550 --> 00:42:26,710
I've done this they're also around me I

1046
00:42:24,430 --> 00:42:29,470
explain what is what risk is how it

1047
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:31,930
worked till inflated faith I'm gonna

1048
00:42:29,470 --> 00:42:34,990
wait a year and they've got a gay group

1049
00:42:31,930 --> 00:42:36,580
all in bed saying you are you know

1050
00:42:34,990 --> 00:42:39,098
because no one wants to see that anymore

1051
00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:42,759
they want to be able to work with yes

1052
00:42:39,099 --> 00:42:43,089
say alright we've done this can you test

1053
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:45,250
it

1054
00:42:43,089 --> 00:42:48,250
yeah I still get it Robin changed it and

1055
00:42:45,250 --> 00:42:49,930
long yeah bit easy be doing this white

1056
00:42:48,250 --> 00:42:52,630
this DM should be doing this approach I

1057
00:42:49,930 --> 00:42:54,368
mean there's pen testers we know how

1058
00:42:52,630 --> 00:42:55,960
we've broken it we need to tell them

1059
00:42:54,369 --> 00:42:58,630
that not just go

1060
00:42:55,960 --> 00:43:00,520
rebound this is being show up because

1061
00:42:58,630 --> 00:43:03,040
it's just my help in anymore and I

1062
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:06,640
really do believe we all get wait

1063
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:09,339
another us Fabio we're gonna ship for

1064
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:11,020
these teams more people to use more and

1065
00:43:09,339 --> 00:43:13,299
help them how much that just turned the

1066
00:43:11,020 --> 00:43:15,460
pots i sat on me a Middlebrook copy all

1067
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:18,430
week smart in the network walking away

1068
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:21,160
and then they get a nasty email on CEO

1069
00:43:18,430 --> 00:43:22,270
saying you pocket by well if you'll

1070
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:25,710
allow me a sinner

1071
00:43:22,270 --> 00:43:29,050
this sort of lengthy comment I think

1072
00:43:25,710 --> 00:43:30,930
from my experience the difference that

1073
00:43:29,050 --> 00:43:35,110
you're highlighting here about

1074
00:43:30,930 --> 00:43:37,330
relationships versus reports necessarily

1075
00:43:35,110 --> 00:43:38,800
is the difference between security

1076
00:43:37,330 --> 00:43:42,160
scanning and pen testing

1077
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:44,170
yeah if you copy and paste the report it

1078
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:45,910
comes out of your scanner and you know

1079
00:43:44,170 --> 00:43:47,620
that that's the bad news that I think

1080
00:43:45,910 --> 00:43:50,170
you're talking about is that I've seen

1081
00:43:47,620 --> 00:43:51,759
you know bullet lists and that is about

1082
00:43:50,170 --> 00:43:53,980
as effective as as you've been

1083
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:56,320
describing but once you actually start

1084
00:43:53,980 --> 00:43:58,600
to integrate your own idea of front

1085
00:43:56,320 --> 00:44:00,850
modelling into that process as a

1086
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:03,250
confessor and be able to communicate not

1087
00:44:00,850 --> 00:44:06,009
just the fact that ability exists but

1088
00:44:03,250 --> 00:44:07,690
this is how it's a story this is how it

1089
00:44:06,010 --> 00:44:09,640
can be exploited and these are the

1090
00:44:07,690 --> 00:44:12,340
assets of the enterprises that are

1091
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:14,350
actually my friend of lucky my favorite

1092
00:44:12,340 --> 00:44:15,910
indicator for my school the security

1093
00:44:14,350 --> 00:44:18,490
assessment scanning assessment things

1094
00:44:15,910 --> 00:44:20,980
but you find that you tell if a sentence

1095
00:44:18,490 --> 00:44:23,350
is like a consultant does not support

1096
00:44:20,980 --> 00:44:25,060
ipv6 you know I think that's kind of

1097
00:44:23,350 --> 00:44:28,690
disability I think just Compass Point

1098
00:44:25,060 --> 00:44:30,190
Blank yeah but you don't well how do you

1099
00:44:28,690 --> 00:44:32,320
deal with this is what can you find was

1100
00:44:30,190 --> 00:44:33,460
press what how do you think it is just

1101
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:34,960
investable that you talks about this

1102
00:44:33,460 --> 00:44:38,530
kind of slight change in pentester

1103
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:41,170
culture and when I first started in

1104
00:44:38,530 --> 00:44:43,060
industry I started up an architect so

1105
00:44:41,170 --> 00:44:45,940
not in the security team I'm so

1106
00:44:43,060 --> 00:44:47,080
interested in security and their company

1107
00:44:45,940 --> 00:44:49,210
that I was working for I had a pen

1108
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:51,310
tester in and I didn't know because I

1109
00:44:49,210 --> 00:44:53,680
saw someone sat quietly with this kind

1110
00:44:51,310 --> 00:44:55,660
of cool like three machines with them

1111
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:57,549
and some puffy is not kind of acquitted

1112
00:44:55,660 --> 00:44:58,930
and anyway they were gonna see it and

1113
00:44:57,550 --> 00:45:02,590
then I remember asking the friend

1114
00:44:58,930 --> 00:45:06,069
industry team like he said it's one of

1115
00:45:02,590 --> 00:45:08,080
other so I kind of went it just sat near

1116
00:45:06,070 --> 00:45:10,240
them it was like hi I'm a grad I'd like

1117
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:11,410
to know what you do and they want to be

1118
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:12,609
really cool and really recipient and

1119
00:45:11,410 --> 00:45:16,540
kind of took me through what they were

1120
00:45:12,610 --> 00:45:18,160
doing but only because I kind of I kind

1121
00:45:16,540 --> 00:45:19,600
of pushed myself into their environment

1122
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:22,240
and was like show me everything I looked

1123
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:25,060
there and and to me that was my first

1124
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:27,790
exposure to pen testers I knew about

1125
00:45:25,060 --> 00:45:31,990
other stories and I liked doing my

1126
00:45:27,790 --> 00:45:34,100
degree with more forensic security and

1127
00:45:31,990 --> 00:45:36,680
specific Rafi was something that was

1128
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:38,060
really interesting to me but this first

1129
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:40,069
time I met pence after it was so

1130
00:45:38,060 --> 00:45:41,720
interesting and I learned so much just

1131
00:45:40,070 --> 00:45:43,340
by sitting in the nest and questions and

1132
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:45,350
plug-in them and probably put their

1133
00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:47,060
report back by a few days what I've

1134
00:45:45,350 --> 00:45:49,880
noticed in a real change over the last

1135
00:45:47,060 --> 00:45:52,190
probably five or six years is it they

1136
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:53,840
have gone from being kind of contractors

1137
00:45:52,190 --> 00:45:55,100
or some songs that come in sitting upon

1138
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:58,120
us there on the network and do their

1139
00:45:55,100 --> 00:46:02,150
work to be an investor teas for me and

1140
00:45:58,120 --> 00:46:04,670
when you do pay for external support for

1141
00:46:02,150 --> 00:46:06,830
pentesting how that success criteria is

1142
00:46:04,670 --> 00:46:09,200
that the engineers understand know the

1143
00:46:06,830 --> 00:46:11,420
vulnerability and often that manifests

1144
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:14,689
itself in is like a wasp top 10 training

1145
00:46:11,420 --> 00:46:17,300
or like really simple how to hack web

1146
00:46:14,690 --> 00:46:19,430
applications through training and I

1147
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:21,620
think that's a really important piece I

1148
00:46:19,430 --> 00:46:22,819
think that you can't just you took up

1149
00:46:21,620 --> 00:46:24,440
engine is actually understanding what

1150
00:46:22,820 --> 00:46:26,300
cross-site scripting is so fun for

1151
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:29,660
overflows or a steep addition whatever

1152
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:32,780
it is you can you can't just give them

1153
00:46:29,660 --> 00:46:34,279
like mitigate this this is at least you

1154
00:46:32,780 --> 00:46:36,590
have to teach them how to create an

1155
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:39,290
attack one of the most effective things

1156
00:46:36,590 --> 00:46:42,920
that I actually read for my company is I

1157
00:46:39,290 --> 00:46:46,040
did a very simplified CTF with really

1158
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:49,040
awesome prizes for the MU years and no

1159
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:51,650
not not the complicated stuff but

1160
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:54,230
actually just something builds

1161
00:46:51,650 --> 00:46:58,910
confidence in the fact that these

1162
00:46:54,230 --> 00:47:01,490
attacks are really accessible and and

1163
00:46:58,910 --> 00:47:03,649
very visceral I'm like I think that's my

1164
00:47:01,490 --> 00:47:06,620
biggest piece of advice is that the more

1165
00:47:03,650 --> 00:47:08,810
you can make it real to the people that

1166
00:47:06,620 --> 00:47:10,580
you are serving in the security capacity

1167
00:47:08,810 --> 00:47:13,330
yeah-ah the better results you're they

1168
00:47:10,580 --> 00:47:15,920
have so we don't spook one where we

1169
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:18,560
repentance they make sure they made

1170
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:21,950
web-based game so food grows played

1171
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:24,320
games and we've been assessment without

1172
00:47:21,950 --> 00:47:26,720
six months we've seen insight issues of

1173
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:28,610
course different you know areas of what

1174
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:30,830
they wanted touched it but we just love

1175
00:47:28,610 --> 00:47:33,110
this this isn't helping brutal six

1176
00:47:30,830 --> 00:47:35,390
wolves were pen test is just not getting

1177
00:47:33,110 --> 00:47:38,150
across so instead of doing the next pen

1178
00:47:35,390 --> 00:47:41,240
test what we run the two-day web app

1179
00:47:38,150 --> 00:47:43,220
packing cause we taught them all of the

1180
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:45,259
stuff that we're binding we taught them

1181
00:47:43,220 --> 00:47:47,689
absolute itself today I met

1182
00:47:45,260 --> 00:47:50,350
they have constant scrutiny gestural

1183
00:47:47,690 --> 00:47:52,670
injection of a pyro file along counsel

1184
00:47:50,350 --> 00:47:55,400
after that when we went back to the

1185
00:47:52,670 --> 00:47:58,970
dentist who imparted mobile and they've

1186
00:47:55,400 --> 00:48:01,400
done that no I've gotta shave that and

1187
00:47:58,970 --> 00:48:03,290
it was something myself understanding

1188
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:06,620
that security principle and it does

1189
00:48:03,290 --> 00:48:08,720
always go back to their sense of humor

1190
00:48:06,620 --> 00:48:12,170
there's no aptitude securely are they

1191
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:13,730
just copy-paste there is a chain so a

1192
00:48:12,170 --> 00:48:15,200
friend of mine has a great story about

1193
00:48:13,730 --> 00:48:18,590
someone giving a sitting next to him on

1194
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:21,259
the pen test and so like I might put

1195
00:48:18,590 --> 00:48:23,930
your day I mean my I was like yeah sure

1196
00:48:21,260 --> 00:48:25,610
sit down so sits down my opens a busy

1197
00:48:23,930 --> 00:48:27,169
now to get scoping document I'm always

1198
00:48:25,610 --> 00:48:31,570
doing is double clicking on outlook

1199
00:48:27,170 --> 00:48:31,570
double clicking on a link this guy gives

1200
00:48:31,660 --> 00:48:36,649
sort of the lights would dim mirror like

1201
00:48:34,460 --> 00:48:39,200
you change the hoodie would about the

1202
00:48:36,650 --> 00:48:41,150
hockey commences but like you know I

1203
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:43,430
think there's there's educating people

1204
00:48:41,150 --> 00:48:45,380
I've done the similar thing where we run

1205
00:48:43,430 --> 00:48:48,109
into an impasse so it's like sorry guys

1206
00:48:45,380 --> 00:48:50,210
like I you know you block scripts other

1207
00:48:48,110 --> 00:48:52,580
one the scripts of that to works you

1208
00:48:50,210 --> 00:48:55,820
plot that just about three we can keep

1209
00:48:52,580 --> 00:48:58,400
doing this or you come in rather than

1210
00:48:55,820 --> 00:49:00,760
people the pen test come in will do

1211
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:03,860
either some training or do some

1212
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:06,050
demonstrations and hunt outs where they

1213
00:49:03,860 --> 00:49:08,390
can almost interactive so it's a bit of

1214
00:49:06,050 --> 00:49:10,040
a shadow copy of your production

1215
00:49:08,390 --> 00:49:12,350
environments which has this fund ability

1216
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:14,210
and I checked it but these things in his

1217
00:49:12,350 --> 00:49:16,670
how it works isn't it doing a night in

1218
00:49:14,210 --> 00:49:18,020
the process almost they've got that says

1219
00:49:16,670 --> 00:49:19,760
that there's a couple of slides that's

1220
00:49:18,020 --> 00:49:22,520
usually I've got pizza then there's like

1221
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:24,560
some bunch last serve so that it becomes

1222
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:26,840
a kind of a like this if I got like an

1223
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:28,660
event in house which makes it slightly

1224
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:31,790
special I've been giving it a place

1225
00:49:28,660 --> 00:49:33,830
really mean don't have to be a fantastic

1226
00:49:31,790 --> 00:49:35,960
to do this either so I would not

1227
00:49:33,830 --> 00:49:38,720
consider myself a fan texture or a bread

1228
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:41,330
Timur and I like to think I know how to

1229
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:43,970
break in a sack but like I am NOT this

1230
00:49:41,330 --> 00:49:45,140
level but when it comes to kind of be

1231
00:49:43,970 --> 00:49:46,700
stopped modeling in the blue team and

1232
00:49:45,140 --> 00:49:48,230
turn against attack I think this stuff's

1233
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:51,049
really interesting demos I talked about

1234
00:49:48,230 --> 00:49:52,310
the conference subdomain educating me

1235
00:49:51,050 --> 00:49:53,660
realize we weren't from the war a lot

1236
00:49:52,310 --> 00:49:54,799
people asked what it was and I thought

1237
00:49:53,660 --> 00:49:57,270
it'd be a good opportunity to talk about

1238
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:58,920
DNS know I'm really sick you like

1239
00:49:57,270 --> 00:50:00,720
about DNS to learning about the inner

1240
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:02,310
side days but it was a good opportunity

1241
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:04,290
demo it and for me it was you can

1242
00:50:02,310 --> 00:50:06,720
opportunity to kind of up my skill level

1243
00:50:04,290 --> 00:50:09,509
in that kind of presentation and put it

1244
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:10,950
together like a hat and put it our

1245
00:50:09,510 --> 00:50:12,480
engineers learned a lot from it and I

1246
00:50:10,950 --> 00:50:14,339
think they learned a lot from it coming

1247
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:16,560
parameter that security if you're in

1248
00:50:14,340 --> 00:50:18,390
monitoring and whether you're stuck

1249
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:20,220
those types of areas being able to

1250
00:50:18,390 --> 00:50:22,589
demonstrate to someone hey this is what

1251
00:50:20,220 --> 00:50:24,270
I see when this happens or even better

1252
00:50:22,590 --> 00:50:26,820
this is what I don't see because no

1253
00:50:24,270 --> 00:50:29,400
one's capturing loans that speaks

1254
00:50:26,820 --> 00:50:31,950
volumes to minute even any a mystery or

1255
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:33,330
in being able to demo and teach people

1256
00:50:31,950 --> 00:50:35,279
kind of what it looks like when you're

1257
00:50:33,330 --> 00:50:46,710
protected is really powerful

1258
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:48,810
alright any other questions yeah the ten

1259
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:52,020
questioners do you think the ability of

1260
00:50:48,810 --> 00:50:55,529
a decent developer negates the requiring

1261
00:50:52,020 --> 00:50:57,720
and requirement or Ventus okay yes all

1262
00:50:55,530 --> 00:50:59,820
right jumped in um I think it depends on

1263
00:50:57,720 --> 00:51:01,980
your risk appetite and also destined

1264
00:50:59,820 --> 00:51:05,010
regulatory pieces if some compliance

1265
00:51:01,980 --> 00:51:09,210
pieces might require a pen tests or some

1266
00:51:05,010 --> 00:51:11,810
form of yeah PGX great and I'm gonna

1267
00:51:09,210 --> 00:51:16,290
take a stronger stance and say no

1268
00:51:11,810 --> 00:51:19,080
primarily because I have a lot of

1269
00:51:16,290 --> 00:51:21,779
experience with data and some analytic

1270
00:51:19,080 --> 00:51:25,350
data that tells me the same eyes on the

1271
00:51:21,780 --> 00:51:28,350
same code over a period of time will

1272
00:51:25,350 --> 00:51:30,900
give you a blind spot um so I think

1273
00:51:28,350 --> 00:51:35,640
fresh eyes from outside is a very

1274
00:51:30,900 --> 00:51:37,950
important concept I also I agree also be

1275
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:39,810
expanding the sentence I think that

1276
00:51:37,950 --> 00:51:42,330
there should be more materials available

1277
00:51:39,810 --> 00:51:45,150
so that you get more security or plan to

1278
00:51:42,330 --> 00:51:47,850
benefits that are accessible so that we

1279
00:51:45,150 --> 00:51:50,190
don't find the low-hanging fruit like

1280
00:51:47,850 --> 00:51:53,069
next year this call I'm hoping to hop on

1281
00:51:50,190 --> 00:51:55,080
paper fake a desk or objection is it

1282
00:51:53,070 --> 00:51:57,120
disclosed discovered in 1998 with these

1283
00:51:55,080 --> 00:51:58,220
well American toys Christmas Eve it's

1284
00:51:57,120 --> 00:52:02,150
just a

1285
00:51:58,220 --> 00:52:04,730
in 1998 in fire hoses right like so it's

1286
00:52:02,150 --> 00:52:06,500
21 next year I'm gonna get a cake eating

1287
00:52:04,730 --> 00:52:08,600
the key he's 20 Walters what you do

1288
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:10,790
right like seriously we've had a slow

1289
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:14,330
injection and it's a trivial probability

1290
00:52:10,790 --> 00:52:17,300
because the mitigation was in the

1291
00:52:14,330 --> 00:52:22,009
original paper the moment I can not be

1292
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:25,490
able to use MSR 67 I'm very pleased not

1293
00:52:22,010 --> 00:52:28,160
Amazon to know why okay the orange is

1294
00:52:25,490 --> 00:52:33,410
eternally blue any other questions

1295
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:35,359
okay let's as a summary just remind you

1296
00:52:33,410 --> 00:52:38,390
know I'll give you a moment so you can

1297
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:40,850
put this together from the red team and

1298
00:52:38,390 --> 00:52:42,710
the blue team perspective one piece of

1299
00:52:40,850 --> 00:52:44,060
advice would take away that you want to

1300
00:52:42,710 --> 00:52:47,060
make sure everybody has about this

1301
00:52:44,060 --> 00:52:49,940
threat process as well as remind

1302
00:52:47,060 --> 00:52:53,480
everybody social media following

1303
00:52:49,940 --> 00:52:55,070
everything so again I'm lens I'll my

1304
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:56,420
takeaway that I'd like everybody to

1305
00:52:55,070 --> 00:52:58,520
think about is really just building

1306
00:52:56,420 --> 00:53:01,370
rapport between the different parts of

1307
00:52:58,520 --> 00:53:04,190
the organization literally coming down

1308
00:53:01,370 --> 00:53:05,960
to the social ability to just go have a

1309
00:53:04,190 --> 00:53:08,360
pizza go out here or somebody and talk

1310
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:11,780
about what their experiences will I

1311
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:16,100
suffer a lot of those things my point of

1312
00:53:11,780 --> 00:53:18,110
view on map logical the other thing that

1313
00:53:16,100 --> 00:53:21,230
I would say if I could this was put into

1314
00:53:18,110 --> 00:53:22,730
every company's an is don't be afraid of

1315
00:53:21,230 --> 00:53:23,480
me security I think if you take a

1316
00:53:22,730 --> 00:53:25,370
fishing boat

1317
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:27,260
there's nothing worse and my point of

1318
00:53:25,370 --> 00:53:28,880
view where I have a thing I want to help

1319
00:53:27,260 --> 00:53:32,390
you I want to disclose it responsibly

1320
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:35,570
and I can't get an answer you know like

1321
00:53:32,390 --> 00:53:37,310
here's a thing you companies had good

1322
00:53:35,570 --> 00:53:38,900
ways and these are excellent ways of

1323
00:53:37,310 --> 00:53:41,900
doing it to be able to take care of the

1324
00:53:38,900 --> 00:53:44,810
shape of it things automatically stop so

1325
00:53:41,900 --> 00:53:48,590
I think that's what I'm going to say am

1326
00:53:44,810 --> 00:53:51,259
- attached a nice antor debt and be a

1327
00:53:48,590 --> 00:53:54,110
contributor so if you're a three person

1328
00:53:51,260 --> 00:53:55,970
contribution on Street projects open

1329
00:53:54,110 --> 00:53:59,210
source projects whether that's raise

1330
00:53:55,970 --> 00:54:00,950
issues or pies do it find projects that

1331
00:53:59,210 --> 00:54:03,170
you know your teams use or that you're

1332
00:54:00,950 --> 00:54:05,089
interested in you might not feel

1333
00:54:03,170 --> 00:54:06,950
confident or comfortable contrary to

1334
00:54:05,090 --> 00:54:08,660
their source code raise issues spot

1335
00:54:06,950 --> 00:54:10,879
things run static analysis

1336
00:54:08,660 --> 00:54:13,368
against it help those out help it seems

1337
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:14,990
out and then in contrast encourage your

1338
00:54:13,369 --> 00:54:17,299
software engineers to contribute to OS

1339
00:54:14,990 --> 00:54:18,919
projects so that open web applications

1340
00:54:17,299 --> 00:54:20,809
through project there's a slacker invite

1341
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:22,819
you to you want where we discuss all the

1342
00:54:20,809 --> 00:54:25,099
things or the dreams and hopes you have

1343
00:54:22,819 --> 00:54:28,700
role in various projects because I'm

1344
00:54:25,099 --> 00:54:30,440
wikis terribly update and there are so

1345
00:54:28,700 --> 00:54:32,058
many things that we'd love to do but I'm

1346
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:34,579
so conscious that it's from a security

1347
00:54:32,059 --> 00:54:36,200
perspective and these are not tools just

1348
00:54:34,579 --> 00:54:39,020
this poutines easy tools for engineers

1349
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:40,189
and we need conscience from Street and

1350
00:54:39,020 --> 00:54:41,630
from engineering team so I would

1351
00:54:40,190 --> 00:54:44,119
encourage you to grow and contribute to

1352
00:54:41,630 --> 00:54:45,650
these projects right well thank you for

1353
00:54:44,119 --> 00:54:47,420
listening to our Randall and we're going

1354
00:54:45,650 --> 00:54:48,040
to be around there as the capital you

1355
00:54:47,420 --> 00:54:51,280
know

1356
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:51,279
