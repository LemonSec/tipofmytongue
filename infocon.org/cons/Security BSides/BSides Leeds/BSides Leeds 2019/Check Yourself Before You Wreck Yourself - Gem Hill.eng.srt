1
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:08,670
so hi my name is Joe not before I am

2
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:10,410
lets off my desk I work for BBC but I

3
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:11,580
did move the time one of my commuters

4
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:13,740
things is talking about mental health

5
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:18,780
I'm feeling his favorite thing to talk

6
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:21,450
about so like my Twitter handle I don't

7
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:24,090
score health I don't think I say is on

8
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:25,860
the speaker notes for the slides there

9
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:27,509
is a link on the last slide to the

10
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:29,160
speaker notes so if I talk too quickly

11
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:33,870
you miss that link or you want to look

12
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:35,070
at me afterwards look there also I'm not

13
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:36,930
going to talk about anything massively

14
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:38,550
like massively in detail value my

15
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:40,440
symptoms so there should be any trigger

16
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:42,059
warnings needed but if you do punch

17
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:43,260
stuff more please feel free to leave

18
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:46,110
similarly you need to go to the loo

19
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:49,019
pretty don't do that because everything

20
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:53,460
comes miss I think of their me saying it

21
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:57,809
in a slightly less eloquent way in the

22
00:00:53,460 --> 00:01:00,870
speaker notes so what I'm going to talk

23
00:00:57,809 --> 00:01:03,480
about today specifically in two sections

24
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:05,009
there is section about how I look after

25
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:07,149
my mental health how I check in with

26
00:01:05,009 --> 00:01:10,960
myself

27
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:12,580
and then there is section on how to have

28
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:15,190
those conversations of how to code went

29
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:17,080
along home sewer goes I'm having trouble

30
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:19,830
because everyone wants to be helpful to

31
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:22,060
people who are having troubles with

32
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:23,200
health right but those conversations are

33
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:24,400
also quite hard to have and they're

34
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,320
quite hard to feel like you're having

35
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,210
them in a way that is helpful and

36
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,229
corrected not really really awkward as

37
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:31,059
the one who has had those conversations

38
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:32,560
from both sides of the table I've got

39
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:33,880
some tips that's why I can share those

40
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,220
with you as well so hopefully you're

41
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:37,360
come out of this talk with some ideas or

42
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:39,760
maybe how to check in with your mental

43
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:41,440
health along regardless if you're

44
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:43,090
suffering with mental illness or not and

45
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,780
how to have some conversations about

46
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:45,490
that

47
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:46,900
because we all have mental ill-health

48
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:49,449
you may not all have

49
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:51,940
diagnosable mental illness but we all go

50
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:54,160
through periods of feeling of mental ill

51
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:57,640
health stress losing something or

52
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:58,990
someone when you're physically ill you

53
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:00,280
can get a lot more anxious about that

54
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:03,630
kind of things and that can lead to

55
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:05,350
mental health there may be short

56
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:08,350
situational it's called situational

57
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:09,699
mental ill-health where an external or a

58
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:11,500
different situation is causing mental

59
00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:13,570
health but we'll all go through that so

60
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:14,950
these tips are useful to have regardless

61
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:17,109
of your experience with mental

62
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:18,458
ill-health because we will all go so it

63
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:20,170
doesn't point in our life like

64
00:02:18,459 --> 00:02:22,030
unfortunately we'll keep it in the faces

65
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:23,760
okay so can you hear me in the back I'm

66
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:34,290
not a load of hoping I'll be all good

67
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:39,519
thanks I just shout out is it this thing

68
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:41,079
okay tomorrow I won't do wandering then

69
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:42,640
I'll try and stay here I'm a bit of a

70
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:50,769
wanderer but I'll try and stay around

71
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:58,208
here then no perfect okay it works on

72
00:02:50,769 --> 00:03:01,019
here but not on there anything know what

73
00:02:58,209 --> 00:03:01,019
I'm just gonna just gonna

74
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:04,300
[Music]

75
00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:10,650
so it's working on here but then if I

76
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:10,650
put that as it there

77
00:03:12,849 --> 00:03:22,160
now it's working at me who knows

78
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:23,269
cool so my mental health status

79
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:26,150
sorry I'll stay here my mental health

80
00:03:23,269 --> 00:03:28,489
status is that I suffer from generalized

81
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:32,060
anxiety disorder a very mild case of

82
00:03:28,489 --> 00:03:33,650
complex PTSD i medicated on what i've

83
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:37,099
been on meds for about seven years and i

84
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:39,530
am in therapy so i am very familiar with

85
00:03:37,099 --> 00:03:41,540
the mental health system and dealing

86
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:43,849
with that kind of stuff I'm very open

87
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:45,410
about this stuff because the more I talk

88
00:03:43,849 --> 00:03:47,599
about it the less weird it is to talk

89
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:49,370
about it's less scary for me because the

90
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:51,768
more I say things and then people aren't

91
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:52,910
worried about it the less scary is to

92
00:03:51,769 --> 00:03:54,530
talk about things which means it's less

93
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:56,269
because I suffer from anxiety everything

94
00:03:54,530 --> 00:04:00,140
is scary if I can make things less scary

95
00:03:56,269 --> 00:04:02,150
brilliant there are always people who

96
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:03,349
feel who appreciate me talking about it

97
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:04,670
is always someone who comes to me ghosts

98
00:04:03,349 --> 00:04:06,560
thank you for talking about it there was

99
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:08,629
someone at my old work at my work I work

100
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,190
for BBC who came to me and said that she

101
00:04:08,629 --> 00:04:11,750
because I've seen you tested her she

102
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:13,040
applied for a senior test a role after

103
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:14,060
hearing me talk about my mental health

104
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,500
issues because she owns herself with

105
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:17,539
some ental health issues I thought well

106
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:19,160
if she can do it maybe I can do it as

107
00:04:17,539 --> 00:04:22,070
well so it doesn't make a massive

108
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:24,410
difference the reason I know so much

109
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:27,830
about self-care is that I've had to pull

110
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:30,380
myself up off the ground and figure this

111
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:32,030
stuff out myself if I can help one other

112
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:33,200
person to have this definite talk it's

113
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:33,530
so they don't have to learn it the hard

114
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,360
way

115
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:37,369
then it makes it kind of all worth it

116
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:39,020
there was something doesn't get out of

117
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:41,120
the struggles i went through trying to

118
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:46,940
get diagnosed so that's kind of why I'm

119
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:48,520
here talking about this stuff this is

120
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:51,620
just going to be a thing that happens

121
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:57,590
but I can't change this to the next

122
00:04:51,620 --> 00:05:01,639
slide there we go so the biggest thing I

123
00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:03,619
wanna talk about today is being aware of

124
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:04,760
your feelings and emotions which is a

125
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:06,260
really great thing to say because I'm

126
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:07,909
people are generally aware of what

127
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:09,740
they're feeling right but I wonder how

128
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:13,729
much we engage with those feelings in a

129
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:15,889
really like entirely rounded way I

130
00:05:13,729 --> 00:05:17,180
didn't I started doing therapy I did two

131
00:05:15,889 --> 00:05:18,860
cognitive behavioral therapy which is

132
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:20,210
where you look at the feelings you're

133
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:22,190
having are you trying to find evidence

134
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:23,270
for those feelings no that's against

135
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:24,650
those feelings it's a good way of

136
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:26,810
dealing with anxiety

137
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:28,400
because it's you have a front of you

138
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:30,350
that your brain is lying to you when

139
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,280
it's anxious about things which anxiety

140
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:35,139
is a lot of the time it's your brain

141
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:37,008
lying to you about things going wrong

142
00:05:35,139 --> 00:05:38,690
I'm not saying you have to be constantly

143
00:05:37,009 --> 00:05:41,840
navel-gazing because who has the time

144
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:43,100
for that right no one but I like right I

145
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:45,590
like picking out what's triggering

146
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:47,150
strong emotions good and bad I keep the

147
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:47,960
cry to journal so I'm great so I write

148
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:49,520
down one thing every day that I'm

149
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:51,080
grateful for so as a reminder of the

150
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:53,090
good things in my life leave our

151
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:54,590
particularly strong negative emotion as

152
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:56,659
well I try to figure out why why that's

153
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:58,130
gone from what's triggering it just

154
00:05:56,660 --> 00:06:00,979
because there's useful information to

155
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:02,389
have knowing your own mind is quite

156
00:06:00,979 --> 00:06:04,340
useful in knowing why you have feelings

157
00:06:02,389 --> 00:06:05,360
is quite useful to have whether it's

158
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:06,560
something that you can avoid in the

159
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,160
future away something that you need to

160
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,440
work on

161
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:11,750
they're both it's always worth having

162
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:13,430
even if you do nothing it's still

163
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:17,539
information information by itself is not

164
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:21,710
necessarily a bad thing it is a lot of

165
00:06:17,539 --> 00:06:25,669
work it can be a lot of work on the on

166
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:27,258
the slide for this there is a PDF of a

167
00:06:25,669 --> 00:06:28,669
cognitive behavior worksheet where you

168
00:06:27,259 --> 00:06:30,229
write down your feelings openness before

169
00:06:28,669 --> 00:06:32,448
evidence against and you can rate how

170
00:06:30,229 --> 00:06:33,800
strong those feelings are if you want to

171
00:06:32,449 --> 00:06:35,599
give that a go you can it's not helpful

172
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:37,099
to everyone absolutely not but it is to

173
00:06:35,599 --> 00:06:38,870
me because this thing that mental health

174
00:06:37,099 --> 00:06:40,219
as well what's helpful to me might not

175
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:42,680
be helpful to everyone else because it's

176
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:44,270
entirely unique so I'm just giving you

177
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:45,889
what helps me and hoping that you are

178
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:47,090
they find something useful or it kind of

179
00:06:45,889 --> 00:06:48,830
inspires you to think about this stuff

180
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:50,690
because it might not work for you that

181
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:53,180
you might look at this stuff and go no

182
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:54,710
that's fine it's so I think is so unique

183
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:56,000
that all we can do is talk about our own

184
00:06:54,710 --> 00:07:00,229
experiences and hope that something

185
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,880
connect somewhere hmm there's a book

186
00:07:00,229 --> 00:07:02,840
called Crucial Conversations tools for

187
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:04,460
talking when the stakes are high

188
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:06,409
dick no one's heard of that book that

189
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:09,198
book is really good for thinking about

190
00:07:06,409 --> 00:07:11,090
how you how the feelings that you feel

191
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:12,289
in the moment that's actually a really

192
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:13,520
good book is they saying that things

193
00:07:12,289 --> 00:07:15,020
like managers talking how hard

194
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,310
conversations with staff but it's

195
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:18,169
actually really good for communication

196
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:19,490
across the board the examples are a bit

197
00:07:18,169 --> 00:07:22,430
heteronormative it's always Bill and his

198
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:25,990
wife Emily but other than that genuinely

199
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:30,470
quite a good book I highly recommend him

200
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:31,280
so the first thing I do is I write all

201
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:33,590
the time

202
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,580
I am constantly writing things unless I

203
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:34,940
really try to get my mouse over this

204
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:38,599
side

205
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:40,010
I find of mine what said that the

206
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:42,290
writing is the cheapest form the therapy

207
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:43,700
you can get because all therapies is

208
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:44,780
talking about your fitting interrogating

209
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:46,310
your feelings and the reason I

210
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:48,140
particularly like writing is because you

211
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:49,880
can write you can't write as fast as you

212
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:51,590
can think when you're stuck in a

213
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:53,900
stressful situation or actual situation

214
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:56,210
and your mind is going at like 50 miles

215
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:57,799
an hour writing things out it's a way

216
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:59,989
you get it to slow down because you can

217
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:02,600
only keep up with your hand when I take

218
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:03,740
your writing I write by hand with a pen

219
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:05,840
and paper because that's what feels good

220
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:07,640
to me you don't have to you can type it

221
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:09,320
out you can talk it you can record

222
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:11,570
yourself talking it out you can do

223
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:14,170
sketch notes and mind maps whatever you

224
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:17,330
want to do what I find helpful is

225
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:19,490
getting my thoughts out in a way that I

226
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:21,409
can review them back because reviewing

227
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:23,450
the back often leads to revelations

228
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:25,370
about that things right so that is my

229
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:26,840
that's why I say writing I mean right

230
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:28,340
get your thoughts out in a way where you

231
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:30,349
can review them at a later date and

232
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:33,880
they're concrete and it is slower than

233
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:36,020
your thoughts so for me that is writing

234
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:36,979
again you might not be able to do

235
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:39,049
anything with those feelings with all

236
00:08:36,979 --> 00:08:40,370
those that information it's having that

237
00:08:39,049 --> 00:08:54,880
information and being aware of things

238
00:08:40,370 --> 00:09:00,830
that for me really helps no no that way

239
00:08:54,880 --> 00:09:04,160
right we really mean to ourselves as a

240
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:05,360
species right but all the time we really

241
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,500
mean to ourselves how often have we

242
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,120
stayed awake thinking of things that

243
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:11,090
like interruptions is that the other

244
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:12,740
person does not remember when the waiter

245
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:15,590
said enjoy your meal in you went thanks

246
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:17,510
you two that kind of stuff that keeps

247
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:18,800
you those interactions that person is

248
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:20,710
not gonna remember but you remember and

249
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:23,000
you'll remember at 3 in the morning

250
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:26,750
we're really mean to ourselves all the

251
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:28,820
time the reason I write I write

252
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:29,960
something thankful for every day is to

253
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:32,390
remind myself that there are good things

254
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:34,160
in my life and I don't know I don't know

255
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:35,660
unique you think every day so I was

256
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,219
right what I'm great before even if I

257
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:38,540
mean great for it before because that

258
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:40,760
means I've got something in my life that

259
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:41,360
stays in my life a constant that makes

260
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:43,040
me happy

261
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,930
whether it be friends whether we someone

262
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:47,660
to work is a constant that makes me

263
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:51,680
grateful for my life and I've done that

264
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:52,459
for year and a half nerve and I found it

265
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:56,030
really powerful

266
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:57,740
again it might not work for you but my

267
00:09:56,030 --> 00:10:00,620
main message here is give yourself a bit

268
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:01,940
of a break maybe and remind yourself II

269
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:03,110
could I can't my save you up to date all

270
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:04,610
the time not some constant looking for

271
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:05,960
work but because one it said it's all

272
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:07,310
for updating your CV when you are

273
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:09,500
looking for a job right it is one of the

274
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:09,890
worst things in the world and two I have

275
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,120
a list

276
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:12,740
Ami's I have a list of achievements that

277
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:15,800
I have done at work that I can look back

278
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:18,380
on ago maybe I can do my job maybe I'm

279
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:20,209
not the worst and it sounds so

280
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:21,710
ridiculous and so simple but for me it

281
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:23,330
is ridiculously powerful to have a black

282
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:26,360
and white record of things that make me

283
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:27,770
feel good that I can be proud of because

284
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:29,540
it's not sleeping mean to myself I have

285
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:31,310
to be kind to myself and that's really

286
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:32,540
hard by find if I'm kind to myself I

287
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:36,949
find it a lot easier to be kind to

288
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:38,689
others and being in a tech company of

289
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:40,520
being in a tech environment empathy to

290
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:42,350
our users to other people is massive it

291
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:44,090
is so important and this to me is a

292
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:45,470
really easy way of doing it cuz I've got

293
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:57,740
to be nice to myself so I'm gonna be

294
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:59,390
nice to other people so I'm going to

295
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:01,070
talk about self-care now like

296
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:05,390
traditional self-care what we think of

297
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:07,220
over here self-care so South care isn't

298
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:09,500
always meditation and or baths and

299
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:11,420
yogurt can be all of those things I am

300
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:15,080
NOT crapping on bubble bath meditation

301
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:16,209
and yoga but there is so much more to

302
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:20,060
self-care

303
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:21,500
sometimes it is that I let people take

304
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:22,510
my turn up first it's one my favorite

305
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:25,430
tweets in the lot

306
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:27,080
it's on tumblr but you know there are

307
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:29,300
levels of self-care

308
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:30,980
on the most basic stuff to the more

309
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:33,770
complex stuff and I'm gonna go talk all

310
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:35,150
of them as one how are you self-care and

311
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:44,030
what I can do what I can't do as a

312
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:51,230
barometer but how well I'm doing some no

313
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:52,459
come on your basic self-care brushing

314
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:54,980
your teeth in the morning in the evening

315
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:56,570
showering Greg Dulli feeding yourself

316
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:58,310
something that isn't just McDonald's

317
00:11:56,570 --> 00:12:01,690
night after night after night or your

318
00:11:58,310 --> 00:12:04,219
mum's really nice I don't know ever

319
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:06,260
making yourself presentable to yourself

320
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:08,060
and to other humans when I'm feeling

321
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:10,280
really bad brushing my teeth is the

322
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:11,839
first thing to go my teeth are awful

323
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:13,069
because I didn't brush them for a while

324
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:15,650
because I was too busy struggling with

325
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:17,600
everything else that is my warning sign

326
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:20,449
that is pound the alarm I need to do

327
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:23,240
some work on myself for me it tends to

328
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:24,770
be that or showering or wearing clean

329
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:26,210
clothes for pee for a lot of people that

330
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:28,310
I speak to it tends to be that kind of

331
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:30,320
really basic I don't deserve to be nice

332
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:31,640
and clean because you feel quite nice

333
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,920
after a shower don't you and putting

334
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:35,030
clean clothes on you feel good and deep

335
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:38,780
down you don't feel like you deserve

336
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:41,449
that so you don't do it I thought I said

337
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:43,370
that is my big warning sign making

338
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:48,350
myself fit for human consumption as I

339
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:50,540
call it then he bought your other stuff

340
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:52,190
which is harder also it's harder to do

341
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:55,010
and harder to notice when it's slipping

342
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:58,280
I find reaching out to people going hi

343
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:59,330
how are you why don't we just I must say

344
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:00,770
reaching out to people I don't mean I'm

345
00:12:59,330 --> 00:13:02,240
having a hard time I mean literally

346
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:04,730
talking into people that you enjoy

347
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:07,010
talking to that kind of sleeping that

348
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:08,480
kind of slowly coming back into yourself

349
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:10,580
a little bit because I think's a little

350
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,630
bit too hard that's really important I

351
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:13,100
can be really important I think it's

352
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:15,110
really important people to do but it's

353
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:17,690
really hard when you're struggling to do

354
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:19,340
it keeping physically active doing

355
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:20,720
something cozen staying in bed or going

356
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:21,830
from the bed to the sofa and staying on

357
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:25,610
the sofa than going back to the bed

358
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:28,220
again that stuff again mmm it's really

359
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:29,330
hard to for me that's another that these

360
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:30,650
are all like warning signs when I'm not

361
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:33,290
doing these things I love going to the

362
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:34,610
gym I'm one of those people so I don't

363
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:37,069
wanna go to the gym that's the way for

364
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:38,750
warning sign being mindful

365
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:41,600
there's nothing meditation it can just

366
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:43,700
be going for a walk without music doing

367
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,410
not scrolling through your phone and

368
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:49,040
constantly which is the thing that I do

369
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:51,949
a lot I pickup crafts and I do a fair

370
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:53,060
amount of crafts and I pick them up just

371
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:54,140
so I'm not stalling through my phone

372
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:55,430
constantly cuz I will just sit on the

373
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:56,540
sofa I'll put my laptop down and then

374
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:59,870
pick up my phone and just pick up where

375
00:13:56,540 --> 00:14:01,849
I left off on Twitter so doing something

376
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:04,910
that isn't just mindless refreshing of a

377
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:06,350
page doing something playful there is a

378
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:09,350
whole book that again there's a link to

379
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:11,690
it in the side notes beside it's about

380
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:13,850
the importance of play in adult life in

381
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:15,230
work life as well as in personal life

382
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:18,050
it's a fantastic looks like 200 pages

383
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:21,140
very quick read and it talks about how

384
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:23,540
as children we learn social rules

385
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:25,550
through play and then as adults we kind

386
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:28,699
of learn we kind of stop playing so we

387
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:30,050
stop learning and sorry I'm sorry

388
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:31,010
so play is a safe way of learning about

389
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:33,140
social wars and how to navigate

390
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:35,090
situations like playing board games like

391
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:36,140
playing Monopoly which is the worst ball

392
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:37,670
game therefore what is one that we

393
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:39,740
probably most of us have played right

394
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:40,990
that thing of like when do I buy

395
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:42,980
something when do or not buy something

396
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:44,960
losing all that money all that kind of

397
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:46,760
stuff it's a safe way of navigating the

398
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:48,850
unknown and taking risks right you learn

399
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:51,230
this stuff through playing board games

400
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:52,910
and then we don't do anymore when we're

401
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:55,220
adults well some of us don't I do but

402
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:56,990
you know what I mean like we are told to

403
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:57,950
not play anymore cuz that's not an adult

404
00:14:56,990 --> 00:14:59,060
thing to do and actually is really

405
00:14:57,950 --> 00:15:00,710
important reconnecting with that

406
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:01,939
actually can be really fun and really

407
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:03,860
important my life has been so much

408
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:06,290
better since I all good side organizing

409
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:08,030
a month the games night in a pub because

410
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:09,349
I played one I'm talking to my friends

411
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:10,939
and I'm playing games but also I am

412
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:13,820
playing a game and it is fun and I do

413
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:15,020
not have to think about work I can swear

414
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:16,310
with the people I love the most because

415
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:19,819
they've just screwed me over in this

416
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:22,939
game in fact one of my friends also

417
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:24,590
suffers quite badly and again it is a

418
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:26,060
safe place to work for us to swear each

419
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:27,620
other and get it all out because we both

420
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:28,849
know we're both already competitive but

421
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:31,280
we both know it doesn't mean anything

422
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:32,720
it's a safest place doesn't have to be

423
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:35,120
ball games that's just what I do but

424
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,350
something that's fun make your life fun

425
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,000
because Christ you've only got one of

426
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:45,830
them I'm sorry - makes me real

427
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:49,180
existential as well so I've got into it

428
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:56,900
now I know when you do that then that

429
00:15:49,180 --> 00:16:00,290
then come over here Oh max why I have a

430
00:15:56,900 --> 00:16:02,480
thought about mindfulness and my formal

431
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:04,670
occasion I like mindful meditation on

432
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:07,880
the sides there are some as Dropbox link

433
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:09,530
stew some mp3s and some PDFs about

434
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:13,760
Michael meditation if you want to give

435
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:15,170
it a go but it doesn't help everyone in

436
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:17,240
fact for some people it makes them worse

437
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:18,829
like there are some conditions and some

438
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:20,270
ways that people think we're but because

439
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:21,860
my for meditation if you've not done it

440
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:23,810
you do something called a body scan and

441
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:25,280
so you think very specifically about

442
00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:26,160
different parts of your body and move up

443
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:29,010
or down your body

444
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:30,240
I find it really relaxing like I can do

445
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:33,720
it and just drop off to sleep halfway

446
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:37,260
through however for some people it makes

447
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:38,610
anxiety worse it's not gonna help in a

448
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:40,140
crisis so the reason I have a bit of

449
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:41,490
beef with a microphone affectation it's

450
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:44,220
because of the way the NHS has been

451
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:47,340
cooked and all the funding has been cut

452
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:48,720
at one point people ringing one on one

453
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:51,450
in crisis and we're being told to do

454
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:53,370
mindfulness meditation it's like no I

455
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:56,610
need something a bit more intense than

456
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:58,410
that really so it's it's seen as a

457
00:16:56,610 --> 00:16:59,610
band-aid quite a bit and also there are

458
00:16:58,410 --> 00:17:01,949
sites coming out now that it makes some

459
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:03,540
people actively worse so try it by all

460
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:06,600
means I love it if it doesn't work for

461
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:08,730
you please drop it because it's

462
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:10,139
mindfulness isn't for you and I know a

463
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:12,630
lot of companies to do mindfulness as a

464
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:13,860
shortcut for look how great we are and I

465
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:17,310
have me through that because you can't

466
00:17:13,859 --> 00:17:19,349
mindfulness is can promote and

467
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:21,000
contribute to well-being but it's not a

468
00:17:19,349 --> 00:17:23,429
one-size-fits-all kind of thing and it

469
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:26,130
certainly won't fix everything so but I

470
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:35,630
love it so take from that that is my

471
00:17:26,130 --> 00:17:37,500
mindfulness disclaimer so first time

472
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:39,810
that's the first time in this talk up

473
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:41,610
done that right first time an amazing so

474
00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:42,929
this is really important I find this

475
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:44,189
being really important someone that I

476
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:47,010
can go actually you know what I'm not

477
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:53,040
doing great I know just go yeah all

478
00:17:47,010 --> 00:17:55,850
right okay I find lying or hiding things

479
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:57,990
really hard and I do it at work because

480
00:17:55,850 --> 00:17:59,100
sometimes I walk into work on a Monday

481
00:17:57,990 --> 00:18:00,300
morning paper go right how was your

482
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:03,030
weekend and what they don't hear is me

483
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:04,800
to go crying mostly no one wants that

484
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:06,810
all they want you to hear is fine thanks

485
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:07,500
how with quiet how is yours that's what

486
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:09,600
people want

487
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:11,460
alright and that's fine that is a social

488
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:14,699
contract but it's nice to have someone I

489
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:18,150
can go nah been a bit rubbish I find

about this stuff it was much easier to

504
00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:45,570

513
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:03,899
diagnosed right you're just having a

514
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:05,879
rough day that's equally important to

515
00:19:03,899 --> 00:19:10,080
get that stuff out as it is to go I'm

516
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:12,360
having some troubling thoughts there are

517
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:15,029
some apps there's also a list of apps

518
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:16,080
that I've crowd-sourced that people find

519
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:17,610
helpful this kind of stuff as well

520
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:20,220
whether it be thinking about your

521
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:21,779
feelings or finding people to talk to

522
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:23,640
all that kind of stuff I've not tried

523
00:19:21,779 --> 00:19:26,789
all of them but I've tried some of them

524
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:29,010
and uh yeah they're all come recommended

525
00:19:26,789 --> 00:19:30,779
by other people or by me so again

526
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:31,890
doesn't help everyone take what you will

527
00:19:30,779 --> 00:19:34,950
leave they're asked all that kind of

528
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:37,890
stuff so the next part of my talk is

529
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:39,299
gonna be how to be that person that it's

530
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:41,429
all reached out to you how did he'll

531
00:19:39,299 --> 00:19:43,559
handle that conversation because a lot

532
00:19:41,429 --> 00:19:44,760
of us want to be open to that kind of

533
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:46,049
conversation right but I think we don't

534
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:48,510
get a lot of training on how to do

535
00:19:46,049 --> 00:19:50,610
things and it's quite scary for everyone

536
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:51,960
so I figure if I can give you some tips

537
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:52,979
now about how to have those

538
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:54,990
conversations how to deal with those

539
00:19:52,980 --> 00:20:05,700
conversations hopefully that will be

540
00:19:54,990 --> 00:20:07,110
helpful as well so we all want to be

541
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:09,539
like the puppy that doesn't know what

542
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:10,830
it's doing right we want to hell just

543
00:20:09,539 --> 00:20:12,179
like puppies want to make you happy but

544
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:15,120
sometimes it's really hard because we

545
00:20:12,179 --> 00:20:16,409
have no idea what we want so like I said

546
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:18,570
I've had the conversations from both

547
00:20:16,409 --> 00:20:21,570
sides I have had two so last year I went

548
00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:22,799
back to therapy and I what got therapy

549
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:25,200
my first bit authority through the EAP

550
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:26,850
at work and it was doing work time so I

551
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,899
had to say my boss look I need to go

552
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:28,559
back to therapy and he was like yeah

553
00:20:27,899 --> 00:20:30,989
fine

554
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:32,460
whatever you need then I got a new job I

555
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:34,559
cook the mice later and I was like yeah

556
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:36,779
I'm in therapy I need to work from home

557
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:38,428
one day a week because I did a lot of

558
00:20:36,779 --> 00:20:39,750
work on myself actually last year I

559
00:20:38,429 --> 00:20:41,520
stopped talking to my family entirely

560
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:44,399
which was a massive step I'm much better

561
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:45,809
for it but it wasn't that I was a bit of

562
00:20:44,399 --> 00:20:47,219
a mess at work at times because I was

563
00:20:45,809 --> 00:20:50,190
dealing with an awful lot of stuff and

564
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:50,900
work was amazingly supportive but I had

565
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:52,100
to have these conversations

566
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:53,720
people had to are these conversations

567
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:54,830
with me and so these concepts like I've

568
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:57,320
really gathered for the last 12 months

569
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:58,460
of having these conversations I'm also a

570
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:59,300
mental health miss state or don't know

571
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:01,220
if people know about the mental health

572
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:02,659
first day program so some links like I'm

573
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:05,600
on the slides so the mental focus a

574
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:06,800
program is put on by mental health first

575
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,030
aid England where this one has gotten

576
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:10,250
into Wales and all over the world it's

577
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:12,200
in some like 20 odd countries in

578
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:15,560
nineteen different languages and it is

579
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:18,590
of course that it's a two-day course and

580
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:21,530
it gives you resources and tips on how

581
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:23,449
to help someone in crisis in the

582
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:25,220
workplace and so I wear a different

583
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:26,870
color than yard at work that signifies

584
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:28,850
that anyone can come and talk to me and

585
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:31,459
go I'm having trouble I'm having issues

586
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:32,990
will sit well listen if someone is

587
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:34,550
struggling will point them to resources

588
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:35,930
we can do with people in crisis

589
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:38,120
everything from like depression anxiety

590
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:38,930
all the way through to people having a

591
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:41,209
psychotic break

592
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:43,010
suicide self-harm like it's a really

593
00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:45,080
intense two days it's amazing though I

594
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:48,770
highly recommend it if working if you

595
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:51,439
can get your work to do it do it because

596
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:53,480
it's really good which makes like means

597
00:21:51,440 --> 00:22:06,290
I need a lot these conversations it's

598
00:21:53,480 --> 00:22:09,890
one thing so that way so I have four

599
00:22:06,290 --> 00:22:11,330
points to this part of my talk the first

600
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:11,870
race these conversations are going to be

601
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:14,000
awkward

602
00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:15,050
you are never not going to be awkward in

603
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,210
these conversations doesn't matter what

604
00:22:15,050 --> 00:22:18,980
side the table you are because the

605
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:20,810
person living trouble is having trouble

606
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:23,900
and there's not going to be having them

607
00:22:20,810 --> 00:22:25,460
like my words have gone just thinking

608
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:27,320
about how these conversations that's the

609
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:28,490
point very awkward very hard to

610
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:29,450
articulate these things especially a bit

611
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:32,780
somewhat under not spoken to you about

612
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:34,280
before sometimes you're off your game

613
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:35,840
you're thinking about something else

614
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:37,460
you've got a deadline and as someone

615
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,870
comes up to you you're like oh god I

616
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:39,770
want to help but I wasn't expecting this

617
00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:42,290
and I've got other things to do oh

618
00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:46,040
Christ what am i doing that's fine as

619
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:48,680
well just commit to being awkward but

620
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:49,790
helpful and take make awkwardness part

621
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:51,500
of your plan take the awkwardness

622
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:53,680
pressure off you okay you don't have to

623
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:55,760
be perfect you just have to be helpful

624
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:56,750
take the perfect pressure off you it's

625
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,830
fine no one has this connotation

626
00:22:56,750 --> 00:23:00,170
perfectly because the other person is

627
00:22:57,830 --> 00:23:04,500
not perfect anyway is fine we are all

628
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:05,730
fine all I want you to

629
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:06,930
focus on and they start leading to my

630
00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:09,480
second point is being present in the

631
00:23:06,930 --> 00:23:12,030
conversation don't even think about what

632
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:13,620
I'm saying to you now don't go aha hmm

633
00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:14,910
say about its conversations No think

634
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:17,580
about the person in front of you listen

635
00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:19,350
to them fully and send to them because

636
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:21,240
and this is the controversial statement

637
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:25,080
you're not gonna be able to solve their

638
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:26,910
problem I know we're problem solvers

639
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:28,560
I taught us a lot to engineers their job

640
00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:29,610
is solving problems this is not a

641
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:31,169
problem you're gonna be able to solve

642
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:32,780
the only person who can solve the

643
00:23:31,170 --> 00:23:34,830
problem is the person having the problem

644
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:36,720
and trust me that's a hard thing for

645
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:38,010
them to swallow as well it's really hard

646
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,270
for me to really it was really hard when

647
00:23:38,010 --> 00:23:40,920
I realized that I would have to put the

648
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:43,650
work in to stop being so anxious I

649
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:45,090
wanted someone else just to take that

650
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:48,870
away for me

651
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:51,540
what's it can happen so if someone comes

652
00:23:48,870 --> 00:23:53,100
to us I'm having issues I'm really

653
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:56,909
anxious I'm really struggling with

654
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:59,340
stress don't try and solve problems at

655
00:23:56,910 --> 00:24:01,380
them have you tried whatever isn't

656
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:03,120
actually helpful the analogy I have is

657
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:04,920
like if I come in with two bags is that

658
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:06,300
the two bags are pops and a pint glass

659
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:07,770
of water on the top when I say to you

660
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:09,600
can you grab that pint glass I'm

661
00:24:07,770 --> 00:24:11,100
struggling would you take the point

662
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:14,280
glass or would you say have you tried

663
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:14,639
finding a table do you see what I'm

664
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:16,170
saying

665
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:17,280
I understand that people want to offer

666
00:24:16,170 --> 00:24:18,540
solutions but when you say have your

667
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:19,830
tried what you're saying is oh no you

668
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:20,940
deal with that I'm not even going to

669
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:22,980
help you at all for not even a little

670
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:24,060
bit because by listening you're taking

671
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:25,590
that burden off them you're gonna have

672
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:26,669
to give it back you're gonna have to

673
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:27,840
give it back but you're gonna have to

674
00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:31,320
give me the pint glass back okay you're

675
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:33,030
taking it somewhere but taking off them

676
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:36,389
just for a minute just for five minutes

677
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:37,800
can be so helpful because you're sharing

678
00:24:36,390 --> 00:24:39,000
it with them and it is uncomfortable

679
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:40,200
you're gonna have to sit and listen to

680
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,120
some things that move you make might

681
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:45,540
make you very uncomfortable but that is

682
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:49,290
so helpful it is untrue so focus on

683
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:50,639
listening first Center it sent to the

684
00:24:49,290 --> 00:25:01,830
person and they're not the scenario

685
00:24:50,640 --> 00:25:04,200
essentially I will now offer you a

686
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:05,100
script the script that I use when people

687
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:08,490
come and talk to me and have these

688
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:12,120
things I'm sorry to hear that now it

689
00:25:08,490 --> 00:25:14,010
sounds rubbish how can I help change the

690
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:14,969
wording to fit however you want to speak

691
00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:18,179
I am a swearer

692
00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:20,159
I normally say that sounds really rough

693
00:25:18,179 --> 00:25:23,249
oh that sounds I'm really sorry

694
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:27,119
what can I help what needed help and

695
00:25:23,249 --> 00:25:28,679
they might not know but you can listen

696
00:25:27,119 --> 00:25:29,939
you can sympathize and if asked to

697
00:25:28,679 --> 00:25:32,369
advice you can maybe put misses and

698
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:35,039
resources before as fast you can put

699
00:25:32,369 --> 00:25:36,830
into sim to the Samaritans one one six

700
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:39,658
one two three again program something

701
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:42,480
who can offer them advice if they need

702
00:25:39,659 --> 00:25:44,100
to the fourth one I'm going to talk

703
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,600
about someone who if it someone comes to

704
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:46,498
you when you're worried about them so

705
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:48,269
I'm going to talk a little bit about

706
00:25:46,499 --> 00:25:49,499
self-harm and suicide so if you this is

707
00:25:48,269 --> 00:25:51,779
gonna make them comfortable please do

708
00:25:49,499 --> 00:25:53,039
leave honestly looking after yourself is

709
00:25:51,779 --> 00:25:56,580
more important than listening to this

710
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:59,429
talk I promise if you're worried ask

711
00:25:56,580 --> 00:26:00,749
them you're not going to make some think

712
00:25:59,429 --> 00:26:01,860
about it more if they're already

713
00:26:00,749 --> 00:26:02,820
thinking about it or if they're not

714
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:05,399
thinking about it you're not gonna make

715
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:07,408
them think about it I'm really worried

716
00:26:05,399 --> 00:26:09,779
about you are you thinking of hurting

717
00:26:07,409 --> 00:26:11,999
yourself that's all you need to say if

718
00:26:09,779 --> 00:26:15,240
they say no great if they say yes right

719
00:26:11,999 --> 00:26:18,029
who can I call with you to tell them

720
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:20,669
this again if all else fails the

721
00:26:18,029 --> 00:26:22,139
Samaritans they are there to do this

722
00:26:20,669 --> 00:26:24,299
they are given the training because you

723
00:26:22,139 --> 00:26:25,769
don't have the training to deal with

724
00:26:24,299 --> 00:26:27,179
this and be aware of this that you don't

725
00:26:25,769 --> 00:26:30,720
have the training you don't have to take

726
00:26:27,179 --> 00:26:33,179
sitting with someone who might harm

727
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:34,769
themselves if that's not what you want

728
00:26:33,179 --> 00:26:37,169
to do or if you can't do it if you're

729
00:26:34,769 --> 00:26:41,279
not emotionally like ready for that

730
00:26:37,169 --> 00:26:43,200
because it is terrifying so point them

731
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:44,159
to the smart ins point them if all it

732
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:47,279
smells drive them Duany

733
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:49,350
it's not going to be fun but then being

734
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:51,269
alive at the end of the day is they may

735
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:54,539
be traumatized but they'll be alive okay

736
00:26:51,269 --> 00:26:57,029
ask them but do not take that burden on

737
00:26:54,539 --> 00:26:58,019
point them to someone trained point them

738
00:26:57,029 --> 00:26:58,980
to their own support system maybe

739
00:26:58,019 --> 00:27:00,840
they've got a support system already

740
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:02,340
that's why I say who can we call can we

741
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:03,779
call someone see if they've been through

742
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:06,840
it before they know there's people there

743
00:27:03,779 --> 00:27:08,639
they've got support system built-in okay

744
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:10,649
not going to talk about anything hug

745
00:27:08,639 --> 00:27:13,408
pack again we're all good but honestly

746
00:27:10,649 --> 00:27:14,610
it's terrifying but ask it because

747
00:27:13,409 --> 00:27:16,289
people go thank you for asking

748
00:27:14,610 --> 00:27:17,639
no I wasn't but thank you for checking

749
00:27:16,289 --> 00:27:20,580
in with me because people do it to me

750
00:27:17,639 --> 00:27:22,229
people come to me and gone I'm really

751
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:23,369
worried about you no no I'm fine thank

752
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:25,230
you for asking but it's fine I'm always

753
00:27:23,369 --> 00:27:27,389
grateful people checking sit you're

754
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:32,670
thinking about me and you want me to be

755
00:27:27,389 --> 00:27:36,840
safe that's amazing do not be afraid so

756
00:27:32,670 --> 00:27:38,250
look after yourself this is hard it's

757
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:39,990
really hard to be someone's support

758
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:42,360
system even just for an afternoon even

759
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:43,680
just for 5-10 minutes it can really

760
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:46,350
drain you out because you're providing

761
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:47,880
your your emotional support to them

762
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:49,010
which means you're directing your own

763
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:51,090
emotional support for yourself

764
00:27:49,010 --> 00:27:54,180
especially if you're dealing with your

765
00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:56,550
own as well yeah so set those

766
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:58,680
boundaries so I've got five minutes but

767
00:27:56,550 --> 00:28:00,810
then I need to do a thing then look

768
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:04,850
after yourself go do some of the stuff

769
00:28:00,810 --> 00:28:08,520
that I've talked about today go have fun

770
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:10,260
go take the day off work early do

771
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:12,090
something like that - I mean look after

772
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:13,110
yourself because that is just important

773
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:18,090
and you don't want to kill yourself

774
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:19,949
looking after other people so whether

775
00:28:18,090 --> 00:28:22,649
it's on the table having that

776
00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:24,810
conversation terrifying going up to your

777
00:28:22,650 --> 00:28:27,210
boss your coworker your friends and

778
00:28:24,810 --> 00:28:29,040
going actually I'm having a bit of a

779
00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:31,370
 time sorry I hope people don't mind

780
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:34,350
swearing I'm so sorry

781
00:28:31,370 --> 00:28:37,050
should have asked before hunt what does

782
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:38,840
he want anyway but you know it's

783
00:28:37,050 --> 00:28:41,340
terrifying to go someone and admit that

784
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:44,939
you're struggling that you're you're

785
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:47,040
feeling it I do it I still do it often

786
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:48,180
enough and I'm just about I mean just

787
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:50,129
about got to the point where it doesn't

788
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:52,410
feel like admitting that I'm weak so I'm

789
00:28:50,130 --> 00:28:56,130
not weak I've got through so much stuff

790
00:28:52,410 --> 00:28:57,240
with anxiety I am resilient as heck but

791
00:28:56,130 --> 00:28:59,490
admitting to someone that I'm struggling

792
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:00,240
and it's because you can't cope with day

793
00:28:59,490 --> 00:29:02,220
to day life

794
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:03,690
is what you're saying right and that's

795
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:05,360
it always feels a bit weird going yeah I

796
00:29:03,690 --> 00:29:06,800
don't have the energy to go shower

797
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:08,550
anymore

798
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:11,010
but there's nothing physically wrong

799
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:15,000
with me is a really hard conversation to

800
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:16,200
have so what I would what I do assume

801
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,540
when you're not in crisis obviously if

802
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:20,430
you're in crisis please tell people

803
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:22,680
immediately as soon as possible during

804
00:29:20,430 --> 00:29:24,180
the samaritans whatever but if you just

805
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:25,980
need some more accommodations at work or

806
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:28,320
whatever and if you can feel yourself

807
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:29,880
slowly starting to go what I do is I

808
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:32,610
start writing things down because again

809
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:35,100
I'm a writer I write things down what

810
00:29:32,610 --> 00:29:36,540
can work do so I didn't work contact

811
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:37,679
because I've got Toby but what can work

812
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:41,790
do to make me feel better

813
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:44,190
well ideal scenario would my work life

814
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:46,230
be is it taking some time off is it

815
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:49,410
trying to work from home walking

816
00:29:46,230 --> 00:29:50,790
is it time off to go to therapy maybe

817
00:29:49,410 --> 00:29:53,630
it's transition out of a role maybe

818
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:56,730
you've taken a role that isn't for you

819
00:29:53,630 --> 00:29:59,160
find what it is and then you can ask for

820
00:29:56,730 --> 00:29:59,580
it and even if you don't ask for it in

821
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:01,950
the end

822
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:05,520
sorry even if you have a conversation

823
00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:07,020
you don't ask for it having that backing

824
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:08,040
means you're like to have that

825
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:11,340
conversation and you'll find a

826
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:12,780
conversation easier I've said a lot

827
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:14,370
about even if you don't do things

828
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:17,760
because I find a lot of time I may not

829
00:30:14,370 --> 00:30:19,290
do stuff but having that grounding makes

830
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:20,610
it a lot easier to do the thing even if

831
00:30:19,290 --> 00:30:25,409
I don't use the stuff that I've used for

832
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:27,178
the grounding so write it down or

833
00:30:25,410 --> 00:30:30,570
whatever have that conversation

834
00:30:27,179 --> 00:30:33,600
I just got someone to go look I am NOT

835
00:30:30,570 --> 00:30:35,760
I'm having a hard time like so I mean I

836
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:37,649
say make one manages a okay enough that

837
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:41,220
you can go can you have a word I think

838
00:30:37,650 --> 00:30:44,820
I'm having a bit of a rough time X is

839
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:46,530
happening can we do Y to help because a

840
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:47,639
lot of the time from my experience if

841
00:30:46,530 --> 00:30:48,780
you can tell people what you need

842
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:49,919
they'll be quite happy to give it to you

843
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:53,639
and they'll be a lot less stressed out

844
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:55,410
by it because remember when I told my

845
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:56,640
first boss last year two bosses actually

846
00:30:55,410 --> 00:30:58,380

853
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:11,010

854
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:12,179

855

anonymously amazing so I'm gonna get

859
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:20,760
therapy through the AP I'm gonna use

860
00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:21,990
that to then go to into private therapy

861
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:23,850
I might need some time off work

862
00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:28,410
depending one of your point Misco it was

863
00:31:23,850 --> 00:31:30,299
like yeah that's fine anything else I'm

864
00:31:28,410 --> 00:31:31,740
like no no I'm pretty sure I've got a

865
00:31:30,299 --> 00:31:33,870
support network I'm pretty sure very

866
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:37,049
much therapy will help with that he was

867
00:31:33,870 --> 00:31:38,370
like oh you've got everything down then

868
00:31:37,049 --> 00:31:39,418
I'm like yeah yeah I might get to work

869
00:31:38,370 --> 00:31:41,428
from home a bit more and he was like

870
00:31:39,419 --> 00:31:42,929
yeah of course whatever and that was it

871
00:31:41,429 --> 00:31:44,580
that was the entire conversation he was

872
00:31:42,929 --> 00:31:46,860
like he was almost disappointed that he

873
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:48,120
couldn't help me more uh-huh which you

874
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:49,678
may find people go into this all

875
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:51,389
adrenalin and then you're just like oh

876
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:54,890
just need to work from home but like oh

877
00:31:51,390 --> 00:31:54,890
all right

878
00:31:55,010 --> 00:31:59,129
so that's why I find going preparing

879
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:00,270
those conversations is easier because it

880
00:31:59,130 --> 00:32:01,740
means it does mean a little bit I'm

881
00:32:00,270 --> 00:32:04,289
taking a bit of a burden of managing

882
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:05,520
their emotions a bit but that how I feel

883
00:32:04,289 --> 00:32:08,039
more comfortable these conversations go

884
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:09,299
in yeah no actually I'm fine I'm just

885
00:32:08,039 --> 00:32:15,570
gonna deal with this you just give me

886
00:32:09,299 --> 00:32:16,620
permission and then we'll go so I'm

887
00:32:15,570 --> 00:32:17,668
getting towards into my talk so I hope

888
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:21,949
you all have questions if not that's

889
00:32:17,669 --> 00:32:21,950
fine we can I'm really I already think

890
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:27,960
this is my goal right Mayans actually

891
00:32:26,190 --> 00:32:29,820
will never go away I won't ever not be

892
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:31,620
anxious there is never a day in my life

893
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:37,139
I'm not going to be anxious that is just

894
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:39,030
a situation that I am in and yeah that's

895
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:41,760
just my life and I have accepted that

896
00:32:39,030 --> 00:32:45,178
into my life that I am always going to

897
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:50,179
be anxious that's mine maybe I'll always

898
00:32:45,179 --> 00:32:50,179
be on meds I don't know um but

899
00:32:51,550 --> 00:33:00,639
oh I think I just got bit overheated no

900
00:32:56,560 --> 00:33:02,260
no I'm good I'm good I find herb turns

901
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:10,450
out talking about anxiety makes me back

902
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:12,129
to sometimes it's fine yes no this is

903
00:33:10,450 --> 00:33:14,550
like my last night victory my side so

904
00:33:12,130 --> 00:33:18,190
I'm good I'm good I'm feeling okay now

905
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:19,480
but yes so my ideal day today is that I

906
00:33:18,190 --> 00:33:21,310
can listen to my anxiety when I need to

907
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:22,690
because sometimes it's helpful sometimes

908
00:33:21,310 --> 00:33:24,730
being anxious about basic piece of

909
00:33:22,690 --> 00:33:26,320
software that testing means that I don't

910
00:33:24,730 --> 00:33:27,510
know it right off and I can do a better

911
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:30,639
job I can do more investigating

912
00:33:27,510 --> 00:33:32,350
sometimes it just gets in my way so my

913
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:34,630
goal is to listen to my anxiety but

914
00:33:32,350 --> 00:33:36,040
learn to ignore it what I need to

915
00:33:34,630 --> 00:33:38,320
because it's always gonna be there lying

916
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:40,990
to me going that person doesn't like you

917
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:43,629
you're not that good at your job and

918
00:33:40,990 --> 00:33:45,490
it's tough it's tiring some days it

919
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:47,950
feels like my entire life I have two

920
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:50,040
full-time jobs my actual job that pays

921
00:33:47,950 --> 00:33:52,210
me are there managing my mental health

922
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:54,159
sometimes it feels like that and that's

923
00:33:52,210 --> 00:33:58,090
okay sometimes I'll do everything right

924
00:33:54,160 --> 00:34:00,190
and still be really not okay and while

925
00:33:58,090 --> 00:34:02,260
it's not nice not being okay I've

926
00:34:00,190 --> 00:34:04,890
learned to accept that maybe that is

927
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:06,910
okay at the end of the day and it's fine

928
00:34:04,890 --> 00:34:08,490
if all you get out of this talk is

929
00:34:06,910 --> 00:34:11,290
insight it what it's like for people

930
00:34:08,489 --> 00:34:13,178
then I hope that's helpful

931
00:34:11,290 --> 00:34:14,259
I'm really hoping you've got some tips

932
00:34:13,179 --> 00:34:16,630
out there that you can take away and use

933
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:18,520
or at least use as a springboard to

934
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:20,770
think about how you think about your

935
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:21,159
mental house because so the reason is

936
00:34:20,770 --> 00:34:23,620
talk

937
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:26,020
start it is because a friend of mine and

938
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:28,960
a friend of pliers Vernon Richards asked

939
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:30,699
me I know how to keep myself healthy

940
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:32,320
physically but I've no idea how to do

941
00:34:30,699 --> 00:34:34,120
that mentally and I was like I know I

942
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:35,710
know how to do that

943
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:37,330
and this is where these talks come from

944
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:39,250
is because it made me realize that not

945
00:34:37,330 --> 00:34:41,529
everyone is hard to do this work and not

946
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:43,899
everyone knows how to do this work and

947
00:34:41,530 --> 00:34:45,190
if I can it's so much easier to do it if

948
00:34:43,899 --> 00:34:47,830
you're feeling okay then when you're

949
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:49,270
feeling rubbish trust me if you're

950
00:34:47,830 --> 00:34:51,969
feeling okay now and you can take this

951
00:34:49,270 --> 00:34:54,489
tool let's talk it away and do build

952
00:34:51,969 --> 00:34:56,709
that toolbox for yourself you'll have it

953
00:34:54,489 --> 00:34:58,029
if you ever need it hopefully you'll

954
00:34:56,710 --> 00:35:01,090
never need it that would be great but

955
00:34:58,030 --> 00:35:02,560
life kicks you in the face and if you

956
00:35:01,090 --> 00:35:04,480
have a toolbox for dealing with when

957
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:05,380
life kicks you in the face you'll be

958
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,640
able to handle it

959
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:10,480
a lot better and at least you'll know

960
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:13,390
vaguely what you're doing so mental

961
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:16,480
health is kind of how our Charlie people

962
00:35:13,390 --> 00:35:18,460
processes is a lot of agile is you take

963
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:20,440
what works for the team and you throw

964
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:21,820
away what does it and it's not changes

965
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:24,310
you pick up somewhat new when you throw

966
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:28,630
a zip away your mental health can be

967
00:35:24,310 --> 00:35:30,850
constantly evolving so fine stuff here

968
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:32,080
that works for you fine stuff here that

969
00:35:30,850 --> 00:35:32,710
it finds something isn't in there that

970
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:34,450
works for you

971
00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:37,690
throw away everything else if it isn't

972
00:35:34,450 --> 00:35:40,689
serving you that is fine maybe nothing

973
00:35:37,690 --> 00:35:43,990
in this will help you but maybe you'll

974
00:35:40,690 --> 00:35:46,180
go away think of your own stuff thank

975
00:35:43,990 --> 00:35:55,899
