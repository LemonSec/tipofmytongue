1
00:00:04,109 --> 00:00:07,529
good morning class

2
00:00:08,219 --> 00:00:13,780
hello thank you for thank you thank you

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:17,820
for coming here I produced people

4
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:17,820
speaking in these guys nice to see you

5
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:22,619
I've been here last year and I wasn't

6
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:29,619
expecting I see that we'll be talking

7
00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:33,430
next year so it's been a ride for me so

8
00:00:29,619 --> 00:00:36,219
what is this talk about first of all

9
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:41,350
this is meadow meadow is working in

10
00:00:36,219 --> 00:00:42,850
hardware security and she was she likes

11
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:45,700
to talk about herself in third person

12
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:48,640
and she works against criminals mostly

13
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:50,800
right that'll do it so I don't only

14
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:54,280
guest I don't what the dance trackers I

15
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:58,599
won't against criminals and so there is

16
00:00:54,280 --> 00:01:04,269
and the the q7r and outside is grabbing

17
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:06,009
of Jesus Cuba and this talk originally

18
00:01:04,269 --> 00:01:09,039
he was supposed to be just my ranting

19
00:01:06,009 --> 00:01:12,130
about how we need to go deeper in had

20
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:15,840
where it had were hacking but as I was

21
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:18,908
doing this I got too much content Oh

22
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:21,369
one-hour talk so I decided to make it a

23
00:01:18,909 --> 00:01:23,710
training so what's gonna happen here I

24
00:01:21,369 --> 00:01:28,960
will just give you our brief overview of

25
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:30,729
deep level Harbor happen and in the

26
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:33,548
background there will be a training

27
00:01:30,729 --> 00:01:36,850
behind this it will land on github some

28
00:01:33,549 --> 00:01:41,439
point next few weeks so you'll be able

29
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:44,380
to follow I will make learning path of

30
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:46,779
if you can follow this path and build

31
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:49,720
this this this thing you hear and learn

32
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:54,670
all the little things that are happening

33
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:57,070
between the keyboard and the the hosts

34
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:59,950
are the be seen at the keyboard is

35
00:01:57,070 --> 00:02:01,600
connected to and land the protocols let

36
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:06,040
you learn to how to analyze them and

37
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:08,470
then have to break them so there will be

38
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:11,920
some talking and hopefully if everything

39
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:16,180
works there'll be some demos as well and

40
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:16,329
yeah as I said moment ago you don't have

41
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:18,460
to

42
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:23,440
take notes because everything I'm saying

43
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:27,600
here mold it will be available online in

44
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:31,900
the future so what brought me here

45
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:34,180
several questions problems were

46
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:36,610
happening on Twitter or empathic world

47
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:38,890
in general and I was thinking that I

48
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:42,550
should I should really like have one

49
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:44,019
place to answer at least several of

50
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:47,380
those questions because I cannot solve

51
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:50,560
every problem but maybe some of them I

52
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:52,630
can actually try to strain your map one

53
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:55,240
of them is people are talking about

54
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:56,920
buying powers to fee to two USB adapter

55
00:02:55,240 --> 00:03:02,740
and connecting them to are doing or as

56
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:04,030
well if I like that's not - that's and

57
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:06,880
no one is connecting them if you were

58
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:12,490
just following and then and then they're

59
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:14,019
all happy about that we do it's not

60
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:18,910
anyone's fault that if they don't know

61
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:21,130
about this but this people are repeating

62
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:23,440
this this this disguise over it just

63
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:26,829
became truth and that's not exactly true

64
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:29,620
and the other thing I was asked this

65
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:33,489
question a lot actually someone who has

66
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:36,910
very experienced hacker they asked me

67
00:03:33,489 --> 00:03:39,010
what what voltage does SPI Ronald SBI's

68
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:42,250
do one of these serial protocols I was

69
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:44,109
like it's not the right question because

70
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:46,390
actually there is no voltage on SPI is

71
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:48,820
like it's much more complicated right

72
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:51,220
but obviously for someone who's not a

73
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:53,470
hardware hacker he's a legitimate

74
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:56,739
question how do i what porches do i used

75
00:03:53,470 --> 00:04:00,760
to connect usb on right sorry and that

76
00:03:56,739 --> 00:04:07,480
third one asks I was asked this question

77
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:09,040
by one of one of P so this question many

78
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:10,179
times I'm being asked how to be a hard

79
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,310
worker right

80
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:14,110
I like what you do I like that you do

81
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:15,370
they have how do P I have I have - what

82
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:20,290
do I do to be I hard what happened was

83
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:21,850
like this but this is this is not a

84
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:23,530
right to recover that one - no because I

85
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:25,630
if I if I tell someone just stole a

86
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:26,919
dude's captive just go and not build

87
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:30,040
stop because there's so many things that

88
00:04:26,919 --> 00:04:31,270
can do so I was thinking how will make

89
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:33,280
something for you right I will design

90
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:35,799
the ball then follow you can you can

91
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:38,979
build together there with me for it with

92
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:40,720
me tagging you and if you do this you

93
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:42,610
can follow my steps if you build this up

94
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:45,160
you okay I don't know it right there

95
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:52,210
will be this maybe one of your starting

96
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:54,670
point into I'm happy it's intimidating

97
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:57,190
alright and it is scan and this is what

98
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:59,560
most people do they start have a hacking

99
00:04:57,190 --> 00:05:01,800
they try to do something they get

100
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:06,790
intimidated by the lack of knowledge or

101
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:09,000
something else or like this is mostly it

102
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:11,200
is intimidating it will be intimidating

103
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,930
I'm being intubated at work at work

104
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:17,110
because it's just a matter of level that

105
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:18,820
you are like I encounter something and

106
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:21,040
I'm not thinking like I really should

107
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:21,790
know this I will do this we is I said we

108
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:25,270
should know this

109
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:29,170
I don't like a sack up my world and this

110
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:30,549
is not true I mean I hope so it's normal

111
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:33,190
because there are so many things that

112
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:36,610
you need to know about and it's not to

113
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:39,370
be intimidated by not knowing anything

114
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:41,710
it's just what I'm trying to say here is

115
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:43,360
that no matter the level you are you

116
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:45,969
always still be always something that's

117
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,410
that's intimidating right so you don't

118
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:54,370
have to be afraid and you don't have to

119
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:56,290
be intimidated so how the haka is just

120
00:05:54,370 --> 00:06:00,130
some other skills alright so this

121
00:05:56,290 --> 00:06:04,410
happened at some con last week week ago

122
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:04,409
there at the conference in in in DC and

123
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:10,600
and I say went and then started

124
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:14,920
not started they were just posting ads

125
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:16,960
for jobs and an NSA people are taking

126
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:19,500
pictures of this saying like all I say

127
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:22,239
is probably ever be hacking us like that

128
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:26,950
it's a good play on the no variability

129
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:29,530
not gonna Billy but threat vector when

130
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:31,240
you connect our phone to UM no charge or

131
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:33,880
someone has your phone I mean it's not

132
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:35,140
that simple anymore but this is this is

133
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:37,090
what they did and if you weren't just

134
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:40,659
taking pictures like oh and I say nice

135
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:43,539
and I was like that's just go and check

136
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:45,880
right I mean taking pictures no if

137
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:48,690
you had Oaxaca if you're curious you

138
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:51,159
just go there connect something those

139
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:53,500
charges and check if it's really

140
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:55,570
something malicious or not all right and

141
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:58,410
honestly if you if you build this stuff

142
00:06:55,570 --> 00:07:01,390
you will know how all right so it's not

143
00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:03,370
it's not that much complicated but if

144
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:04,840
you're curious enough if you see

145
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:06,820
something like this I want to I want to

146
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:09,760
find out what it is you are already

147
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:11,710
heard will happen right and the rest is

148
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:13,230
just the knowledge that you have to gain

149
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:17,580
on your way

150
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:20,170
so yes it's intimidating it is scary

151
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:22,000
if you're curious if you if you see

152
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:23,650
something this this NSI stunt and go to

153
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:28,630
hack it go to find out what it is

154
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:32,169
so idea how that happened so there are

155
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:36,310
several ways to do hardware hacking to

156
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:46,920
go and you have a hacking and one of

157
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:46,920
them this is this is I read a book right

158
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:59,260
with a heavy fake book and it's to some

159
00:07:56,710 --> 00:08:01,750
extent is good because the way I've been

160
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:04,570
taught many years ago assembly language

161
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:06,460
for example we were doing assembly

162
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:08,650
language of paper so we're writing stuff

163
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:10,719
on paper it wasn't like you type

164
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:12,219
something in you compile it or just one

165
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,800
and see what the errors are go back

166
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:18,190
correct Wow you have to learn how to

167
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:20,710
code before we actually go and get a

168
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:23,170
chance to do something about the actual

169
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:25,330
machine right so you learn how to

170
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:27,790
respect the resources you learn how to

171
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:29,320
correct your typos before you actually

172
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:31,510
start to type something all right this

173
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:34,090
is one approach that we are angry at why

174
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:39,280
having we why aren't we doing this other

175
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:41,140
computers on some computers and but 20

176
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:42,579
is like there I think that that was a

177
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:45,370
very good thing

178
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:46,730
so reading a book is one approach but we

179
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:51,660
don't have time for this

180
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:52,920
this is like 600 pages and it's I mean

181
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:54,510
it's fascinating for me but it's quite

182
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:57,199
boring we want to do something

183
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:59,819
interesting and well in our lives so

184
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:03,860
path 2 is obviously business online so

185
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:07,110
build something together it's fine

186
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:08,700
sometimes it doesn't work and you need

187
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:10,290
to know why it doesn't work right

188
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:11,970
because you cannot just go to circle the

189
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:15,439
globe and copy it basic code because

190
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:18,090
it's not carved you have to build it and

191
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:20,790
this knowledge in this book helps so

192
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:22,890
don't obviously don't spend your life 5

193
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:24,810
years 5 years of your life learning the

194
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:28,080
stuff and then start to do stuff but be

195
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:29,910
aware that those books those even those

196
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:32,730
even though they are heavy and in

197
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:36,560
somewhat intimidating there are friends

198
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:39,560
all right so you probably will need to

199
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:41,760
do some reading and do some recent

200
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:43,020
enough of this talking but that's not

201
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,450
actually true because I will be talking

202
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:47,970
for a while sorry

203
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:50,130
so here's a keyboard and this is not

204
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:51,510
what I planned for today because I

205
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:53,250
forgot to take the keyboard that I

206
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:56,069
wanted so so I bought a keyboard on my

207
00:09:53,250 --> 00:10:00,600
way here and this is not the keyboard

208
00:09:56,070 --> 00:10:03,690
that very good for this example because

209
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:05,430
it's about wire and wireless one so the

210
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:09,020
the one that I have for the training is

211
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:12,329
actually a wild one and this keyboard

212
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:14,340
just has a very small receiver alright

213
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:16,410
so this is not only a keyboard or a

214
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:19,020
wireless well I don't know what's gonna

215
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:21,870
happen if it's gonna work for my demo so

216
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:28,220
maybe maybe it's gonna work or maybe we

217
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:31,710
have to stop life debug session but the

218
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:33,150
the the the keyboard that I have for

219
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:34,710
prepared for the training is doing

220
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:36,630
something maybe is doing something

221
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:40,380
magical is not but it's wild keep my

222
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:48,380
quiet USB USB human so why a keyboard

223
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:50,939
because they're not simple but they are

224
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:53,070
one of the simplest devices that another

225
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:56,430
website so because this impress a key

226
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:57,960
then I get to informations going back

227
00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:59,520
and forth one that you pass the key you

228
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,100
want you to release that you so there's

229
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,660
a

230
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:04,810
small amount of data going back and

231
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:06,069
forth so it's sort of easy to analyze it

232
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:08,199
all right because you're not being over

233
00:11:06,069 --> 00:11:10,930
overlaid with of this packets flowing

234
00:11:08,199 --> 00:11:13,540
back and forth so that's one reason for

235
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:16,870
me picking a keyboard I did it as a demo

236
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:21,969
for this as a tool for this for this

237
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:25,259
demo and key possibly even plus a very

238
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:26,560
favorite my favorite everyone's favorite

239
00:11:25,259 --> 00:11:32,980
hacking tools

240
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:35,560
because that's who they're two angles to

241
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:37,990
that one of them is probably know about

242
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:40,839
rubber ducky which is basically what you

243
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:42,029
do is you take a USB keyboard and you

244
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:45,699
pack it up in a very small package

245
00:11:42,029 --> 00:11:48,250
probably the size of this and then you

246
00:11:45,699 --> 00:11:50,560
program the keys to press all right so

247
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:53,769
imagine yourself being in front of a

248
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:55,180
load in machine you have a keyboard but

249
00:11:53,769 --> 00:11:56,649
you don't have a screen all right so you

250
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:58,630
type something and something happens so

251
00:11:56,649 --> 00:12:01,180
this is this is a very nice thing to do

252
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:04,180
and I'm not doing penetration testing

253
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:05,829
but I know that this this method is

254
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:07,540
usually out of scope because it's so

255
00:12:05,829 --> 00:12:10,719
evil that companies don't really want to

256
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:12,699
take this into death coordinate so

257
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:17,560
that's one thing the other thing and

258
00:12:12,699 --> 00:12:20,920
this is what this is very scary actually

259
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:23,589
the other thing about USB keyboards is

260
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:25,630
similar similar vector is that you have

261
00:12:23,589 --> 00:12:27,310
Evo made in your corporate environment

262
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:29,199
so you have your Nokia office you have a

263
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:29,709
keyboards normal use the t-bolt they all

264
00:12:29,199 --> 00:12:31,899
look the same

265
00:12:29,709 --> 00:12:34,380
what you do if you put something inside

266
00:12:31,899 --> 00:12:36,880
your keyboard right and you swap it

267
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:39,250
someone comes in they do their work the

268
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:40,750
keyboard wants us as it should it's not

269
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:43,199
loving the keys because that's that

270
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:46,480
simple all right come in the keys is no

271
00:12:43,199 --> 00:12:51,339
easy thing to do one of my favorite

272
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:53,829
thing is that when the keyboard when the

273
00:12:51,339 --> 00:12:56,380
user logs out of the windows I press

274
00:12:53,829 --> 00:12:58,479
windows Cannell right the placement of

275
00:12:56,380 --> 00:13:00,880
them and they go up what this keyboard

276
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:02,500
is doing for example it's not like I

277
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:06,490
mean no one ever done that

278
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:09,790
obviously the keyboard intercepts the

279
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:12,069
windows out a shortcut and before it

280
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:13,990
sends Windows L it does something else

281
00:13:12,069 --> 00:13:14,469
right in the background and then in

282
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:17,350
sense

283
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:19,240
and because people when they are working

284
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:21,730
for to go to the toilet or get a coffee

285
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:23,500
they just press those two tees and leave

286
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:26,500
and don't look at the screens so

287
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:28,180
something happens before the lock screen

288
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:30,160
appears all right and there's something

289
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:32,170
is how you own a machine

290
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:33,520
all right so the evil might copy the

291
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:35,349
environment someone comes in to pee in

292
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:39,069
the office they swap out if you match

293
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:43,620
and it's like very scary actually

294
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:46,270
so assuming that we have a keyboard that

295
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:50,050
does something evil and this is not

296
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:53,980
hundred percent accurate example because

297
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:57,910
when you have a when you have a good

298
00:13:53,980 --> 00:14:00,430
criminal working with this with this

299
00:13:57,910 --> 00:14:02,350
vector then you will not let you know

300
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:04,630
that this being that this is happening I

301
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:06,640
don't mean only hackers with big egos

302
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:09,250
they always want to leave the marks

303
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:10,990
behind all right so on is good you

304
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:12,670
probably never know that the keyboard is

305
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:15,880
evil and that's that's the problem with

306
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:17,380
it because it's very hard to detect but

307
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:18,910
for therefore the training for the

308
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:22,840
learning purposes we just assume that

309
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:24,490
the keyboard is the keyboard is you and

310
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:26,260
we know keys are doing press will to a

311
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:27,220
nicety what you see what's happening up

312
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:29,650
see we don't want to connect the

313
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:31,470
keyboard to the to the PC directly

314
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:33,610
because you don't want to get hurt again

315
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:40,720
so we need something to filter the data

316
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:42,910
and to understand the data so a beta we

317
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,500
are talking of what's on the bottom

318
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:47,079
device was on the keyboard and how to

319
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:51,130
how to how do we how can we see what's

320
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:53,500
in there nowadays luckily everything 0

321
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:55,689
now I don't want to bother you with

322
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:58,900
history because that I'm taking a few

323
00:14:55,690 --> 00:15:01,150
hours but in the olden days staff was

324
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:04,270
parallel which means a bits were being

325
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:06,760
sent over eight lines nowadays is just

326
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:10,240
one bit after one bit on one wire or two

327
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:13,870
wires when it's bi-directional what I'm

328
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:18,490
where I'm going this is that it's quite

329
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:20,850
simple to capture the data and this is a

330
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:24,640
this is the way our personal problems

331
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:27,850
some making a problem absurd or very

332
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:29,649
abstract so that I can I can work from

333
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:31,480
obstruct solution to our problem is

334
00:15:29,649 --> 00:15:34,149
something that's feasible in this case

335
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:39,279
because this is data is on one wire ones

336
00:15:34,149 --> 00:15:42,069
and zeros so if I had a multimeter which

337
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:43,360
mine is voltage zero is low voltage

338
00:15:42,069 --> 00:15:46,779
while is hi Bob

339
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:48,699
so if I attach my D mm the meter to the

340
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:51,430
wire and measured the voltage I could

341
00:15:48,699 --> 00:15:51,880
just get those ones and zeros write them

342
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:56,370
down

343
00:15:51,880 --> 00:16:00,339
right one after the other and then if I

344
00:15:56,370 --> 00:16:02,529
enough time and type I could just put

345
00:16:00,339 --> 00:16:05,410
them together and understand what the

346
00:16:02,529 --> 00:16:08,709
protocol is how it's how its and what

347
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:11,110
the data is and because the most of the

348
00:16:08,709 --> 00:16:13,029
protocols unless they are encrypted even

349
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:15,880
if I encrypted you can usually get some

350
00:16:13,029 --> 00:16:17,439
information from the encrypted data it's

351
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:18,699
out there right the only thing that's

352
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:20,470
stopping here some understand what's

353
00:16:18,699 --> 00:16:23,019
happening on the one is our time and the

354
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:25,870
effort put into the unders into the into

355
00:16:23,019 --> 00:16:28,329
doing some reason all right as I said

356
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:29,709
all the protocols are described

357
00:16:28,329 --> 00:16:32,199
somewhere on the internet and they

358
00:16:29,709 --> 00:16:34,359
usually free for us to get them so

359
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:35,250
obviously nowadays you have a scenes to

360
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:38,050
do that for us

361
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:39,970
we don't have to write anything down and

362
00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:44,439
one of the machine is the oscilloscope

363
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:45,970
now if I go like I cannot buy an

364
00:16:44,439 --> 00:16:50,259
oscilloscope I cannot be have at our

365
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:53,560
hacker that's not exactly true but what

366
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:55,290
I want to say here today amongst other

367
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:57,849
things that if you have an opportunity

368
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:59,380
like a hacker space and make a space

369
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:01,839
because they usually have those staff

370
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:04,059
available for you to play with going

371
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:05,880
them like this is really important

372
00:17:04,059 --> 00:17:08,349
because when you have a hacker

373
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:11,470
challengers work for example you can buy

374
00:17:08,349 --> 00:17:13,329
a black hacker black box that does the

375
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:15,909
job for you but when you have real

376
00:17:13,329 --> 00:17:18,309
challenges with will say criminals they

377
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:19,929
don't usually do stuff as you would

378
00:17:18,309 --> 00:17:21,819
expect them right and have to go to the

379
00:17:19,929 --> 00:17:23,589
deeper levels you have to be able to

380
00:17:21,819 --> 00:17:25,658
understand how the data flows back and

381
00:17:23,589 --> 00:17:28,480
forth on the lowest levels that's why if

382
00:17:25,659 --> 00:17:33,100
you get this opportunity you definitely

383
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:35,200
need to learn how to how to operate this

384
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:38,110
this type of machine so what an

385
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:40,480
oscilloscope is doing and may be able to

386
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:42,309
do this here so

387
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:47,889
that's Keith measures voltage against

388
00:17:42,309 --> 00:17:50,158
time so what it does work so it probably

389
00:17:47,889 --> 00:17:53,559
won't be on the video

390
00:17:50,159 --> 00:17:55,570
that's fine but you will see it and I

391
00:17:53,559 --> 00:17:57,759
will explain later and then come

392
00:17:55,570 --> 00:18:00,580
together it draws a line will scream

393
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:03,159
right like this this is your time base

394
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:06,759
this is that the speed of the dog is

395
00:18:03,159 --> 00:18:10,960
constant on the X and so the time

396
00:18:06,759 --> 00:18:13,330
controls the the x-axis and the voltage

397
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:16,659
controls the y-axis so as the voltage

398
00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:18,970
changes goes up down up and down up and

399
00:18:16,659 --> 00:18:21,489
down and this if you do it fast enough

400
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:22,859
you don't get a dot you get a line and

401
00:18:21,489 --> 00:18:25,989
they look something like this

402
00:18:22,859 --> 00:18:28,570
this is that the old school source code

403
00:18:25,989 --> 00:18:32,080
the slower that the dot moves the

404
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:33,850
brighter the the the line is so you see

405
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:35,408
when it moves horizontally it's bright

406
00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:37,509
because it's moving slowly then it drops

407
00:18:35,409 --> 00:18:39,129
very quickly to the bottom that's why

408
00:18:37,509 --> 00:18:41,350
you cannot you almost cannot see the

409
00:18:39,129 --> 00:18:43,600
line because it's so fast alright so

410
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:45,369
this is the the principle behind the

411
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:51,340
oscilloscope measures voltage against

412
00:18:45,369 --> 00:18:56,529
time and the that was a simple that's

413
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:59,199
not simple those knobs and switches they

414
00:18:56,529 --> 00:19:01,450
are again intimidating unfortunately but

415
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:05,230
I mean those are the types of devices

416
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:06,820
that I started my my time learning about

417
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:08,980
hardware

418
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:12,609
it takes a while to get on to understand

419
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:16,509
what's happening there and the but again

420
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:18,428
if you get a chance because it takes it

421
00:19:16,509 --> 00:19:19,840
takes a while as I said to understand

422
00:19:18,429 --> 00:19:21,909
them I get the chance I understand how

423
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:24,609
to operate this device you will be able

424
00:19:21,909 --> 00:19:26,289
to operate any modern oscilloscope

425
00:19:24,609 --> 00:19:27,820
because the principles are still decide

426
00:19:26,289 --> 00:19:30,249
so if you start with something difficult

427
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:32,980
and then you move to the usb one which I

428
00:19:30,249 --> 00:19:37,149
have here you will be able to use them

429
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:39,759
and utilize all the features that they

430
00:19:37,149 --> 00:19:42,399
have if you start from this and then you

431
00:19:39,759 --> 00:19:45,009
go to our job that has top oscilloscope

432
00:19:42,399 --> 00:19:50,139
proper the Altos to the Scopes if you

433
00:19:45,009 --> 00:19:51,909
like so and the the biggest not on there

434
00:19:50,139 --> 00:19:54,100
is that the stickers I have for you

435
00:19:51,909 --> 00:19:56,460
today that falling out some

436
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:58,750
whatever be available some ways maybe

437
00:19:56,460 --> 00:20:00,520
inspired by the biggest note that this

438
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:02,770
is the time-base know this is how you

439
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:04,690
define how you control the speed of the

440
00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:06,639
doctor the horizontal line is the

441
00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:09,130
biggest one because it's the most most

442
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:11,230
important wonder if you work well scope

443
00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:15,610
this is the most important one that's

444
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:17,620
used nowadays that simpler ones they

445
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:20,919
don't have those knobs they don't have

446
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:22,479
that nice being screen they are

447
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:26,760
obviously better because the taken

448
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:30,340
forward but the eternal does sexy and

449
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:32,530
and we have USB ones which is the the

450
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:35,070
ones I have here this is the picker

451
00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:38,740
scope and this is the same thing one

452
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:41,889
just they are good but they are not as

453
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:45,550
well as the as the the standard on one

454
00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:48,730
has the price one of them this is the

455
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:51,520
side is more digital this one is more an

456
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:55,210
ERG either both of them have the

457
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:57,160
problems for me someone who learn to

458
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:59,770
work the proper service copes it takes a

459
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:02,230
lot of deep breaths and counting to 10

460
00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:04,240
to use them because there they have the

461
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:06,040
problems but they work right they I will

462
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:08,410
show you how they work in a bit

463
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:09,970
and they also logic analyzers so for

464
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:13,030
example if you're doing do is be only in

465
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:17,560
your life by a logic analyzer because

466
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:21,010
USB the current USB USB to high-speed is

467
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:24,360
close to 500 megabits and they use be

468
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:26,680
free is I think five gigabits so

469
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:28,689
standalone oscilloscope to analyze it

470
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:30,760
because you liked seven 100 thousand

471
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:32,560
pounds alright so but the energy

472
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:34,870
analyzer for that is much much more

473
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:37,270
affordable so there also note you can

474
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:39,580
horizon and honestly the thing you want

475
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:42,490
it's basically a logic analyzer that has

476
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:45,490
some another capability but yeah this is

477
00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:48,090
just a hello Jacana is not really our

478
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:48,090
oscilloscope

479
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:54,970
do you mean one no you don't need my but

480
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:57,910
it will be good if you learn how to use

481
00:21:54,970 --> 00:22:03,010
it at some point as I said you may or

482
00:21:57,910 --> 00:22:07,150
you will encounter something that no

483
00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:07,789
hacker box black hockey box that you buy

484
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:11,149
a line

485
00:22:07,789 --> 00:22:13,940
or thirty quid we'll analyze and you

486
00:22:11,149 --> 00:22:17,059
will have to be use you have to use the

487
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:19,159
the old type oscilloscope DoD did

488
00:22:17,059 --> 00:22:21,499
standalone title sort of scope and again

489
00:22:19,159 --> 00:22:23,450
if you had a practice if you take this

490
00:22:21,499 --> 00:22:24,679
bolt or some other boat go to a hacker

491
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:27,340
will make a space they have an

492
00:22:24,679 --> 00:22:29,479
oscilloscope you play with it then you

493
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:33,738
you have this advantage of actually

494
00:22:29,479 --> 00:22:34,220
being able to understand how it how it

495
00:22:33,739 --> 00:22:39,200
works

496
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:40,159
so let's connect it up and I'm try hi

497
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,859
Seth

498
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:44,629
I bought this USB keyboard the wireless

499
00:22:42,859 --> 00:23:54,668
key with yesterday sir I don't know if

500
00:22:44,629 --> 00:23:59,988
it's gonna work but I see yes that's

501
00:23:54,669 --> 00:24:02,690
deep breaths shouting to turn it's it's

502
00:23:59,989 --> 00:24:06,429
not the best thing out there right so

503
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:10,639
this looks like it actually is connected

504
00:24:06,429 --> 00:24:13,129
okay so what I'm going to do the other

505
00:24:10,639 --> 00:24:15,529
important thing that you will if you get

506
00:24:13,129 --> 00:24:17,509
the chance to learn about the scopes the

507
00:24:15,529 --> 00:24:18,770
trigger the trigger is when you start to

508
00:24:17,509 --> 00:24:22,340
measure up measure of

509
00:24:18,770 --> 00:24:24,379
and that Sadie doesn't support drive you

510
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:28,010
which for me for so much work the source

511
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:30,500
code is like it's good but you have to

512
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:33,590
start the measurement or something so

513
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:38,030
what I'm gonna do here is I have a

514
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:45,620
trigger that takes the sentiment wow it

515
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:49,100
actually knows something so okay so I

516
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:52,370
said I will show you our low speed USB

517
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:54,350
but this is actually a high speed USB so

518
00:24:52,370 --> 00:24:59,059
if I change the settings here

519
00:24:54,350 --> 00:25:03,678
I should high speed with full speed

520
00:24:59,059 --> 00:25:09,379
ah there we go so when you look at it at

521
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:10,130
the lowest levels of USB hardware this

522
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:12,230
is how it looks

523
00:25:10,130 --> 00:25:14,450
it's just ones and zeroes I mean it's

524
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:17,660
it's a bit more complicated with USB

525
00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:19,850
because you must be for us as and use

526
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:22,460
that USB is very simple because we

527
00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:24,469
planted in it works on the on the back

528
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:26,150
end is quite complicated because stumble

529
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:27,850
to make something defender usually have

530
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:33,380
to attempt to show through many hoops

531
00:25:27,850 --> 00:25:36,379
but what we have here is just the glance

532
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:38,000
and zero of that flow on the USB and

533
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:40,730
what I want to show you here if I can

534
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:44,120
find it I presume to what type of what

535
00:25:40,730 --> 00:25:57,200
types of things you can find if you are

536
00:25:44,120 --> 00:26:00,469
trying to analyze the the protocol so

537
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:03,980
for example the way USB works when is

538
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:09,520
when is first connected it you can

539
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:12,010
connect up 220 27 devices to a USB bus

540
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:15,559
each of them guess it's an address

541
00:26:12,010 --> 00:26:18,950
assigned at some point by default they

542
00:26:15,559 --> 00:26:21,200
are they answer to the address of 0 and

543
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:24,530
the host just like we see here is

544
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:27,200
assigning the D address and what I am

545
00:26:24,530 --> 00:26:29,809
looking for at the moment is a packet

546
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:32,160
set of packet that will assign the

547
00:26:29,809 --> 00:26:35,129
address

548
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:41,020
we're not waste too much time for this

549
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:43,180
ah there we go so this is the packet

550
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:45,340
that is assigning G in the address I

551
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:48,550
know because the second byte on the

552
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:50,770
packet is four five in hexa doesn't

553
00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:56,520
matter this deal of sixteen and the

554
00:26:50,770 --> 00:27:01,270
address is 12 in hex and if we go lower

555
00:26:56,520 --> 00:27:03,280
so much further down the road you see

556
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:03,970
that the the packets are being sent to

557
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:07,139
address

558
00:27:03,970 --> 00:27:11,230
12 so I mean this doesn't get you much

559
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:14,080
data but you can get if you have a scope

560
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:16,750
or logic analyzer even the cheapest one

561
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:19,030
you will be able to understand how the

562
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:21,160
USB works on the relatives and you'll be

563
00:27:19,030 --> 00:27:24,760
able to design a thing that you can

564
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:27,640
connect to a NSA charger but account all

565
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:28,960
right and my training will provide you

566
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:31,180
this information so you don't have to

567
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:33,190
have an oscilloscope to actually to work

568
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:36,970
on this because I will explain what this

569
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:37,690
hold is no sense is but this is how this

570
00:27:36,970 --> 00:27:42,520
is how it works

571
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:44,830
and these decide II is gonna go about

572
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:47,800
this but Sadie has some problem with

573
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:51,220
some issues because you cannot export

574
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:56,139
the data as you want and and honestly

575
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:58,510
sometimes it just just as fast anyway so

576
00:27:56,140 --> 00:28:01,660
this is how USB looked on the on the on

577
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:03,790
the lowest levels if I go further I will

578
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:08,110
show you something more interesting if

579
00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:15,899
this goes well we have seen you have

580
00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:15,899
been at low speed but the full speed so

581
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:23,110
given you with you with limited number

582
00:28:19,570 --> 00:28:25,300
of particles because there's like 20 the

583
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:27,159
most common ones but usually one have a

584
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:27,669
few of them so we'll just be as we've

585
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:33,220
seen before

586
00:28:27,670 --> 00:28:37,570
USB like it is not being used for inside

587
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:39,700
hardware communications this SPI which

588
00:28:37,570 --> 00:28:41,850
is a nice Percy which are being used to

589
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:44,340
talk with routing devices inside are

590
00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:46,559
larger so we have a route

591
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:49,649
for example have a CPU has a CPU and as

592
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:52,678
a memory day there's a good chance the

593
00:28:49,650 --> 00:28:56,880
communications between the the CPU and

594
00:28:52,679 --> 00:28:58,850
the memory is over SPL and you don't

595
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:01,440
have others to future all right Mike

596
00:28:58,850 --> 00:29:03,110
know that there's no wires to feature

597
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:06,830
anymore

598
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:10,199
so yeah SPI speci between components and

599
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:11,760
UART is the the the protocol that used

600
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:13,440
to communicate to the outside so if you

601
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:17,039
hack your route air box doesn't zero

602
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:21,870
also that you connect your you are to s

603
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:24,419
be adapter and this is what you use the

604
00:29:21,870 --> 00:29:28,408
the UART is the protocol used to

605
00:29:24,419 --> 00:29:30,450
complete to the absol world and you try

606
00:29:28,409 --> 00:29:33,299
and you will note that USB inside you

607
00:29:30,450 --> 00:29:35,010
don't get up USB inside the device

608
00:29:33,299 --> 00:29:37,020
because it's really pain to set it up

609
00:29:35,010 --> 00:29:38,820
because like I said it's easy for us as

610
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:41,490
an end user so it's very difficult on

611
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:44,520
the of the on the inside but then again

612
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:48,570
I had before if you get an enemy a clear

613
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:52,070
we know that but that wants to mess up

614
00:29:48,570 --> 00:29:56,220
your life they will just do that alright

615
00:29:52,070 --> 00:30:01,200
so we need to connect the key word to

616
00:29:56,220 --> 00:30:04,470
something and high-level overview of USB

617
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:07,799
is that USB is a USB device can be there

618
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:11,429
a host or a peripheral alright and that

619
00:30:07,799 --> 00:30:12,870
they there's also USB on-the-go which

620
00:30:11,429 --> 00:30:15,659
allows the device to be configured

621
00:30:12,870 --> 00:30:17,520
either as a peripheral as as a whole so

622
00:30:15,659 --> 00:30:19,230
for example your phone when they'll

623
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:21,929
connect it to your PC there is a

624
00:30:19,230 --> 00:30:25,590
peripheral but you connect our USB cable

625
00:30:21,929 --> 00:30:28,980
to your pound and this our host so we

626
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:32,129
look for USB hubs right and we look for

627
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:35,970
us behold breakout PCB and we find this

628
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:38,130
thingy and this thingy it says this is

629
00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:40,919
an additive machine but we don't know to

630
00:30:38,130 --> 00:30:43,230
go too easy on this because we want to

631
00:30:40,919 --> 00:30:45,720
learn how this thing works and honestly

632
00:30:43,230 --> 00:30:52,799
if you put that on another network

633
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:54,360
because this is so the other thing I

634
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:55,889
want to talk about is data because

635
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:57,750
people who get intimidated by death

636
00:30:55,890 --> 00:30:58,050
issues and I'm getting intimidated by

637
00:30:57,750 --> 00:31:00,930
that

638
00:30:58,050 --> 00:31:03,030
because there are sometimes so awful

639
00:31:00,930 --> 00:31:05,430
like I'm if I'm designing something and

640
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:07,710
I want to find the device I'm looking at

641
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:09,120
datasheet it's it just crap I will just

642
00:31:07,710 --> 00:31:11,310
move away and take a lot because

643
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:14,159
sometimes it makes you feel like the

644
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:17,700
manufacturers want you want you to hate

645
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:20,610
the device like it's it's just awful and

646
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:22,830
other than that obviously we are still

647
00:31:20,610 --> 00:31:25,290
using the two column layout of documents

648
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:26,939
like we're printing anything but we have

649
00:31:25,290 --> 00:31:31,649
two columns and when you scrub have to

650
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:36,660
scroll here yes they make you angry and

651
00:31:31,650 --> 00:31:38,280
but you all the information that you

652
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:39,030
need is that all right so if you take

653
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:41,730
deep breaths

654
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:43,350
if you come to ten all the information

655
00:31:41,730 --> 00:31:46,590
that you need to work on the device is

656
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:48,959
there so if you find the data sheet that

657
00:31:46,590 --> 00:31:51,209
you cannot understand and it is written

658
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:52,740
in some strange language it's not you is

659
00:31:51,210 --> 00:31:56,400
that right it's their fault because

660
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:58,380
that's what they do and if we if we

661
00:31:56,400 --> 00:32:00,120
design with something obviously with a

662
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:01,560
mobile iphone for this device if you're

663
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:02,010
not having something you have to use

664
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:04,800
what we have

665
00:32:02,010 --> 00:32:06,629
so there the other thing I want to tell

666
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:08,070
you about don't trust what it says on

667
00:32:06,630 --> 00:32:11,340
the label it says this is yours because

668
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:13,889
that when you feel it's not what it is

669
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:17,399
in fact this this device here that I had

670
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:21,150
a picture month ago is a a breakout PCB

671
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:24,210
for a controller max feet 2 3 4 2 1

672
00:32:21,150 --> 00:32:27,150
which is the USB controller and it's

673
00:32:24,210 --> 00:32:28,980
this this PCB doesn't do anything it

674
00:32:27,150 --> 00:32:30,600
just has that the controller on it that

675
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:34,050
has all the parts connected to stuff

676
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:35,870
right so yeah it's not an Arduino she I

677
00:32:34,050 --> 00:32:39,389
mean it may be used as one but

678
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:42,870
effectively it's just a control on a PCB

679
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:45,690
and it can also be used as a powerful

680
00:32:42,870 --> 00:32:50,280
which the manufacturer of the DCP never

681
00:32:45,690 --> 00:32:52,050
told you and from the datasheet we

682
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:55,170
learned that this dis control talks over

683
00:32:52,050 --> 00:32:57,360
SPI Sony something speaking SPI and the

684
00:32:55,170 --> 00:32:59,040
best bet is how do we know because I

685
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:02,699
know you know speaks as peer out of the

686
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:04,379
box and the word about out there you

687
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:09,779
know for me is that is a good platform

688
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:13,679
to them once you learn how to use

689
00:33:09,779 --> 00:33:17,700
how to change states on pins how to

690
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:19,769
control stuff over without Reno move

691
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:22,830
away from it how to be nervous and

692
00:33:19,769 --> 00:33:24,840
really not our classroom to build stuff

693
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:27,749
that well that are supposed to be using

694
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:33,718
production because Arduino code makes

695
00:33:27,749 --> 00:33:34,649
you use makes you write bad code that's

696
00:33:33,719 --> 00:33:37,799
all there is

697
00:33:34,649 --> 00:33:39,629
right you will learn and then you move

698
00:33:37,799 --> 00:33:41,279
to something that's that's not our do

699
00:33:39,629 --> 00:33:44,218
you know and you'll be completely lost

700
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:45,869
right so once you start once you get the

701
00:33:44,219 --> 00:33:50,129
grasp of are doing of how it works

702
00:33:45,869 --> 00:33:52,529
who - like then but don't use it you

703
00:33:50,129 --> 00:33:54,119
know for for something that has to be

704
00:33:52,529 --> 00:33:57,899
manufactured right don't use it as a

705
00:33:54,119 --> 00:33:58,349
production gun so we collect you know

706
00:33:57,899 --> 00:34:01,109
what

707
00:33:58,349 --> 00:34:02,700
and it doesn't work right and it doesn't

708
00:34:01,109 --> 00:34:05,728
work because this is what hardware

709
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:12,929
hacking is so the first job with this

710
00:34:05,729 --> 00:34:15,569
this this this PCB is that is it because

711
00:34:12,929 --> 00:34:18,539
as you might know maybe you know the USB

712
00:34:15,569 --> 00:34:21,538
is a 5 volt pass which means the devices

713
00:34:18,539 --> 00:34:24,779
are being powered by 5 volts USB now the

714
00:34:21,539 --> 00:34:29,250
max faithful to one device that the chip

715
00:34:24,779 --> 00:34:32,159
that's on this BCPs 3.3 volts so someone

716
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:36,239
who designed this PCB they protected the

717
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:40,710
5 volt pin of the USB to 3.3 pin on the

718
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:43,678
max right because Wow right and the I

719
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:46,139
found this is a clone or a spin-off or

720
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:48,629
something so she beat Apple designed

721
00:34:46,139 --> 00:34:53,339
eight years ago and the original author

722
00:34:48,629 --> 00:34:55,618
maybe it wasn't original said that yes I

723
00:34:53,339 --> 00:34:56,578
checked it doesn't work USB doesn't work

724
00:34:55,619 --> 00:34:59,069
with people he votes

725
00:34:56,579 --> 00:35:00,990
I checked with keyboards they don't work

726
00:34:59,069 --> 00:35:03,390
I checked with my state of the world but

727
00:35:00,990 --> 00:35:07,740
he is a PCB right you know private why

728
00:35:03,390 --> 00:35:09,720
are you doing this so that's the first

729
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:12,270
trap you can make filo wrap and you

730
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:16,049
don't have a PCB of a break above

731
00:35:12,270 --> 00:35:18,660
because it just blows up second trap and

732
00:35:16,049 --> 00:35:19,410
the question that I had that I talked to

733
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:23,240
you about though

734
00:35:19,410 --> 00:35:25,670
what Dantas does the STI realm you read

735
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:28,189
because the SBI doesn't define the

736
00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:30,260
voltage all right did the despi runs on

737
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:34,010
something called system voltage so for

738
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:34,430
example if you are MCU CPU runs on five

739
00:35:34,010 --> 00:35:38,119
pounds

740
00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:41,779
SPE will be 5 volts if it can be

741
00:35:38,119 --> 00:35:43,849
frequently 1.2 1.6 whatever so there

742
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:47,660
isn't a straight answer to the question

743
00:35:43,849 --> 00:35:49,700
of what voltage does SPI random usually

744
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:51,230
you just have to go somewhere else we'll

745
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:53,540
have to look at the PCB and find out

746
00:35:51,230 --> 00:35:54,710
what the system voltage of the PCB it is

747
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:56,240
another case

748
00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:59,150
it tries on a different pocket right

749
00:35:56,240 --> 00:36:03,078
because I'll do you know is 5 volts our

750
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:06,320
SPI on our device on the USB host is few

751
00:36:03,079 --> 00:36:08,690
puffy you connect them together and you

752
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:11,510
don't have a PCB yeah right so that's

753
00:36:08,690 --> 00:36:15,109
the second loss because once you put 5

754
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:22,700
volt SPI signal into 3.3 volt divided

755
00:36:15,109 --> 00:36:25,700
just third trap press bi is a full

756
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:27,859
duplex which means you can send data at

757
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:29,089
the same time in both ways so it's

758
00:36:27,859 --> 00:36:31,730
sending and receiving this is the

759
00:36:29,089 --> 00:36:34,310
definition of the toko Maxim was

760
00:36:31,730 --> 00:36:36,290
designed that the the manufacturer of

761
00:36:34,310 --> 00:36:40,400
the end of the chip hacked it a bit and

762
00:36:36,290 --> 00:36:42,770
maybe I have to place so you send and

763
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:44,660
then we see and from that perspective it

764
00:36:42,770 --> 00:36:49,369
was a very nice idea because they design

765
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:53,089
a design device to be used in small

766
00:36:49,369 --> 00:36:56,030
devices so into a small to be as small

767
00:36:53,089 --> 00:37:00,410
as possible way they hacked it they use

768
00:36:56,030 --> 00:37:02,210
one line of the SPI the bus as a

769
00:37:00,410 --> 00:37:04,940
bi-directional one so you send the

770
00:37:02,210 --> 00:37:09,140
command and then the device is switching

771
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:10,550
as I took the other direction on the

772
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:12,379
same line you get the information back

773
00:37:10,550 --> 00:37:15,380
but obviously I do you know it's not

774
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:16,849
supporting that because why would it so

775
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:20,450
you connected it up in doesn't work

776
00:37:16,849 --> 00:37:21,950
because this is half duplex and I spent

777
00:37:20,450 --> 00:37:24,589
a moment to understand what's actually

778
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:27,049
happening because this is not sharp of

779
00:37:24,589 --> 00:37:28,640
someone who's experienced that I I know

780
00:37:27,050 --> 00:37:30,440
how history works I don't have to read

781
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:34,069
that the nine line it says in the manual

782
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:36,410
this is half duplex I didn't really

783
00:37:34,069 --> 00:37:37,700
spend too much time on the datasheet so

784
00:37:36,410 --> 00:37:39,440
me away to understand why it doesn't

785
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:41,720
work it doesn't work because it's a trap

786
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:45,350
and by default you can swap switch it

787
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:47,839
this device still full duplex but by

788
00:37:45,350 --> 00:37:49,880
default when you power it up it comes up

789
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:52,640
last half - so yeah

790
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:55,520
just careful what you reading and this

791
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:58,790
is the best one when you look at the

792
00:37:55,520 --> 00:38:02,570
bottom of the PCB the bottom the bottom

793
00:37:58,790 --> 00:38:05,840
the bottom right you have four pins this

794
00:38:02,570 --> 00:38:09,770
is a describer this is master out slain

795
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:11,690
in master in slave out crock and SS

796
00:38:09,770 --> 00:38:14,570
which is slave select to see the four

797
00:38:11,690 --> 00:38:18,710
lines that using the SPI what it

798
00:38:14,570 --> 00:38:21,530
actually is this is from left right this

799
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:24,260
is croc master in slave out master out

800
00:38:21,530 --> 00:38:26,450
sleep in a slave select why because this

801
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:30,260
is happy hacking right by something it

802
00:38:26,450 --> 00:38:32,390
says that what isn't true so again it

803
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:34,730
took me a while to understand why this

804
00:38:32,390 --> 00:38:35,960
thing doesn't work and should work it is

805
00:38:34,730 --> 00:38:38,810
connected it doesn't work well it

806
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:42,680
doesn't work because someone made a

807
00:38:38,810 --> 00:38:45,380
mistake so don't have the chops that you

808
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:48,020
have on them when you do a hardware

809
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:49,880
hacking and coming back to my slides for

810
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:52,130
my moment ago about things being

811
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:54,020
intimidating this is intimidating right

812
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:56,690
because you know that it should work

813
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:59,780
it's all connect setup it's all proper

814
00:38:56,690 --> 00:39:04,730
but it still doesn't work and this what

815
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:07,700
it is it's just normal right so try not

816
00:39:04,730 --> 00:39:12,130
to be too intimidated by those things

817
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:15,109
because they are normal and natural and

818
00:39:12,130 --> 00:39:18,560
the manufacturers are usually don't want

819
00:39:15,110 --> 00:39:22,880
us to get you so we draw out some balls

820
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:25,490
and after the jostle bolts buy another

821
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:27,830
one it eventually starts to work

822
00:39:25,490 --> 00:39:30,189
hopefully and this is what I will try to

823
00:39:27,830 --> 00:39:30,190
show you

824
00:39:40,100 --> 00:40:10,848
[Music]

825
00:39:41,630 --> 00:40:12,920
I forgot to tell you a couple of sides

826
00:40:10,849 --> 00:40:16,309
before when I was talking about the SPI

827
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:18,200
voltage there's our arm how you deal

828
00:40:16,309 --> 00:40:21,470
with the different voltages on the SPI

829
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:25,189
you have a magic thing called SPI not

830
00:40:21,470 --> 00:40:26,930
SPI just level converter it's best

831
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:29,390
described what it does is best described

832
00:40:26,930 --> 00:40:31,038
as magic and is explained in this book

833
00:40:29,390 --> 00:40:32,900
so if you really want to find out how it

834
00:40:31,039 --> 00:40:35,359
works it's you know go through this book

835
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:37,930
and at some point I will explain note

836
00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:40,250
that on the training how it works but

837
00:40:37,930 --> 00:40:42,500
that's how we'll deal with this right so

838
00:40:40,250 --> 00:40:45,170
someone have this problem before us and

839
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:47,869
they just design and voltage level come

840
00:40:45,170 --> 00:40:49,309
by this frequency on one side fivefold

841
00:40:47,869 --> 00:40:51,049
on the other side you couldn't them

842
00:40:49,309 --> 00:41:10,670
together and the magic happens

843
00:40:51,049 --> 00:41:12,589
and it just works good nap I had to

844
00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:14,289
remove some slides from the from the

845
00:41:12,589 --> 00:41:17,328
presentation because it was wrong and

846
00:41:14,289 --> 00:41:20,180
what I wanted to tell you about what you

847
00:41:17,329 --> 00:41:22,069
need to start to build your app there

848
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:24,710
was several minutes about talking about

849
00:41:22,069 --> 00:41:28,369
this one of the things that you need to

850
00:41:24,710 --> 00:41:31,069
get is the think of breadboard which is

851
00:41:28,369 --> 00:41:33,980
this thing that you have that you have

852
00:41:31,069 --> 00:41:35,569
here which is basically something that

853
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:38,119
lets you get away without soldering

854
00:41:35,569 --> 00:41:40,130
stuff right so because you connect you

855
00:41:38,119 --> 00:41:44,000
put things on it you connect so wise you

856
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:45,470
put some wires in and it just works but

857
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:48,650
what I wanted to tell you on the other

858
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:52,788
slide that that's nots not there is that

859
00:41:48,650 --> 00:41:54,349
it's again as Arduino it's not something

860
00:41:52,789 --> 00:41:57,559
that should be used it using

861
00:41:54,349 --> 00:42:02,809
the product you use it to learn or you

862
00:41:57,559 --> 00:42:04,430
use it to debug stuff but you may use it

863
00:42:02,809 --> 00:42:09,219
for and the actual products and I will

864
00:42:04,430 --> 00:42:09,219
show you hopefully why is that

865
00:42:10,269 --> 00:42:19,180
what not actually works no there's

866
00:42:15,949 --> 00:42:19,180
something wrong here

867
00:42:24,519 --> 00:42:37,788
actually there is something wrong here

868
00:42:26,559 --> 00:42:40,489
but okay this is actually okay so that

869
00:42:37,789 --> 00:42:42,709
the breadboard it shouldn't be used in

870
00:42:40,489 --> 00:42:45,349
an actual product because people

871
00:42:42,709 --> 00:42:46,759
sometimes do like those robots and stuff

872
00:42:45,349 --> 00:42:48,920
when you put stuff together on a

873
00:42:46,759 --> 00:42:52,009
breadboard connected ugly y'all happy it

874
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:54,229
works it works by accident because

875
00:42:52,009 --> 00:42:56,809
sometimes it will stop working and you

876
00:42:54,229 --> 00:42:59,058
will not know why and I will show you

877
00:42:56,809 --> 00:43:00,920
why it for example why it would stop

878
00:42:59,059 --> 00:43:05,979
supporting this is actually something

879
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:24,099
weird happening here that shouldn't be

880
00:43:05,979 --> 00:43:24,098
so the thing about breadboard because

881
00:43:25,180 --> 00:43:31,219
that's how we're happy you know

882
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:37,699
sometimes so sure that you know what

883
00:43:31,219 --> 00:43:41,719
you're doing the thing about the

884
00:43:37,699 --> 00:43:44,059
breadboard is that it's doesn't provide

885
00:43:41,719 --> 00:43:45,380
you the good connection so sometimes you

886
00:43:44,059 --> 00:43:48,999
will see something that's not really

887
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:54,259
there because you have all those wires

888
00:43:48,999 --> 00:44:03,279
crossing each other and they are adding

889
00:43:54,259 --> 00:44:03,279
some signals to the to the protocol

890
00:44:06,830 --> 00:44:11,330
[Music]

891
00:44:07,990 --> 00:44:14,990
it doesn't work as I wanted it to but

892
00:44:11,330 --> 00:44:17,180
basically what you have here on the

893
00:44:14,990 --> 00:44:19,669
lowest levels you have what the hell is

894
00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:22,910
going on here like I know that this they

895
00:44:19,670 --> 00:44:27,560
have to be something here I'm gonna just

896
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:33,379
work you know totally set up what you

897
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:38,509
see here is the the SBI communication so

898
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:41,510
this is your clock on the SPI here you

899
00:44:38,510 --> 00:44:44,540
have data out from the from the from the

900
00:44:41,510 --> 00:44:46,670
master and should be here the red one

901
00:44:44,540 --> 00:44:48,080
and the data coming back from this life

902
00:44:46,670 --> 00:44:50,390
you should be here

903
00:44:48,080 --> 00:45:00,819
it's not actually what I wanted to see

904
00:44:50,390 --> 00:45:06,740
here and I'll confuse you bastards

905
00:45:00,820 --> 00:45:08,240
anyway so this is this is the other

906
00:45:06,740 --> 00:45:10,189
device that I have today that the

907
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:12,020
thickest copies it's much more

908
00:45:10,190 --> 00:45:15,830
complicated than that they say v1

909
00:45:12,020 --> 00:45:18,259
because it's more analog one so you have

910
00:45:15,830 --> 00:45:20,299
more control over what you seeing at how

911
00:45:18,260 --> 00:45:22,070
you seeing it and what this thing it

912
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:26,930
should be doing if it was working as I

913
00:45:22,070 --> 00:45:30,320
wanted it to maybe I need to change it

914
00:45:26,930 --> 00:45:37,609
would be showing you the data I'll show

915
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:42,110
you the data now this is some nonsense

916
00:45:37,610 --> 00:45:44,510
it's not what I wanted to be doing so it

917
00:45:42,110 --> 00:45:46,790
will show you the data that's flowing on

918
00:45:44,510 --> 00:45:49,700
the SPI line which is quite convenient

919
00:45:46,790 --> 00:45:52,520
the thing that I wanted to show you on

920
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:56,000
this on this on this trace on this this

921
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:57,530
trace is that the the breadboard is

922
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:00,020
introducing some signals that are not

923
00:45:57,530 --> 00:46:03,200
either and those are those for example

924
00:46:00,020 --> 00:46:05,840
also do spikes here they are there

925
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:09,080
because the line the cloak line is right

926
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:10,880
here and the wires are too close to each

927
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:13,940
other this is high frequency signal

928
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:15,650
which means the is just jumping to the

929
00:46:13,940 --> 00:46:17,720
other wire right and this is because

930
00:46:15,650 --> 00:46:20,060
this is connected the way it is so

931
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:21,589
sometimes you will get away with high

932
00:46:20,060 --> 00:46:23,299
frequency signals on a backward

933
00:46:21,590 --> 00:46:25,370
sometimes you or not and you will build

934
00:46:23,300 --> 00:46:27,140
something else a robot that's talking

935
00:46:25,370 --> 00:46:29,960
over spi to some devices on high

936
00:46:27,140 --> 00:46:31,160
frequency you connected it up it doesn't

937
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:35,000
work it doesn't work because the

938
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:37,609
breadboard shouldn't use those type of

939
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:39,320
things and again if something doesn't

940
00:46:37,610 --> 00:46:41,690
work and you have access to our maker

941
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:44,420
space you can always go there and try to

942
00:46:41,690 --> 00:46:46,670
connect to a device like this and you

943
00:46:44,420 --> 00:46:48,440
for example see your spikes and then you

944
00:46:46,670 --> 00:46:52,190
know that there's something wrong

945
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:54,020
actually right there and that the

946
00:46:52,190 --> 00:46:55,640
problem wasn't that you didn't know how

947
00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:59,540
to do it the problem was present new

948
00:46:55,640 --> 00:47:01,879
bread right yeah I am really depressed

949
00:46:59,540 --> 00:47:03,350
that that it's not doing what I wanted

950
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:07,100
to do but we don't have time because

951
00:47:03,350 --> 00:47:09,290
you're almost out of time so but what

952
00:47:07,100 --> 00:47:12,020
it's doing basically this what is what

953
00:47:09,290 --> 00:47:13,910
this device is doing is just as Sayle

954
00:47:12,020 --> 00:47:18,340
dumping the data that is being sent

955
00:47:13,910 --> 00:47:23,000
because the data I'm sending from them

956
00:47:18,340 --> 00:47:28,400
from the Arduino to the SPI is right

957
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:32,030
here I'm sending those this is what I'm

958
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:33,860
sending those bytes here and they don't

959
00:47:32,030 --> 00:47:37,220
they don't match it sometimes it's

960
00:47:33,860 --> 00:47:39,980
probably some interference somewhere and

961
00:47:37,220 --> 00:47:41,750
this is also like I was playing with it

962
00:47:39,980 --> 00:47:44,300
yesterday or the day before and they're

963
00:47:41,750 --> 00:47:46,130
checking if it was because it won't but

964
00:47:44,300 --> 00:47:50,570
because this is an open ball and this is

965
00:47:46,130 --> 00:47:52,790
our low low voltage signal on a high

966
00:47:50,570 --> 00:47:54,350
frequency the thing that can be

967
00:47:52,790 --> 00:47:58,190
interfering with that is for example the

968
00:47:54,350 --> 00:48:00,230
Wi-Fi here right oh this the projector

969
00:47:58,190 --> 00:48:03,260
because the projector has some high

970
00:48:00,230 --> 00:48:05,480
frequency stuff in it it may be

971
00:48:03,260 --> 00:48:07,580
interfering with this right this is not

972
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:10,310
not how you measure high frequency

973
00:48:07,580 --> 00:48:15,980
signals this is just like to do this way

974
00:48:10,310 --> 00:48:18,970
so going back to my step out to talk

975
00:48:15,980 --> 00:48:23,020
about and I might actually make it

976
00:48:18,970 --> 00:48:23,020
without going over time

977
00:48:28,180 --> 00:48:31,339
[Music]

978
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:40,060
so the last thing for today

979
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:44,950
the the you want or the minus 2p2 so as

980
00:48:40,060 --> 00:48:47,410
to feature is a definition of how you

981
00:48:44,950 --> 00:48:50,319
want policy used to transport you at

982
00:48:47,410 --> 00:48:53,680
over that's what basically it is it

983
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:57,280
takes part like fifty or sixty s before

984
00:48:53,680 --> 00:49:00,339
before today and the thing about hours

985
00:48:57,280 --> 00:49:04,210
to the two is using much higher voltages

986
00:49:00,340 --> 00:49:06,430
then accepted by the things like Arduino

987
00:49:04,210 --> 00:49:09,010
so if you cannot ask you to to your

988
00:49:06,430 --> 00:49:12,250
Arduino not only it's not gonna work it

989
00:49:09,010 --> 00:49:14,560
probably will blow up because that's

990
00:49:12,250 --> 00:49:16,720
what it is that's why when I see that

991
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:18,610
people are buying USB to others to fit

992
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:20,439
two adapters I'm think you are not

993
00:49:18,610 --> 00:49:22,390
buying cars to each other because you

994
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:27,190
may there are asked to veto adapters and

995
00:49:22,390 --> 00:49:29,680
the reason behind it is that the there's

996
00:49:27,190 --> 00:49:32,190
still a lot of devices that I use are

997
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:36,720
stiffly to as a silicon so as a backup

998
00:49:32,190 --> 00:49:39,280
in network infrastructure especially so

999
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:40,990
someone needed to design because we

1000
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:44,140
wanted to move away from using goes to

1001
00:49:40,990 --> 00:49:47,169
between those big 8 pin polls on our

1002
00:49:44,140 --> 00:49:49,359
disease FTDI was was very nice and

1003
00:49:47,170 --> 00:49:52,390
designed the power stupid to to is be

1004
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:58,870
adapt that was we cool but the thing

1005
00:49:52,390 --> 00:50:03,670
that they did was that nowadays there's

1006
00:49:58,870 --> 00:50:06,549
a big confusion with the hours to be to

1007
00:50:03,670 --> 00:50:08,980
and you are and those adapters the

1008
00:50:06,550 --> 00:50:12,400
reason behind is that the last thing on

1009
00:50:08,980 --> 00:50:15,550
my on my slide one is no trick hi zo

1010
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:19,060
snotty blow unless otherwise the way I

1011
00:50:15,550 --> 00:50:20,950
asked if it's worth him like 50 or 60

1012
00:50:19,060 --> 00:50:22,930
years ago you connected two terminals

1013
00:50:20,950 --> 00:50:24,339
between them and you put the voltage on

1014
00:50:22,930 --> 00:50:26,290
them so that the other side knew that

1015
00:50:24,340 --> 00:50:29,470
the line is still still works right so

1016
00:50:26,290 --> 00:50:32,800
the default rate was high voltage and

1017
00:50:29,470 --> 00:50:36,640
the the active state our logic one was

1018
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:37,870
no vote friend so this is its opposite

1019
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:43,150
to what we expect

1020
00:50:37,870 --> 00:50:46,150
so on the UART one is low and zero is

1021
00:50:43,150 --> 00:50:47,830
hi and that's how most of the CPUs MCU

1022
00:50:46,150 --> 00:50:49,750
is worked like they are doing a lot so

1023
00:50:47,830 --> 00:50:51,220
if you look at the trace I may be able

1024
00:50:49,750 --> 00:50:55,240
to show it maybe I will start showing

1025
00:50:51,220 --> 00:50:59,290
while I'm talking the way it works is

1026
00:50:55,240 --> 00:51:02,500
that the the MCS are expecting the

1027
00:50:59,290 --> 00:51:05,170
inverse logic so one is slow as you know

1028
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:07,870
is high what what's happening is you

1029
00:51:05,170 --> 00:51:11,250
have many devices that you can buy that

1030
00:51:07,870 --> 00:51:12,520
say they talk over you are right because

1031
00:51:11,250 --> 00:51:16,510
why not

1032
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:18,340
and they talk about you want and when

1033
00:51:16,510 --> 00:51:21,760
they are talking over you what they're

1034
00:51:18,340 --> 00:51:25,060
using the normal human load equals zero

1035
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:27,520
is low and while it's high right and you

1036
00:51:25,060 --> 00:51:31,420
connect them together they don't because

1037
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:35,370
I would say so this is because the I'm

1038
00:51:31,420 --> 00:51:39,010
not entirely sure if this is 100% true

1039
00:51:35,370 --> 00:51:42,100
so maybe don't quote me on this but I

1040
00:51:39,010 --> 00:51:43,450
think you are thus at the most if you -

1041
00:51:42,100 --> 00:51:46,600
is part of the standard so this is the

1042
00:51:43,450 --> 00:51:51,910
recommended standard from 50 or 60 or 70

1043
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:54,819
years ago and the UART is not defined

1044
00:51:51,910 --> 00:51:56,799
anywhere it just sort of happened which

1045
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:59,860
means anyone can take whatever the data

1046
00:51:56,800 --> 00:52:02,260
whatever they want from it and just

1047
00:51:59,860 --> 00:52:06,490
apply it to the product so I say you

1048
00:52:02,260 --> 00:52:08,530
would buy say a GPS chip you want to

1049
00:52:06,490 --> 00:52:10,479
connect to your Arduino and they took

1050
00:52:08,530 --> 00:52:11,800
over you are and you have a you add on

1051
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:14,290
your Arduino you connect them together

1052
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:22,000
they will not work and you'll have no

1053
00:52:14,290 --> 00:52:25,270
way of and you have no way of knowing

1054
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:28,870
this hat unless you search your Google

1055
00:52:25,270 --> 00:52:40,810
or have a scope that to show you that

1056
00:52:28,870 --> 00:52:44,460
the the lines are invest so that's

1057
00:52:40,810 --> 00:52:46,720
another how to shop for you

1058
00:52:44,460 --> 00:52:50,070
signals are actually opposite to what

1059
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:50,069
you what you expect

1060
00:52:52,190 --> 00:52:57,680
it's not doing and I said what I want

1061
00:52:55,100 --> 00:53:00,319
you to do but it doesn't matter because

1062
00:52:57,680 --> 00:53:03,140
I should be able to show you something

1063
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:10,670
of the love useful

1064
00:53:03,140 --> 00:53:12,200
why aren't you see that's my as my

1065
00:53:10,670 --> 00:53:14,120
problem with hardware because when I

1066
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:16,460
have a scope that's a standalone device

1067
00:53:14,120 --> 00:53:18,620
all of this I would just power it up and

1068
00:53:16,460 --> 00:53:21,850
it works you have those devices you

1069
00:53:18,620 --> 00:53:26,470
connect them up and they just don't work

1070
00:53:21,850 --> 00:53:26,470
so we try this again

1071
00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:39,620
so when you buy this is another thing

1072
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:41,240
that you have to get used to if you want

1073
00:53:39,620 --> 00:53:43,009
to get into hardware hacker and there's

1074
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:45,799
a bit of and I don't want to rant about

1075
00:53:43,010 --> 00:53:48,470
this too too long because this is not

1076
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:52,670
change anything but you buy those tools

1077
00:53:48,470 --> 00:53:56,709
that you pay a lot of money for them and

1078
00:53:52,670 --> 00:54:00,460
they just don't work because that's

1079
00:53:56,710 --> 00:54:05,530
that's all there is that's that's the

1080
00:54:00,460 --> 00:54:05,530
that's the hardware that you have today

1081
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:26,060
right so in a moment you have to give up

1082
00:54:24,349 --> 00:54:30,770
this is exactly though I'm gonna have to

1083
00:54:26,060 --> 00:54:34,040
do that I spent six weeks trying to do

1084
00:54:30,770 --> 00:54:38,000
it doesn't matter doesn't matter as I

1085
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:40,700
said that the whole thing would be would

1086
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:42,710
be on the table anyway and I really

1087
00:54:40,700 --> 00:54:45,410
regret that because I wanted to show you

1088
00:54:42,710 --> 00:54:48,410
how to calculate the the baud rate from

1089
00:54:45,410 --> 00:54:50,770
this code I can tell you actually I may

1090
00:54:48,410 --> 00:54:53,149
have a screenshot to show you this oh

1091
00:54:50,770 --> 00:54:57,580
because I was expecting as someone who

1092
00:54:53,150 --> 00:54:57,580
failed you may have a screen shoot I

1093
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:08,810
have a screen shot but I don't have I

1094
00:55:04,599 --> 00:55:10,460
don't have the lines here what I wanted

1095
00:55:08,810 --> 00:55:15,830
to show you is that first of all that

1096
00:55:10,460 --> 00:55:17,720
the UART is much slower than the SPI

1097
00:55:15,830 --> 00:55:22,520
because you would expose CPI some Lane

1098
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:28,339
protocol like you are you are normally

1099
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:30,320
is hundred and fifteen 200 115 thousand

1100
00:55:28,339 --> 00:55:32,000
and two hundred bits per second that's

1101
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:37,869
the top speed that you normally get so

1102
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:41,300
mad for my you were SPI you can get

1103
00:55:37,869 --> 00:55:46,339
there's no limit you can easily get up

1104
00:55:41,300 --> 00:55:48,230
to more 20 megabits right so it's just

1105
00:55:46,339 --> 00:55:49,970
fine now laying small protocol that no

1106
00:55:48,230 --> 00:55:53,270
one knows about actually it's quite fast

1107
00:55:49,970 --> 00:55:55,399
so here you see D this is the SPI that

1108
00:55:53,270 --> 00:55:58,160
we saw before this is how small it is

1109
00:55:55,400 --> 00:56:01,250
and this is the UART and this is just

1110
00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:03,950
two bytes right you can see the how how

1111
00:56:01,250 --> 00:56:06,410
fast SP is and SPI is not lame it's

1112
00:56:03,950 --> 00:56:07,669
actually quite good what I wanted to

1113
00:56:06,410 --> 00:56:09,529
show you here I will not show you that

1114
00:56:07,670 --> 00:56:11,720
you can have calculate the baud rate

1115
00:56:09,530 --> 00:56:13,910
from the from the scope so this device

1116
00:56:11,720 --> 00:56:16,339
this the software has this and I think

1117
00:56:13,910 --> 00:56:19,970
of ruler so you move the thing from the

1118
00:56:16,339 --> 00:56:22,940
side and two rulers and you apply them

1119
00:56:19,970 --> 00:56:25,759
to to the trace I can actually here and

1120
00:56:22,940 --> 00:56:31,250
then on the top here it tells you how

1121
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:31,870
long that that how long that the palace

1122
00:56:31,250 --> 00:56:33,760
is

1123
00:56:31,870 --> 00:56:35,799
so how many calculate that the birth

1124
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:37,180
weight from from a trace you take the

1125
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:38,650
shortest one under you what you think

1126
00:56:37,180 --> 00:56:42,339
the shortest one and measure how long it

1127
00:56:38,650 --> 00:56:44,560
is right and the that the birth weight

1128
00:56:42,340 --> 00:56:46,750
is actually depends on whom you ask for

1129
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:48,670
either the exact the frequency of the

1130
00:56:46,750 --> 00:56:50,560
signal or half of the frequency of the

1131
00:56:48,670 --> 00:56:52,920
signal right so here if you have 20

1132
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:57,580
megabits that 20 megahertz right

1133
00:56:52,920 --> 00:57:01,210
frequency is the inverse o period so if

1134
00:56:57,580 --> 00:57:02,710
we measure the shorter signal here if

1135
00:57:01,210 --> 00:57:05,830
you measure the shortest signal he'll

1136
00:57:02,710 --> 00:57:08,110
take the how long it is and on top of my

1137
00:57:05,830 --> 00:57:12,759
head I think is about eight microseconds

1138
00:57:08,110 --> 00:57:15,280
8.5 microseconds divide one by eight

1139
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:16,720
microseconds you get the baud rate the

1140
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:19,510
thing that that the cool thing I wanted

1141
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:22,089
to show you is that we said the in the

1142
00:57:19,510 --> 00:57:27,910
software we said the speed of the unit

1143
00:57:22,090 --> 00:57:30,310
the pole 215 and 200 and that's a lie

1144
00:57:27,910 --> 00:57:32,080
because Arduino will have to let take

1145
00:57:30,310 --> 00:57:36,250
this both rate and adjust it to assault

1146
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:40,779
and the clock in fact what it is is 170

1147
00:57:36,250 --> 00:57:43,780
and 664 something some right and when

1148
00:57:40,780 --> 00:57:46,810
you connected when you connect it like

1149
00:57:43,780 --> 00:57:49,060
this and just put the board way that you

1150
00:57:46,810 --> 00:57:51,100
expect the peakers cold you'll get a

1151
00:57:49,060 --> 00:57:53,620
target here right is instead of actual

1152
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:55,810
data but you have to measure the signal

1153
00:57:53,620 --> 00:57:59,109
you have to measure the length that the

1154
00:57:55,810 --> 00:58:01,570
length of the signal 1 divided by buzzes

1155
00:57:59,110 --> 00:58:03,310
by this length and put this link put the

1156
00:58:01,570 --> 00:58:16,180
result back into picoscope and get the

1157
00:58:03,310 --> 00:58:19,000
actual date because it doesn't anyway so

1158
00:58:16,180 --> 00:58:21,609
this is this is now I lost my power

1159
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:26,140
point as well that's great this is

1160
00:58:21,610 --> 00:58:30,280
basically shorter this is basically all

1161
00:58:26,140 --> 00:58:33,120
I wanted to show you today and the last

1162
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:33,120
slide is

1163
00:58:36,540 --> 00:58:41,070
maybe users are peaceful yes you're

1164
00:58:44,610 --> 00:58:50,500
right so this is what I wanted to show

1165
00:58:48,310 --> 00:58:53,620
you today I wanted to tell you that

1166
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:55,660
there's a training made that I'm making

1167
00:58:53,620 --> 00:58:58,960
in the in the in the background that

1168
00:58:55,660 --> 00:59:02,410
will be on line one my one of my

1169
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:04,960
recommendations is this heavy book this

1170
00:59:02,410 --> 00:59:06,700
is we have absolutely everything you

1171
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:08,860
need to only electronic this is not the

1172
00:59:06,700 --> 00:59:11,500
hardware hacking this is about the

1173
00:59:08,860 --> 00:59:13,510
electronics right and it's something

1174
00:59:11,500 --> 00:59:16,930
that I like to read in my past time

1175
00:59:13,510 --> 00:59:18,490
because I wield like that I should know

1176
00:59:16,930 --> 00:59:20,770
most of this not because that that's

1177
00:59:18,490 --> 00:59:22,629
what I've been taught at school so this

1178
00:59:20,770 --> 00:59:28,120
is one of my one of my accommodations

1179
00:59:22,630 --> 00:59:30,130
the other one the other one is marks my

1180
00:59:28,120 --> 00:59:32,920
attorney whose organizer of this this

1181
00:59:30,130 --> 00:59:37,390
fantastic event he's making us a book

1182
00:59:32,920 --> 00:59:40,030
about hardware tools for pen testers

1183
00:59:37,390 --> 00:59:42,600
write fantastically because he's

1184
00:59:40,030 --> 00:59:45,370
actually talking about this this stuff

1185
00:59:42,600 --> 00:59:49,270
what the protocols are have you bleep

1186
00:59:45,370 --> 00:59:52,930
starving and I really recommend that for

1187
00:59:49,270 --> 00:59:56,320
you and what else is here oh I'm also on

1188
00:59:52,930 --> 01:00:00,040
the many has club you may know me from

1189
00:59:56,320 --> 01:00:02,730
there so always happy to join it we also

1190
01:00:00,040 --> 01:00:05,950
talk about that at the know and then so

1191
01:00:02,730 --> 01:00:08,200
so yeah and take this knowledge take

1192
01:00:05,950 --> 01:00:10,060
this this things and go home and play

1193
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:11,930
and build this stuff and hope that it

1194
01:00:10,060 --> 01:00:16,250
doesn't break when you go and present it

1195
01:00:11,930 --> 01:00:16,250
