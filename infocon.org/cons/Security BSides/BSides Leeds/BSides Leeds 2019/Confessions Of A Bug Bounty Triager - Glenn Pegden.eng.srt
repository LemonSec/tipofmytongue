1
00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:09,800
so folks confessing a book battery idea

2
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:12,200
my name is Glenn I'm a senior cyber

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:14,750
security specialist at SBG try saying

4
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:18,470
that after a few beers I'm an old-school

5
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:19,730
hacker so this is original 2600 teach at

6
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:25,099
least probably older than some of you in

7
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:26,270
the room hi Jay I'm about to triage yeah

8
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:28,660
that's one of the more interesting bits

9
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:30,560
of the job that's a bit I talk about I

10
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:31,939
wasn't going to explain what about the

11
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,930
rest of my job was going to quick losses

12
00:00:31,939 --> 00:00:36,260
even through all the some of the other

13
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:38,420
bits I do well actually it does fit

14
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:40,309
lovely with the chocolate sauce you did

15
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:41,420
before in so much a part of my job is

16
00:00:40,309 --> 00:00:43,309
acting there's a bit of an interface

17
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:44,539
between security and people like our

18
00:00:43,309 --> 00:00:47,030
development teams and infrastructure

19
00:00:44,539 --> 00:00:48,949
teams so that they actually get security

20
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:50,569
so we can actually fix things earlier on

21
00:00:48,949 --> 00:00:54,829
in the process so we're not just finding

22
00:00:50,569 --> 00:00:55,999
out about problems and the actual time

23
00:00:54,829 --> 00:00:57,379
of them stuff going live which is

24
00:00:55,999 --> 00:01:00,440
exactly what they were saying that we

25
00:00:57,379 --> 00:01:01,489
should be doing so it's nice to not

26
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:06,679
supposed to go there I have something

27
00:01:01,489 --> 00:01:08,420
but realistically my actual main sort of

28
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:10,070
facet at work is I'm just the old guy

29
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:11,870
yells at cloud Brit cloud on obstacle

30
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:14,869
yell as your head of stcp I hit them all

31
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:18,140
equally give me ten give me number two I

32
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:19,700
was in violence any day so before we get

33
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:22,550
started I humbly remember that the

34
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:26,560
original disclaimer for South Park I

35
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:29,570
kind of need something similar for this

36
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:32,330
I've been working on a book back program

37
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:34,639
now for a good couple years however that

38
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:36,200
is only a small part of my knowledge on

39
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,630
this I spend a lot of time talking to

40
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:41,060
all the triage years with a lot of time

41
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:43,670
talking to pen testers bill Conti

42
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:45,200
bounces the two or three of you in the

43
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:47,180
room that were been tested to death by

44
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,650
me asking questions trying to actually

45
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:50,150
work out what makes you tick what you

46
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:50,510
want up a program to make our program

47
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:56,210
better

48
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:57,770
I also also cause a lot of triage is one

49
00:01:56,210 --> 00:01:59,270
of the things I've not managed to get a

50
00:01:57,770 --> 00:02:01,190
lot of feedback from his triage is at

51
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:02,960
work for planted platforms themselves I

52
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:05,120
tend to be talking the triage is that

53
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:07,789
actually three hours straight for the

54
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:09,408
companies so with all that take onboard

55
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:12,530
that everything I'm about to tell you is

56
00:02:09,408 --> 00:02:14,358
a very limited view point although

57
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:15,370
opinions made by perfectly valid we're

58
00:02:14,359 --> 00:02:17,290
aware

59
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:19,780
some good reasons that our scheme is

60
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:21,220
atypical in some ways so what works well

61
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:23,650
for us may not have worked quite so well

62
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:25,750
for others and vice-versa so basically

63
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:28,269
take it all with a pinch of salt

64
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:29,650
Oh additionally yeah don't think that

65
00:02:28,269 --> 00:02:32,140
any of this is my original work and I

66
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:33,489
actually came into SPG at just the right

67
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:35,230
time the book back scheme was already

68
00:02:33,489 --> 00:02:36,640
launched somebody did a lot of the work

69
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:43,329
and I'm just riding on that coattails

70
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:46,000
now so so I wrote the the abstract for

71
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:48,700
this literally after two hours sleep

72
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,760
having just taken my OS CP so I had to

73
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:52,869
actually contact mark and Chloe and ask

74
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,790
them what had actually said I was doing

75
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:55,959
it on and I realized that in the

76
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:57,910
abstract I'd written that was gonna be

77
00:02:55,959 --> 00:03:00,459
something for both Blue Team and Red

78
00:02:57,910 --> 00:03:01,920
Team four vendors looking to do bug

79
00:03:00,459 --> 00:03:04,540
bounties and talk about hackers which

80
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:07,149
realized afterwards was a mistake book

81
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:09,429
so what we've got so at this some slides

82
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:11,950
wasn't something a bit red and blue I am

83
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:13,750
on cap America works well for me let my

84
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:15,250
wife proofread my slides and she went

85
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:16,840
yeah it's alright I get the whole Red

86
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:19,810
Team Blue team same it's not very you is

87
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:21,130
it so very major one I thought you did

88
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:26,950
boom sort of more Elmo and Cookie

89
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:28,660
Monster it's like that is genius now my

90
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:30,730
job is so much easier when I think of

91
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:32,739
sort of red the red team is team Elmo

92
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:35,078
and blue team's team Cookie Monster

93
00:03:32,739 --> 00:03:35,350
that's just my favorite InfoSec thing

94
00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:39,250
ever

95
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:40,780
well what is a genius at times so why do

96
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:43,389
we do it why do we get into this whole

97
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:46,420
bunch scheme and ask you before touched

98
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:48,100
on the whole responsible disclosure bit

99
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:50,380
vulnerabilities happened they're out

100
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:51,940
there companies like to know about them

101
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:53,950
ideals before everybody else does so

102
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:55,720
we'll start off on the red team why did

103
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:58,480
a book battery people want to do it well

104
00:03:55,720 --> 00:04:02,880
according to the 2080 was it hacker

105
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:05,290
important hacker one top five reasons to

106
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:07,299
learn tips and techniques fair enough

107
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:08,888
to be challenged definitely very

108
00:04:07,299 --> 00:04:10,480
challenging to have fun Karl I'll give

109
00:04:08,889 --> 00:04:11,829
you that I've start playing at that side

110
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,918
of the equation are stuffing is

111
00:04:11,829 --> 00:04:17,889
definitely fun to make money certainly I

112
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:19,359
mean it's very good rated and better to

113
00:04:17,889 --> 00:04:21,220
catch for yourself and career

114
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:22,450
advancement interesting in a start

115
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:24,130
haven't gotten those are only three

116
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:26,950
percent of people said that one of their

117
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:28,540
major reasons was to show off that's a

118
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:30,610
lie over everybody

119
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:32,440
I know myself included loose to show off

120
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:35,850
about you may have a primary driver but

121
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:37,960
back in school we want to talk about it

122
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:40,570
so from the blue side of things from

123
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:41,890
seeing Cookie Monster why do we do it to

124
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:43,390
cost-effectively find vulnerabilities

125
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:45,550
that would otherwise have been missed

126
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:47,729
that is our primary driver we are not

127
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:49,390
interested in finding out who the best

128
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:51,340
compacted with who the best plans

129
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:53,800
testers are we don't really care that

130
00:04:51,340 --> 00:05:00,310
much about the renter hahaha Hyundai you

131
00:04:53,800 --> 00:05:01,720
absolutely hero that is utterly our main

132
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:04,810
drivers is to find those vulnerabilities

133
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:07,810
and under the cost effective I'll talk a

134
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:10,240
bit later about why and when both

135
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:13,510
partners are cost effective in some

136
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,890
cases to increase customer or board

137
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:16,450
confidence your product it's great to

138
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:18,250
say we are secure if you say we are

139
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:20,950
secure and we're putting our money where

140
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:25,270
our mouth is yeah you'd only went from

141
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:27,640
that to a public disclosure again you

142
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:29,349
very just at the end of your talk or

143
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:33,789
energy suckers talks as they just

144
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:35,080
mention the fact that public schemes are

145
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:36,400
kind of an extension of responsibility

146
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,450
so you've got OPEC scheme responsible

147
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,130
disclosure it kinda has to be an

148
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:42,820
underpinning of that that they they do

149
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:44,350
that and finally no we don't use bull

150
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:45,670
pouty schemes as a way of paying ransoms

151
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:50,440
if you don't know what that refers to

152
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:52,360
Bravo Reid so as the blue team was a

153
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:53,469
fear that the whole point this talk will

154
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,610
start to give you a view from our side

155
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:56,590
of the fence because triage just don't

156
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:58,420
talk about it very much so what do we

157
00:05:56,590 --> 00:06:00,940
care about and we do care we do

158
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:02,530
genuinely care we care about how quickly

159
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:04,840
a vulnerability to our so we can get on

160
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:07,270
to the next task we are busy people we

161
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:10,150
goodbye triage is a bit like doing

162
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:11,409
customer support which it's it's fun

163
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:12,580
it's a lot more interest is a lot more

164
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:13,930
challenging but realistically we'll

165
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:15,010
stack of reports to get through we don't

166
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:17,670
want to spend they eat on it we just

167
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:20,230
want to get on and do the next thing and

168
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:21,460
we care about what the actual risk to

169
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:23,140
the business of the vulnerability is a

170
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:25,120
large part of our role is actually

171
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:27,070
assessing risk in fact pretty much all

172
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:29,800
we do in one method is referencing risk

173
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:30,760
in one form or another so it's looking

174
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,740
at your roommate trying to work out just

175
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:34,810
what the actual threat from that is and

176
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:36,040
there isn't necessarily always is that

177
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:37,270
you know we do get reports so that's

178
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:38,860
interesting that's definitely wrong o

179
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:40,270
coders definitely made a mistake there

180
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:42,130
however the risks their business is

181
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:44,950
pretty negligible

182
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:47,290
and how long it's going to take the Deaf

183
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:50,349
to resolve the issue like yourselves you

184
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:51,340
we want to see it fixed and you know we

185
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:53,920
don't want to see a hanging around fraid

186
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:56,049
so we we kind of interested in what that

187
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:58,330
time to resolution is going to be and

188
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:59,470
we're also interested why there isn't a

189
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:02,020
better way of handling to you because

190
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:03,340
duplicates are as a mooing for our side

191
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:04,450
of the fence as they are for you we

192
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:06,460
don't like him anyway and I've yet to

193
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:07,840
find somebody in the industry that's

194
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:10,900
found a good way of dealing with them

195
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:13,359
and we do genuinely like to keep Packers

196
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:15,460
happy we're kind of on your side we deal

197
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,260
here our habit however keeping our

198
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:19,229
bosses happy is much more important and

199
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:22,990
bear that in mind that ultimately

200
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:24,460
somebody's paid our check and we're not

201
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:26,080
going to throw ourselves under the bus -

202
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:27,849
and to keep you happy

203
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:30,729
we are there on behalf of the company at

204
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:34,330
the end of the day so the stuff we don't

205
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:37,690
care about understands a lot of this we

206
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:40,900
don't care about who you are so seeing

207
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:43,000
things that you have and that big names

208
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:44,440
are favored in this industry and whilst

209
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,450
there is an element talk to you to get

210
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:48,460
invites on to some programs that's true

211
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:49,990
but once you're on a program we as tree

212
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:51,430
huggers we don't care who you are we

213
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:53,680
don't care if you're a big name or a

214
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:56,830
first-time reporter be do we rarely

215
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:58,810
actually bother looking at that we don't

216
00:07:56,830 --> 00:08:00,010
care about the amount about your kudos

217
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:02,440
or rep or whatever you're getting out of

218
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:04,840
this it's irrelevant to us of all the

219
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:07,300
people I've talked to nobody is getting

220
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:09,280
pressured to actually minimize their

221
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:10,990
bounty payments that pressure to be fair

222
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:13,030
to be consistent to make sure that

223
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:14,620
actually nobody can come back and say

224
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:17,530
afterwards well that you know why did he

225
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:18,910
get accident he got one I've never found

226
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:20,619
anyone actually pressured to keep the

227
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:24,250
money down despite what some people

228
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:25,690
think we don't care about the history of

229
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:27,190
the vulnerability class I do look at

230
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:28,990
when people send in history lessons

231
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:32,020
explaining to me just by cross-site

232
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:33,760
scripting is such a bad thing dude he'll

233
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:38,468
with dozens and dozens of these trust me

234
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:40,479
I had no and we don't Claire I don't

235
00:08:38,469 --> 00:08:42,219
really care how clever your hack is or

236
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:44,980
how hard it was to find spit on ferati

237
00:08:42,219 --> 00:08:46,720
we do appreciate a good clever hack what

238
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:49,480
realistically fools get the job done

239
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,950
it's not a fact that we we don't really

240
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:52,480
take into account how much effort you

241
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:54,950
put into it we take into account what

242
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,180
the actual risk to the business is

243
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:59,200
if you've stumbled across something

244
00:08:56,180 --> 00:09:01,849
because you literally type out something

245
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:04,010
versus you spend the months hammering at

246
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:05,540
something we're going to just evaluate

247
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:06,650
that look at the relative risks and it

248
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:08,000
may be the thing you've stumbled across

249
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:09,230
because you type on something is

250
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,890
actually riskier that's what's gonna get

251
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:15,200
your bigger pain so the basis of this

252
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:16,520
talk is kind of questions that I consult

253
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,140
about come story but I've been asked

254
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:19,730
over time that I've kind of Roland that

255
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:21,500
I want to share with you came from a

256
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:23,270
conversation with Sean who may or may

257
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:24,950
not be in the room with D c151 where I

258
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:26,870
got talking to him about what I didn't

259
00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:28,310
realize that actually what pack hunters

260
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:31,850
don't know about our side job very much

261
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:33,290
at all so questionnaire gaps quite a lot

262
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:33,920
why doesn't my report get the attention

263
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:36,050
it deserves

264
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:38,030
you dropped something he didn't you've

265
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:39,469
given this a big vulnerability why you

266
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:41,470
know why are we not running around like

267
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:44,180
my hair's on fire

268
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:47,480
good whole bunch of reasons for it and

269
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:48,739
first one and starting off with a quote

270
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:50,840
from Cain reservist if you're not aware

271
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:52,820
of Katie murderous she's kind of a queen

272
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:55,550
book bounce game she was responsible for

273
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:56,810
get in Facebook's frozen off the ground

274
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:58,939
forgetting to the DoD and the Air Force

275
00:09:56,810 --> 00:10:01,310
kidnap problems off the ground she kind

276
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:04,910
of wrote the book on on bounty hunting

277
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:06,890
and she's now very forefront to ensuring

278
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:08,480
that only the right people to start them

279
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:10,250
book count schemes I'm putting up there

280
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,720
not right for everything and one of our

281
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:13,310
ports reasons people are very concerned

282
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:14,840
about vulnerability disclosure but most

283
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:17,420
organizations aren't ready for them

284
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:19,520
absolutely and it's all to do with flow

285
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:21,349
control flow control is your ability as

286
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:23,840
an organization to take new reports in

287
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:26,630
to look at them to evaluate them to

288
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:27,890
triage them to get them fixed to get

289
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:30,439
that deployment why I don't go around

290
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:33,830
that cycle if you can't do that fast

291
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:36,650
enough it causes your headaches is quite

292
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:37,820
often with other organizations as I

293
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:38,930
again this is welcome back to talking to

294
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:39,920
all the triage is can I actually think

295
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:42,560
we do pretty well

296
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:45,939
if that flow control is broken if you're

297
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:48,949
in your flow of data in his fasting your

298
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:52,340
they are out everything gets stuck in

299
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:53,780
the middle and your your book just gets

300
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:56,870
look there because it's just in an ever

301
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:57,800
growing pile of problems so looking for

302
00:10:56,870 --> 00:11:01,250
some of the training straight this with

303
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:02,180
imagine that your lovely crafted PLC

304
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:03,740
that you've just given me for your

305
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:06,229
awesome vulnerability is that amazing

306
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:07,430
looking pancake over there if your own

307
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:08,630
flow control is broken in your

308
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:10,729
organization

309
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:13,970
or back triage this is what happens when

310
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:16,329
I hope this verse I love this so I took

311
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:29,949
a play

312
00:11:16,329 --> 00:11:29,949
No can you play come play take pause

313
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:52,509
[Music]

314
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:05,070
when the pipe life doesn't work that

315
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:07,019
exploding pink bunny is a dev team and

316
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:08,910
I've talked to people that have had them

317
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:11,010
have to if you can't get that flow

318
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:12,240
through then your pancake is just going

319
00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:15,300
to be lost in a huge pile of all the

320
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:18,000
palookas pancakes so that's one reason

321
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:18,959
that your thing that your report may not

322
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,079
get the attention it deserves

323
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:23,279
second one ease of triage thankfully

324
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:24,660
because of our program I talked a little

325
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:26,820
bit about our Provost if it later on

326
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:28,469
bought our program we get really good

327
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:29,910
signals those we don't get a lot of

328
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:31,440
rules reports but so people all the tree

329
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:34,019
huggers they get some absolute dross so

330
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:35,550
what we want is something like that with

331
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:37,110
general ten generalist technical people

332
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:38,609
we generally get what we're looking at

333
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:40,410
give me a pill come and give me

334
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:42,209
absolutely have some time no I hope to

335
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:44,160
ask do we laughing yeah don't replicate

336
00:12:42,209 --> 00:12:45,540
my second beautiful proof is proof of

337
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:47,699
concept that's what I want what we tend

338
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:49,709
to get is that somebody spending sixteen

339
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:56,670
pages explaining where CSRF is a bad

340
00:12:49,709 --> 00:12:58,199
thing so just so obviously people cook

341
00:12:56,670 --> 00:13:01,949
up famous series of books on two books

342
00:12:58,199 --> 00:13:03,870
now in the industry plc or gtfo applies

343
00:13:01,949 --> 00:13:05,219
here PLC or gtfo you feel free to give

344
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:08,940
me all the information in the world that

345
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:10,620
you want but if you can get me a nice

346
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:12,630
sort simple command or something

347
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:14,339
beginning to replicate I'm gonna look at

348
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:16,649
that first and I said before this is a

349
00:13:14,339 --> 00:13:17,820
lot like custom support if you can pick

350
00:13:16,649 --> 00:13:19,199
and choose reports you do you're gonna

351
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:21,029
choose the easy ones you can choose the

352
00:13:19,199 --> 00:13:22,589
ones you've already got a nice simple

353
00:13:21,029 --> 00:13:24,050
pot for a lot one way you have to read

354
00:13:22,589 --> 00:13:28,709
an essay before you get going

355
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:31,979
three like a visibility good raps nobody

356
00:13:28,709 --> 00:13:34,469
for SVG in here that's on par bad to say

357
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:38,550
over other than them we've got some of

358
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:40,350
our brass they didn't see this again

359
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:42,029
this is something that we've got really

360
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:43,920
right but I've seen them really badly so

361
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:48,540
I've were just walking to this before

362
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:51,569
the path from so report coming in to fix

363
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:54,029
is this in a small company literally

364
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:56,010
wander over tell dev is wrong

365
00:13:54,029 --> 00:13:59,149
dev course which any recognizable form

366
00:13:56,010 --> 00:14:03,000
by the way hey

367
00:13:59,149 --> 00:14:05,399
fantastic living together so whatever er

368
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,170
I've did not secure right in reality in

369
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:08,579
big organizations what can sometimes

370
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:10,920
happen he says talking to get the slide

371
00:14:08,579 --> 00:14:14,130
back speaking legal process again is

372
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:15,839
that you write your little report you do

373
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:18,839
your little Homer Simpson bit that I'm

374
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:21,209
desperately to get to you've send off

375
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:22,769
your report goes off into some huge

376
00:14:21,209 --> 00:14:24,300
corporate structure never to be seen

377
00:14:22,769 --> 00:14:26,790
again I'm going to be eaten by beavers

378
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:27,899
so sometimes the reason you're triage it

379
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:29,130
isn't talking to you isn't giving you

380
00:14:27,899 --> 00:14:31,290
updates it's because they've sent their

381
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:33,439
report often to the system of tubes and

382
00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:36,209
they're just not hearing back on it

383
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:38,550
fraud ization privatization is harder I

384
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:39,930
spot my job is prioritization and some

385
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:45,000
of the guys down here lost part of my

386
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:46,138
job and I'm getting at to people work on

387
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,550
the right things he's tough so you've

388
00:14:46,139 --> 00:14:48,750
dropped this awesome thing oh you think

389
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:51,359
you've found something really serious

390
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:52,800
that we you think this is what's

391
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,180
happening they're running around trying

392
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:56,219
to put out the fire this is you know

393
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:57,899
really care about my thing whereas in

394
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:59,250
reality what's actually happening I

395
00:14:57,899 --> 00:15:07,139
think you put guys probably know what's

396
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:08,639
coming you know you'll see you've

397
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:09,959
reported your one thing you're only

398
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:11,430
aware of your one thing you've no idea

399
00:15:09,959 --> 00:15:16,050
whether we're dealing with one thing

400
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:18,479
like that or lenders also prophylactic

401
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:19,920
season even if you convince those that

402
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:22,620
it's important and we're running around

403
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:24,569
like headless chickens stevia or any of

404
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:26,250
is it I was just like receipt it's like

405
00:15:24,569 --> 00:15:28,410
what can happen sometimes in bigger

406
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:30,569
organization is an org chart that looks

407
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:32,189
like that where we get the fire but

408
00:15:30,569 --> 00:15:34,139
actually conveying the importance about

409
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:35,370
fire through the organization it's kind

410
00:15:34,139 --> 00:15:36,839
of tough okay

411
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:37,829
seems like we do pretty well and we're

412
00:15:36,839 --> 00:15:42,329
quite proud of that but I've seen other

413
00:15:37,829 --> 00:15:44,250
places too that trade for it might

414
00:15:42,329 --> 00:15:45,930
actually care we might just not be able

415
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:50,370
to tell you why we can't tell you

416
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:51,479
anything at this medication silent

417
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:54,240
alarms things like that there are

418
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:56,759
certain things in there for example if

419
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:58,350
your activity triggers one of you know

420
00:15:56,759 --> 00:16:00,449
an auntie notable anything wonderful and

421
00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:01,769
rinsing there's lots of legal issues

422
00:16:00,449 --> 00:16:04,040
that we're telling somebody that they've

423
00:16:01,769 --> 00:16:07,889
trigger down to money laundering process

424
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:09,060
yeah similar when I worked in them sort

425
00:16:07,889 --> 00:16:11,100
of chat filtering for a while there's

426
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:12,930
all sorts of things where the chat will

427
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:14,640
be like go but it would be in for

428
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:16,410
moderators taught to go and start to get

429
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,520
into things though it may well be just

430
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:19,050
because you've nice to pull something

431
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:20,430
off it may be that some things that to

432
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:23,160
be happened as planned in the background

433
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:28,170
it's just not necessarily bullied to the

434
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:29,069
user that just happened the rest of

435
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:30,240
these are kind of just things that

436
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:32,580
happened sometimes in big organizations

437
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:34,350
that I can't generally defend but it's

438
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:35,990
the way organizations were sometimes was

439
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:39,839
also decided fixing other things

440
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:41,459
sometimes fixing the risk of so the cost

441
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:44,610
of fixing it outweighs the risk of

442
00:16:41,459 --> 00:16:45,810
leaving it things get to you for the

443
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:47,040
Commission's they're putting effort into

444
00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:48,439
since was about to be turned off it's

445
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,819
very hard to convince people do that

446
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:52,260
sometimes it's nobody's responsibility

447
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:53,730
again I've worked places where this has

448
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:55,020
happened that literally a team's written

449
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:57,000
a thing that teams got this boundedness

450
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:58,680
blow into twinkle is the company and the

451
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,270
code is just sat there ephemeral and

452
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:02,040
trying to get something something that

453
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:04,470
nobody's ever touched before it's very

454
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:05,938
hard to do source code has been lost not

455
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:07,860
a personal one whatever talk to people

456
00:17:05,939 --> 00:17:09,420
where that's happened literally to fix a

457
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:11,309
small vulnerability would have required

458
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:12,750
route rewriting the entire application

459
00:17:11,309 --> 00:17:15,839
because they no longer had the source

460
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:17,760
for it last time it was modified it

461
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:20,520
wouldn't reboot again people have told

462
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:22,109
me of situations like that was just so

463
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:25,129
flaky they have to leave it running and

464
00:17:22,109 --> 00:17:27,599
then touch it and surprise being reached

465
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:32,940
there are whole list of reasons that we

466
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:34,919
did the the information maybe start with

467
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:39,480
a wreak triage and he can't really tell

468
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:41,280
you why he can't tell you anything so

469
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:43,559
try to get some attention a few quick

470
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:45,090
summaries simple query reports that gets

471
00:17:43,559 --> 00:17:49,678
the point we love simple reports we hate

472
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:51,559
essays part of that POC old gtfo build

473
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:53,730
relationships come and talk to us and

474
00:17:51,559 --> 00:17:56,730
let's put patches we actually love

475
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:58,710
talking to hacker actually asked us for

476
00:17:56,730 --> 00:18:01,320
more info on things as you know we can't

477
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:03,000
say giveaway company secrets book you

478
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:05,550
know we may tell you that certain thing

479
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,960
you're looking at is you know it's

480
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:09,350
protected by something or other when

481
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:11,490
maybe I'll tell you that it's you know

482
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:12,750
actually Black Codes using this library

483
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:14,429
so if you look if you're looking for a

484
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:15,870
problem you know if you think you found

485
00:18:14,429 --> 00:18:17,100
a wife by passing out and say well

486
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:18,389
actually we're just using that one over

487
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:21,030
there don't look at that open-source

488
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:22,290
project if that's or towards you just a

489
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:27,050
we can't get away come the secrets it's

490
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:29,850
amazing what we can tell you patients we

491
00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:31,139
we're so you know we care what we're

492
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:34,290
doing but it's still a job we're not

493
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:36,210
doing this 24/7 365 I know some about

494
00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:37,559
people that seem to be doing it twenty

495
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:38,790
four seven three six five some of the

496
00:18:37,559 --> 00:18:41,550
Twitter streams are follow you look at

497
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:43,860
these ganyan so people in general you

498
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:46,800
see sauce thirty-six hours of Twitter

499
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:48,270
reports went on this is like where did

500
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:50,790
you fight to eat sleep or bathe in the

501
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:52,590
last 48 hours it just them we're not

502
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:56,700
like I like to go home and see what my

503
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:58,830
from son of any Union so that was a bit

504
00:18:56,700 --> 00:19:00,600
first you what why don't we why don't we

505
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:02,490
get these reserves question number two

506
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:04,740
I'm about this a few times like the one

507
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:06,210
Street we see a lot of bounty hunters

508
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:08,669
I've never worked out an intership have

509
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:10,169
never been developers of the other very

510
00:19:08,669 --> 00:19:11,370
very good at what they do but they've

511
00:19:10,169 --> 00:19:12,750
never been on our side of the fence

512
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:15,418
where developers find a sense unseen

513
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:17,100
that sometimes that code gets into

514
00:19:15,419 --> 00:19:19,230
production for sometimes bad reason

515
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:21,389
sometimes good reasons so when people

516
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:23,220
sort of say yeah dude this is obvious

517
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:25,830
this is like simple XSS how on earth did

518
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:27,870
this make you to production again tiny

519
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:28,830
the earlier talk it's not excusing some

520
00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:31,729
of this stuff but it's kind of

521
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:33,689
explaining where it comes from

522
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:37,950
sometimes the risk is worth it sometimes

523
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:39,929
you know the the entire all the factors

524
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:42,300
are going to get the an application life

525
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:44,150
security is only one of those it's all

526
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:46,110
risk based sometimes the risk of

527
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:48,240
cross-site scripting is worth the risk

528
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:51,559
of getting out there again another Katy

529
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:53,309
Missouri example that I love is a

530
00:19:51,559 --> 00:19:57,360
disappearance you had over hacker that

531
00:19:53,309 --> 00:19:59,040
had found them database open creds and

532
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:01,080
she wouldn't pay on it and the whole

533
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:03,480
point was yes it was a database yes

534
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:05,639
there was not north indication on it

535
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:07,980
however it was a read on we database

536
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:09,750
with public they own it sure it looks

537
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:10,650
bad you know it's not something that

538
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:12,210
everyone Edward IRA

539
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:14,220
ever hold of so this is called practice

540
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:17,640
but realistically the impact from that

541
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:19,200
was zero so sometimes the impact is so

542
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:20,450
small that the business will make

543
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:23,000
decisions just draw with it

544
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:25,320
[Music]

545
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,000
and latitude of next time do better

546
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:29,129
without going back and worrying about

547
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,480
last time we're all withholding we're

548
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:31,710
all getting better at coding you'll

549
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,030
suddenly realize that the right way to

550
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:34,560
do things any of you have been down at

551
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:36,810
develop if you know you get better all

552
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:38,429
the time how often do you think actually

553
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:41,970
I know I know understand you say the

554
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:42,360
value of store procedures or something

555
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:43,650
like that

556
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:45,120
do you go back and look at the code you

557
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:46,290
wrote two years ago and ready for that

558
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:48,510
yet you'd make sure you get it right

559
00:20:46,290 --> 00:20:51,149
next time and because of that because

560
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:53,070
software doesn't tend to go away old

561
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:57,150
stuff never gets fixed it never gets

562
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:58,379
improved green fields are easy Broncos

563
00:20:57,150 --> 00:21:00,090
run right there if you're writing

564
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:01,740
something from scratch it's really oh

565
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:03,570
it's a lot easier to make sure you said

566
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:05,690
it right if you're trying to build

567
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:08,280
something on top of somebody else's

568
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:10,050
truly app that doesn't really work that

569
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:14,160
relies on a three-year-old version of

570
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:16,080
Java right stops working doesn't use TLS

571
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:17,640
if you're building something on top of

572
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,800
that you may be stuck with their bad

573
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:24,510
decisions in which case you're just

574
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:27,149
gonna be partying a turd not all

575
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:29,040
software developers are equals and it

576
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:33,180
may well be the bits of your company on

577
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:34,889
parade the people that are doing you

578
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:36,270
know development day and day out it may

579
00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:38,250
be that they've got this absolutely

580
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:41,810
nailed and then suddenly you get

581
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:44,700
something like a marketing team or

582
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:46,139
something like that they can do a bit of

583
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:47,790
HTML and suddenly they find out that

584
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:49,800
their CMS allows you to do custom

585
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:51,870
javascript in there and off they go and

586
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:54,090
bypass all your s DLCs and all your best

587
00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:55,800
practice and suddenly you're paying out

588
00:21:54,090 --> 00:21:57,000
thousands in bounties for cross-site

589
00:21:55,800 --> 00:22:00,300
scripting a platform you didn't even

590
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:03,930
know you got so so none of these are

591
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:05,040
excusable but they do happen question

592
00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:07,800
number three why does it the hell does

593
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:09,420
it take so long to get paid again we're

594
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:11,100
quite lucky where a typical we pay on

595
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:14,310
triage we know in the industry paying on

596
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:15,750
triage is rare I think I didn't up a

597
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:18,659
triage it is brilliant and I wish more

598
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:22,170
people did it or say like many things

599
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:25,530
win not the the less an use case on this

600
00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:27,450
so why does it take salt get paid big

601
00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:28,980
company is notoriously slow to release

602
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:30,510
money if you've ever worked at a small

603
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:33,030
company that's trying to get money of a

604
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:34,810
big company it takes forever this is not

605
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:37,670
just a book but I think she's right

606
00:22:34,810 --> 00:22:38,990
big companies hold onto money as long as

607
00:22:37,670 --> 00:22:41,270
possible just doesn't matter of course

608
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:45,020
it's not they you know that desperately

609
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:47,180
it's just the way business works however

610
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:48,950
about platforms don't work up credit

611
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:50,720
they want the money up front and you can

612
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:54,230
probably already see why these two

613
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:56,090
things don't work together predicting

614
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:58,190
the rate you're fools will be really

615
00:22:56,090 --> 00:23:00,020
hard so you've got a slow drip feed of

616
00:22:58,190 --> 00:23:02,000
money over there and I'll that's a live

617
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:04,639
feed of me being eaten over there so you

618
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,500
could predict quite often a month or two

619
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:08,690
in advance how fast one's gonna burn

620
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:10,010
down which if your saw paying afraid of

621
00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:11,210
us hosting is easy because you've got a

622
00:23:10,010 --> 00:23:13,879
price list and if you'll pick up bug

623
00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:15,410
bounties you may pay sort of a couple of

624
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:17,300
hundred dollars over three weeks and

625
00:23:15,410 --> 00:23:20,060
then get hit for about eight grand in 48

626
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:21,470
hours so it's really really hard to some

627
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:23,000
manage that flow to actually make sure

628
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:27,040
that there's always money and when the

629
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:29,330
reports of the winning pay off again

630
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:30,950
what pay on fix what does it never gonna

631
00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:32,720
get fixed that must be a nightmare the

632
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:34,280
fact if you're reporting stuff to a

633
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,870
company and then they're looking out

634
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:37,879
thinking well we could fix it for all

635
00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:40,189
the reasons I mentioned earlier they're

636
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:42,910
not actually intending fixing that

637
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:45,290
rabbits do not actually get paid on it

638
00:23:42,910 --> 00:23:47,450
I'm the apparent feared return of does

639
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:49,010
record a level of trust and if you don't

640
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:58,400
receive people taking part you put back

641
00:23:49,010 --> 00:24:03,140
for a remnant problem so Laura radio

642
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:05,090
today I talk of last weekend to do that

643
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:06,230
I got else to do none of it because I

644
00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:07,850
spent most of the weekend teaching

645
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:11,150
myself GIMP because I couldn't find a

646
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:12,469
better image for to represent bling I

647
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:15,980
have a picture of Macklemore at one

648
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:17,990
point but I decided that yeah bling of

649
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:19,640
Mark and I realized well in fact I can't

650
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:21,620
actually think of anybody less blingy

651
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:23,510
and more money or money re intake than

652
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:27,860
mark book oh I brought like like dude

653
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:30,040
doing that so how'd you max my buddy get

654
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:30,040
paid

655
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:49,530
Oh smart doorbell some reason mad or at

656
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:53,730
home yes well things to be distracted

657
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:55,320
but not as they paid demonstrate risk no

658
00:24:53,730 --> 00:24:56,910
matter what ferret before we don't care

659
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:58,470
about how clever your hack is we don't

660
00:24:56,910 --> 00:25:01,230
care about how long it took we do care

661
00:24:58,470 --> 00:25:03,990
about risk so come up with examples are

662
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:05,670
actually demonstrate risk as an attacker

663
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:06,930
as a techie you in the studio we all

664
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:09,240
understand with JavaScript is right but

665
00:25:06,930 --> 00:25:10,740
you can pop it alert box we know that

666
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:12,000
that alert box come there means you own

667
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:13,650
the client you anything that's on the

668
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,170
clients there but it doesn't really

669
00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:18,330
demonstrate the risk very much however

670
00:25:16,170 --> 00:25:20,790
if you actually demonstrated steal alone

671
00:25:18,330 --> 00:25:22,919
SSO tokens and then transform that

672
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:24,360
simple XSS into an account takeover

673
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:26,640
because you've managed to log in as

674
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:27,899
somebody else by doing it that's really

675
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:31,170
easy a confidence to risk when you're a

676
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:32,700
company that actually deals with credit

677
00:25:31,170 --> 00:25:34,230
cards all the time you can just you can

678
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:36,540
show that for a simple exercise you can

679
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:41,790
get somebody's credit card past

680
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:42,960
that's real risk to demonstrate let's

681
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:45,620
say remember that we don't care about

682
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:47,610
the cleverness we do care about the risk

683
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:50,729
but understand what matters to your

684
00:25:47,610 --> 00:25:52,439
target ties into that and you know not

685
00:25:50,730 --> 00:25:54,840
all companies care about the same cares

686
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:56,730
of risk and reputation or compliant for

687
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:57,629
a glycin theta3 same type of deal we all

688
00:25:56,730 --> 00:25:59,160
care about different things so

689
00:25:57,630 --> 00:26:01,140
understand who you're reporting to

690
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:02,490
understand what scares them well what

691
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:03,810
are they absolutely terrified about are

692
00:26:02,490 --> 00:26:06,300
they terrified I have another data

693
00:26:03,810 --> 00:26:07,770
breach was they Ted what are they scared

694
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:11,700
about having all that customers account

695
00:26:07,770 --> 00:26:14,580
rinse it may not actually affect what

696
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:16,140
you get paid me most famous games are

697
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:17,490
quite prescriptive but it might well get

698
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:18,090
your fixed quicker and if it's a payoff

699
00:26:17,490 --> 00:26:21,060
fix

700
00:26:18,090 --> 00:26:23,159
scheme being paid quicker definite good

701
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:25,530
things now finally think about code

702
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:27,450
reuse if that vulnerability has made it

703
00:26:25,530 --> 00:26:30,590
onto that website that developers

704
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:33,000
screwed or if that company haven't got a

705
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:34,860
nice system to feed that knowledge

706
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,060
backing that software on my site off

707
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:38,370
come on so a bit later

708
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:40,050
then that mistaken be key to keeping

709
00:26:38,370 --> 00:26:41,850
made over and over again so if you found

710
00:26:40,050 --> 00:26:43,830
her I've really put in a certain area

711
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:44,519
the site look to think where might that

712
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:46,109
same

713
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:47,820
have been doing that same thing and poke

714
00:26:46,109 --> 00:26:49,259
and it may well be that you're one

715
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:52,769
gorilla you found over that you can find

716
00:26:49,259 --> 00:26:54,239
200 of it over there and it seems

717
00:26:52,769 --> 00:26:58,229
structured right that's 200 tons of

718
00:26:54,239 --> 00:27:00,269
papers okay so the realistic you can't

719
00:26:58,229 --> 00:27:02,940
bribers you can try especially the sweet

720
00:27:00,269 --> 00:27:04,349
well doesn't generally work in fact you

721
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:06,899
with coffee

722
00:27:04,349 --> 00:27:11,009
well we can actually help protects true

723
00:27:06,899 --> 00:27:13,139
for we can actually yeah we're not we're

724
00:27:11,009 --> 00:27:14,489
not battling with you we you know we

725
00:27:13,139 --> 00:27:16,799
want to find out those vulnerabilities

726
00:27:14,489 --> 00:27:17,909
if we can give you information isn't

727
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:20,700
gonna screwing the video of it to give

728
00:27:17,909 --> 00:27:23,700
you extra information without affecting

729
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:25,679
the business will we do it number five

730
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:27,359
it's not a new program why should I

731
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:28,469
bother this is one that's come from my

732
00:27:27,359 --> 00:27:29,728
experience at there that I've now

733
00:27:28,469 --> 00:27:32,159
started still a lot of other people

734
00:27:29,729 --> 00:27:35,489
about our program was into and along

735
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:37,169
with the longest time we I would be the

736
00:27:35,489 --> 00:27:47,039
time probably I've been coming three

737
00:27:37,169 --> 00:27:48,899
seconds not very good oh wow so as we

738
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:50,009
move from an internal program we're the

739
00:27:48,899 --> 00:27:52,049
only people that could report

740
00:27:50,009 --> 00:27:54,389
vulnerabilities are people are actively

741
00:27:52,049 --> 00:27:55,709
work for us we've now started invited a

742
00:27:54,389 --> 00:27:56,939
few externals on it and the first few

743
00:27:55,709 --> 00:27:58,889
people that we invite the people I've

744
00:27:56,940 --> 00:28:00,959
been knowing know for years been doing

745
00:27:58,889 --> 00:28:02,639
bank skimmers are making money oh and

746
00:28:00,959 --> 00:28:04,320
quite a few of those looked at the

747
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:09,418
scheme spent so over two or three hours

748
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:10,559
in gum now you didn't find very much and

749
00:28:09,419 --> 00:28:13,139
then we'll move on and go and find a

750
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:14,279
different target at the moment I've seen

751
00:28:13,139 --> 00:28:16,349
a lot of that there's a lot of people

752
00:28:14,279 --> 00:28:18,529
that go up to you guys have done an okay

753
00:28:16,349 --> 00:28:22,349
job of moving up the low-hanging fruit

754
00:28:18,529 --> 00:28:23,940
it's actually not worth my time on me

755
00:28:22,349 --> 00:28:25,229
spending your time on your program I can

756
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:27,509
go over that progra over there and just

757
00:28:25,229 --> 00:28:28,810
so you know who rob xs/s is for fallen

758
00:28:27,509 --> 00:28:32,110
yeah

759
00:28:28,810 --> 00:28:34,030
no matter where you get them from and so

760
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:35,260
we do get as I do because I why should I

761
00:28:34,030 --> 00:28:37,540
bother well there are a few reasons why

762
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:39,400
you should bother company like ours

763
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:40,840
hundred postcode deployments a day

764
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:43,120
that's a hell of a changing landscape

765
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:45,159
hundreds plus chances a day that

766
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:47,290
somebody screwed since you know five

767
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:49,660
thousand servers just one bit of our

768
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:51,159
platform last time I can find data for

769
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:52,990
and this is like by eighteen months ago

770
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:54,760
they've got 1 million three hundred

771
00:28:52,990 --> 00:28:58,680
thousand lines of code that's a lot of

772
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:58,680
scope people pick new things wrong

773
00:28:58,710 --> 00:29:03,130
quickness technology can move faster

774
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:05,260
than security some like colleagues down

775
00:29:03,130 --> 00:29:06,820
there on the phones we have his we're in

776
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:10,840
a company is encouraged to use

777
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:12,129
cutting-edge tools we're sort of you

778
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:13,510
know always using the latest and

779
00:29:12,130 --> 00:29:14,710
greatest things which is fantastic the

780
00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:16,180
developers do it means that we can

781
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:17,920
attract some amazing developers because

782
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:19,420
they get too close and great stuff but

783
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:23,320
it means that we somehow have to be

784
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:25,330
ahead of them and whilst we're your step

785
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:27,520
the very beginning I like old-fashioned

786
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:29,710
except in with simple web servers on the

787
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:34,600
rather than so ephemeral kubernetes

788
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:37,420
clusters but if with tin with a simple

789
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:39,520
VM on it maybe running PHP we've got an

790
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:41,290
absolute boatload of tools that are

791
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:43,270
partly out there partly STL see that we

792
00:29:41,290 --> 00:29:45,190
had invested over decades to make sure

793
00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:47,680
that trap code doesn't go out the door

794
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:49,750
so the newer stuff that to link isn't as

795
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:51,130
mature where it's available at all sure

796
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:53,830
we've got internal tools but it hasn't

797
00:29:51,130 --> 00:29:56,290
got all those years have been tested so

798
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:57,610
it means that the scope for actually new

799
00:29:56,290 --> 00:29:59,710
and interesting vulnerabilities coming

800
00:29:57,610 --> 00:30:01,300
out is a lot wider so focus on the new

801
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:06,100
stuff you know focus on get to a corner

802
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:07,060
store again if one of the interesting

803
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:08,679
things that some of these story

804
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:10,179
seriously about is that they were doing

805
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:12,130
us in a lot company they were looking at

806
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:13,780
the Tech Talks we were doing to get an

807
00:30:12,130 --> 00:30:14,980
understanding for what tech we were

808
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:17,560
using you know the fact that we were got

809
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:19,120
out and talking about our use of things

810
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:21,280
like Kafka and kubernetes and stuff I

811
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:22,929
was like ah right so you guys and it was

812
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:26,470
giving them a heads up so I think go and

813
00:30:22,930 --> 00:30:28,450
dig in okay people we use the same tools

814
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:29,500
you do think up Bob yeah coming about

815
00:30:28,450 --> 00:30:30,550
the low-hanging fruit thing if you're

816
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:32,320
just going to hit it with a bunch of

817
00:30:30,550 --> 00:30:33,850
off-the-shelf tools you know what we've

818
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:36,100
probably already got those building

819
00:30:33,850 --> 00:30:39,059
estelle SDLC already open up I'm nothing

820
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:41,080
with them we've kind of screwed up

821
00:30:39,059 --> 00:30:43,509
unless what was in the room who's

822
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:46,059
actually rinse quite it's quite a lot of

823
00:30:43,509 --> 00:30:50,889
people recently without a relatively

824
00:30:46,059 --> 00:30:52,899
office you're still well yeah it doesn't

825
00:30:50,889 --> 00:30:55,269
take a lot to actually raise yourself

826
00:30:52,899 --> 00:30:58,090
above that level of people's I just

827
00:30:55,269 --> 00:30:59,289
using automated tools and remember the

828
00:30:58,090 --> 00:31:00,939
how the hell does this get introduction

829
00:30:59,289 --> 00:31:02,859
thing that did a few minutes ago those

830
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:08,859
things do happen bad code makes it live

831
00:31:02,859 --> 00:31:11,049
don't assume that what I'm not trained

832
00:31:08,859 --> 00:31:12,939
dollar is egg is at every level somebody

833
00:31:11,049 --> 00:31:14,559
decided that was a good idea somebody's

834
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:18,669
headed at the optimal way to make a door

835
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:20,320
only not accidentally come on open

836
00:31:18,669 --> 00:31:21,999
during the trebles to lean out the

837
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:28,059
window people make really tough

838
00:31:21,999 --> 00:31:29,169
decisions so time too bad right so

839
00:31:28,059 --> 00:31:31,509
anybody I think what this next section

840
00:31:29,169 --> 00:31:36,549
is going to be what I thought was

841
00:31:31,509 --> 00:31:39,879
obvious some takeaways gotta get at

842
00:31:36,549 --> 00:31:43,899
least one bad joke in there so back to

843
00:31:39,879 --> 00:31:45,340
Cookie Monster Elmo again start off with

844
00:31:43,899 --> 00:31:47,320
T Cookie Monster's some things for the

845
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:48,459
companies out there that are actually

846
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:50,408
thinking of getting into this game

847
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:55,299
because I put it in the abstract and

848
00:31:50,409 --> 00:31:56,999
really wished I hadn't when are you

849
00:31:55,299 --> 00:31:59,408
ready to start pen test scheme and again

850
00:31:56,999 --> 00:32:00,970
people I came as a us do this far better

851
00:31:59,409 --> 00:32:04,809
than me your readers do you give you an

852
00:32:00,970 --> 00:32:06,700
idea the people have come on downstairs

853
00:32:04,809 --> 00:32:08,408
they are great they will tell you how

854
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:09,369
they can make your life easier they will

855
00:32:08,409 --> 00:32:11,499
give you some kinds about how you're

856
00:32:09,369 --> 00:32:12,988
ready however to me if you can't answer

857
00:32:11,499 --> 00:32:15,639
these questions with the right answer

858
00:32:12,989 --> 00:32:17,080
you've got better ways of finding those

859
00:32:15,639 --> 00:32:19,299
but really it's more cost-effective ways

860
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:20,830
in the book fancy scheme fix those first

861
00:32:19,299 --> 00:32:23,349
and then go down and talk to them about

862
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:25,629
sign up to on their program so I'll good

863
00:32:23,349 --> 00:32:27,820
pen test enough finally next to me more

864
00:32:25,629 --> 00:32:29,408
and buy good pen tests I mean a skilled

865
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:32,019
tester that you put inside your

866
00:32:29,409 --> 00:32:34,479
perimeter and give you an open scope

867
00:32:32,019 --> 00:32:36,249
exactly backing on you're probably safe

868
00:32:34,479 --> 00:32:38,919
if you're just going oh I'm secure

869
00:32:36,249 --> 00:32:41,679
because I want score for PC I left some

870
00:32:38,919 --> 00:32:43,779
sort of training key with necess just

871
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:47,799
scan it and possibly message results

872
00:32:43,779 --> 00:32:50,200
then that's not a pen test do you have a

873
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:50,570
good strong SLT with good code or in if

874
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,399
you

875
00:32:50,570 --> 00:32:53,899
don't have a good strong eye so SDLC

876
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:55,250
field software development cycle if you

877
00:32:53,899 --> 00:32:57,258
literally just shoveling code out the

878
00:32:55,250 --> 00:32:59,480
door without any real checks on it and

879
00:32:57,259 --> 00:33:00,740
you're not doing code or it you will get

880
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:02,450
more value at this stage of your

881
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:06,409
maturity bits fixing that before messing

882
00:33:02,450 --> 00:33:08,450
around with balance games do you already

883
00:33:06,409 --> 00:33:13,039
have a good working impressive ability

884
00:33:08,450 --> 00:33:14,960
disclosure process if if you don't fix

885
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:16,340
that first you should before you even

886
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:18,860
think about book that means you should

887
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:19,789
be able to simulate taking a report from

888
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:21,049
a member of the public about

889
00:33:19,789 --> 00:33:24,080
vulnerability if they found on your site

890
00:33:21,049 --> 00:33:27,289
and swiftly and efficiently watch that

891
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:30,080
go from this report through to that live

892
00:33:27,289 --> 00:33:30,350
fix code without it getting stuck in the

893
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:32,059
middle

894
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:33,889
if you can't demonstrate that you can do

895
00:33:32,059 --> 00:33:35,090
that you're not at the stage yet where

896
00:33:33,889 --> 00:33:36,289
this is going to really help you all

897
00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:37,759
you're going to do is pay a load of

898
00:33:36,289 --> 00:33:41,419
money to find a load of information you

899
00:33:37,759 --> 00:33:43,429
can't actually handle can on that can

900
00:33:41,419 --> 00:33:45,470
you trigger it quickly enough one of the

901
00:33:43,429 --> 00:33:47,299
big problems a lot of people have talked

902
00:33:45,470 --> 00:33:48,230
to when the triage is is that when they

903
00:33:47,299 --> 00:33:50,179
start their scheme they open the

904
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:52,190
floodgates and suddenly they've just got

905
00:33:50,179 --> 00:33:53,750
a huge stack of incoming problems that

906
00:33:52,190 --> 00:33:55,580
they can't actually manage you know

907
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:57,110
there's a company one of the reasons

908
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:58,549
that we stayed as an internal only

909
00:33:57,110 --> 00:34:01,459
scheme so the only people that could

910
00:33:58,549 --> 00:34:03,080
report to us or our own staff we did

911
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:05,360
that to actually make sure that we'd got

912
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:07,820
all the resources in in place to be able

913
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:10,549
to actually triage stuff quickly enough

914
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:13,460
without just having a big you know month

915
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:15,579
bit like the myth like the pile of bills

916
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:17,990
coming in just a pile of little report

917
00:34:15,579 --> 00:34:20,899
similar can you fix quick enough if you

918
00:34:17,989 --> 00:34:22,489
can't fix this this data isn't that much

919
00:34:20,899 --> 00:34:24,020
usually I mean sure you can appreciate

920
00:34:22,489 --> 00:34:26,209
the risk if it battery if you've seen

921
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:27,918
the vulnerabilities and rank them but

922
00:34:26,210 --> 00:34:29,210
realistically if none of this stuff's

923
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:30,549
actually going to get fixed if you

924
00:34:29,210 --> 00:34:33,349
haven't got a good enough and

925
00:34:30,550 --> 00:34:34,460
development process that you're taking

926
00:34:33,349 --> 00:34:36,020
these reports and actually getting a

927
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:38,089
fixed code for me okay it's just an

928
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:41,210
expensive way to find out a little bit

929
00:34:38,089 --> 00:34:43,639
of risk data and do you have a process

930
00:34:41,210 --> 00:34:46,310
ensures that all this data is fed back

931
00:34:43,639 --> 00:34:48,940
in your SDLC source saying my mistakes

932
00:34:46,310 --> 00:34:51,139
are made repeatedly very similar thing

933
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:52,310
if you haven't got that if you're

934
00:34:51,139 --> 00:34:54,020
literally just collecting

935
00:34:52,310 --> 00:34:55,849
vulnerabilities are fixing them this is

936
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:58,790
going to be a very very expensive way of

937
00:34:55,849 --> 00:35:00,140
doing pen tests and really spent us at

938
00:34:58,790 --> 00:35:01,310
that because they're completely open and

939
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:03,020
we'll never get the things you want to

940
00:35:01,310 --> 00:35:04,400
eat you need to be able to make sure

941
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:05,930
when you get those reports

942
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:08,750
that you haven't just fixed that

943
00:35:05,930 --> 00:35:09,919
vulnerability you fix the problems in

944
00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:11,299
your process that led to that

945
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:14,660
vulnerability getting alive on the

946
00:35:11,299 --> 00:35:15,020
website because I answered a bundle

947
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:16,848
there

948
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:18,890
oh yeah and can you achieve steady

949
00:35:16,849 --> 00:35:20,240
sustainable growth and put the brakes on

950
00:35:18,890 --> 00:35:21,589
they needed one of the big things that

951
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:23,598
are seating people are really struggle

952
00:35:21,589 --> 00:35:26,180
with schemes like this is when they've

953
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:27,710
gone write about a big treasure Lord we

954
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:29,538
have a book bounty even worse we have a

955
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:31,339
public book bands a scheme and then

956
00:35:29,539 --> 00:35:33,380
suddenly the floodgates are open they're

957
00:35:31,339 --> 00:35:35,779
going million reports on this like oh we

958
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:37,309
can't cook with this book however we

959
00:35:35,779 --> 00:35:39,680
just told the press we're doing it and

960
00:35:37,309 --> 00:35:42,740
we can't stop and we can't slow this

961
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:44,270
down help we're drowning my advice and

962
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:46,520
let's do what we did start small start

963
00:35:44,270 --> 00:35:47,630
internal only then grow and invite a few

964
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:49,430
more so you can actually control that

965
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:51,079
growth so the one problem do go wrong

966
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:53,390
with your process when when you can't

967
00:35:51,079 --> 00:35:55,369
keep up you can actually go to the

968
00:35:53,390 --> 00:35:57,170
people that you're working so IT guys

969
00:35:55,369 --> 00:35:58,220
we're screwed with the money this month

970
00:35:57,170 --> 00:35:59,270
it's going to be a month or two before

971
00:35:58,220 --> 00:36:01,399
you actually get you found the money

972
00:35:59,270 --> 00:36:03,140
because we are paper my man was right

973
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:04,250
off oh yeah glad you raised that

974
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:05,420
vulnerability but you're not gonna see

975
00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:07,849
that fixed for a while because we

976
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:10,339
realized that the people are owned that

977
00:36:07,849 --> 00:36:12,440
code on aren't ours therefore we

978
00:36:10,339 --> 00:36:14,150
provision scoped it so you can fix all

979
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:16,750
those sort of things early on before you

980
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:20,289
let them the Massey's on your scheme

981
00:36:16,750 --> 00:36:22,309
final tips for tune Cookie Monster you

982
00:36:20,289 --> 00:36:23,420
understand sure you're ready hello and

983
00:36:22,309 --> 00:36:25,730
you're sure that you have the resources

984
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:27,500
and same things they don't think make

985
00:36:25,730 --> 00:36:29,510
sure bump-out issues push back in your

986
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:32,480
SDLC pay on three hours as possible just

987
00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:36,650
that's nice time he'll fix is very nice

988
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:38,930
and grow slowly and control whiter than

989
00:36:36,650 --> 00:36:41,779
wanna keep stopped or considering an

990
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:44,538
internal Lord's first talks of hackers

991
00:36:41,779 --> 00:36:47,089
be as open as possible have a clear and

992
00:36:44,539 --> 00:36:50,809
concise payment structure and absolutely

993
00:36:47,089 --> 00:36:52,730
do that I mean one of the things we long

994
00:36:50,809 --> 00:36:55,039
from our launch is that we initially

995
00:36:52,730 --> 00:36:58,910
went with a a menu based payment

996
00:36:55,039 --> 00:37:02,839
structure and that just Bo basically

997
00:36:58,910 --> 00:37:03,140
xs/s $250 RCE thousand dollars that sort

998
00:37:02,839 --> 00:37:04,430
of thing

999
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:05,990
and we find out that didn't actually

1000
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:08,990
work for that didn't really build risk

1001
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:11,240
into it in any way and so we switched to

1002
00:37:08,990 --> 00:37:14,589
a CVS a space system which whilst not

1003
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:14,589
perfect he's a lot better

1004
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:20,450
there you go have a system that is yours

1005
00:37:18,859 --> 00:37:22,160
hacker to pay swiftly because nothing's

1006
00:37:20,450 --> 00:37:24,020
more annoying the hacker actually thinks

1007
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:27,859
the roadman it isn't getting it I know

1008
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:30,590
after onto their emails make sure your

1009
00:37:27,859 --> 00:37:32,060
triage azar technically proficient don't

1010
00:37:30,590 --> 00:37:34,880
treat this as a customer service thing

1011
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:36,440
don't give it your tech desk it takes

1012
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:39,050
actual skill people to be able to

1013
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:41,090
understand triage and prioritize this

1014
00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:43,730
properly I know these are hard to find

1015
00:37:41,090 --> 00:37:45,050
we've had empty job roles on the team

1016
00:37:43,730 --> 00:37:46,190
that the variables are on there for this

1017
00:37:45,050 --> 00:37:47,770
for a while so if you think you do it

1018
00:37:46,190 --> 00:37:50,150
come talk to me

1019
00:37:47,770 --> 00:37:56,030
ha if people are gonna look with floppy

1020
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:57,080
fluid thing was uneven I didn't even

1021
00:37:56,030 --> 00:37:58,010
thought about that before and I could

1022
00:37:57,080 --> 00:38:01,190
have done that for that rather than

1023
00:37:58,010 --> 00:38:05,420
winging it make sure your program

1024
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:07,340
results in properly prioritize is by

1025
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:09,619
risk not just cost it's really really

1026
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:12,290
easy to fall in the trap of fixing the

1027
00:38:09,619 --> 00:38:14,210
the most expensive books first

1028
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:15,560
if that isn't aligned with risk you're

1029
00:38:14,210 --> 00:38:22,690
doing it wrong he should be fixing risky

1030
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:22,690
stuff first so some things for Team Elmo

1031
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:27,230
don't assume into your programs not a

1032
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:29,990
finding jab oops

1033
00:38:27,230 --> 00:38:32,260
talk to you three ideas check those

1034
00:38:29,990 --> 00:38:35,149
stats toxic to your own community and

1035
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:37,780
showing simple packing notes may not be

1036
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:40,430
here next ruble you really about that

1037
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:42,290
yeah the book back forms a few of the

1038
00:38:40,430 --> 00:38:43,879
places that actually talk to each other

1039
00:38:42,290 --> 00:38:48,890
about programs find out out that what's

1040
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:50,359
worth being on what isn't if your

1041
00:38:48,890 --> 00:38:51,740
workplace you've any talk to those about

1042
00:38:50,359 --> 00:38:53,060
talk to your workplace about launching a

1043
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:55,098
scheme I appreciate a lot of bounty

1044
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:56,720
hunters on in bigger organizations but

1045
00:38:55,099 --> 00:38:58,130
if you are see whether you already

1046
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:59,990
flight into a launch for your honest

1047
00:38:58,130 --> 00:39:02,869
think it's because it's a really good

1048
00:38:59,990 --> 00:39:04,910
way of kickstart in you know your career

1049
00:39:02,869 --> 00:39:08,599
into a bug bounty hunting if you can

1050
00:39:04,910 --> 00:39:10,098
start on an internal program common

1051
00:39:08,599 --> 00:39:13,250
advice for bounty hunters everything

1052
00:39:10,099 --> 00:39:15,890
I've read seems to be go deep however my

1053
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:18,080
experience and to be fair a thing that

1054
00:39:15,890 --> 00:39:19,819
I've just read from you the other day is

1055
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:20,869
actually it seems that the top people

1056
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:23,359
the people are making the money of this

1057
00:39:20,869 --> 00:39:25,339
are going wide not deep these two chaps

1058
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:28,520
here am i proof of that as well the fact

1059
00:39:25,339 --> 00:39:29,480
that they're they're a very wide range

1060
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:30,890
of firms

1061
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:34,750
rather than just rinsing a couple of

1062
00:39:30,890 --> 00:39:34,750
them for everything they've got

1063
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:39,259
remember - oh yeah from that side being

1064
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:42,828
ready to learn which aliens have fun

1065
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:43,930
make money and grow those careers and

1066
00:39:42,829 --> 00:39:47,869
show off of it

1067
00:39:43,930 --> 00:39:49,549
cool and we'll hit that in time as well

1068
00:39:47,869 --> 00:39:51,920
even always carved with me or anything

1069
00:39:49,550 --> 00:39:54,260
I'm quite impressed did you

1070
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:55,730
I didn't say I've been too busy looking

1071
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:58,430
at that to revive my cell phone looking

1072
00:39:55,730 --> 00:40:00,170
at look at the audience so folks that

1073
00:39:58,430 --> 00:40:03,470
was me that's a guided to a life of the

1074
00:40:00,170 --> 00:40:17,390
book back triage yep any questions

1075
00:40:03,470 --> 00:40:18,828
Jeff on that caveat a disclaimer on the

1076
00:40:17,390 --> 00:40:21,290
front of that I'm the wrong side of the

1077
00:40:18,829 --> 00:40:22,820
fence to answer that and said there are

1078
00:40:21,290 --> 00:40:24,680
quite a few bounty hunters here who make

1079
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:29,150
me not useful hands up and sort of take

1080
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:30,379
composable I've started dabbling in that

1081
00:40:29,150 --> 00:40:32,270
side partly as a nice little bit of an

1082
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:34,220
experiment myself cuz I'm yeah what I

1083
00:40:32,270 --> 00:40:36,470
have kind of interested so I want to see

1084
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:38,328
how easy it was to get into there are

1085
00:40:36,470 --> 00:40:39,618
lots of stories about getting over that

1086
00:40:38,329 --> 00:40:41,119
initial hump to get onto the private

1087
00:40:39,619 --> 00:40:43,130
program as being quite hard that I've

1088
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:46,369
been I want to party see for myself hard

1089
00:40:43,130 --> 00:40:47,950
day's I mean ultimately there are

1090
00:40:46,369 --> 00:40:50,150
thousands of public programs out there

1091
00:40:47,950 --> 00:40:53,180
go just see what you can find

1092
00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:55,609
i it was disc wishing we Sean DC one

1093
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:57,770
five one on one of our local groups few

1094
00:40:55,609 --> 00:40:59,690
months ago when I raise this and this

1095
00:40:57,770 --> 00:41:01,250
isn't just the fun profit from programs

1096
00:40:59,690 --> 00:41:02,690
be fun if stuff on public programs all

1097
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:04,099
the time so don't believe these nonsense

1098
00:41:02,690 --> 00:41:06,319
that public programs have being rinsed

1099
00:41:04,099 --> 00:41:08,270
to death there is still stuff on them if

1100
00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:11,750
you're looking for ways to actually go a

1101
00:41:08,270 --> 00:41:12,980
little bit of a leg up say talk to tree

1102
00:41:11,750 --> 00:41:15,740
artists book talk to us if you're by

1103
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:17,599
going on to a few schemes focus the

1104
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:19,189
other day hacker one CTF now actually

1105
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:20,270
also offers you invites to schemes

1106
00:41:19,190 --> 00:41:22,310
because I realized people are being back

1107
00:41:20,270 --> 00:41:25,069
to a scheme at work based on that rep

1108
00:41:22,310 --> 00:41:28,069
alone so a few other ways into that but

1109
00:41:25,069 --> 00:41:30,079
realistically give it a go in fact even

1110
00:41:28,069 --> 00:41:32,690
better advice and boot party knows calm

1111
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:33,890
going to me inform them that go ask

1112
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:35,300
those guys keep going fairies very

1113
00:41:33,890 --> 00:41:39,819
talented guys advice to be doing it

1114
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:42,730
rather than either just loves it anymore

1115
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:52,270
compasses another question but you see

1116
00:41:42,730 --> 00:41:58,720
some problems comment and they disclose

1117
00:41:52,270 --> 00:42:02,080
the end points for level so they found a

1118
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:05,589
success here so the report at war that

1119
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:09,220
was a secure junctions here so go there

1120
00:42:05,590 --> 00:42:13,030
report again very nama Rupa doesn't leak

1121
00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:14,529
fixed yeah interesting idea and I mean I

1122
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:16,540
can see why that would work from the

1123
00:42:14,530 --> 00:42:17,890
woman's point of view I'm going to my

1124
00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:19,540
positive work and actually saying we're

1125
00:42:17,890 --> 00:42:23,950
gonna disclose M point so we know we've

1126
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:25,420
gotten abilities are might not fly boy I

1127
00:42:23,950 --> 00:42:26,710
picked up in town that's a joke problem

1128
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:28,480
is that it's a case of have you tell

1129
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:52,380
people not to waste time on something

1130
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:55,360
without having them over that process

1131
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:57,850
yeah almost to make the the concept of

1132
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:59,710
an NDA do protein got raised by some to

1133
00:42:57,850 --> 00:43:00,850
read through the davises I don't know

1134
00:42:59,710 --> 00:43:02,470
quite how I feel about that but it

1135
00:43:00,850 --> 00:43:04,600
certainly got me thinking and do wonder

1136
00:43:02,470 --> 00:43:05,890
whether that's a future state departing

1137
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:08,020
hunting world likely to see sort of a

1138
00:43:05,890 --> 00:43:09,609
step up from the the private program

1139
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:13,930
with you as an a private program with

1140
00:43:09,610 --> 00:43:16,660
with NDA I think I'm not gonna like this

1141
00:43:13,930 --> 00:43:17,799
am I so I suppose these people to walk

1142
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:20,410
around there right little Hughes

1143
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:21,940
Hannibal glad to see the common these

1144
00:43:20,410 --> 00:43:24,339
are a conflict of interest between the

1145
00:43:21,940 --> 00:43:25,780
devs writing the code and then off we

1146
00:43:24,340 --> 00:43:29,590
announce the year and have you managed

1147
00:43:25,780 --> 00:43:30,940
us I predict if I always predict that

1148
00:43:29,590 --> 00:43:32,650
question the fact it's come with room

1149
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:33,970
deal with it no it's never like a sale

1150
00:43:32,650 --> 00:43:37,360
please don't like a students because I

1151
00:43:33,970 --> 00:43:40,509
have to have that slide oh he says give

1152
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:48,580
any slide I absolutely have there's a

1153
00:43:40,510 --> 00:43:50,590
point to go oops I had to have that

1154
00:43:48,580 --> 00:43:52,850
slide on the end for that because

1155
00:43:50,590 --> 00:43:54,320
everybody always asks me loud

1156
00:43:52,850 --> 00:43:56,360
so it doesn't say rotten somebody that

1157
00:43:54,320 --> 00:44:01,550
actually knows my thoughts on the tasks

1158
00:43:56,360 --> 00:44:03,920
it yes it's a question gassed about a

1159
00:44:01,550 --> 00:44:05,960
lot to me it's an absolute non-issue if

1160
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:08,120
you're hiring developers that would

1161
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:10,400
raise books and then report them for

1162
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:12,799
bounty you've got an HR problem you've

1163
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:15,950
got hiring from I'm not a technical bug

1164
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:17,480
bounty program and even if you go one

1165
00:44:15,950 --> 00:44:20,240
stage further and sort of do the whole

1166
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:22,370
yeah well to people colluding you know

1167
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:23,750
person a raises and person B fixes we

1168
00:44:22,370 --> 00:44:26,450
don't have a rule in our place that you

1169
00:44:23,750 --> 00:44:27,680
can't report issues with any code you've

1170
00:44:26,450 --> 00:44:29,149
actually worked on so it would

1171
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:31,549
technically be possible to get to two

1172
00:44:29,150 --> 00:44:33,020
people colluding book where you put

1173
00:44:31,550 --> 00:44:34,430
collusion about conspiracy and where

1174
00:44:33,020 --> 00:44:35,420
your conspiracy you've got an extra risk

1175
00:44:34,430 --> 00:44:37,870
you're going to do that for a couple

1176
00:44:35,420 --> 00:44:41,360
thousand dollars in bank payments

1177
00:44:37,870 --> 00:44:42,770
probably not well yes I mean technically

1178
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:58,300
absolutely but it is always something

1179
00:44:42,770 --> 00:44:58,300
everybody else anymore for anymore yes

1180
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:03,859
the some of the logic behind why people

1181
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:06,890
prefer why companies prefer to pay on

1182
00:45:03,860 --> 00:45:09,260
fix is that there is an incentive for

1183
00:45:06,890 --> 00:45:12,740
the hacker to keep that knowledge

1184
00:45:09,260 --> 00:45:14,060
private until they've been paid however

1185
00:45:12,740 --> 00:45:15,620
if you'll allowing people on the scene

1186
00:45:14,060 --> 00:45:16,940
that that on your schema the only thing

1187
00:45:15,620 --> 00:45:18,620
that's stopping them disclosing that

1188
00:45:16,940 --> 00:45:20,330
vulnerability is the promise of money

1189
00:45:18,620 --> 00:45:23,240
again you're probably attracting the

1190
00:45:20,330 --> 00:45:25,880
wrong package I mean I can I get

1191
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:27,319
technically why you'd do it but it seems

1192
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:30,260
lost but yeah exactly that literally the

1193
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:31,790
case that it's a it's a contract and you

1194
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:33,770
know they did they think oh they're

1195
00:45:31,790 --> 00:45:41,810
going to keep Marshall for fuel adores

1196
00:45:33,770 --> 00:45:45,259
it yes that's why so cool you get a

1197
00:45:41,810 --> 00:45:47,240
second let me go for it yeah this one

1198
00:45:45,260 --> 00:45:50,270
fire you read a lot of time you suppose

1199
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:58,759
that you realized this horribly bro so

1200
00:45:50,270 --> 00:46:02,420
you say that a lot of time

1201
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:04,430
is that really not eating all you're

1202
00:46:02,420 --> 00:46:07,970
trying to do so my good news like I

1203
00:46:04,430 --> 00:46:10,399
slowly bro you need service basically

1204
00:46:07,970 --> 00:46:12,319
like an ad won't put that across to them

1205
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:14,030
in a way that doesn't scare backs that's

1206
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:15,350
a great question and my only experience

1207
00:46:14,030 --> 00:46:17,000
art is on the other side of the fence

1208
00:46:15,350 --> 00:46:18,259
because obviously I've been looking

1209
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,700
after work somewhere where we haven't

1210
00:46:18,260 --> 00:46:21,800
got that problem where we have got teams

1211
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:23,569
that trained deal with that but yes I'd

1212
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:26,090
report myself in exactly that situation

1213
00:46:23,570 --> 00:46:27,350
that because I'm technical because I can

1214
00:46:26,090 --> 00:46:28,520
explain that technical and what's wrong

1215
00:46:27,350 --> 00:46:29,960
with the site and you realize it's just

1216
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:32,480
some guy that's throwing up a wordpress

1217
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:34,400
blog that as forward some tutorial from

1218
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:35,869
eight years ago and so they're just if

1219
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:38,260
this doesn't work mob seven seven seven

1220
00:46:35,869 --> 00:46:41,150
everything no it works you know it's a

1221
00:46:38,260 --> 00:46:42,890
yeah it's a top and I haven't got a good

1222
00:46:41,150 --> 00:46:44,840
answer for that and if anybody has let

1223
00:46:42,890 --> 00:46:46,250
me know I mean I like to think I'm good

1224
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:50,030
at that part of my job is explaining

1225
00:46:46,250 --> 00:46:51,800
technical security concepts to not say

1226
00:46:50,030 --> 00:46:54,200
non-technical but sudden long security

1227
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:55,970
people so doing stuff down to a level of

1228
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:58,730
people were these kind of what I do but

1229
00:46:55,970 --> 00:47:00,169
yeah it is toughened I don't know if

1230
00:46:58,730 --> 00:47:00,920
I've ever had the tree I suppose to give

1231
00:47:00,170 --> 00:47:03,980
you an answer on that

1232
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:06,200
oh well absolute beginning don't focus

1233
00:47:03,980 --> 00:47:09,369
on the technical vulnerability focus on

1234
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:11,359
the risk focus on what the actual and

1235
00:47:09,369 --> 00:47:14,330
consequence of that vulnerability could

1236
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:16,160
be rather than hey you know you screwed

1237
00:47:14,330 --> 00:47:20,450
your positions over or whatever there's

1238
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:21,970
a deep there's not always a lot they go

1239
00:47:20,450 --> 00:47:26,299
punt

1240
00:47:21,970 --> 00:47:28,730
Kamil off it's not question issues that

1241
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:33,020
other suggestions that go on you just be

1242
00:47:28,730 --> 00:47:37,480
say about recession information really

1243
00:47:33,020 --> 00:47:40,160
else so if you could possibly remember

1244
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:43,400
this is the problem this is how to

1245
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:48,589
reproduce it CGS is fixed and I thought

1246
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:49,940
use the suggestion what they do still

1247
00:47:48,590 --> 00:47:52,310
there are internal schemes up pays a

1248
00:47:49,940 --> 00:47:53,600
dividend because internally people have

1249
00:47:52,310 --> 00:47:54,890
got access to the source and they

1250
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:56,750
actually understand the estate profit

1251
00:47:54,890 --> 00:47:58,970
are things out there that is a massive

1252
00:47:56,750 --> 00:47:59,510
win when you look down that thing yeah I

1253
00:47:58,970 --> 00:48:01,640
get that

1254
00:47:59,510 --> 00:48:02,720
so he says by the way this system over

1255
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:04,069
here what you've done and screw this

1256
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:05,660
thing up it's like great I can throw

1257
00:48:04,070 --> 00:48:07,340
that at the dev team they're gonna look

1258
00:48:05,660 --> 00:48:09,500
at validating yep you're right that fix

1259
00:48:07,340 --> 00:48:12,170
is gonna work how about the door really

1260
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:13,520
quickly whereas sometimes if we go

1261
00:48:12,170 --> 00:48:15,680
there's a thing over that it's wrong

1262
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:16,040
allocating on don't know why it's doing

1263
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:17,690
that

1264
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:21,980
worked all right when it was on a dead

1265
00:48:17,690 --> 00:48:24,200
box must be kubernetes problem so but

1266
00:48:21,980 --> 00:48:27,670
yeah that's what clues to remediation

1267
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:27,669
coming a big big big help

1268
00:48:28,930 --> 00:48:35,419
cool also sneaked in how messed up he

1269
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:40,730
wasn't here earlier when I was talking

1270
00:48:35,420 --> 00:48:42,260
about the money was he cool right no

1271
00:48:40,730 --> 00:48:44,770
more questions thank you very much for

1272
00:48:42,260 --> 00:48:44,770
for that
