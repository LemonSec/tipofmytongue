1
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:08,639
so thanks for coming and seeing my talk

2
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:11,190
I always find the spark of the talk the

3
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:15,059
hardest part so I wanted to start this

4
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:17,099
one with just a little story so I I went

5
00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:18,839
through this conference about a year ago

6
00:00:17,099 --> 00:00:20,279
maybe a year and a half it was good

7
00:00:18,839 --> 00:00:20,848
DevOps tastes like a really awesome

8
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:23,039
event

9
00:00:20,849 --> 00:00:26,579
it wasn't an info set conference it was

10
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:27,749
a DevOps conference so I went to go to

11
00:00:26,579 --> 00:00:31,470
gets very different perspective of

12
00:00:27,749 --> 00:00:33,870
things and that was a guy given a talk

13
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:36,480
and he said who here is in security so I

14
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:38,608
put my hand up so a few other hands go

15
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,930
up around her around the audience and

16
00:00:38,609 --> 00:00:44,399
then I heard some from the back just go

17
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:46,739
boo and to me that kind of that told me

18
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:50,160
what some of these other teams think

19
00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:53,640
about inverse act right InfoSec is often

20
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:55,858
blockers we're there to say you know you

21
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:57,839
can't go live or your application is

22
00:00:55,859 --> 00:00:59,940
broken or you can't do this and you

23
00:00:57,839 --> 00:01:01,498
can't do your job and actually I found

24
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:03,480
this this image online I don't know who

25
00:01:01,499 --> 00:01:05,790
made it but it kind of it says something

26
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:08,759
right even security these security as

27
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:11,820
the bad guy so I want to try and think

28
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:14,040
about ways where we could stop security

29
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:16,619
from getting in the way stop security

30
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:20,040
from being a blocker and tell me instead

31
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:21,930
turn security into an enabler I think

32
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,850
this is at least someone else's

33
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:25,530
automation because once we can start to

34
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:27,750
automate security we can start to

35
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:29,400
integrate security and when it's

36
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:35,610
integrated it actually becomes a part of

37
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:38,370
a company's ethos and their culture so

38
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:41,580
just quickly I Who am I I'm Jamel Harris

39
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:43,860
some people might know me as J I'm a pen

40
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:46,110
tester for digital interruption so this

41
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:48,780
is the company I started where but was

42
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:51,450
saskia right here um we do penetration

43
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:53,940
testing but also one thing we're going

44
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:55,770
to focus on is is more of this on like

45
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:58,560
deficit hawks type of approach to

46
00:01:55,770 --> 00:02:01,880
security so we're developing new tooling

47
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:04,020
and methodologies developers can use

48
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:05,610
firstly I'm interested in things like

49
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:07,098
mobile application security I really

50
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:09,690
like reverse engineering

51
00:02:07,099 --> 00:02:12,480
software-defined radio as well I've

52
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:13,890
given a couple of talks in SDR some

53
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,599
Twitter accounts that I think are worth

54
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:18,540
following

55
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:20,879
obviously me but also mentis the gray

56
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:23,010
hats so this is a group I run in

57
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:25,379
Manchester where we put on you know kind

58
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:26,909
of workshops are free workshops on all

59
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:28,888
kinds of topics I'm gonna get a lot of

60
00:02:26,909 --> 00:02:30,780
help from Thunder Manchester InfoSec

61
00:02:28,889 --> 00:02:33,840
scene there which is pretty awesome we

62
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:35,700
compete in cts we run CTF as well and

63
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,469
then the ice security is that company

64
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:38,909
Twitter account where we published our

65
00:02:37,469 --> 00:02:40,260
research and things so if you want to

66
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:42,298
keep an eye on you know what kind of

67
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:45,269
things we're releasing as a company I

68
00:02:42,299 --> 00:02:46,889
check that out I'm not a developer as

69
00:02:45,269 --> 00:02:49,859
you can see here I'm mostly looking at

70
00:02:46,889 --> 00:02:52,139
things from a security point of view and

71
00:02:49,859 --> 00:02:54,870
thinking how can I use my skills to help

72
00:02:52,139 --> 00:02:56,489
development before moving into security

73
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:58,409
I was a software engineer so I think

74
00:02:56,489 --> 00:03:00,060
that's maybe why I have a site down

75
00:02:58,409 --> 00:03:07,500
perspective compared to a lot of other

76
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:09,060
other pen testers I speak to so why did

77
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:11,010
I want to do this talk after speaking to

78
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:14,129
some other pen testers and a lot of my

79
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:15,599
friends they always tell me man I hate

80
00:03:14,129 --> 00:03:18,060
pen testing pen testing sucks I want to

81
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:19,500
go work in Sainsbury's instead and I got

82
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:21,239
totally get it because I felt this the

83
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:22,530
same way after afternoon pen testing for

84
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:25,199
a little while all right

85
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:26,729
it's actually really boring right anyone

86
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:27,989
here there's an experienced pen decimos

87
00:03:26,729 --> 00:03:30,060
that we spent a lot of time looking at

88
00:03:27,989 --> 00:03:30,689
the same types of things there's only so

89
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:32,400
many times

90
00:03:30,689 --> 00:03:34,739
finding cross-site scripting is going to

91
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,449
be interesting and I really hate being

92
00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:40,079
bored and pen testing yeah it can be

93
00:03:36,449 --> 00:03:42,000
simply kind of boring um writing

94
00:03:40,079 --> 00:03:43,799
low-risk issues as well

95
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,079
so when I'm on the test and I find all

96
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:48,659
these kind of low risk you know head is

97
00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:51,060
not HTTP headers not set or things like

98
00:03:48,659 --> 00:03:53,310
that I've got to put those in the report

99
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:54,659
and that means if the report takes a

100
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:57,299
long time to write because there's loads

101
00:03:54,659 --> 00:03:58,769
of those issues which take them to the

102
00:03:57,299 --> 00:04:01,049
next point with no one's gonna fix those

103
00:03:58,769 --> 00:04:04,500
right if you are the bad guy report

104
00:04:01,049 --> 00:04:06,989
these low risk issues um then they're

105
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:09,329
not worth fixing as the pen tester I

106
00:04:06,989 --> 00:04:11,430
need to report those because there's

107
00:04:09,329 --> 00:04:12,870
still a risk involved with them so I

108
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:14,150
need the brothers in the report need

109
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:16,978
spend the time right in the report

110
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:19,380
knowing that no one's gonna read it so

111
00:04:16,978 --> 00:04:21,449
that's like really the motivating ah so

112
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:22,860
from the pen testers side of point of

113
00:04:21,449 --> 00:04:25,560
view we think that is kind of limited

114
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:28,020
value to some organisations and the fact

115
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:30,389
that we still have horrible software

116
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:31,560
it proves that right companies are still

117
00:04:30,389 --> 00:04:34,379
getting breached even though they are

118
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:36,419
fantastic so pentesting yeah kind of

119
00:04:34,379 --> 00:04:38,009
coma sites from the develop their

120
00:04:36,419 --> 00:04:39,419
developers point of view again the

121
00:04:38,009 --> 00:04:40,919
reports get padded with these low risk

122
00:04:39,419 --> 00:04:42,750
issues so they're paying a small fortune

123
00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:45,090
to have someone come in and do a pen

124
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:47,819
test and what they get back is you know

125
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:51,239
a 50 page document that says we found

126
00:04:47,819 --> 00:04:53,909
that the cookie flag wasn't set or some

127
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:57,060
very convoluted but I've an ability

128
00:04:53,909 --> 00:04:58,650
that's not actually exploitable because

129
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:02,039
we don't understand the context of the

130
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:04,739
vulnerabilities so when I'm on the test

131
00:05:02,039 --> 00:05:06,539
I might be there for a week maybe two

132
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:07,650
weeks or something I don't really

133
00:05:06,539 --> 00:05:09,180
understand much about what the

134
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:12,120
application actually does so I can only

135
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:13,860
rate things based on my kind of

136
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:16,199
experience at the time and that doesn't

137
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:19,020
necessarily fit in with the reality of

138
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:22,259
what the organization needs so I might

139
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:23,549
risk something as as a high-risk but

140
00:05:22,259 --> 00:05:25,080
actually the organisation might have

141
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:27,289
controls in place it turns it into a low

142
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:29,758
and I'm not gonna know that all the

143
00:05:27,289 --> 00:05:31,409
developers are going to see is a pen

144
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:33,150
test report with a high risk high risk

145
00:05:31,409 --> 00:05:34,830
issue that is actually a low risk issue

146
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:36,508
or it could be the other way around I

147
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:38,400
might raise something as a medium and

148
00:05:36,509 --> 00:05:41,880
actually it's you know business critical

149
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:45,150
to them as an example I was doing a test

150
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:47,219
on a mobile application where I may have

151
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:48,929
to disable this the security control

152
00:05:47,219 --> 00:05:51,000
that to me it didn't raise him that

153
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:52,919
important but this was a big part of how

154
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,240
the company made money so once they saw

155
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:55,859
that you know this thought that I kind

156
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,990
of freaked out and I would have only

157
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:59,490
raised it probably as a loan because it

158
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:02,490
was very simple control that I didn't

159
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:04,979
really see was doing much anyway there's

160
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:07,259
a lot of ego insecurity and an info set

161
00:06:04,979 --> 00:06:10,139
um I was on site with a colleague of

162
00:06:07,259 --> 00:06:12,690
mine this was a few years back so he's

163
00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:15,270
honestly one of the most skilled hackers

164
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:19,020
and pen testers in the UK but we were on

165
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:21,779
flight together and blue balloons a code

166
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:23,430
of view and he just starts kind of

167
00:06:21,779 --> 00:06:24,900
mocking the developer like artists

168
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:26,310
developer you can't believe you had this

169
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:28,138
one ability look what I found blah blah

170
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:31,889
blah and the devil sitting right behind

171
00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:33,270
us so again imagine you are the other

172
00:06:31,889 --> 00:06:34,560
developer you've gotta work good InfoSec

173
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:35,639
and you're working with people like that

174
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:39,120
you know we have a lot of video and

175
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:41,920
we're hard to speak to and also I think

176
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:43,480
a lot developers understand that

177
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:45,040
I can't stop development right they need

178
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:47,200
to release on time that is the priority

179
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:49,540
when security comes in and says you

180
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:51,310
can't go live while the developer says

181
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:53,290
well you know what this is this is

182
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:54,460
what's making the company money so

183
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:56,830
there's always gonna be this friction

184
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:58,330
between between pen testing so we don't

185
00:06:56,830 --> 00:07:00,430
like it as pen testers developers don't

186
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:02,590
like it I couldn't provide them too much

187
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:04,960
value there's also this problem where

188
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:06,429
people don't even really know what a pen

189
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:09,070
test is and I'm sure a lot of people

190
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:11,410
have seen maybe in an email or something

191
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:13,719
ten test report with a capital P and as

192
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:16,870
if it stands for something cuz I see a

193
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:18,160
lot from them for my clients we've just

194
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:19,720
kind of points out to me that then

195
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,240
people don't actually know what pen test

196
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:26,590
is right they just know they they need

197
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:28,780
one I was speaking to speaking to this

198
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:30,940
client recently and we were going

199
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:32,650
through the Skorpion process and he said

200
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:34,000
so how long will this take

201
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:36,400
and I said oh you know he about five

202
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,620
days this is quite basic web app oh five

203
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,849
days it's a long time so you just you

204
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:41,710
say you press go and then you get the

205
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:43,870
results back five days later I'm like no

206
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:46,239
there's no there's no hack button it's

207
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:48,310
like five days of doing things but he

208
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:50,680
honestly had no idea what a pen test

209
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:55,060
entailed I just he knew at least he had

210
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:57,220
been told they needed to get one and

211
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:58,570
also we can't even in the industry we

212
00:07:57,220 --> 00:08:01,390
can't always agree with what a pen test

213
00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:04,180
is in a red team boils down for an

214
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:05,830
assessment you know these things if you

215
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:08,980
speak to any pen tester they can have a

216
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:10,840
slightly different way of thinking about

217
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:13,270
it or describing likely what that kind

218
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:15,969
of test is so we're confused

219
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:18,219
our clients are confused we say that pen

220
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:19,390
tests don't really provide value they

221
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:21,490
don't really want pen test anyway

222
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:25,570
because of all the things I've spoken

223
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:27,940
before so we're gonna just look at this

224
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:31,330
fictitious company and a bit of a case

225
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:33,940
study and they're called talk squared so

226
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:36,789
they have a number of occasions I'm glad

227
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:39,160
somebody got the joke so number of

228
00:08:36,789 --> 00:08:40,360
applications are web applications and

229
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:43,510
one of them was breached

230
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:44,830
okay well yeah they had a pen test so

231
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:46,180
how could something like this happen if

232
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:47,860
they have a kind actually they're secure

233
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:50,849
then again I'm gonna point out that this

234
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:52,100
is it's more of a fictitious bad thing I

235
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:55,169
mean

236
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:55,169
[Music]

237
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:00,099
sorry I mean I'm not reading too much

238
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,329
about smoke here yeah but yeah I mean

239
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:03,250
scope was actually a big thing

240
00:09:01,329 --> 00:09:06,128
pentesting is I'm actually a decided by

241
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:07,990
the next time I do this um so fictitious

242
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:12,149
company they have web applications one

243
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:14,290
of them work was breached so they have a

244
00:09:12,149 --> 00:09:15,759
traditional development star right so

245
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:17,920
they go through this waterfall

246
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:19,259
methodology which I'm sure everyone or

247
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:21,279
most people here will be familiar with

248
00:09:19,259 --> 00:09:24,240
basically we start by gathering

249
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:26,529
requirements design the application

250
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:28,089
implement it and then this is when

251
00:09:26,529 --> 00:09:30,310
testing so once the application is

252
00:09:28,089 --> 00:09:32,259
implemented and finished then they get

253
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:33,369
tested now this isn't just security

254
00:09:32,259 --> 00:09:36,610
testing this is going to be Quality

255
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:38,680
Assurance testing as well and actually

256
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:41,470
at this point sometimes this is come to

257
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:44,290
the end because the company realizes

258
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:45,939
they have enough budget for security so

259
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:47,469
they can't even think but in this case

260
00:09:45,939 --> 00:09:51,310
that's kind of assumed that they do get

261
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:56,410
a pen test and then only after that will

262
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:58,209
they deploy like as I said sometimes in

263
00:09:56,410 --> 00:10:00,130
the real world there really isn't enough

264
00:09:58,209 --> 00:10:04,089
budget to complete the security testing

265
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:06,009
which is a real shame so we looked at

266
00:10:04,089 --> 00:10:07,779
traditional methodologies and so let's

267
00:10:06,009 --> 00:10:12,430
look at what I would do in a more

268
00:10:07,779 --> 00:10:15,399
traditional type of pen test I would go

269
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:17,258
on site like which I quite enjoy don't I

270
00:10:15,399 --> 00:10:20,680
get to wear a suit for like a grown up

271
00:10:17,259 --> 00:10:23,259
which is pretty cool um so I got insight

272
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:25,750
I then have to usually go to a reception

273
00:10:23,259 --> 00:10:29,620
and you know go through security get a

274
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:31,630
badge then I wait my contact will come

275
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:34,389
meet me and he will show me the toilet

276
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:36,910
slop and where the coffee is I finally

277
00:10:34,389 --> 00:10:38,079
get to sit down I get I get my IP

278
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:39,939
address but I need the test or the

279
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:43,870
application or whatever and then I gotta

280
00:10:39,939 --> 00:10:46,719
wait for credentials and the worst I've

281
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:48,250
seen this is I was on site with three

282
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:51,220
other consultants we were there for five

283
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:53,379
days which is a 20 day engagement and we

284
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:56,559
spent the first three days waiting for

285
00:10:53,379 --> 00:10:58,449
credentials so the 15 days of the test

286
00:10:56,559 --> 00:11:00,759
on so we let credentials we do some

287
00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:03,279
testing when we can wait for some more

288
00:11:00,759 --> 00:11:05,529
credentials test a bit more venti we

289
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:06,430
leave and then we send a repeat the PDF

290
00:11:05,529 --> 00:11:08,439
report in the end

291
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:10,510
you know with there's been a lot of time

292
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:13,630
with distracting people writing reports

293
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:14,560
et cetera developers tend to feel like

294
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:15,370
this every time you find a vulnerability

295
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,959
right

296
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:20,529
because they just think they don't want

297
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:22,089
us to find things so we're there every

298
00:11:20,529 --> 00:11:24,640
time we find something they know that

299
00:11:22,089 --> 00:11:26,140
they've got to address it or fix it or

300
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:28,390
it's gonna affect their deadlines I'm

301
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:30,640
just gonna make them look bad the

302
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:33,069
companies are kind of throwing money at

303
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:36,899
the problem and testers have large day

304
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:39,940
rates um anytime we find issues the

305
00:11:36,899 --> 00:11:41,260
deadlines get pushed organisation have

306
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:43,810
to decide whether they accept the

307
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:45,880
vulnerability or whether they know they

308
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:49,180
have to need to manage it and etc

309
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:51,730
they're just throwing money away but as

310
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:55,209
a consultant if I'm fine from my point

311
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:57,010
of view so let's take this company and

312
00:11:55,209 --> 00:11:59,229
say that we did with some pen tests and

313
00:11:57,010 --> 00:12:00,730
we found some vulnerabilities we have

314
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:02,589
some critical vulnerabilities such as

315
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:04,089
remote code execution or sequel

316
00:12:02,589 --> 00:12:06,430
injection

317
00:12:04,089 --> 00:12:08,560
you know the client-side prices are

318
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:09,459
trusted so in this petition application

319
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,650
let's say that is some kind of

320
00:12:09,459 --> 00:12:13,959
e-commerce site you know if this

321
00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:16,750
trusting prices from the client that

322
00:12:13,959 --> 00:12:20,310
that's a big deal and then you know a

323
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:23,650
load of issues I would say a high risk

324
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:25,630
such as you know coupons might be

325
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:28,510
guessable or likely sent occasionally

326
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:29,709
some pages you know there's always a ton

327
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:32,709
of medium risk issues

328
00:12:29,709 --> 00:12:35,260
not everyone him with Nessa agree that

329
00:12:32,709 --> 00:12:38,199
all these are medium but that's kind of

330
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:39,790
on the problems right the way that I

331
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:42,520
rate the run abilities is fairly

332
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:45,699
subjective but I think about what I

333
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:47,230
think it should be as a risk so but

334
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:48,910
there are some techniques like the more

335
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:50,470
objective so there's like cbss schools

336
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:51,760
and things but then these have their

337
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:54,910
weaknesses were they don't always

338
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:56,500
capture the right details so sometimes

339
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:58,630
yeah I might write something as medium

340
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:59,829
when and other pen testers wouldn't or

341
00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:01,300
maybe I would even rate it as a

342
00:12:59,829 --> 00:13:04,089
different thing on a different day you

343
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:09,479
know sometimes it's just like poor you

344
00:13:04,089 --> 00:13:09,480
medium and then loads of low risk issues

345
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:15,459
so we're gonna try and do is let's see

346
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:17,980
if we can take these issues and see how

347
00:13:15,459 --> 00:13:20,239
many of those we can automate away okay

348
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:21,980
or we can we can automate so that

349
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:25,459
you no longer will find them during a

350
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:26,990
pen test but before we do that hands up

351
00:13:25,459 --> 00:13:29,018
if you would have gone live with with

352
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:30,350
this pen test report so if you had a

353
00:13:29,019 --> 00:13:32,149
application with all these

354
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:37,309
vulnerabilities would anyone go live

355
00:13:32,149 --> 00:13:38,689
with it what hmm why not yeah and you

356
00:13:37,309 --> 00:13:40,639
know what there are tears I see that

357
00:13:38,689 --> 00:13:41,540
most companies they will go live when

358
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:44,179
they know that there are vulnerabilities

359
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:46,040
because again you know they have to make

360
00:13:44,179 --> 00:13:47,899
money and making money is that priority

361
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:49,849
which it should be it kind of makes

362
00:13:47,899 --> 00:13:51,589
sense so I've definitely been there

363
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:54,110
situations where we've delivered similar

364
00:13:51,589 --> 00:13:56,209
reports to this and there's no choice

365
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:57,769
but to our life there's always the idea

366
00:13:56,209 --> 00:14:00,609
that they will fix the run derbys fun

367
00:13:57,769 --> 00:14:03,050
business later but that rarely happens

368
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:09,069
in fact I remember this one time I was

369
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:13,040
doing a test went back six months later

370
00:14:09,069 --> 00:14:14,599
and did did another test for them I

371
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:16,969
guess I'm application to have the same

372
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,929
issues so um did you address anything in

373
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:19,990
northern loss pen test you know what

374
00:14:17,929 --> 00:14:22,429
happened oh there was a pen test before

375
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:26,179
that so I think what happened is the

376
00:14:22,429 --> 00:14:28,220
teams have changed the PDF report that

377
00:14:26,179 --> 00:14:29,869
we send through which is why we do n

378
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:31,819
tests normally must just got lost in

379
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:34,459
someone's inbox so they had no

380
00:14:31,819 --> 00:14:35,839
visibility of that at all so they have

381
00:14:34,459 --> 00:14:40,969
no idea the offenders that even happened

382
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:43,970
six months prior so the solution I think

383
00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:45,559
is we can't ignore security right that

384
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:47,449
would be a problem so we need to pull it

385
00:14:45,559 --> 00:14:50,118
hand into the hands of the developers

386
00:14:47,449 --> 00:14:51,799
and the test is already in the team so

387
00:14:50,119 --> 00:14:52,910
we will left-shift it all right we're

388
00:14:51,799 --> 00:14:54,740
fine put your questions for the

389
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:57,969
beginning of the development process so

390
00:14:54,740 --> 00:15:01,100
that's been mostly to testing earlier um

391
00:14:57,970 --> 00:15:03,290
so it's cheaper which is fantastic but

392
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:05,240
also there are different ways to test

393
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:06,799
when when it's earlier so our for

394
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:08,809
example unit testing and we look at that

395
00:15:06,799 --> 00:15:10,220
in a bit later but unit test is not

396
00:15:08,809 --> 00:15:12,649
something that I'm mentally gonna do as

397
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:14,389
part of a pen test but it is totally one

398
00:15:12,649 --> 00:15:18,410
of the ways that developers test their

399
00:15:14,389 --> 00:15:22,809
applications so let's look at

400
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:27,469
requirements and design part of the the

401
00:15:22,809 --> 00:15:28,639
design the methodology I'm kind of team

402
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:30,199
putting these two things together but I

403
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:31,759
think they're related so we're gonna see

404
00:15:30,199 --> 00:15:34,130
if we can integrate security in the

405
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:37,820
requirements and the design part

406
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:41,450
of the application development so

407
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:42,710
firstly um I'll say is for some

408
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:44,570
applications you might decide actually

409
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:47,150
you don't you don't really care about

410
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:49,250
security and that's fine if it's an

411
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:51,290
internal application maybe that has no

412
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:54,470
user data or maybe only trusted users

413
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:56,480
can use it it's probably I probably

414
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:58,160
don't need that much security involved

415
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:00,380
with it so don't worry about it focus

416
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:01,910
your efforts on other things if it's a

417
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:03,880
FinTech application something that's

418
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:05,750
public something that handles payments

419
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:07,850
something that's likely to be attacked

420
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:11,270
these are the applications where we need

421
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:14,720
to add more more budget to do security

422
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:18,130
tests and do them earlier and you pro

423
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:18,130
you the pen test as well in these cases

424
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:23,660
but the the thing is it should be an

425
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:25,640
informed decision to understand your

426
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:29,000
application understand whether it should

427
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:30,770
be tested or not and so I kind of like

428
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,390
how I try to put this in there a bit of

429
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:33,949
a graph right so if there's something

430
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:36,590
that's down here when the greenside

431
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:37,910
forget about it um if this don't often

432
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:41,510
what's more the red side you want to add

433
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:43,939
more security budget more budget should

434
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:45,380
be used for security only it's kind of

435
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:47,480
relevant to each company's risk appetite

436
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:53,000
as to where they want a place or

437
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:56,270
application so firstly let's think about

438
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:58,190
kind of the ways that we can discover

439
00:16:56,270 --> 00:17:02,060
threats you want to be able to think

440
00:16:58,190 --> 00:17:05,510
like an attacker so in the design stage

441
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:07,879
we want to say say ok so how might an

442
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:09,260
attacker abuse our applications and

443
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:11,780
there are a few different techniques we

444
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:14,300
can use so we have threat modeling um

445
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:16,609
this is where we start to decompose and

446
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:18,709
understand the application where we want

447
00:17:16,609 --> 00:17:20,179
to try and determine the threats and

448
00:17:18,709 --> 00:17:21,770
determine the countermeasures that we

449
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:23,300
want to do and this would be more like a

450
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:25,099
brainstorming activity right so we'll

451
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:26,540
sit down and try and and model the

452
00:17:25,099 --> 00:17:28,580
threats of the application think about

453
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:29,930
one attacker might have to do where the

454
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:32,240
attackers were coming from what assets

455
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:34,940
are they gonna be after I really like

456
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:38,900
abuse stories don't we like the name is

457
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:42,170
weird after Google a few stories but so

458
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:43,310
this is more like a in fact we'll talk

459
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:45,200
about this on the next line so I'll come

460
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:46,760
back to it one thing that I'd also

461
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,840
recommend is looking at previous pen

462
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:50,629
test reports

463
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:54,889
often times there may be some common

464
00:17:50,629 --> 00:17:56,509
vulnerabilities to an organization so if

465
00:17:54,889 --> 00:17:58,340
you're developing an application and

466
00:17:56,509 --> 00:17:59,929
you've had previous pen test on take a

467
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:02,720
look at those try and understand those

468
00:17:59,929 --> 00:18:05,570
maybe there's maybe there's a library

469
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:06,889
that has been used a lot that's

470
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:08,779
introducing fun abilities or maybe

471
00:18:06,889 --> 00:18:10,879
there's too certain the coding practices

472
00:18:08,779 --> 00:18:13,070
that is kind of inherent within that

473
00:18:10,879 --> 00:18:14,748
company so if you can identify those by

474
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:16,039
reading previous pen test reports you

475
00:18:14,749 --> 00:18:18,200
have another way of thinking like an

476
00:18:16,039 --> 00:18:23,990
attacker to try and improve the next

477
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:25,879
design training of course if you don't

478
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:27,200
want security training send your team on

479
00:18:25,879 --> 00:18:29,449
security so many developers and your

480
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:31,999
testers then they have that they would

481
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:34,580
have an understanding of how how pen

482
00:18:31,999 --> 00:18:36,470
testing works and how security testers

483
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:38,539
will go out looking for vulnerabilities

484
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:41,450
and I will say what this might be a good

485
00:18:38,539 --> 00:18:43,429
place to to bring in external help but

486
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:46,909
you do need to use external consultants

487
00:18:43,429 --> 00:18:48,139
these security firms do it right at the

488
00:18:46,909 --> 00:18:50,450
beginning rather than right at the end

489
00:18:48,139 --> 00:18:53,570
which is more traditional way you know

490
00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:58,159
have them come in and help you to to

491
00:18:53,570 --> 00:19:00,200
brainstorm threats to applications so

492
00:18:58,159 --> 00:19:02,509
with a few stories they kind of like

493
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:04,519
user stories in scrum but more from the

494
00:19:02,509 --> 00:19:05,330
attackers point of view so we can say is

495
00:19:04,519 --> 00:19:06,529
as an attacker

496
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:08,658
I want to login to the application

497
00:19:06,529 --> 00:19:10,369
without knowing the password and you can

498
00:19:08,659 --> 00:19:13,460
document these and you can just get a

499
00:19:10,369 --> 00:19:15,559
list of as many as possible know as a

500
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:17,059
type I want to to get free stuff or as

501
00:19:15,559 --> 00:19:19,220
intact there I want to change the

502
00:19:17,059 --> 00:19:21,918
ranking of specific products all right

503
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:23,960
so we have a way of documenting the

504
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:26,389
things that an attacker might want to do

505
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:28,070
within the application and of course

506
00:19:26,389 --> 00:19:30,199
with each of these they can be broken

507
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:32,029
down further so as an attacker I want to

508
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:34,159
log into the application without knowing

509
00:19:32,029 --> 00:19:35,869
the password well we can prove force it

510
00:19:34,159 --> 00:19:37,399
right might be after you sequel

511
00:19:35,869 --> 00:19:40,070
injection to bypass the authentication

512
00:19:37,399 --> 00:19:43,639
mechanism maybe it as part of Reese

513
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:44,689
reset for another user so these things

514
00:19:43,639 --> 00:19:46,309
we've broken it down and again this

515
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:48,619
should be something this was done with

516
00:19:46,309 --> 00:19:50,149
the team it should be done with a

517
00:19:48,619 --> 00:19:53,299
brainstorming session try to understand

518
00:19:50,149 --> 00:19:57,739
as many ways that an attacker might be

519
00:19:53,299 --> 00:19:59,750
able to abuse the system so in theory if

520
00:19:57,740 --> 00:20:01,700
we did this properly and then design

521
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:03,529
your application based on this on

522
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:05,330
abuse stories there would be no

523
00:20:03,529 --> 00:20:06,830
vulnerabilities but of course there will

524
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:11,510
be implementation issues that we need to

525
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:15,559
address later so one thing that I like

526
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:16,879
is security requirements right I when

527
00:20:15,559 --> 00:20:18,590
applications of the birth they need to

528
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:20,149
be this requirements document where they

529
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:22,490
slay out what the application should do

530
00:20:20,149 --> 00:20:23,889
very rarely do I see security

531
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:29,269
requirements added to that list

532
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:31,428
so if if we start at things such as web

533
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:33,110
progressively over HTTPS

534
00:20:31,429 --> 00:20:36,889
this becomes a requirement the

535
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:38,600
application so now pay a good

536
00:20:36,889 --> 00:20:40,939
application and application the meets

537
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:44,269
the requirements a finished application

538
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:45,919
is a secure application but we've added

539
00:20:44,269 --> 00:20:48,830
that the security requirements into what

540
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:51,230
complete looks like and we can use some

541
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:54,519
of the previous techniques we saw to do

542
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:54,519
IP security requirements

543
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:02,450
so with security requirements we're

544
00:21:00,019 --> 00:21:07,010
gonna what we try to do is we define

545
00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:08,360
design problems early on okay so we've

546
00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:09,830
looked at their requirements the design

547
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:11,809
stage we thought about how to try and

548
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:13,189
add security for that about

549
00:21:11,809 --> 00:21:15,408
implementation how we're gonna try and

550
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:18,799
add security into the actual encoding

551
00:21:15,409 --> 00:21:20,059
side of things I think it's really

552
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:23,570
important to embed security knowledge

553
00:21:20,059 --> 00:21:25,908
inside the team again with training

554
00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:27,980
right so we if we have developers and

555
00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:30,110
testers understanding what security is

556
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:34,429
they they have another kind of tool to

557
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:38,240
be able to to use to detect for security

558
00:21:34,429 --> 00:21:39,950
vulnerabilities and they have the the

559
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:42,919
knowledge to write good code write

560
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:44,360
secure code herring is a really like

561
00:21:42,919 --> 00:21:46,130
this technique so with pairing you might

562
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:49,399
have two developers sitting in front of

563
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:52,309
the same keyboard I'm actually coding

564
00:21:49,399 --> 00:21:56,209
together and if one of those guys or

565
00:21:52,309 --> 00:21:57,408
girls people if one of those I got

566
00:21:56,210 --> 00:22:03,230
thought of last time for using these

567
00:21:57,409 --> 00:22:05,240
guys so if those coders has security

568
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:08,960
understanding then they will actually be

569
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:10,760
able to must train the other one because

570
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,230
you know so one person goes to write

571
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:14,299
some code room for example this they are

572
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:15,290
seeking judging the other person sitting

573
00:22:14,299 --> 00:22:17,120
there and

574
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:18,590
sighs they were Beyonce RIT that's a fun

575
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:21,679
ability there you need to change it this

576
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:22,820
way then it's the knowledge kind of

577
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:25,550
being spread within the team

578
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:27,530
the advantage is once the parents are

579
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:29,540
the pair's change now you've got two

580
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:31,490
people on Social Security and so that

581
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:33,770
pairs will understand it as well so it

582
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:37,850
kind of makes it the security noise

583
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:42,379
mixes within the team the very very sort

584
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:45,620
of non-threatening way security SME

585
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:47,510
started matter experts actually I would

586
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:50,179
like to see more companies hiring people

587
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:51,890
to be the subject matter expert in the

588
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:53,630
team so this will be someone that they

589
00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:55,400
can actually developers can actually go

590
00:22:53,630 --> 00:22:56,780
to the last question hey you know like

591
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:59,360
what happens if I do this or what is

592
00:22:56,780 --> 00:23:01,430
what's the best way to do this or what's

593
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:03,709
the risk of you know handing something

594
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:05,240
this way so this is like it should be a

595
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:09,170
dedicated role I think it's really

596
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:10,760
really important rather than just either

597
00:23:09,170 --> 00:23:13,960
happy to google it or guess it or bring

598
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:16,070
in expensive external contractors

599
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:17,300
security champions so this is slightly

600
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:18,320
different from SME this will be

601
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:20,450
someone's actually part of the team

602
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:22,970
someone that's maybe a developer as well

603
00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:24,920
and and they're the person you're

604
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:27,320
highlighting as the person that want to

605
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:30,020
be more involved to security I think is

606
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:31,429
actually really important because when I

607
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:32,840
was a software engineer I was really

608
00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:34,940
interested in security and the only way

609
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:37,129
I could really do security stuff was to

610
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:38,720
comment on tester would it would have

611
00:23:37,130 --> 00:23:39,980
been awesome if they would have said hey

612
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,510
you know what you interested in security

613
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:43,340
how about your the security champion

614
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:45,140
will send you to security conferences

615
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:47,360
would you know add training around

616
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:49,610
security then they would have had my

617
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,870
security knowledge inside the dev team

618
00:23:49,610 --> 00:23:52,459
which would have been great

619
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:54,199
and I've seen not like I saw my friends

620
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:56,390
as well have similar backgrounds where

621
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:57,590
they were developers they wanted to do

622
00:23:56,390 --> 00:24:00,400
security stuff and the only solution

623
00:23:57,590 --> 00:24:03,230
they had was the content tester because

624
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:04,940
where they work did not didn't give them

625
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:09,140
the flexibility to do more security

626
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:11,620
things security code review is a good

627
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:14,630
way to embed security into the team so

628
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:17,270
lots of places they will have some code

629
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:21,320
review process before Cole gets checked

630
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:22,840
in or used and if we're looking at that

631
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:25,040
from a security point of view as well

632
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:28,580
then that's a really good way to pick up

633
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:28,908
security issues and also to embed this

634
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:32,228
ID

635
00:24:28,909 --> 00:24:34,879
of quality security quality inside the

636
00:24:32,229 --> 00:24:38,049
code base so developers were actually

637
00:24:34,879 --> 00:24:40,009
quite proud of the code they write and

638
00:24:38,049 --> 00:24:41,509
but one of the problems is that security

639
00:24:40,009 --> 00:24:44,090
has never really become a metric of

640
00:24:41,509 --> 00:24:45,499
quality for a lot of them so once that

641
00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:48,619
happens with things like code review

642
00:24:45,499 --> 00:24:50,779
then quite security becomes a measure of

643
00:24:48,619 --> 00:24:52,879
quality and then because I won't be

644
00:24:50,779 --> 00:24:54,440
proud of their code that will be a few

645
00:24:52,879 --> 00:24:56,599
around a bit is now understand secure

646
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:59,239
ditches a bit more has anyone heard of

647
00:24:56,599 --> 00:25:01,489
chat ops before yeah so I came across

648
00:24:59,239 --> 00:25:04,249
this some reason I really liked it I

649
00:25:01,489 --> 00:25:05,869
worked at a place doing internal pen

650
00:25:04,249 --> 00:25:08,960
testing for quite a large company and

651
00:25:05,869 --> 00:25:12,709
there was this there was a lot of

652
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:16,879
developers use slack my turn to the guys

653
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:19,039
in security and said is anyone here on

654
00:25:16,879 --> 00:25:21,109
slack and they'll be beyond slack

655
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:22,609
there's just developers and you know the

656
00:25:21,109 --> 00:25:24,019
whole team is here anyway so we don't

657
00:25:22,609 --> 00:25:26,299
need to mic ok fair enough

658
00:25:24,019 --> 00:25:29,359
and I went on slack and I hosted more

659
00:25:26,299 --> 00:25:31,879
security questions in slack then I did

660
00:25:29,359 --> 00:25:33,379
any other way that was the assumption in

661
00:25:31,879 --> 00:25:35,238
the security team that if the developer

662
00:25:33,379 --> 00:25:36,918
had a question they would call us up or

663
00:25:35,239 --> 00:25:39,470
often as in that email or something but

664
00:25:36,919 --> 00:25:40,999
as he is they were mostly just asked the

665
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:43,249
question on slack and hope somebody

666
00:25:40,999 --> 00:25:46,129
would answer it and by having someone in

667
00:25:43,249 --> 00:25:48,529
arm in the slack channel who honestly

668
00:25:46,129 --> 00:25:51,199
security was he able to to really help

669
00:25:48,529 --> 00:25:53,659
them in a way that made sense for them

670
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:56,049
and of course conferences I think

671
00:25:53,659 --> 00:25:58,399
companies are really important both from

672
00:25:56,049 --> 00:26:00,379
InfoSec so if you're working with

673
00:25:58,399 --> 00:26:02,299
developers send them to InfoSec

674
00:26:00,379 --> 00:26:04,189
conferences they learn a lot also I

675
00:26:02,299 --> 00:26:06,139
think I say if I set people to go to

676
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:08,029
more developer conferences and try and

677
00:26:06,139 --> 00:26:09,978
you know it's great if I can talk to

678
00:26:08,029 --> 00:26:12,049
other security people about what I do

679
00:26:09,979 --> 00:26:14,090
but it's better if I tweet the

680
00:26:12,049 --> 00:26:18,259
developers about whitey and get them to

681
00:26:14,090 --> 00:26:20,959
understand why security is important um

682
00:26:18,259 --> 00:26:24,710
ok so developers they know they want to

683
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:27,229
add security in develop is know have to

684
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:29,649
test their own code and there's this

685
00:26:27,229 --> 00:26:33,549
really useful technique unit testing

686
00:26:29,649 --> 00:26:36,889
where we write code to test our code I

687
00:26:33,549 --> 00:26:41,859
very rarely see security tests on a unit

688
00:26:36,889 --> 00:26:41,859
testing at the testing level is a shame

689
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:45,649
if we can try and integrate secure

690
00:26:44,179 --> 00:26:47,179
testing to unit testing again we have a

691
00:26:45,649 --> 00:26:52,580
different way of testing for security

692
00:26:47,179 --> 00:26:54,279
vulnerabilities so what might a unit

693
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:56,750
test was security one bit he looked like

694
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:59,630
well given the attacker can submit a

695
00:26:56,750 --> 00:27:01,250
username and password when they try more

696
00:26:59,630 --> 00:27:03,020
than five incorrect passwords then they

697
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:05,029
then the account should be locked so

698
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:06,350
this is following more of like a bdp or

699
00:27:05,029 --> 00:27:08,990
behavioral drift and development

700
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:11,959
approach to unit testing but we map out

701
00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:13,850
our requirements that we saw earlier we

702
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:15,470
can map those out to statements like

703
00:27:13,850 --> 00:27:18,770
this and when we have a statement like

704
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:20,419
this we can turn it into some code now

705
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:22,668
this is not good code it probably won't

706
00:27:20,419 --> 00:27:24,169
work really for the unit test but we can

707
00:27:22,669 --> 00:27:26,090
see that we have with setting up the

708
00:27:24,169 --> 00:27:28,370
application the way that we want with

709
00:27:26,090 --> 00:27:30,168
with doing some kind of action I found

710
00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:32,629
logged in five times and then we check

711
00:27:30,169 --> 00:27:34,279
if the account is locked so now we have

712
00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:38,330
a way that every time that application

713
00:27:34,279 --> 00:27:39,679
is built this test will run and the

714
00:27:38,330 --> 00:27:42,740
developer instantly knows whether

715
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:47,750
there's weather updating is vulnerable

716
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:49,429
to to brute forcing accounts and I think

717
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:50,840
the real part is here is that it is run

718
00:27:49,429 --> 00:27:55,190
every single time that the application

719
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:57,740
is built so we've got some

720
00:27:55,190 --> 00:28:00,429
implementation stuff arm and what about

721
00:27:57,740 --> 00:28:02,870
moving off to the testing side of things

722
00:28:00,429 --> 00:28:04,760
why I would say is we have tons of

723
00:28:02,870 --> 00:28:06,889
Packer tools for hackers right I think

724
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:09,460
we need fewer of those we need are more

725
00:28:06,890 --> 00:28:12,409
hacker tools for developers and testers

726
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:16,850
things like birth suite and sequel map

727
00:28:12,409 --> 00:28:19,789
and and map awesome tools for a pen

728
00:28:16,850 --> 00:28:21,939
tester but they don't really make too

729
00:28:19,789 --> 00:28:24,440
much sense for for other people because

730
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:29,960
they don't work in a way that makes

731
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:32,270
sense for the way that they work like as

732
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:34,940
an example I remember there's this open

733
00:28:32,270 --> 00:28:37,789
source tool it's really cool I used a

734
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:39,110
lot for in pen test and the company that

735
00:28:37,789 --> 00:28:41,090
created it they tried to make a pro

736
00:28:39,110 --> 00:28:42,590
version of it and they added they added

737
00:28:41,090 --> 00:28:44,779
a GUI on top of it as I think oh now

738
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:46,850
it's a pro version for developers and no

739
00:28:44,779 --> 00:28:49,340
one bought it because it just it wasn't

740
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:51,250
how developers wanted to use the kind of

741
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:54,168
software and how they wanted to test

742
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:56,640
test their code well they want isn't is

743
00:28:54,169 --> 00:28:58,920
more like this so

744
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:00,630
it needs to be something to have an API

745
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:02,420
that can be integrated into the build

746
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:04,560
system so when the application is built

747
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:07,950
with Jenkins for example with Jenkins

748
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:09,899
think and then kick off scans correlate

749
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:11,760
results and then give back a pass or

750
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:13,130
fail to the developer no they don't

751
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:15,570
necessarily want them that has a

752
00:29:13,130 --> 00:29:22,020
command-line tool with a cool hacker

753
00:29:15,570 --> 00:29:24,720
banner in it and actually I did this a

754
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:27,570
few years ago I took a pen testing tool

755
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:29,250
I use quite a lot and I added a wrapper

756
00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:32,129
around it so that it could be run from

757
00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:33,090
Jenkins headed a plugin in Jenkins and

758
00:29:32,130 --> 00:29:36,570
this was actually kind of cool because

759
00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:39,300
what it meant is that when I built an

760
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:40,980
Android application it would run these

761
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:43,020
texts automatically and if the

762
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:44,790
application had the run abilities the

763
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:46,740
field would fail and I'd get kind of

764
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:48,960
instant feedback about that and if the

765
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:50,760
tool I found there was no run abilities

766
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:53,100
then that the potential passed in the

767
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:55,440
application would build successfully I

768
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:58,649
did write a blog post about this which

769
00:29:55,440 --> 00:30:00,360
you can see on my website I think we've

770
00:29:58,650 --> 00:30:02,760
actually expanded that since then and

771
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:05,280
we're actually developing this kind of

772
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:07,290
like larger tool around this we do have

773
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:10,050
a web interface make things easy but

774
00:30:07,290 --> 00:30:11,370
really are the core of it is this API

775
00:30:10,050 --> 00:30:12,810
that means that you know the web

776
00:30:11,370 --> 00:30:14,699
interface might change maybe you can run

777
00:30:12,810 --> 00:30:16,050
it from Jenkins or you know you can

778
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:18,240
write from online if you want because

779
00:30:16,050 --> 00:30:19,830
it's just the Web API but this is the

780
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:24,050
way that I think security tools should

781
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:26,580
evolve do something that is it is

782
00:30:24,050 --> 00:30:28,470
programmable some of that could be

783
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:29,939
controlled by an API because this is how

784
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:35,280
that developers want to test their code

785
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:36,210
in this how they can test their code so

786
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:45,540
there are a few different types of

787
00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:47,640
security tooling sassed is static static

788
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:49,649
code scanning tools so what they'll do

789
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:52,230
is they will take a code base and they

790
00:30:49,650 --> 00:30:54,570
will just scan the source code what

791
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:56,310
abilities uses pattern matching also my

792
00:30:54,570 --> 00:30:58,919
taint analysis where it says that here's

793
00:30:56,310 --> 00:31:00,929
the input here's the output and the

794
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:04,290
input is coming from a web request in

795
00:31:00,930 --> 00:31:05,940
the output is going into a connector

796
00:31:04,290 --> 00:31:06,930
base for example and nothing's happening

797
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:08,850
in the middle so therefore there's

798
00:31:06,930 --> 00:31:10,230
probably sequel injections so it will

799
00:31:08,850 --> 00:31:13,110
scan the application for

800
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:15,510
or fun abilities but I can't stand the

801
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:17,939
source code Nick Jones guy we could talk

802
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:19,620
about this at depth at Def Con a few

803
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:21,450
years back and there's tons of tools

804
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:22,290
that do this kind of thing but I'm 40

805
00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:24,360
there's a lot of them are really

806
00:31:22,290 --> 00:31:27,899
expensive the open source ones tend not

807
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:29,870
to be so great unfortunately then you've

808
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:33,450
got that which is more dynamic testing

809
00:31:29,870 --> 00:31:35,399
so with with that this is running test

810
00:31:33,450 --> 00:31:36,810
cases against a live application this

811
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,980
can be kind of hard to set up in a way

812
00:31:36,810 --> 00:31:40,169
because you need to have the live

813
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:41,580
application there and working before you

814
00:31:40,170 --> 00:31:43,020
can start running the test cases against

815
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:45,000
it but you know think about when you're

816
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:46,379
running like standing-room birth suite

817
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,760
for example or something where it's

818
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:49,830
actually sending off whatever requests

819
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:52,980
to the application doing some tests and

820
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:55,649
the same tape is up on a bit here these

821
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:57,420
tools exist but they need to be made

822
00:31:55,650 --> 00:31:59,910
kind of aware of the application and

823
00:31:57,420 --> 00:32:01,830
they need to understand what risks are

824
00:31:59,910 --> 00:32:04,260
so it is and how the application works

825
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:05,610
to to be really effective but they can

826
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:09,660
be funny better for logic floors

827
00:32:05,610 --> 00:32:12,300
compared disasters and then I asked is

828
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:13,350
pretty like a new way of doing it but

829
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:16,110
this is cool it's kinda like that's

830
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:17,459
where it's doing dynamic stuff but it's

831
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:21,929
using instrumentation so you have an

832
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:24,360
application maybe that's running and you

833
00:32:21,930 --> 00:32:26,700
will the the if' tools will hook it and

834
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:29,310
then add security checks in on the

835
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:30,720
background the advantage is you can have

836
00:32:29,310 --> 00:32:32,610
your normal test cases running or you

837
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:34,880
can just use the application and because

838
00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:38,370
these two what by cooking the

839
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:40,560
application is running he is almost

840
00:32:38,370 --> 00:32:42,780
doing security test tests for free which

841
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:46,620
is really awesome but there are some

842
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:48,750
downsides as well so we've automated

843
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:52,649
security all good we've got our that's

844
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:55,740
my SAS tools we can finish right I'm 40

845
00:32:52,650 --> 00:32:59,700
it's not quite as easy as that scan

846
00:32:55,740 --> 00:33:02,430
times can be an issue so I took a kind

847
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:04,980
of a vulnerable application and run his

848
00:33:02,430 --> 00:33:08,580
app and burps we against it the scan

849
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:10,770
times were not super useful took way too

850
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:11,939
long something that's not that people

851
00:33:10,770 --> 00:33:16,950
don't really want to add that to their

852
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:18,780
build times I tried running the version

853
00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:19,410
2 of but again it's the same application

854
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:21,649
that found

855
00:33:19,410 --> 00:33:24,299
I don't think actually finished the scan

856
00:33:21,650 --> 00:33:26,460
it just didn't have a handle the app

857
00:33:24,299 --> 00:33:28,320
so I could be quite naive to just say

858
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:30,360
run a scanner and you will get all the

859
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:32,178
results you do get some good things

860
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:35,129
right you say you do find a lot of stuff

861
00:33:32,179 --> 00:33:36,419
but it doesn't find everything and again

862
00:33:35,130 --> 00:33:38,789
you need to be able to tune the tool

863
00:33:36,419 --> 00:33:40,350
properly to really get the most

864
00:33:38,789 --> 00:33:42,960
advantage out there I've seen so many

865
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:45,000
development teams just take this app for

866
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:47,880
example and they just they just put a

867
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:50,100
URL in this app hit Stan and then they

868
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:52,230
assume that's going to give them full

869
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:53,490
cooperativity application in 8,000 it

870
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:56,400
needs to be solved properly so they

871
00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:58,590
understand two authentication and you

872
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:59,820
know in switch pages to use and you know

873
00:33:58,590 --> 00:34:02,399
all kinds of stuff they take a long time

874
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:08,100
to configure it correctly and many dev

875
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:10,139
teams might do that so our with QA

876
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:12,719
testing again we can try and add

877
00:34:10,139 --> 00:34:14,100
security into this as well QA testers

878
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:17,310
can be really good at automating tests

879
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:18,719
but often they ignore security I was

880
00:34:17,310 --> 00:34:19,949
speaking to the test at once and she

881
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:22,799
said to me

882
00:34:19,949 --> 00:34:25,469
I asked you know DeeDee security testing

883
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:29,429
I'm as part of your mobile testing she

884
00:34:25,469 --> 00:34:30,709
said security isn't my job so okay well

885
00:34:29,429 --> 00:34:33,210
actually it's kind of a bonus job

886
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:34,859
interestingly I'm like a month or two

887
00:34:33,210 --> 00:34:36,510
ago she messaged me said you know asked

888
00:34:34,859 --> 00:34:38,429
on your own security is everyone's job

889
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:40,050
and it's awesome that that that she

890
00:34:38,429 --> 00:34:41,879
thought you changed her mind and

891
00:34:40,050 --> 00:34:43,409
understand the security is totally

892
00:34:41,879 --> 00:34:46,739
accessible and it's something everyone

893
00:34:43,409 --> 00:34:47,879
is take responsibility for and it means

894
00:34:46,739 --> 00:34:50,668
that they can use the techniques that

895
00:34:47,879 --> 00:34:52,980
they use the tests to do security tests

896
00:34:50,668 --> 00:34:55,710
which again normally would just happen

897
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:59,460
during a pen test and if we can we can

898
00:34:55,710 --> 00:35:05,550
use them to to help us with automated

899
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:07,080
automating our testing as well so if we

900
00:35:05,550 --> 00:35:09,060
have the security requirements that we

901
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:11,190
look at at the beginning we can actually

902
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:13,560
turn these into test cases all right we

903
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:15,690
can we it will be easy for a QA test or

904
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:17,640
easier for a th tester take these test

905
00:35:15,690 --> 00:35:19,109
cases and make a test and they don't

906
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:20,910
actually even need to understand the ins

907
00:35:19,109 --> 00:35:23,100
and outs of security you know they can

908
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:25,319
they can make a test case to see that

909
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:28,080
will requests are goin over HTTP without

910
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:29,640
understanding why that's important and

911
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:31,319
what that means is these are going to be

912
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:35,160
fewer vulnerabilities that I find in a

913
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:37,859
pen test and actually I got this message

914
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:40,769
from somebody recently I was Gabe a

915
00:35:37,859 --> 00:35:42,989
the torque at of the workshop our mobile

916
00:35:40,769 --> 00:35:45,450
application security testing at a

917
00:35:42,989 --> 00:35:47,460
conference good test bash and they ever

918
00:35:45,450 --> 00:35:49,769
talk this person actually they won't

919
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:51,059
even act my workshop I was just talking

920
00:35:49,769 --> 00:35:54,149
about security this for like days

921
00:35:51,059 --> 00:35:56,819
because honest I won't shop about it so

922
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:58,410
I got this message from them and they

923
00:35:56,819 --> 00:36:00,630
said you know I found my first phone

924
00:35:58,410 --> 00:36:02,819
ability an application we were testing

925
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:05,039
an application and I realized that it

926
00:36:02,819 --> 00:36:07,019
was sending the password over HTTP

927
00:36:05,039 --> 00:36:08,910
well you'll a school like this is not a

928
00:36:07,019 --> 00:36:11,069
super complex run ability but the fact

929
00:36:08,910 --> 00:36:12,868
that they are after listening to me

930
00:36:11,069 --> 00:36:14,730
thinking that ok security is not a big

931
00:36:12,869 --> 00:36:15,989
scary thing I actually managed to find a

932
00:36:14,730 --> 00:36:17,940
funny bit in one of the applications

933
00:36:15,989 --> 00:36:20,249
they were testing proved to me that

934
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:22,230
actually this kind of approach can work

935
00:36:20,249 --> 00:36:24,450
and again it's one fewer thing I need to

936
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:27,319
write in the pen test rapport I want to

937
00:36:24,450 --> 00:36:31,169
try and minimize as much as possible

938
00:36:27,319 --> 00:36:32,730
we've spoken about applications all that

939
00:36:31,170 --> 00:36:34,289
infrastructure side well once we have

940
00:36:32,730 --> 00:36:35,249
infrastructure as code which is one of

941
00:36:34,289 --> 00:36:36,900
the keys to DevOps

942
00:36:35,249 --> 00:36:39,480
we can start to use some of the same

943
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:41,339
tools we can use the SAS tools to scan

944
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:44,220
all sort of the scanner code

945
00:36:41,339 --> 00:36:46,349
infrastructure code we can compare the

946
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:48,538
configuration files to a good baseline

947
00:36:46,349 --> 00:36:50,759
and we can say you know we know this

948
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:54,140
this service this service you only have

949
00:36:50,759 --> 00:36:56,460
what 80 open or 4 4 4 3 open or whatever

950
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:58,890
with the config files that's used to

951
00:36:56,460 --> 00:37:00,480
generate that infrastructure we can make

952
00:36:58,890 --> 00:37:02,549
sure that that never changes if it does

953
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:05,579
change it can be highlighted it can be

954
00:37:02,549 --> 00:37:07,319
highlighted with an selected therefore

955
00:37:05,579 --> 00:37:09,119
all the odds person understand that

956
00:37:07,319 --> 00:37:12,869
there's been a change that is against

957
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:16,200
the baseline if you can't do something

958
00:37:12,869 --> 00:37:18,239
like this there are other options such

959
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:19,288
as using hacking tools like nmap

960
00:37:18,239 --> 00:37:20,970
vanessa's like we saw before

961
00:37:19,289 --> 00:37:23,579
you're right wrappers around them and

962
00:37:20,970 --> 00:37:25,859
try to integrate them into into your

963
00:37:23,579 --> 00:37:28,440
process but that's gonna have some

964
00:37:25,859 --> 00:37:31,529
challenges running these tools in a an

965
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:33,749
automated way that's quick and easy to

966
00:37:31,529 --> 00:37:35,700
pass the results from this is harder

967
00:37:33,749 --> 00:37:40,980
than more about the infrastructures code

968
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:44,879
type of thing so we instead that we've

969
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:46,559
changed our security checks into

970
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:48,289
something that's more like this alright

971
00:37:46,559 --> 00:37:50,819
so the developer would commit some code

972
00:37:48,289 --> 00:37:52,730
so that source code repo and this will

973
00:37:50,819 --> 00:37:55,650
start bills

974
00:37:52,730 --> 00:37:58,470
that bill system might check for

975
00:37:55,650 --> 00:38:00,030
vulnerable dependencies right and then

976
00:37:58,470 --> 00:38:02,160
it will run some source code scanning

977
00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:03,660
stuff maybe the source code scan will

978
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:06,000
actually run on the developers box as

979
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:08,009
well so as they're developing in the IDE

980
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:10,220
they get instant feedback about any

981
00:38:08,010 --> 00:38:13,140
security verses that introduce him

982
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:14,879
dynamic tests might get run and may be

983
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:17,430
that the volume it has only run once a

984
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:18,690
week because they take more time but

985
00:38:17,430 --> 00:38:22,169
they can be run as part of the build

986
00:38:18,690 --> 00:38:25,890
system and only if all these things are

987
00:38:22,170 --> 00:38:28,890
successful the build gets deployed on in

988
00:38:25,890 --> 00:38:30,720
the point deployed in production so we

989
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:32,009
have a way of pushing straight to

990
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:34,770
production which developers want to do

991
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:36,750
we also have security in place so now

992
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:38,850
security has become something that can

993
00:38:36,750 --> 00:38:43,770
help developers get into production with

994
00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:45,330
less risk it's also repeatable no these

995
00:38:43,770 --> 00:38:47,100
are these checks will happen every time

996
00:38:45,330 --> 00:38:48,360
that dedications gets built you know

997
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:56,759
gonna have a pen test every time that

998
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:58,050
liege in this bill so that working had

999
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:59,850
more of this traditional approach around

1000
00:38:58,050 --> 00:39:04,290
well as we're trying to move more into

1001
00:38:59,850 --> 00:39:05,790
something like this but where does hem

1002
00:39:04,290 --> 00:39:08,759
testing fit into something that is

1003
00:39:05,790 --> 00:39:10,710
continuously being deployed I tried to

1004
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:12,870
do pen testing a company where they had

1005
00:39:10,710 --> 00:39:16,920
a very agile approach to their

1006
00:39:12,870 --> 00:39:18,600
development and they want us to pen test

1007
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:21,710
their application that changed every

1008
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:24,690
week it was it was almost impossible

1009
00:39:21,710 --> 00:39:26,220
testing became mostly just doing code

1010
00:39:24,690 --> 00:39:28,500
reviews right to try and see what's

1011
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:29,730
changed you know how can we try and find

1012
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:32,880
some run abilities in this area

1013
00:39:29,730 --> 00:39:34,500
oh wait note the codes changed again so

1014
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:37,820
where does like pen testing and things

1015
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:43,110
fit into actually this type of the saved

1016
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:44,190
well what I would say is remember this

1017
00:39:43,110 --> 00:39:45,780
side where we said that some

1018
00:39:44,190 --> 00:39:49,710
applications do require pen testing

1019
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:50,670
which is totally true I'm gonna say

1020
00:39:49,710 --> 00:39:52,140
something that we pushed into our

1021
00:39:50,670 --> 00:39:53,490
clients as well and actually there might

1022
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:55,740
be something in this room the dynast

1023
00:39:53,490 --> 00:39:59,250
really agree with what I'm gonna say and

1024
00:39:55,740 --> 00:40:01,259
if you don't want me it oh yes but if we

1025
00:39:59,250 --> 00:40:03,570
have this more our automated way of

1026
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:05,290
doing testing where security testing

1027
00:40:03,570 --> 00:40:07,750
where we know we have a

1028
00:40:05,290 --> 00:40:10,540
a known good application is going into

1029
00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:13,240
production we might say that maybe every

1030
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:15,100
you know ex deployment I have after X

1031
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:17,740
number of months or something then we

1032
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:20,080
actually just have a tick box pen test

1033
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:22,479
now I'm a pen tester that's saying that

1034
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:24,460
in this case if all these things are set

1035
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:26,530
up a tick box pen test might be okay

1036
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:28,900
it's gonna be cheaper right because I

1037
00:40:26,530 --> 00:40:31,120
don't require as many skills it's a good

1038
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:34,000
way to get new people into security so

1039
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:36,790
it's gonna open up a new set of roles

1040
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:39,220
where they go in and look for kind of

1041
00:40:36,790 --> 00:40:41,380
known issues they're gonna say it's more

1042
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:43,089
like a verification to say okay we know

1043
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:44,590
that these tools have been working

1044
00:40:43,090 --> 00:40:46,690
correctly and there's been no big

1045
00:40:44,590 --> 00:40:48,970
changes that the tools hasn't picked up

1046
00:40:46,690 --> 00:40:50,800
or you know things like that so it's not

1047
00:40:48,970 --> 00:40:52,839
about discovering new issues but mainly

1048
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:55,450
verifying everything that you know about

1049
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:59,680
is correct and again I think this is

1050
00:40:55,450 --> 00:41:01,240
going to be a real I realize a real way

1051
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:09,009
to kind of change the way that pen

1052
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:11,169
testing happens but also I think what it

1053
00:41:09,010 --> 00:41:12,820
would mean is that when the more

1054
00:41:11,170 --> 00:41:14,200
experienced pen testers come in they can

1055
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:17,460
work in a way that's more like this

1056
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:19,660
right they can do more like a red team

1057
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:22,870
continuous type of thing where we're not

1058
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:24,819
necessarily limited by to the scope of

1059
00:41:22,870 --> 00:41:26,500
one specific application instead we

1060
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:28,660
might be monitoring an organization

1061
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:32,260
looking for in a book that one weakness

1062
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:34,029
that pops up at some point they can have

1063
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:35,790
like an internal security team this just

1064
00:41:34,030 --> 00:41:38,290
content in looking at everything and

1065
00:41:35,790 --> 00:41:40,810
being able to feed that back into the

1066
00:41:38,290 --> 00:41:42,490
development process so they find you

1067
00:41:40,810 --> 00:41:44,590
know this issue being deal not picked up

1068
00:41:42,490 --> 00:41:46,089
by on the tick-box pen test will the

1069
00:41:44,590 --> 00:41:48,340
cheaper tick-box pen test not be if I

1070
00:41:46,090 --> 00:41:50,260
buy the tooling this kind of continuous

1071
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:51,970
style of testing we'll pick that up and

1072
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:53,770
they feed that back into the development

1073
00:41:51,970 --> 00:41:56,020
team where they can fix it and this is

1074
00:41:53,770 --> 00:41:59,230
where you look for kind of more complex

1075
00:41:56,020 --> 00:42:01,180
logic issues or new bones things that

1076
00:41:59,230 --> 00:42:04,360
take a bit more understanding of

1077
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:09,250
security and kind of more experience in

1078
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:11,140
security and you need to be able to tie

1079
00:42:09,250 --> 00:42:13,510
that all together all right so we have

1080
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:15,609
now we have security coming in but not

1081
00:42:13,510 --> 00:42:17,530
just with pen testing at the end but we

1082
00:42:15,610 --> 00:42:19,120
kind of coming in from the continuity

1083
00:42:17,530 --> 00:42:21,850
running with the staffs and the desk to

1084
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:24,250
coming from the QA testers and more this

1085
00:42:21,850 --> 00:42:25,960
red team approached our to continuous

1086
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:27,250
security as well and you know bug

1087
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:29,050
batteries might fit into that and

1088
00:42:27,250 --> 00:42:31,360
security test cases and that was all

1089
00:42:29,050 --> 00:42:34,500
coming into a central database which

1090
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:36,730
Jenkins or the build system is using to

1091
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:40,870
to decide whether the applications

1092
00:42:36,730 --> 00:42:42,730
should be deployed or not but in a way

1093
00:42:40,870 --> 00:42:44,410
it will happen as it currently is a PDF

1094
00:42:42,730 --> 00:42:47,710
that gets most in someone's mailbox and

1095
00:42:44,410 --> 00:42:49,330
I think this is a way better solution so

1096
00:42:47,710 --> 00:42:51,120
if I people say to you to me that won't

1097
00:42:49,330 --> 00:42:53,890
work

1098
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:55,690
well some things they say is need to be

1099
00:42:53,890 --> 00:42:58,420
a really leet hacker to find security

1100
00:42:55,690 --> 00:42:59,200
probabilities and I think like that's

1101
00:42:58,420 --> 00:43:02,410
not true right

1102
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:04,089
you can be you'd have to be very skilled

1103
00:43:02,410 --> 00:43:05,680
in security to file security

1104
00:43:04,090 --> 00:43:08,290
vulnerabilities checking that something

1105
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:10,419
is going over HTTP doesn't require lots

1106
00:43:08,290 --> 00:43:12,880
lots of skills checking whether sequel

1107
00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:14,680
injection lock fittings bundle sequel

1108
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:18,100
injection doesn't necessarily require

1109
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:21,399
lots of skills to understand it and to

1110
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:23,740
exploit it and to you know take that and

1111
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:24,790
leverage and be able to do something

1112
00:43:23,740 --> 00:43:28,209
kind of cool

1113
00:43:24,790 --> 00:43:30,160
or something that's arm like shove off

1114
00:43:28,210 --> 00:43:32,290
the the issue might require more

1115
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:33,910
experience but just don't detect it or

1116
00:43:32,290 --> 00:43:35,259
to find it oftentimes it's just putting

1117
00:43:33,910 --> 00:43:43,149
a couple of characters into a box and

1118
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:45,490
seeing what happens so automated test

1119
00:43:43,150 --> 00:43:47,190
won't find everything that's true

1120
00:43:45,490 --> 00:43:49,870
but I don't find everything either

1121
00:43:47,190 --> 00:43:52,330
honestly if I've had a bad night's sleep

1122
00:43:49,870 --> 00:43:54,940
I might not find some some run abilities

1123
00:43:52,330 --> 00:43:56,230
if it's a new technology there will be

1124
00:43:54,940 --> 00:43:59,280
things I'm just I've never seen before

1125
00:43:56,230 --> 00:44:01,390
often I've seen juniors do testing like

1126
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:03,550
testing application and that's the only

1127
00:44:01,390 --> 00:44:04,629
pen test that happens again that don't

1128
00:44:03,550 --> 00:44:07,270
have the experience to find everything

1129
00:44:04,630 --> 00:44:08,860
either so it's okay to not find

1130
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:11,530
everything so as long as we can find

1131
00:44:08,860 --> 00:44:13,840
a lot of things or more things than

1132
00:44:11,530 --> 00:44:16,480
would happen without running it without

1133
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:22,990
going into automated tests then you can

1134
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:25,090
do them better either pen test to be

1135
00:44:22,990 --> 00:44:27,430
secure well that's not the pen tester

1136
00:44:25,090 --> 00:44:29,350
make sure you secure it's fixing the run

1137
00:44:27,430 --> 00:44:31,480
ability so anything that we can do to

1138
00:44:29,350 --> 00:44:32,990
increase the number of other bits we

1139
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:34,609
find early

1140
00:44:32,990 --> 00:44:36,770
the better position we're going to be in

1141
00:44:34,609 --> 00:44:39,290
and the pen test as I mentioned is only

1142
00:44:36,770 --> 00:44:41,509
a point in time right so if we have a

1143
00:44:39,290 --> 00:44:44,779
pen test and they fix everything that's

1144
00:44:41,510 --> 00:44:46,310
cool but a year later they're gonna

1145
00:44:44,780 --> 00:44:48,349
introduce new probabilities unless they

1146
00:44:46,310 --> 00:44:51,589
have a way of I'm continually monitoring

1147
00:44:48,349 --> 00:44:55,250
for those new issues they can be in just

1148
00:44:51,589 --> 00:44:57,950
just a bad position so that's it either

1149
00:44:55,250 --> 00:45:08,510
not much time we got left 15 minutes

1150
00:44:57,950 --> 00:45:12,230
okay so arm chapters yeah yeah I want to

1151
00:45:08,510 --> 00:45:16,339
ask them any questions so could we still

1152
00:45:12,230 --> 00:45:29,570
up that time so smokey someone any

1153
00:45:16,339 --> 00:45:35,570
question yeah so it was that this one

1154
00:45:29,570 --> 00:45:37,400
yeah so that yes there is um there's a

1155
00:45:35,570 --> 00:45:44,390
really good one um I can't remember its

1156
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:45,800
name it's called okay so so that's like

1157
00:45:44,390 --> 00:45:47,060
systems like that there do exist and

1158
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:49,810
thirty pieces one I've used in the past

1159
00:45:47,060 --> 00:45:52,970
and I enjoyed it I thought it made sense

1160
00:45:49,810 --> 00:45:57,140
but basically yeah is it it allows you

1161
00:45:52,970 --> 00:45:59,509
to quite easily write tools that will

1162
00:45:57,140 --> 00:46:09,049
import into it and so everything is just

1163
00:45:59,510 --> 00:46:11,030
in one central place yeah I mean so

1164
00:46:09,050 --> 00:46:11,990
anyway that kind of make sense for the

1165
00:46:11,030 --> 00:46:13,190
company I don't think there's like one

1166
00:46:11,990 --> 00:46:14,598
answer it really depends on how the

1167
00:46:13,190 --> 00:46:17,270
organisation one so the question is

1168
00:46:14,599 --> 00:46:21,349
about how these these issues then get

1169
00:46:17,270 --> 00:46:22,849
fed into the dev team yeah it depends on

1170
00:46:21,349 --> 00:46:25,760
like if it is a large company is it a

1171
00:46:22,849 --> 00:46:27,320
small company is it you know a dev heavy

1172
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:30,380
or they're doing other stuff as well I

1173
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:32,359
wish there's no really one answer you

1174
00:46:30,380 --> 00:46:34,099
design some kind of policy that makes

1175
00:46:32,359 --> 00:46:36,170
sense for that team the hard part is

1176
00:46:34,099 --> 00:46:38,030
really to get the developers to be

1177
00:46:36,170 --> 00:46:40,040
involved with it

1178
00:46:38,030 --> 00:46:43,040
I've worked the places before where you

1179
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:44,779
know they brought us in to try to help

1180
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:45,720
invest security into what the developers

1181
00:46:44,780 --> 00:46:48,960
doing

1182
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:53,910
that is they want to but also they got

1183
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:55,950
stuff to do and any change is it's met

1184
00:46:53,910 --> 00:46:59,700
with resistance because they just know

1185
00:46:55,950 --> 00:47:04,649
it's going to take them time to to have

1186
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:07,319
to work efficiently so yeah well we did

1187
00:47:04,650 --> 00:47:11,880
use threat fix it was really more about

1188
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:13,500
like this is now the process that there

1189
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:16,380
will be three things and then they get

1190
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:19,440
exported zero zero and then it becomes

1191
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:22,800
part of their normal while handling

1192
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:26,250
process to one issue that one thing I

1193
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:28,760
see a lot is that the PDF goes over to

1194
00:47:26,250 --> 00:47:30,840
the client of the phone abilities and

1195
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:33,030
there's no one knows what to do with it

1196
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:35,160
if we can start to treat them as normal

1197
00:47:33,030 --> 00:47:37,920
bugs then they just get picked up and

1198
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:41,149
they get triaged and rated as they would

1199
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:43,170
with other other non-security but

1200
00:47:41,150 --> 00:47:45,390
nothing that that's really one of the

1201
00:47:43,170 --> 00:47:48,890
he's you know he everything gets fixed

1202
00:47:45,390 --> 00:47:48,890
as other bugs

1203
00:47:49,340 --> 00:47:52,449
[Music]

1204
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:10,520
yeah i think i think i am empathetic I

1205
00:48:07,380 --> 00:48:13,080
know because I've been there where I

1206
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:16,980
work so when I was doing my first

1207
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:18,299
internship I was doing development and I

1208
00:48:16,980 --> 00:48:20,490
said to my boss I have written this

1209
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:22,230
application like you asked me to but

1210
00:48:20,490 --> 00:48:23,310
it's not cross-site scripting in and

1211
00:48:22,230 --> 00:48:25,349
he's like it doesn't matter I'm like

1212
00:48:23,310 --> 00:48:27,180
what does another like Krypton is like

1213
00:48:25,349 --> 00:48:28,710
yeah but to use it you've got to be on

1214
00:48:27,180 --> 00:48:30,569
the secure network and there's there's

1215
00:48:28,710 --> 00:48:31,050
like five users anyway so I just don't

1216
00:48:30,570 --> 00:48:33,180
worry about it

1217
00:48:31,050 --> 00:48:36,119
like oh okay that makes sense I think

1218
00:48:33,180 --> 00:48:39,419
ever since then I realized that security

1219
00:48:36,119 --> 00:48:41,520
is not the most important thing you know

1220
00:48:39,420 --> 00:48:44,400
you need to understand the other factors

1221
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:47,099
there as well security is super

1222
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:49,650
important but if it's on an entire

1223
00:48:47,099 --> 00:48:52,140
network and evil to be trusted to get

1224
00:48:49,650 --> 00:48:53,220
there then yeah there's there's more

1225
00:48:52,140 --> 00:48:55,290
that there's other things you can do

1226
00:48:53,220 --> 00:48:57,649
rather than certeyn a hack some brochure

1227
00:48:55,290 --> 00:48:57,650
where website

1228
00:49:18,950 --> 00:49:23,460
okay so the question was the biggest

1229
00:49:21,390 --> 00:49:24,120
barrier to seeing the stuff imprinted in

1230
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:29,780
industry

1231
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:33,140
um I think InfoSec the way that we

1232
00:49:29,780 --> 00:49:36,450
positioned security we always say that

1233
00:49:33,140 --> 00:49:40,170
you know you've got to be super elite to

1234
00:49:36,450 --> 00:49:41,220
find security issues I think for the

1235
00:49:40,170 --> 00:49:42,870
work I've done in the past where I've

1236
00:49:41,220 --> 00:49:44,970
told people that that's not true has

1237
00:49:42,870 --> 00:49:46,470
been where I've seen the largest impact

1238
00:49:44,970 --> 00:49:48,080
where they can actually they have the

1239
00:49:46,470 --> 00:49:50,189
confidence to look for vulnerabilities

1240
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:52,470
our team after digging like indium

1241
00:49:50,190 --> 00:49:55,860
phosphate sometimes we can be very the

1242
00:49:52,470 --> 00:49:57,629
vehm in us and it should be more us all

1243
00:49:55,860 --> 00:50:00,450
right well over the end of the day if

1244
00:49:57,630 --> 00:50:02,940
I'm up hired by a company I'm I feel

1245
00:50:00,450 --> 00:50:05,160
like I'm there to help make that product

1246
00:50:02,940 --> 00:50:07,980
better I'm not there to tell them that

1247
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:10,440
they're wrong they've they can't code or

1248
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:12,000
that they suck is that I'm here to you

1249
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:14,160
know you guys do the Badminton really

1250
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:15,900
well and IT security really well so

1251
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:18,600
we're working together to make something

1252
00:50:15,900 --> 00:50:20,820
good and I think once you start having a

1253
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:25,319
more of like just an ass attitude to

1254
00:50:20,820 --> 00:50:29,010
things the knowledge starts did change

1255
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:31,250
so security InfoSec understands more how

1256
00:50:29,010 --> 00:51:03,480
developers work and the Vipers on

1257
00:50:31,250 --> 00:51:05,130
security so the question was about the

1258
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:06,570
layers of yeah I'm just wondering

1259
00:51:05,130 --> 00:51:09,290
whether or not you kind of map these

1260
00:51:06,570 --> 00:51:12,380
kind of layered security tests into the

1261
00:51:09,290 --> 00:51:16,479
profiles okay I'm so I don't really

1262
00:51:12,380 --> 00:51:20,239
um one thing I try to say is you know

1263
00:51:16,479 --> 00:51:22,038
understand who your but on sample your

1264
00:51:20,239 --> 00:51:23,660
threat is you probably don't want

1265
00:51:22,039 --> 00:51:26,239
application online does vulnerable to

1266
00:51:23,660 --> 00:51:27,529
script kiddies or you know anything if

1267
00:51:26,239 --> 00:51:29,599
you can find the front a bit about

1268
00:51:27,529 --> 00:51:30,109
running blog sweet other people can do

1269
00:51:29,599 --> 00:51:31,789
that too

1270
00:51:30,109 --> 00:51:33,170
and if that is what your threat is for

1271
00:51:31,789 --> 00:51:34,729
some organizations that's all they're

1272
00:51:33,170 --> 00:51:38,599
worried about you know it's maybe it's

1273
00:51:34,729 --> 00:51:41,538
like a 10 10 person organization where

1274
00:51:38,599 --> 00:51:43,430
they just that budget is tiny just make

1275
00:51:41,539 --> 00:51:46,999
sure that that's not gonna happen that's

1276
00:51:43,430 --> 00:51:48,379
not you fine have run pups we get on the

1277
00:51:46,999 --> 00:51:50,930
phones run a busy space and you're

1278
00:51:48,380 --> 00:51:52,670
probably fine if you are more worried

1279
00:51:50,930 --> 00:51:53,960
about that yeah I need to do more things

1280
00:51:52,670 --> 00:52:08,589
quick I've never really thought too much

1281
00:51:53,960 --> 00:52:56,299
about like yeah so might better have a

1282
00:52:08,589 --> 00:53:08,150
better you know the questions differs

1283
00:52:56,299 --> 00:53:10,819
from yeah so when you're working with

1284
00:53:08,150 --> 00:53:11,930
applications that yeah that you are

1285
00:53:10,819 --> 00:53:13,700
developing in cycles where you're moving

1286
00:53:11,930 --> 00:53:15,859
around lot really I think the only thing

1287
00:53:13,700 --> 00:53:17,419
you can do is to try and automate stuff

1288
00:53:15,859 --> 00:53:19,038
doing any kind of manual testing there

1289
00:53:17,420 --> 00:53:20,660
becomes really difficult like as I said

1290
00:53:19,039 --> 00:53:23,239
when I was brought in to do my new

1291
00:53:20,660 --> 00:53:24,739
testing a company that was costly

1292
00:53:23,239 --> 00:53:26,390
changing applications it was really

1293
00:53:24,739 --> 00:53:27,980
really hard so

1294
00:53:26,390 --> 00:53:30,109
said what they should have focused on is

1295
00:53:27,980 --> 00:53:33,049
having asked worked with the testers

1296
00:53:30,109 --> 00:53:34,759
that they already had that had the test

1297
00:53:33,049 --> 00:53:36,440
cases that and a way of testing

1298
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:37,970
applications we should be working with

1299
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:40,789
them to develop security test cases

1300
00:53:37,970 --> 00:53:44,419
instead of having us coming in to do pen

1301
00:53:40,789 --> 00:53:47,210
testing in it yes I think I think that's

1302
00:53:44,420 --> 00:53:50,180
probably the more sensible approach if

1303
00:53:47,210 --> 00:53:52,789
you have way of doing testing try and

1304
00:53:50,180 --> 00:53:57,308
add security into those Rob will happen

1305
00:53:52,789 --> 00:53:57,309
like a manual security test

1306
00:53:57,490 --> 00:54:29,299
yeah the questions yeah good question so

1307
00:54:25,099 --> 00:54:31,279
the question was about how clients react

1308
00:54:29,299 --> 00:54:34,640
to have a new way of doing security

1309
00:54:31,279 --> 00:54:36,859
stuff ah honestly that is one of the the

1310
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:38,299
harder things when we first ID'd with

1311
00:54:36,859 --> 00:54:39,710
Rochon we as I said we're not gonna

1312
00:54:38,299 --> 00:54:41,119
defend testing we're only gonna do this

1313
00:54:39,710 --> 00:54:43,849
kind of stuff

1314
00:54:41,119 --> 00:54:46,640
and I didn't last very long because I

1315
00:54:43,849 --> 00:54:48,799
love our I said oh we want a pen test

1316
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:51,950
fine we'll do it with the defenders um

1317
00:54:48,799 --> 00:54:54,500
so I think we keep more people to talk

1318
00:54:51,950 --> 00:54:56,990
about this and once it becomes easier to

1319
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:58,519
do it this way there's gonna be adopted

1320
00:54:56,990 --> 00:55:00,049
the companies I've worked with where

1321
00:54:58,519 --> 00:55:02,930
they have tried to do the stuff the

1322
00:55:00,049 --> 00:55:04,730
biggest problem was not getting the

1323
00:55:02,930 --> 00:55:07,519
technology as place it was just

1324
00:55:04,730 --> 00:55:09,410
getting the developers to work in that

1325
00:55:07,519 --> 00:55:11,180
way so that's why I needs to become from

1326
00:55:09,410 --> 00:55:12,140
this like really embed it it's a way

1327
00:55:11,180 --> 00:55:15,200
that they're doing so again with

1328
00:55:12,140 --> 00:55:15,828
training with using the tools of they're

1329
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:17,538
familiar with

1330
00:55:15,829 --> 00:55:19,400
I think what they don't want to do is

1331
00:55:17,539 --> 00:55:22,099
have like all these new tools they need

1332
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:24,140
to run if it's stuff that already using

1333
00:55:22,099 --> 00:55:27,170
Jenkins Jenkins already kicking off

1334
00:55:24,140 --> 00:55:28,879
scans and doing things then adding

1335
00:55:27,170 --> 00:55:30,440
another one not the screws down is not

1336
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:32,569
really a big deal saying here's like

1337
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:34,609
this other you know here's this other

1338
00:55:32,569 --> 00:55:36,558
tool you pull around the gates there

1339
00:55:34,609 --> 00:55:39,140
because some pens have tried to do GUI

1340
00:55:36,559 --> 00:55:39,770
to some pen test tool that best becomes

1341
00:55:39,140 --> 00:55:44,720
an issue

1342
00:55:39,770 --> 00:55:48,050
so yeah there is um companies are slowly

1343
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:49,549
moving for this idea but a lot of

1344
00:55:48,050 --> 00:55:51,410
companies it's ready lots of the smaller

1345
00:55:49,550 --> 00:55:54,230
companies they just they're told they

1346
00:55:51,410 --> 00:55:57,080
need a pen test because that customer is

1347
00:55:54,230 --> 00:55:59,060
asked for the pen test report and that's

1348
00:55:57,080 --> 00:56:00,950
their driver hand security and for those

1349
00:55:59,060 --> 00:56:03,500
described companies I think it's only

1350
00:56:00,950 --> 00:56:05,540
ever gonna be pen testing is the Cummins

1351
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:07,369
that really want to have a highly

1352
00:56:05,540 --> 00:56:11,210
secure applications that might look like

1353
00:56:07,369 --> 00:56:13,040
this so yeah good question honestly it's

1354
00:56:11,210 --> 00:56:17,930
like when we slide like no pen testing

1355
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:22,450
we're not gonna do it yeah yeah exactly

1356
00:56:17,930 --> 00:56:26,080
exactly what people to pay anything else

1357
00:56:22,450 --> 00:56:26,080
cool thank you very much guys
