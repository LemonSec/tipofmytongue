1
00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:07,490
cool so yeah hey bro

2
00:00:05,569 --> 00:00:09,500
there's no thanks all for coming along

3
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:12,290
so I'm gonna start this talk off was a

4
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:15,460
question and that's the question of what

5
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:20,299
does Minority Report black mirror and

6
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:21,560
1984 all have in common now there's not

7
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:24,230
the fact that they're all forms of media

8
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:25,579
you know books films TV shows nor is it

9
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:28,430
the fact that they're all about

10
00:00:25,579 --> 00:00:30,349
dystopian futures but instead it's the

11
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:33,530
fact that they all talk about predicting

12
00:00:30,349 --> 00:00:34,520
crime in one way or another whether

13
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:37,250
that's the precogs

14
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:40,700
in Minority Report Ricola in black

15
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:42,590
mirror or the fort police in 1984 each

16
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:44,540
of these forms of media look at how we

17
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:47,450
could predict crime but more

18
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:49,430
specifically the repercussions of doings

19
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:51,079
and that's all we could be talking about

20
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:52,910
today we're going to talk about how we

21
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:56,570
can use natural language processing to

22
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:58,160
predict crime so for those of you that

23
00:00:56,570 --> 00:01:00,470
know me well know I'm not a

24
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:02,480
mathematician and I'm also not a police

25
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:04,009
officer so why am I talking about

26
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,229
natural language processing which is

27
00:01:04,009 --> 00:01:08,510
quite mathy and predictive policing

28
00:01:06,229 --> 00:01:11,240
which hasn't they may suggest it's all

29
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:13,310
about the wall and crime well it comes

30
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:16,339
down to this quote the idea that

31
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:18,830
intrusion analysis security analysis

32
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:19,370
it's about far more than the tools we

33
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:21,979
use

34
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:23,299
it's about innovating and looking at new

35
00:01:21,979 --> 00:01:26,030
ways that we can protect ourselves

36
00:01:23,299 --> 00:01:30,440
against the tanks but also predict those

37
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:31,280
attacks in the first place so I'm

38
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:33,020
actually gonna be talking about today

39
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,880
well I want to break up into three main

40
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:37,369
areas I'll talk about what predictive

41
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:39,890
policing actually is I wanna talk about

42
00:01:37,369 --> 00:01:41,090
what natural language processing is the

43
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:43,549
finally I'll talk about how we can merge

44
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:45,650
these two ideas together how we can use

45
00:01:43,549 --> 00:01:49,610
natural language processing to predict

46
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:51,500
crime before I can know what my name is

47
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:53,060
James Stevenson and this time two years

48
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:54,799
ago now I was a student at the

49
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:57,049
University of South Wales studying

50
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:58,970
computer security before that I was an

51
00:01:57,049 --> 00:02:01,189
intern at a logic a cloud security

52
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:03,798
company and these days I'm a graduate in

53
00:02:01,189 --> 00:02:05,630
BT security Boston sadly writing

54
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:07,460
articles to InfoSec magazine and there

55
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:11,120
should be one on sentiment analysis and

56
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:13,310
the next hours but jumping straight into

57
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:15,439
it what is predictive policing

58
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:16,370
I keep talking about it but what

59
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:17,930
actually is it

60
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:20,599
because if we're going to use natural

61
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:22,340
language processing to predict crime and

62
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:25,459
kind of me to know what predictive

63
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:27,800
policing is and it comes down to two

64
00:02:25,459 --> 00:02:30,849
main areas location-based predictive

65
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:33,560
policing and individual based abilities

66
00:02:30,849 --> 00:02:35,209
so the name may suggest location-based

67
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:37,099
predictive policing there's all but

68
00:02:35,209 --> 00:02:39,920
looking at an area so I saying in this

69
00:02:37,099 --> 00:02:42,440
area in the future is a crime likely to

70
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:44,629
occur now this map is a great example of

71
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:46,129
location-based predictive policing it's

72
00:02:44,629 --> 00:02:48,079
a map of London or between a specific

73
00:02:46,129 --> 00:02:51,260
time period the darker the color the

74
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:52,819
more crime or we can use this for

75
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:55,370
predictive policing because we can say

76
00:02:52,819 --> 00:02:58,190
okay if a crime persecuted under these

77
00:02:55,370 --> 00:03:00,200
specific circumstances in the past the

78
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:04,099
new Chrome's likely to occur and these

79
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:05,929
same circumstances again so today we're

80
00:03:04,099 --> 00:03:08,569
gonna be focusing on individual based

81
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:10,160
predictive policing now individual based

82
00:03:08,569 --> 00:03:11,988
predictive policing is like a game of 20

83
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:13,849
questions we have different questions

84
00:03:11,989 --> 00:03:16,340
you go to different routes different

85
00:03:13,849 --> 00:03:18,018
avenues I'm left with the school and

86
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:21,980
that score is how likely a specific

87
00:03:18,019 --> 00:03:23,389
individual is to commit from and when it

88
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:24,920
comes to this type of predictive

89
00:03:23,389 --> 00:03:26,840
policing there's a whole range of

90
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:29,899
methodologies approaches and theories

91
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:30,950
that we can use to predict Khan and

92
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:33,650
we're going to focus on three of those

93
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:35,630
today the first figure we're going to

94
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:37,760
look at is called string theory now

95
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:40,940
string theory is the idea that society

96
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:43,269
puts pressure or individuals to achieve

97
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:46,220
specific goals like the American dream

98
00:03:43,269 --> 00:03:48,440
but when individuals lack the means to

99
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:50,930
achieve those goals they're more likely

100
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:53,269
to commit crimes so that I can achieve

101
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:55,280
them the next figure we're gonna look at

102
00:03:53,269 --> 00:03:57,290
is called social control theory the

103
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:59,359
social control theory is the idea that

104
00:03:57,290 --> 00:04:01,790
individuals who lack close relationships

105
00:03:59,359 --> 00:04:03,859
commitments values long rules are more

106
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:05,690
likely to commit crimes because they

107
00:04:03,859 --> 00:04:09,470
don't have those relationships or values

108
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:10,639
as an anchor in society then the final

109
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:13,099
theory will be look at today is called

110
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:15,260
social disorganization theory now social

111
00:04:13,099 --> 00:04:19,039
disorganization theory is the idea that

112
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:21,079
location is key if you live or work in

113
00:04:19,039 --> 00:04:22,700
an area known for a specific type of

114
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:25,280
crime this theory says that

115
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:29,300
intrinsically you're more likely to

116
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:30,020
connect crowd looking at what natural or

117
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,580
what predicted

118
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:33,469
policing is different types of

119
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:35,380
predictive policing and how we can use

120
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:37,340
predictive policing it's a pretty cool

121
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:38,870
but this talk is all about natural

122
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:40,969
language processor is all about how we

123
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:43,400
can use natural language processing to

124
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:44,930
do just that but to really understand

125
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:47,060
that three understand natural language

126
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:50,960
processing we need to understand

127
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:52,790
language what is language well for us as

128
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:55,669
human beings language comes down to

129
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:58,610
these three main areas speaking reading

130
00:04:55,670 --> 00:05:01,010
and writing things that we do every day

131
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:03,080
so because we do these things every day

132
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:07,159
most of us or some of us four people

133
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:12,109
answer this question Paris - France plus

134
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:15,380
England equals what now the answer is

135
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:18,680
London because Paris is to France as

136
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:20,659
London is to England so if we knew that

137
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:22,670
that was the answer why did we know for

138
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:24,050
those years well we knew that answer

139
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:25,730
because the experience this was had

140
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:28,100
because the knowledge in the context

141
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:30,680
that were built where we spoken to

142
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:33,860
people got on internet read books that's

143
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:35,570
all built our understanding so then the

144
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:37,580
question still stands through to give

145
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:39,159
that question to a machine would it be

146
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:41,630
able to answer the question

147
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:44,030
well it would if we gave it the right

148
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:46,670
context so this is the Wikipedia article

149
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:48,619
for London and if we fed this into our

150
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:50,960
natural language processing machine it

151
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:53,780
would learn from the surrounding context

152
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:55,340
Moodle in that London is a city it would

153
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:57,500
learn that London is in the United

154
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:59,479
Kingdom of which England is as well

155
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:02,960
again building that knowledge base and

156
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:04,610
building that context so that's how

157
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:07,700
natural language processing works

158
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:09,260
how does sentiment analysis work because

159
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:11,180
sentiment analysis is all about looking

160
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:12,590
at a specific bit of text and saying

161
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:16,700
what is the emotion what is the

162
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:19,250
sentiment behind that text so again as

163
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:21,830
human beings we have eight main pillars

164
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:24,200
to our emotions but the sentiment

165
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:27,740
analysis we only really care about -

166
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:30,020
that's positive and negative so how do

167
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:32,500
we translate these eight emotions down

168
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:34,669
to do and well when we're talking about

169
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:37,460
positive emotions we're really talking

170
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:39,080
about these ones with anger being the

171
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:40,520
red herring when when we're talking

172
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:43,990
about negative emotions

173
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:45,818
we're really talking these words

174
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:47,440
so if that's the emotions that we're

175
00:06:45,819 --> 00:06:49,479
talking about and refer to natural

176
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:51,969
language processing when it's too

177
00:06:49,479 --> 00:06:54,130
intimate analysis specifically how do we

178
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:56,139
actually get that sentiment from text

179
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:57,490
how do we ask our machine to look at a

180
00:06:56,139 --> 00:07:00,729
bit of text and say what is the

181
00:06:57,490 --> 00:07:03,190
sentiment behind it and well if the same

182
00:07:00,729 --> 00:07:05,169
as most machine learning approaches we

183
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:06,580
take a massive dataset now for this

184
00:07:05,169 --> 00:07:08,680
example it's going to be restaurant

185
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:11,169
reviews we think it have too many

186
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:13,780
entities to those reviews the actual

187
00:07:11,169 --> 00:07:15,758
review and the sentiment of that review

188
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:18,309
so for example I love my local pizza

189
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:21,039
restaurant has a positive sentiment

190
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:24,130
while this place is content health has a

191
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:26,650
negative sentiment we're then going to

192
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:28,630
break that dataset down to two we're

193
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:31,150
gonna have a training set and a testing

194
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:32,800
set when it comes to that training set

195
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:34,719
we're gonna ask our natural language

196
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:37,720
processing initiative to look at the key

197
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:40,389
words we say okay what keywords are more

198
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:42,280
problems with a positive sentence and

199
00:07:40,389 --> 00:07:45,280
what keywords are more problems with a

200
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:47,229
negative sentiment when we come to

201
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:50,169
testing were then going to say okay you

202
00:07:47,229 --> 00:07:52,479
tell me what the sentiment of these

203
00:07:50,169 --> 00:07:54,490
remaining entities it is and if that

204
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:57,729
matches the sentiment we already know

205
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:59,460
them to have great it doesn't then

206
00:07:57,729 --> 00:08:01,630
something's gone wrong

207
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:03,370
so that's how natural language

208
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:05,919
processing words that's how sentiment

209
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:07,419
analysis works what already exists or

210
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:10,330
some examples of natural language

211
00:08:07,419 --> 00:08:12,099
processing in the real world well this

212
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:14,229
is AWS comprehend more specifically

213
00:08:12,099 --> 00:08:15,759
comprehend Medical which is a delicious

214
00:08:14,229 --> 00:08:18,159
approach to natural language processing

215
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:21,610
when it comes to medicine and healthcare

216
00:08:18,159 --> 00:08:23,710
a doctor or healthcare professional will

217
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:25,960
type in a patient's information detailed

218
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:27,820
symptoms the natural language process

219
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:29,049
into it will do its thing and it will

220
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:30,520
come back with key bits of information

221
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:34,060
the things that that health care

222
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:36,279
professional the eastern it this example

223
00:08:34,059 --> 00:08:38,380
we have is tengo la notte toe AI is

224
00:08:36,279 --> 00:08:40,149
Microsoft's approach to natural language

225
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:42,820
processing when it came to a Twitter

226
00:08:40,149 --> 00:08:45,130
chat tell you would change its response

227
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:48,220
to people depending where people spoke

228
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:50,350
to it now lasted just under 24 hours it

229
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:54,250
was quite controversial but nonetheless

230
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:56,589
a great example then finally we have

231
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:57,960
predictive text or Evernote your own

232
00:08:56,589 --> 00:09:00,400
Android or an eye

233
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:00,940
whether your predictive taxes properly

234
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:04,930
works

235
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:06,190
uses natural language processing so

236
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:08,290
there we have three great examples of

237
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:11,140
natural language processing we have

238
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:13,420
healthcare communications and mobile

239
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:14,500
phones but none of those answered the

240
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:16,270
question that we had in the beginning

241
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:19,390
how we can use natural language

242
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:21,819
processing to predict quote and that's

243
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:24,610
what we're going to talk about next so

244
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:25,300
this this is Alice its Alice's job to do

245
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:28,540
just that

246
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:29,890
it's Alice's job to predict crime which

247
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:32,199
it currently does this is she

248
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:35,560
individually and manually profiles

249
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:37,420
websites chat forums social media

250
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:39,310
accounts and she profiles individuals

251
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:42,640
all these accounts on their likelihood

252
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:44,530
of clinic run but we can take this a

253
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:46,240
step further we can use the approaches

254
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:49,089
that were just mentioned to automate

255
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:51,040
this we can scrape those websites we can

256
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:53,650
use natural language processing on the

257
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:56,050
response we can then return to Alice of

258
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:59,319
risk a risk of each of these individuals

259
00:09:56,050 --> 00:10:01,359
to here or her organization and then of

260
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:03,340
course they can be actioned accordingly

261
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,620
and that's what we're gonna be talking

262
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:06,460
about for the rest of safe we're gonna

263
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:08,710
be talking about how we could build a

264
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:11,080
conceptual framework that allows us to

265
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:13,360
do justice that allows us to predict

266
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:17,080
crime using natural language processing

267
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:19,060
and the first part of this framework is

268
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:20,140
where Alice needs to sit down and she

269
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:22,599
needs to look at the individuals that

270
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:25,510
she's profiling and say okay what is the

271
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:27,070
impact of these individuals if they were

272
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:30,520
to commit the crime that were profiling

273
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:31,750
them for what would the impact be or if

274
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:33,760
we're looking at network infrastructure

275
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:37,000
what the impacts are these specific

276
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:38,890
malicious actors be an every comes down

277
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,780
to those three main areas lots of

278
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:42,360
confidentiality integrity and

279
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:44,800
availability

280
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:45,880
so that's part of that framework goes

281
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:49,060
back to those predictive policing

282
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:50,470
theories that we mentioned Billy Ron we

283
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:52,239
scrape these websites we look at the

284
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:54,930
text we use natural language processing

285
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:58,120
on the text we first of all we say okay

286
00:10:54,930 --> 00:11:01,900
does that text contain references to any

287
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:05,650
goals or aspirations if it does what is

288
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:08,020
the sentiment of that text next we take

289
00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:10,390
that same bit of text and say okay now

290
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:11,620
does that text contain reference to any

291
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:13,480
close relationships

292
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:16,900
teni commitments and individuals and

293
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:19,450
groups any organizations and if so what

294
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:22,449
is the sentiment and then finally you

295
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:26,050
say okay does that body of text contain

296
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:28,660
reference to the individuals location if

297
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:31,479
so is it a location known for that type

298
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:34,390
of crime and finally once again what is

299
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:37,240
the sentiment and then we go from each

300
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:39,970
of these trees aggregating a score as we

301
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:42,040
go and there's a score of the overall

302
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:45,820
likelihood for this individual on

303
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:47,890
committing Cod we then use that score to

304
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:49,930
account the risk and that's the risk of

305
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:54,069
that individual to the crime that Alice

306
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:56,020
is provoked and then pin ultimately as

307
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:58,029
part of this framework we just want to

308
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:59,500
aggregate as much information as we can

309
00:11:58,029 --> 00:12:02,140
and we can use natural language

310
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:04,300
processing to do this we can aggregate

311
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:07,210
information like common topics trends

312
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:10,449
age gender and race occupations salary

313
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:12,010
that finally any dates or times now the

314
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:12,940
reason why we haven't focused on this

315
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:14,260
information today

316
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:16,480
because this information has

317
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:18,790
significantly higher scope of the coming

318
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:22,630
bucks and that's really a talk for

319
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:23,949
another day so finally we're going to

320
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:25,420
talk about a naming convention with

321
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:26,740
these individuals as part of its

322
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:28,540
framework how can we name these

323
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:30,160
individuals without including any of

324
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:32,680
that information that has the potential

325
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:34,150
of becoming bias so here I've chosen a

326
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:37,959
naming convention it's broken down into

327
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:39,279
four main areas the source the time the

328
00:12:37,959 --> 00:12:41,140
reticle which is what we worked out

329
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:44,550
earlier on and the finally a pseudo

330
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:47,110
random words exhibit a bit of uniqueness

331
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:49,930
and then we have it so we've looked at

332
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:52,420
what predictive policing is looked at

333
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:53,349
what natural language processing is most

334
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:56,709
looked at how we can use natural

335
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:58,630
language processing to predict crime but

336
00:12:56,709 --> 00:13:00,550
again it comes back to the facts why are

337
00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:03,430
you talking about this in a computer

338
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:06,130
security problems and it comes back to

339
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:09,459
this quote the idea that intrusion

340
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:11,740
analysis security analysis it's about

341
00:13:09,459 --> 00:13:14,560
far more than the tools we use

342
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:16,600
it's about innovating but also thinking

343
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:18,430
outside the box and looking at new ways

344
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:20,680
that we can protect ourselves against

345
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:23,770
tenants but also predict those attacks

346
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:25,609
in the first place so I've got a few

347
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:27,560
minutes left so what I'm going to do

348
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:29,480
with some questions I've had in the past

349
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:32,810
I'll write book and then we can have any

350
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:34,459
questions anyone else says so for this

351
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:37,369
question we have is its predictive

352
00:13:34,459 --> 00:13:39,619
policing better than normal police and

353
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:41,870
the answer there is no right predictive

354
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:43,760
policing is a supplement it's a tool

355
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:45,380
it's something that should be used in

356
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:48,470
addition to normal

357
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:51,320
policing next we have is predictive

358
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:54,410
policing but the quick answer to that is

359
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:56,390
yes it is very bias the short answer or

360
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:59,300
long answer I should say is yes it's

361
00:13:56,390 --> 00:14:01,699
bias but it's just as bias as normal

362
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:03,769
human beings the problem you have were

363
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:06,800
predictive policing is it's garbage in

364
00:14:03,769 --> 00:14:08,959
garbage out so if you're dictor is bias

365
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:11,329
well framework is going to be bias as

366
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:14,119
well and the problem we have with crime

367
00:14:11,329 --> 00:14:16,910
deter is that the data is super bias

368
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:19,040
there's so many undocumented crimes like

369
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:21,319
assault that because of the way it's

370
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:24,010
documented or undocumented means that

371
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:26,930
our frameworks are intrinsically bias

372
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:28,519
and then finally or finally but it's

373
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:29,540
predictive policing used in the real

374
00:14:28,519 --> 00:14:31,490
world yes

375
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:33,319
so it's used across the UK but one of

376
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:35,690
the kind of highest media bits of

377
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:37,190
attention it's had is the LAPD in the

378
00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:39,860
States so they have a scheme called

379
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:42,110
laser the way that laser works is it's

380
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:44,600
for ex-offenders so ex-offenders get

381
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:46,699
given a score and that score defines how

382
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:49,910
likely that individual is to commit a

383
00:14:46,699 --> 00:14:52,310
crime next we have how good is natural

384
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:54,800
language processing picking up nuances

385
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:56,689
in text and there's a great example I

386
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:58,490
looked at from a video this woman talks

387
00:14:56,690 --> 00:14:59,720
about natural image processing and she

388
00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:01,880
talks about how there's this one example

389
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:03,860
that understands two languages sooner

390
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:05,810
teens and I think that's a great example

391
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:07,310
because it actually goes to show that in

392
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:09,260
some cases natural language processing

393
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:12,800
is better for understanding language

394
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:14,480
than us as human beings and finally

395
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,930
what's next while specifically for this

396
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,089
framework

397
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:19,130
currently I'm building on a tool that

398
00:15:17,089 --> 00:15:21,019
allows us to do justice it's way early

399
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:22,430
stages at the moment but it's more on a

400
00:15:21,019 --> 00:15:24,560
proof of concept to show that it's

401
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:27,589
possible rather than just if you're

402
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:29,810
right to go so once again thanks for

403
00:15:27,589 --> 00:15:31,370
coming along basically organizers for

404
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:33,380
having you today if you do have any

405
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:34,970
questions proof it ask me now come find

406
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:39,040
me afterwards I'm also on Twitter and

407
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:39,040
underscore entities Thanks

408
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:59,330
are there any questions early good I

409
00:15:47,360 --> 00:16:03,680
can't send you the penis do you think on

410
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:05,180
supported I think I said so it's

411
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,500
definitely a supplement chair right all

412
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:08,300
right so it's not there to replace a

413
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:10,430
police intuition and it's not there to

414
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:11,930
replace human interaction but it can

415
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:14,180
definitely be used as an additional

416
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:16,040
tools Sophie let you look at and go okay

417
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:57,890
well it thinks this I actually think

418
00:16:16,040 --> 00:17:04,460
this yes okay so it's the question how

419
00:16:57,890 --> 00:17:06,200
does sorry yeah so pretty times how you

420
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:08,569
do it so currently did so the question

421
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:10,310
is if you have kind of large amounts of

422
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:12,649
data or a botnet or anything on those

423
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:14,589
lines is that like a red herring is that

424
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:16,550
picked up using a framework like this

425
00:17:14,589 --> 00:17:18,169
and I think it really depends how you

426
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:19,010
implement it because you can add your

427
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:21,050
own rules you can add your own

428
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:22,760
signatures and every depends what you're

429
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:24,109
looking for so in the case of Alice

430
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:26,450
where we had Alice was specifically

431
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:28,040
looking for key individuals let's say

432
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:29,450
she typed in an individual's name and

433
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:32,570
that would be the individual she's

434
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:34,580
profile in cases where you're looking at

435
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:37,790
large amounts of data and you're looking

436
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:40,070
for all of this data who in that data is

437
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:42,290
a bad guy could be a bad guy I think

438
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:44,090
that's a very different scenario where

439
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:44,540
you're more looking for a needle in the

440
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:47,270
haystack

441
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:49,970
rather than looking for a specific

442
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:52,100
individual in that haystack there any

443
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:56,299
questions this

444
00:17:52,100 --> 00:18:04,850
years old I guess stories about where

445
00:17:56,299 --> 00:18:11,320
this stuff goes wrong was that tied up

446
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:11,320
daily so oh yes yes yes

447
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:16,940
so I've done that's the reason I like

448
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:19,429
bringing this up at the beginning

449
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:20,750
because the question is if all in all

450
00:18:19,429 --> 00:18:22,610
those forms of media that we have

451
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:26,090
predicted policing has gone terribly

452
00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:26,479
wrong and what is that to do with all

453
00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:28,070
this

454
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,480
and again I think that's why I like

455
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:31,070
bringing it up at the beginning because

456
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:33,590
it does go to show yeah this can go

457
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:35,780
horribly wrong but it's up to us as

458
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:36,379
people curating this so much the AI ugh

459
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:38,450
right

460
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:40,309
will say well what happens to AI but it

461
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:41,990
goes horribly wrong well it's up to ask

462
00:18:40,309 --> 00:18:43,280
to curate ads and to make sure it

463
00:18:41,990 --> 00:19:00,980
doesn't go horribly wrong

464
00:18:43,280 --> 00:19:02,418
okay how many cultures where those yeah

465
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:04,789
yes so this varies are primarily

466
00:19:02,419 --> 00:19:06,409
designed for Western cultures so the

467
00:19:04,789 --> 00:19:08,510
question was there's three Furies that

468
00:19:06,409 --> 00:19:10,159
we mentioned earlier on where do they

469
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:13,039
work do they work everywhere they're not

470
00:19:10,159 --> 00:19:15,020
and again so those few fries are a

471
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:17,570
Western based designed on Western

472
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:19,370
culture now again it reads minds of how

473
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:21,350
your profile if you are performing

474
00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:22,668
different culture then you're gonna be

475
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:24,408
using different theories you can be even

476
00:19:22,669 --> 00:19:26,150
different approaches different is all of

477
00:19:24,409 --> 00:19:28,610
that stuff and again it comes down to

478
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:30,710
the individual approach again this

479
00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:33,110
framework is completely conceptional it

480
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:34,970
doesn't really exist so you would have

481
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:38,000
to tailor depending on what you're doing

482
00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:41,120
again coming back to curating great in

483
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:43,570
your discussions yeah great thanks ever

484
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,570
again
