1
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:10,110
so this talk is about responsible

2
00:00:06,599 --> 00:00:12,600
disclosure and does it work no it

3
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:17,669
doesn't and there we go you know go home

4
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:19,289
and so Who am I i'm saskya plants I'm

5
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:21,539
one of the founders of digital

6
00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:24,839
interruption which is a security agency

7
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:28,169
that I run with Joe Harris and you might

8
00:00:24,839 --> 00:00:30,720
know me on twitter as mischeif I'm also

9
00:00:28,169 --> 00:00:35,309
one of the organizers and on the board

10
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:40,289
of buddies of the InfoSec coppers we

11
00:00:35,309 --> 00:00:42,510
just get this through the idea of the

12
00:00:40,289 --> 00:00:45,929
emphasized copies is that there's only

13
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:49,140
seven percent of women in InfoSec which

14
00:00:45,929 --> 00:00:52,890
is shockingly and we would like to

15
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:56,309
see the gender gap kind of reduced a bit

16
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:59,039
so we have a board of buddies and we

17
00:00:56,309 --> 00:01:00,899
started going to conferences on math so

18
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:02,699
that we can empower other women to go to

19
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:04,409
conferences as well by having someone

20
00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:06,390
that they can team up with so it doesn't

21
00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:09,420
feel so intimidating being the only girl

22
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:11,100
in a roomful of Matt I'm also one of

23
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:15,330
their founders and organizers for

24
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:17,580
Manchester gray hats which is basically

25
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:19,650
to support op and to teach people how to

26
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:21,480
do hacking and stuff we've got I think

27
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:24,090
four people now that we've moved over

28
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:26,430
into pentesting and by upscaling

29
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:29,190
and we have some of our awesome admins

30
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:30,810
here from grey house as well and and I'm

31
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:33,140
also on the board and one of the

32
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:36,210
organizers but it was Montessori shocker

33
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:43,140
and so yeah I do a fair amount in the

34
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:45,179
community Oh apparently we have stickers

35
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:47,220
for gray hats and uber so people want

36
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:51,030
stickers they can have stickers so come

37
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:53,789
come crab stickers and I also am one of

38
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:55,770
the organizers for texting City which is

39
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:57,900
a mental health initiative that we've

40
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:59,399
started putting forward in Manchester to

41
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:02,220
try and support people in the tech

42
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:02,760
industry and because we're all going

43
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:07,140
crazy

44
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:09,300
and so yeah more importantly the reason

45
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:12,480
that I'm qualified to be able to do this

46
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:14,520
talk is I am a standards writer I've

47
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:17,130
been writing standards for about 10

48
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:20,610
is in some countries I'm considered a

49
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:22,560
specialist expert which is hilarious but

50
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:25,290
I do know what I'm talking about when it

51
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:27,150
comes to standards and some of the stuff

52
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:29,010
that we do with digital interruption is

53
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:31,410
kind of cool and hacky you might have

54
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:35,280
seen some of J stuff on YouTube and

55
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:36,900
LinkedIn where we break into stuff so

56
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,700
today you're gonna see me do some really

57
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:44,090
cool stuff which is basically circle

58
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:47,280
things in red and say why it's wrong so

59
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:49,350
responsible disclosure what is it and

60
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,900
who does it apply to what does the law

61
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:56,359
say there are standards right

62
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:59,090
surely vendors one is to disclose balls

63
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:02,520
that's it in a nutshell

64
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:04,590
so what is it a new dessert apply tea so

65
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:06,570
it's a model or process in which a

66
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:08,790
vulnerability or issue is disclosed only

67
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:10,680
after a period of time that allows for a

68
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:13,739
firm ability or issue to be patched or

69
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:15,750
mended importantly what it's not is a

70
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:18,480
legally binding contract that will lead

71
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:20,510
to payment or a commitment to patch and

72
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:23,940
it won't protect you from prosecution

73
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:25,530
so it's bundled up a lot at the moment

74
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:27,209
particularly with things like bug

75
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:30,330
bounties and they really are very

76
00:03:27,209 --> 00:03:33,209
distinct things and but bounties are an

77
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:35,670
invitation to pen test something it's

78
00:03:33,209 --> 00:03:38,220
kind of a open scope pan test but

79
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:40,859
there is a scope in it if you go outside

80
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:42,780
of that scope you are going into a realm

81
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:44,220
where you are not protected which means

82
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:45,750
if you need to display something it

83
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:50,910
would be under responsible disclosure

84
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:54,120
rather than above bounty the standards

85
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:56,220
are say that a place to security

86
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:59,690
researchers security companies

87
00:03:56,220 --> 00:04:02,730
government coordinators and users

88
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:06,060
basically it's anyone anybody who finds

89
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:10,320
a vulnerability or issue so this is a

90
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:12,900
really ridiculous list it could be a QA

91
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:14,340
person it could be a software tester it

92
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:15,989
could be a hobbyist it could be

93
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:18,329
literally someone who is just using a

94
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:21,120
website and there was a vulnerability in

95
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:22,740
Domino's recently where and they

96
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,510
fertilized there was a bug where they

97
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:26,040
didn't charge for the number of toppings

98
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:27,110
that you had so people were literally

99
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,580
just putting all the

100
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:34,069
things on a pizza because they could

101
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:36,289
apparently it was disgusting that it was

102
00:04:34,069 --> 00:04:38,629
only because it was losing Domino's

103
00:04:36,289 --> 00:04:40,009
money eventually that they decided to do

104
00:04:38,629 --> 00:04:41,719
something about it never bother

105
00:04:40,009 --> 00:04:43,699
disclosing it they just had all these

106
00:04:41,719 --> 00:04:48,229
revolting pizzas I'm pretty sure Jay

107
00:04:43,699 --> 00:04:54,620
Harris that kept most without the meat

108
00:04:48,229 --> 00:04:56,479
obviously so the most important thing

109
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:59,330
when we're thinking about responsible

110
00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:01,960
disclosure is that you're not protected

111
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:07,508
by the law the computer misuse Act

112
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:10,159
actually means that it is illegal to

113
00:05:07,509 --> 00:05:12,139
access a computer in a way that is

114
00:05:10,159 --> 00:05:14,240
unauthorized so if you find a

115
00:05:12,139 --> 00:05:15,979
vulnerability and you're able to prove

116
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:20,300
that there is a vulnerability or issue

117
00:05:15,979 --> 00:05:24,529
you are immediately in breach of their

118
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:26,029
CMA so the law basically says that there

119
00:05:24,529 --> 00:05:28,939
must be a knowledge that there is an

120
00:05:26,029 --> 00:05:31,520
intended access that wasn't authorized

121
00:05:28,939 --> 00:05:33,400
or an intention to secure access to any

122
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:36,169
program or data help within a computer

123
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:38,659
what's great about the CMA was it was

124
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:40,729
written in 1990 which was a year before

125
00:05:38,659 --> 00:05:42,770
the world wide web or the Internet as we

126
00:05:40,729 --> 00:05:46,370
now know it came out so it's like really

127
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:48,620
super relevant and current it has no

128
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:50,300
definition of computer and the

129
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:52,490
justification for that is because

130
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:55,129
technology moves too quickly for there

131
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:57,860
to be a definition of computer so we

132
00:05:55,129 --> 00:06:00,919
have an act which is legally binding

133
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:02,900
that you could be prosecuted under that

134
00:06:00,919 --> 00:06:05,870
doesn't actually have a definition of

135
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:08,960
what it is so it's the something misuse

136
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:11,659
Act so that really needs to be revised

137
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:13,549
and the the core issue that we have with

138
00:06:11,659 --> 00:06:15,919
anything when we talk about responsible

139
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:17,360
disclosure is that is what you're

140
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:18,258
dealing with so you are completely

141
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,509
unprotected

142
00:06:18,259 --> 00:06:23,509
because the computer misuse Act will not

143
00:06:20,509 --> 00:06:26,000
consider your intention it will

144
00:06:23,509 --> 00:06:28,069
literally just consider what you do so

145
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,930
if your intention is to help you feel

146
00:06:28,069 --> 00:06:31,909
intention is to prevent if your

147
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:34,310
intention is to do something ethically

148
00:06:31,909 --> 00:06:39,740
the computer misuse Act doesn't give a

149
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:41,090
 but there are standards right so

150
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:43,480
we're fine because I

151
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:45,530
there's an ISO international standards

152
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:48,710
organization because that's gonna help

153
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:51,169
us except when you actually look at the

154
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:54,580
standards all it talks about is fender

155
00:06:51,169 --> 00:06:58,070
bender bender bender bender

156
00:06:54,580 --> 00:07:00,680
there's almost nothing about security

157
00:06:58,070 --> 00:07:03,139
researchers which is like massively

158
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:06,710
problematic so the international

159
00:07:03,139 --> 00:07:09,230
standards organization hardy-har and has

160
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:13,750
a more defined set of standards for

161
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:17,000
making tea than it does for variability

162
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:19,010
abilities and ethical disclosure so if

163
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,240
you if you look at the ISO 40 it will

164
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:21,919
tell you what temperature the water

165
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:25,400
should be and how long you should steep

166
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:30,340
the tea for and all of this Oh seriously

167
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:34,880
it literally does this and in 36 pages

168
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:39,469
there is one page on how you disclose a

169
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:42,979
vulnerability and even then it basically

170
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:44,510
says you kind of don't have to deal with

171
00:07:42,979 --> 00:07:47,900
it if you don't want to we kind of

172
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:52,310
suggest that you do stuff and this to me

173
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:55,219
is a huge huge issue recently the ISO

174
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:57,260
was released for free and as a result of

175
00:07:55,220 --> 00:08:00,680
liter security and the NCSC because

176
00:07:57,260 --> 00:08:02,479
those guys have got our backs and so

177
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:05,030
they released the standard for free

178
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:07,070
accept the standards from 2014 it's 5

179
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:09,320
years out of date and then they released

180
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:10,880
another standard in October so it's now

181
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:14,210
defunct so this literally has no

182
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:16,100
standing whatsoever and you have to pay

183
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:17,989
over a hundred pounds to get the new

184
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:19,850
standard that's been revised and it has

185
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:22,130
been revised quite significantly we

186
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:24,229
think but who knows but the bottom line

187
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:26,900
is it doesn't matter anyway because it's

188
00:08:24,229 --> 00:08:29,090
completely optional so a standard is

189
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:31,070
something that should be measured this

190
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:33,110
is not a standard this is

191
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:35,599
guidance at best and it's guidance that

192
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:37,640
you don't have to take I get passionate

193
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:40,370
about standards I literally write

194
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:43,039
standards this is not a standard so you

195
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:44,900
can see they have a map here for how you

196
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:46,279
should deal with disclosure and how you

197
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:48,730
should deal with the vulnerability

198
00:08:46,279 --> 00:08:51,990
handling process

199
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:54,639
nothing for reporters in this at all

200
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:58,360
there's also bits missing and you can

201
00:08:54,639 --> 00:09:01,630
see my notes I've annotated all 36 pages

202
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:04,630
I get more angry as I do I also can't

203
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:06,040
spell so if anyone gets like totally

204
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:10,529
hung up on my bad spelling I have

205
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:10,529
lollipops for you and you know you can

206
00:09:11,459 --> 00:09:19,709
there are some paupers in there my

207
00:09:14,139 --> 00:09:22,690
sister did a review and then gave up so

208
00:09:19,709 --> 00:09:26,170
this is the system that they suggest for

209
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:28,660
how you communicate there's a definition

210
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:30,519
of vendor within the standards but

211
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:32,199
they've added in other vendors with no

212
00:09:30,519 --> 00:09:34,959
definition I'm not sure what another

213
00:09:32,199 --> 00:09:36,729
vendor is there's too lots of

214
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:40,599
coordinators here which are apparently

215
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:43,000
incredibly important the finder or the

216
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:43,510
reporter there's no communication with

217
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,610
them

218
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:51,760
it's literally lucky reporter it's

219
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:54,279
pretty much a a really so in terms

220
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:55,899
of us as a community who are finding

221
00:09:54,279 --> 00:09:57,730
these vulnerabilities reporting and

222
00:09:55,899 --> 00:09:59,560
trying to patch stuff up we're really

223
00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:02,519
not being supported in terms of the I

224
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:06,339
say but it's okay cuz there's the NCSC

225
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:08,500
so they got our backs right they've got

226
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:11,410
a whole policy around practice birth

227
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:13,449
responsible disclosure accept a policy

228
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:16,689
is not a standard a policy can be

229
00:10:13,449 --> 00:10:19,560
changed to any point and within their

230
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:22,990
policy they make it really clear that

231
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:24,219
this is not applicable and waits protect

232
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:26,709
us from the law at all

233
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:29,139
it's a custom-tailored policy for

234
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:31,959
vendors again nothing about researchers

235
00:10:29,139 --> 00:10:33,670
they talk about as having safeguards but

236
00:10:31,959 --> 00:10:36,099
there are literally no safeguards that

237
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:39,069
they define within this policy so

238
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:42,240
instead of 36 pages for the ntsc we have

239
00:10:39,069 --> 00:10:45,160
six and we're still not covered in this

240
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:47,380
this top one as you can see in my rant

241
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:48,939
enos i literally write thunders and i

242
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:50,889
don't know what that means it makes no

243
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:52,300
sense whatsoever standards and supposed

244
00:10:50,889 --> 00:10:53,589
to be written in plain english they're

245
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:55,120
supposed to be accessible they're

246
00:10:53,589 --> 00:10:57,530
supposed to be easily understandable

247
00:10:55,120 --> 00:11:00,110
that doesn't make any sense

248
00:10:57,530 --> 00:11:01,850
they also talk about having the most

249
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:03,290
limited number of links in the chain

250
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:05,120
which suggests that you shouldn't have a

251
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:07,939
coordinator whilst they're saying that

252
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:09,080
they will be the coordinator at the

253
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:11,090
moment they're saying that there's a

254
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:12,590
bounty bounty program that they're

255
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:15,050
running but it's for government websites

256
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:16,760
only so any vendor websites are

257
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:19,339
off-limits for that so they're basically

258
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:21,500
suggesting that they're going to act in

259
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:29,540
a way that isn't universal so again not

260
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:32,990
standard literally they say it is so

261
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:35,599
clear why do we even have this and so

262
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:38,150
the organization here has a choice to be

263
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:41,450
able to adopt or pursue responsible

264
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:43,490
disclosure it can be done as followed

265
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:45,830
all of this is very very loose language

266
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:47,660
and no point I think saying that there's

267
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:49,490
a standard port in process for how we

268
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:51,620
deal with things and right at the bottom

269
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:54,320
they make it clear again that there is a

270
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:55,460
an opportunity to say what your policy

271
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:58,160
is about whether you're going to

272
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:59,480
prosecute people or not so regardless of

273
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,240
the fact that you might be acting

274
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:04,130
ethically and trying to help a vendor

275
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:05,930
organisation by telling them that the

276
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:15,500
software is vulnerable you could be

277
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:17,270
prosecuted that's the bit on us that's

278
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:21,610
literally all there is that's the

279
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:24,920
guidance there is no proper guidance and

280
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:27,140
apparently recipes to minimize any

281
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:29,360
hostile actors but there's no guidance

282
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:31,880
to tell us how far we can go to prove an

283
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:34,670
issue or a point and at any point that

284
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:36,140
we go to to the degree that we are

285
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:42,589
proving that there's an issue we're

286
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:44,930
immediately in breach of the law and the

287
00:12:42,589 --> 00:12:47,480
NCSC themselves say that they basically

288
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:50,120
are only there to promote responsible

289
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:51,050
disclosure so they're not enforcing it

290
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:54,080
this is that this is a

291
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:56,780
government-sponsored agency and all they

292
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:58,940
can do is promote and they will attempt

293
00:12:56,780 --> 00:13:01,550
to put you in touch with a vendor if you

294
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:03,080
find a vulnerability so that makes me

295
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:05,270
feel really confident that someone's

296
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:08,180
going to attempt so if anyone's seen the

297
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:10,430
tweet from oli lovely Olli from the NCSC

298
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:11,410
who's really super excited with his

299
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:12,670
tweets about how

300
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:14,589
we're gonna change everything with our

301
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:16,449
new disclosure process which is

302
00:13:14,589 --> 00:13:17,800
releasing some icing standards that are

303
00:13:16,449 --> 00:13:20,079
five years out-of-date and aren't

304
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:22,689
standards and won't protect you and are

305
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:27,339
only for government websites anyway and

306
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:31,949
in Finland at least view a t-shirt isn't

307
00:13:27,339 --> 00:13:31,949
that UK you just don't get prosecuted

308
00:13:35,759 --> 00:13:41,529
but surely vendors want is to disclose

309
00:13:38,199 --> 00:13:43,329
don't they like they want to have secure

310
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:45,850
software they want to have secure

311
00:13:43,329 --> 00:13:48,519
systems except they don't they don't

312
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:50,110
want to disclose they don't want to

313
00:13:48,519 --> 00:13:52,000
displace because that's reputation will

314
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:53,920
damage when we disclose they don't want

315
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,569
us to disclose because there's a risk to

316
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:57,279
functionality or their existing software

317
00:13:55,569 --> 00:14:00,099
because we know that when we actually

318
00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:06,100
think something we knock everything else

319
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:07,540
and that's expensive it's costly and a

320
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:10,779
lot of the time they don't know how to

321
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:13,480
fix it or they might not be able to fix

322
00:14:10,779 --> 00:14:14,560
it and that's where it's really

323
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:17,079
important because if you've got a

324
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:18,489
forever day instead of a zero day you

325
00:14:17,079 --> 00:14:19,979
really need to understand that because

326
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:22,449
you shouldn't be replicating that code

327
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:27,279
because that code is intrinsically

328
00:14:22,449 --> 00:14:29,529
vulnerable and they hate us and the

329
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:34,149
reason they hate us is because we do

330
00:14:29,529 --> 00:14:37,300
 like this there is no other

331
00:14:34,149 --> 00:14:39,430
industry on earth where people put death

332
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:43,209
threats out because somebody has over

333
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:47,709
mobility we are not making ourselves

334
00:14:43,209 --> 00:14:51,040
look good we're also not consistent we

335
00:14:47,709 --> 00:14:53,589
can't even agree between ourselves so

336
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:56,589
what we have at the moment is a system

337
00:14:53,589 --> 00:15:00,550
by which we're not protected we don't

338
00:14:56,589 --> 00:15:03,339
protect ourselves we don't agree we

339
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:05,229
bully and berate people but then we say

340
00:15:03,339 --> 00:15:06,610
that we want to be protected we want to

341
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:09,670
be protected by the law because we're

342
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:12,069
ethical but are we ethical are we even

343
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:14,139
really a community because the community

344
00:15:12,069 --> 00:15:16,389
is very fractioned at the moment

345
00:15:14,139 --> 00:15:19,589
everybody is fighting over something all

346
00:15:16,389 --> 00:15:22,149
the time we really have an opportunity

347
00:15:19,589 --> 00:15:23,440
because we are in our infancy we're only

348
00:15:22,149 --> 00:15:26,770
20 years in

349
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:30,850
terms of of being an industry in itself

350
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:34,270
and we are in charge of securing

351
00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:35,610
people's data and people's data is

352
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:38,890
important

353
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:41,020
people say well nobody died well yes

354
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:45,220
they did after Ashley Madison four

355
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:47,620
people died when people's data is going

356
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:49,390
rogue when there are breaches it means

357
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:52,150
that money is stolen it means that lives

358
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:54,250
are affected and here we are fighting

359
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:56,860
over whether someone can dresses pedo

360
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:57,910
bear at derbycon because apparently

361
00:15:56,860 --> 00:16:02,560
that's what's really important to our

362
00:15:57,910 --> 00:16:03,730
community if we can work together to

363
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,349
deal with the things that are really

364
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:11,770
important then we could make a

365
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:14,290
difference but how do we do this so the

366
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:17,110
GMC for example General Medical Council

367
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:18,880
who I have worked for because I work for

368
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:21,160
regulators because I write standards

369
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:23,080
have a system by which it doesn't matter

370
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:24,910
if you've done seven years of education

371
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:27,280
to become a doctor you have to register

372
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:29,829
with them you have to pass one basic

373
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:31,870
standard and your ethics are taken into

374
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:33,940
consideration and you have to be

375
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:35,950
licensed to practice in this country and

376
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:37,570
if you it up they will take you off

377
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:39,340
the register and you cannot practice as

378
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:42,430
a doctor it's the same for lawyers

379
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:45,550
taking the bar or being disbarred or not

380
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:47,469
being able to practice so I'm not saying

381
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:50,020
necessarily that we need to have some

382
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:52,150
kind of regulator that stands between us

383
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:54,520
and other people because I know that's

384
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:56,170
going to make me horribly unpopular but

385
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:57,760
my elevator pitch has gone down like a

386
00:16:56,170 --> 00:16:59,459
sack of already so what does it

387
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:01,900
matter

388
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:03,520
do we need that do we need to come

389
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:05,770
together as a community do we need to

390
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:08,319
stop talking around the question around

391
00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:12,550
the issue do we actually need to start

392
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:14,619
working together I think yes I think

393
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:18,209
there's like a level to it I wouldn't

394
00:17:14,619 --> 00:17:20,679
suggest that we necessarily have a GMC

395
00:17:18,209 --> 00:17:24,120
but I think a set of standards that we

396
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:28,270
sign up to that we actually work with

397
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:30,850
how many people are crest accredited you

398
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:32,410
spend what 5,000 pounds what's crest

399
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:36,669
accreditation is it a thousand pounds

400
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:38,930
five thousand five hundred pounds

401
00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:43,250
but for the company it's like five grand

402
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:45,050
isn't it like yearly updates so that you

403
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:46,730
can demonstrate that you can hack into

404
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:50,540
like software that's five years out of

405
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:52,700
date that you don't need anyway but will

406
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:55,190
sign up to that but we won't sign up to

407
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:58,460
a code of ethics it doesn't make sense

408
00:17:55,190 --> 00:18:01,010
to me it literally does not make sense

409
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:03,100
to me that will we'll have OS CP will

410
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:06,020
have cissp will have all of these

411
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:07,909
accreditations that mean nothing that

412
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:10,879
they're not a measure of our abilities

413
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:13,700
but we have no measure of our ethics are

414
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:15,860
we an ethical community or not because

415
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:18,710
you come really really quickly move away

416
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:20,810
from the L wills of this world by

417
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:23,480
literally saying sign up to ethics and

418
00:18:20,810 --> 00:18:26,030
and live by them we literally have

419
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:28,520
ethical hackers as our tagline for our

420
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:30,680
organization we live and die by our

421
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:32,450
ethics it is a hill we will die on the

422
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:34,160
stuff we do around mental health we

423
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:37,190
literally put our name out there but

424
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:38,630
people don't trust us possibly because

425
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:40,340
we did break into our own office and

426
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:41,060
possibly because they hit a little bit

427
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:46,820
of trouble for that

428
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:52,030
but ethics and it's not like we actually

429
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:56,389
get prosecuted with the CMA is it yeah

430
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:58,340
we are we do get prosecuted not only did

431
00:18:56,390 --> 00:19:00,110
we get prosecuted been under our own axe

432
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:04,429
but we get prosecuted under other

433
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:06,439
people's acts as well so Larry love the

434
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:08,330
guys from Lowell sack all of them have

435
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:10,130
been under extradition they've had to

436
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:11,929
fight extradition over to the states

437
00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:15,380
because there's some that they

438
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:17,560
pulled when they were 16 years old the

439
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:22,820
amount of damage that Lowry loved was

440
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:26,389
allegedly and did with the visit the FBI

441
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:29,149
website that he had to into NASA so he

442
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:31,790
took it down for I think a couple of

443
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:34,960
days it was 70,000 pounds that's the

444
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:38,750
amount of damage it was financially yep

445
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:41,600
realistically cybersecurity breaches

446
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:44,810
costs billions if not trillions of

447
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:46,550
pounds a year so there's all these

448
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:48,260
different factions that are talking at

449
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:50,428
the moment when it comes to responsible

450
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:52,980
disclosure is it real

451
00:19:50,429 --> 00:19:54,600
worth it why are we doing it why are we

452
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:56,039
putting ourselves out there there's a

453
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:58,168
school of thought that says that you

454
00:19:56,039 --> 00:20:01,009
shouldn't displays at all like

455
00:19:58,169 --> 00:20:04,169
non-disclosure is the best way forward

456
00:20:01,009 --> 00:20:07,679
we're working for free we're not thanked

457
00:20:04,169 --> 00:20:12,179
for it everyone hates us anyway but in

458
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:15,649
reality no one patches and the evidence

459
00:20:12,179 --> 00:20:18,450
of that is absolutely clear wanna cry

460
00:20:15,649 --> 00:20:21,809
the patches were there no one patched

461
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:24,600
one a cry came out they still didn't

462
00:20:21,809 --> 00:20:26,399
patch there was another attack two

463
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:28,740
months later and it took down a loader

464
00:20:26,399 --> 00:20:31,408
systems in Hungary because it still

465
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:34,860
wasn't patched people literally don't

466
00:20:31,409 --> 00:20:42,960
patch so again we're talking around the

467
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:46,769
subject security is broken unless we

468
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:49,740
start creating secure code working with

469
00:20:46,769 --> 00:20:54,299
vendors to create secure software from

470
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:56,610
the first point patching won't work we

471
00:20:54,299 --> 00:20:58,470
really need to stop pen testing we

472
00:20:56,610 --> 00:21:01,199
really need to stop coming in at the end

473
00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:03,629
and go in it's all just fire it

474
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:06,179
into the Sun because people have

475
00:21:03,629 --> 00:21:08,549
deadlines and they have figures that

476
00:21:06,179 --> 00:21:10,289
they have to make in terms of money so

477
00:21:08,549 --> 00:21:12,408
they're just gay all right then and then

478
00:21:10,289 --> 00:21:14,970
your your PDF report will get lost

479
00:21:12,409 --> 00:21:17,909
somewhere in the annals of somebody's

480
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:20,190
inbox what we need to be doing is

481
00:21:17,909 --> 00:21:23,129
working with vendors working with

482
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:24,840
organizations to be able to help them so

483
00:21:23,129 --> 00:21:26,850
that they build software that's secure

484
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:28,649
in the first instance and they don't

485
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:33,269
want to work with us because we're all

486
00:21:28,649 --> 00:21:35,729
twats so we have this opportunity now to

487
00:21:33,269 --> 00:21:39,240
change security because security is

488
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:40,710
broken and it's up to us to make the

489
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:44,369
decision about whether we want to do

490
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:47,909
that or not so I've gone through this

491
00:21:44,369 --> 00:21:49,918
talk really quickly but I've said

492
00:21:47,909 --> 00:21:51,749
basically what we have to say this is an

493
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:54,299
introduction this is a larger piece of

494
00:21:51,749 --> 00:21:56,340
work that cap J mark and I say large

495
00:21:54,299 --> 00:21:58,110
Cardinale have been working on for

496
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:59,820
awhile and we're going to continue to

497
00:21:58,110 --> 00:22:01,439
work on we have more stats and figures

498
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:02,580
but we don't feel it was appropriate at

499
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,850
this point because we're going to be

500
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:06,899
releasing a white paper

501
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:09,580
about it but if anyone has any questions

502
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:12,580
we kind of felt it would be interesting

503
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:13,990
to do this as more of a panel and learn

504
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:21,210
from the people in the room you have

505
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:21,210
thoughts and comments so at the end of

506
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:31,330
its life dedicated to the reasons why

507
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:35,110
the passwords are so good approaching it

508
00:22:31,330 --> 00:22:36,639
from a detective like they actually said

509
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:39,760
reaches cost so much money and they

510
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:42,010
didn't really like it material by most

511
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:43,990
people so we're holding them apart the

512
00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:46,360
holding companies created a secure

513
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:48,700
software accountable for not the same

514
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:51,760
why we call companies who build insecure

515
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:53,320
ages right I love that you're using a

516
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:55,270
bridge analogy I was literally talking

517
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:59,129
about that last night like you wouldn't

518
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:59,129
just give her the bridge but everyone

519
00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:10,690
say we should if I write this service

520
00:23:08,049 --> 00:23:13,360
and help the people who I said like that

521
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:22,120
keep scoring us hmm before holding a

522
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:23,439
kind of over so I absolutely agree with

523
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:26,709
what you're saying and what's quite

524
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:30,549
interesting is that the industries that

525
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:34,000
are regulated heavily tend to be better

526
00:23:30,549 --> 00:23:35,559
with security and the industries that

527
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,600
lose a ton of money because of

528
00:23:35,559 --> 00:23:42,340
breaches tend to be better with security

529
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:44,110
hence PCI DSS because when your credit

530
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:47,590
card is breached it's not your money

531
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:51,668
it's visas and they have to cover it and

532
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:53,230
they have a framework of 19 different

533
00:23:51,669 --> 00:23:56,710
frameworks are now under PCI DSS

534
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:58,750
depending on like the level of card data

535
00:23:56,710 --> 00:24:01,179
that you use because it's absolutely

536
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:04,929
whom their interest be units to breach

537
00:24:01,179 --> 00:24:09,370
this information and but then other

538
00:24:04,929 --> 00:24:11,950
people talk talk just throw information

539
00:24:09,370 --> 00:24:13,719
out the window like it's ticker tape so

540
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:16,540
yes I think accountability is really

541
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:17,460
important I think that personally I

542
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:19,799
think that they

543
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:22,230
computer misuse that shouldn't be about

544
00:24:19,799 --> 00:24:24,270
criminalizing people who have good

545
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:26,940
intent but I think you absolutely should

546
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:30,110
criminalize organizations that don't

547
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:32,520
take security seriously every year

548
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:34,049
something else gets linked into the

549
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:36,990
internet something else becomes

550
00:24:34,049 --> 00:24:40,350
intelligent something else becomes added

551
00:24:36,990 --> 00:24:42,630
into the IOT Amazon so helpfully now

552
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:44,580
have a microwave that you can say party

553
00:24:42,630 --> 00:24:46,110
to and it will bake your potato but you

554
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:48,000
have to physically go to the microwave

555
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:53,939
and put the potato in so why can't you

556
00:24:48,000 --> 00:25:04,640
just press the goddamn button called

557
00:24:53,940 --> 00:25:04,640
timer to be honest 10 minutes is fine

558
00:25:06,770 --> 00:25:11,279
there's another security company who I

559
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:13,320
went I won't say who they are but they

560
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:16,130
do like to paste pictures about how

561
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:18,840
successful they am I'm not salty at all

562
00:25:16,130 --> 00:25:22,049
and they can see they can see their

563
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:24,178
Tesla car from their fridge I haven't

564
00:25:22,049 --> 00:25:26,220
registered that with the with the ICO

565
00:25:24,179 --> 00:25:27,929
which you need to because effectively

566
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:31,620
it's a security camera not going to tell

567
00:25:27,929 --> 00:25:32,970
them and but we are getting to a point

568
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:35,459
where literally everything is going to

569
00:25:32,970 --> 00:25:36,659
be internet enabled so it's important

570
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:38,399
that we don't breach people's

571
00:25:36,659 --> 00:25:39,770
information is everywhere and when you

572
00:25:38,399 --> 00:25:41,850
have a name like mine

573
00:25:39,770 --> 00:25:43,740
saskia plants I'm literally the only

574
00:25:41,850 --> 00:25:45,120
person in the world with my name when

575
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:48,840
you have my middle names in cheers

576
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:50,549
parents Nora and mudita literally I am

577
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:52,199
the only person in the world with my

578
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:54,418
name which means that any information

579
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:58,289
about me is always going to be about me

580
00:25:54,419 --> 00:25:59,940
yeah I'm not Jim Taylor so it's

581
00:25:58,289 --> 00:26:02,549
important to me that my information is

582
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:04,470
kept secure because I'm at risk my

583
00:26:02,549 --> 00:26:06,029
identity is at risk more than other

584
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:08,399
people so I take this really really

585
00:26:06,029 --> 00:26:10,890
seriously and also a privacy privacy

586
00:26:08,399 --> 00:26:13,799
specialist and I orgone advise companies

587
00:26:10,890 --> 00:26:15,659
on how to hold data in a secure and

588
00:26:13,799 --> 00:26:17,039
private way so it is really really

589
00:26:15,659 --> 00:26:19,169
important to me that they are held

590
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:21,360
accountable and we're all talking about

591
00:26:19,169 --> 00:26:23,130
the gdpr is something that is like this

592
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:25,139
this sort of magic bullet that's going

593
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:27,590
to make everything right again and even

594
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:29,360
though Google has been fine 44 million

595
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:34,490
Facebook next

596
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:37,070
in reality it's very subjective the gdpr

597
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:39,620
in itself only talks about reasonable

598
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:43,040
measures again what's a reasonable

599
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:45,350
measure what's the standard standards

600
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:47,870
are important standards are what we base

601
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:51,669
things on and without them we're really

602
00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:51,669
just kind of fumbling around in the dark

603
00:26:54,250 --> 00:27:00,800
your opinion and do you think this

604
00:26:57,280 --> 00:27:02,750
laziness on behalf of like develop it's

605
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:05,180
easier to think it's like lack of

606
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:07,040
education I don't think it's laziness at

607
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:08,690
all developers are proud of that code

608
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:12,470
and they should be it's a difficult job

609
00:27:08,690 --> 00:27:14,960
I think there are a number of issues and

610
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:16,820
I think Jay might be able to back up

611
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:18,670
what I say afterwards I'll possibly say

612
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:20,450
I'm wrong because I'm not a developer

613
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:25,430
personally I think there were too many

614
00:27:20,450 --> 00:27:29,390
languages and I think that the standards

615
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:31,640
around education and training for

616
00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:34,790
developers literally cannot keep up with

617
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:36,470
how quickly we move I think they're not

618
00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:40,639
getting enough support in terms of

619
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:44,690
security and secure coding and they hate

620
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:47,360
us they literally they do and so dave

621
00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:51,770
has a great story about being on site

622
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:54,169
doing a code review so basically I was

623
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:59,240
on site doing a code review with a

624
00:27:54,170 --> 00:28:01,040
colleague and he he starts we were

625
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:04,970
looking at the code of new stuff to mock

626
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:07,430
the developer this developer saw little

627
00:28:04,970 --> 00:28:09,730
bility I hope could they not call it and

628
00:28:07,430 --> 00:28:12,200
the dent will see him right behind us so

629
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:13,790
but you know these got these companies

630
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:15,710
are paying to get really experienced pen

631
00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:17,810
testers I mean to help them with their

632
00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:20,000
security and instead a lot of us are

633
00:28:17,810 --> 00:28:22,760
they're just you know mocking the

634
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,230
developers trying to make us feel better

635
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:26,720
about what we're doing and make us feel

636
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:28,490
like they're more intelligent than the

637
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:30,020
developers when they write here is it's

638
00:28:28,490 --> 00:28:31,600
not about being more intelligent you

639
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:33,710
just have a different skill set

640
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:37,189
developers do what they do really well

641
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:39,500
and we do what we do realize more about

642
00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:42,179
trying to find ways that that can work

643
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:43,799
together yeah cuz I mean at the end

644
00:28:42,179 --> 00:28:45,419
that I heard her we're so much better

645
00:28:43,799 --> 00:28:47,850
than you but everything's easy when you

646
00:28:45,419 --> 00:28:49,230
know how and we are live when you focus

647
00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:50,998
on one small things

648
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:53,490
he's focus on security you need good at

649
00:28:50,999 --> 00:28:56,360
security are very few pendentives

650
00:28:53,490 --> 00:28:59,369
developers no yeah

651
00:28:56,360 --> 00:29:01,529
but then also within our own industry we

652
00:28:59,369 --> 00:29:03,330
we kind of accolade and hold people up

653
00:29:01,529 --> 00:29:05,070
for their technical ability when

654
00:29:03,330 --> 00:29:06,570
actually you know this is an industry

655
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:09,059
and an industry means that there's a

656
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:11,730
number of skill sets within it I'm not

657
00:29:09,059 --> 00:29:13,408
technical I talk like I'm technical

658
00:29:11,730 --> 00:29:16,679
because it makes clients think that I'm

659
00:29:13,409 --> 00:29:18,980
smart but I'm smart in different ways I

660
00:29:16,679 --> 00:29:22,110
can circle things and say they're wrong

661
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:24,779
but my skills are actually relevant to

662
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:27,360
our industry I don't have to be able to

663
00:29:24,779 --> 00:29:28,740
hack to be able to say they can be

664
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:31,229
better and we can do better

665
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:34,049
I can still lay down really really

666
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:37,139
coherent standards that we can we can

667
00:29:34,049 --> 00:29:39,690
work towards and and I think this is the

668
00:29:37,139 --> 00:29:42,539
thing in technology we're uploading the

669
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:44,490
wrong things and developers really are

670
00:29:42,539 --> 00:29:46,440
doing an amazing job the stuff that

671
00:29:44,490 --> 00:29:49,019
developers have actually produced is

672
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:51,720
amazing but we can help them instead of

673
00:29:49,019 --> 00:29:54,200
laugh at them we can help vendors be

674
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:56,669
better rather than tell them their

675
00:29:54,200 --> 00:30:11,759
or give them death threats because

676
00:29:56,669 --> 00:30:23,159
that's just awful I was saying that

677
00:30:11,759 --> 00:30:25,919
anything it's doing to talk no actual

678
00:30:23,159 --> 00:30:36,200
team leader is saying that how we like

679
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:36,200
equals people will be saying that

680
00:30:37,730 --> 00:30:45,149
actually freaky clown says something

681
00:30:42,899 --> 00:30:50,100
similar typically recently a local

682
00:30:45,149 --> 00:30:51,250
person who's in to it now yes to every

683
00:30:50,100 --> 00:32:04,530
cop all right

684
00:30:51,250 --> 00:32:04,530
I think I think there's several elements

685
00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:15,070
there one can hang

686
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:18,250
come join me people I felt like as the

687
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:25,330
most hated person in like the room as a

688
00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:28,150
journalist I think that why we started

689
00:32:25,330 --> 00:32:30,070
getting sort of together on this project

690
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:32,620
is because I think that the media does

691
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:34,389
really have a role in all this when it

692
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:37,030
comes to responsible disclosure which is

693
00:32:34,390 --> 00:32:38,620
some of the bits that along with mark

694
00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:41,440
large Cardinal we've been exploring

695
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:43,120
about how effective this is because you

696
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:44,860
can absolutely drop a zero-day on

697
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:46,300
Twitter and if it's something like you

698
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:49,060
know Microsoft they're usually gonna

699
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:51,310
patch it right away but you know if if

700
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:54,040
if otherwise you need that sort of

701
00:32:51,310 --> 00:32:56,350
pressure from from journalists to speak

702
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:58,270
to the vendors which which I've done in

703
00:32:56,350 --> 00:33:00,490
it and it works because like a lot of

704
00:32:58,270 --> 00:33:03,910
times you know journalists and reporters

705
00:33:00,490 --> 00:33:05,080
for the most part are used to having you

706
00:33:03,910 --> 00:33:08,080
know the door slammed in their

707
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:10,570
face and like I'm no problem like

708
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:12,730
getting on the phone and continuing to

709
00:33:10,570 --> 00:33:14,409
like this is why we took all functional

710
00:33:12,730 --> 00:33:17,740
damage isn't it so it's like when we get

711
00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:19,750
cat involved than their reputations on

712
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:21,430
the line and they're still very scared

713
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:24,250
of the media and why I think just from

714
00:33:21,430 --> 00:33:26,170
hearing Saskia's speak just just like

715
00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:28,330
five minutes ago I think it's also

716
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:31,450
really useful because journalism itself

717
00:33:28,330 --> 00:33:34,149
is also in like a bit of a crisis mode

718
00:33:31,450 --> 00:33:37,630
and like there are only sort of certain

719
00:33:34,150 --> 00:33:39,550
like reporters and journalists that you

720
00:33:37,630 --> 00:33:41,740
know have built trust with security

721
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:44,020
researchers and you know Jay when I

722
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:45,250
first gave my talk on this like he was

723
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:46,420
kind of like how do I talk to

724
00:33:45,250 --> 00:33:47,980
journalists I think there's a really

725
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:50,140
good heartburn yeah I think there's like

726
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:54,250
a really good opportunity to like kind

727
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:56,290
of sort of not to fix both industries in

728
00:33:54,250 --> 00:33:58,240
a way and when it comes to work together

729
00:33:56,290 --> 00:34:00,670
and when it comes to communicating like

730
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:02,700
these things I think that's where like

731
00:34:00,670 --> 00:34:04,900
journalists can come in and be like okay

732
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:06,970
we're really bad at the stuff that you

733
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:08,800
guys do but we will keep learning and

734
00:34:06,970 --> 00:34:10,480
reading everything until we get good and

735
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:13,630
be able to explain it in a way that

736
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:17,260
people understand and the thing the

737
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:18,880
thing I'd like to say then tomato is as

738
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:20,290
an industry at the moment we've worked

739
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:21,880
in that way right we find

740
00:34:20,290 --> 00:34:26,500
vulnerabilities and we try to report

741
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:27,700
them after the product is deployed maybe

742
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:30,580
we could do things in a different way

743
00:34:27,699 --> 00:34:32,109
and instead of doing about that where if

744
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:34,509
you we're working with developers

745
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:36,550
earlier so there's no reason why you

746
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:38,680
can't be interested in security and also

747
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:39,730
be a software developer and then you're

748
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:41,949
a software developer that understand

749
00:34:39,730 --> 00:34:44,370
security so those vulnerabilities and

750
00:34:41,949 --> 00:34:46,899
less likely to make it into production

751
00:34:44,370 --> 00:34:49,000
obviously that's not like the solution

752
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:51,310
to everything but there would be fewer

753
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:53,020
vulnerabilities if more of the security

754
00:34:51,310 --> 00:34:56,320
community thinks okay how can I actually

755
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:57,190
work with an organization organizations

756
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:59,470
need to change the way that they

757
00:34:57,190 --> 00:35:00,190
approach people as well so we know what

758
00:34:59,470 --> 00:35:01,240
they should be doing and this is

759
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:03,240
actually something that is always was

760
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:05,649
talking about earlier and at the keynote

761
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:08,470
when they're hiring hire people from

762
00:35:05,650 --> 00:35:10,090
different backgrounds I'm not talking

763
00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:12,129
about like agenda and things like that

764
00:35:10,090 --> 00:35:14,230
but you know highest security people

765
00:35:12,130 --> 00:35:16,030
hire developers hire infrastructure

766
00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:17,710
people and when you have to ask them a

767
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:18,490
question you're gonna get different

768
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:19,780
salut

769
00:35:18,490 --> 00:35:21,310
different answers and then you're gonna

770
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:23,170
make a better product I think also we

771
00:35:21,310 --> 00:35:25,360
need to take into consideration that

772
00:35:23,170 --> 00:35:27,760
again I've said that we're in our

773
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:31,030
infancy is an industry but we are in our

774
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:33,390
infancy is an industry but also what

775
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:37,360
we're selling is protection against us

776
00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:39,310
and when we set up digital interruption

777
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:40,660
it's a very bad model of refusing to do

778
00:35:39,310 --> 00:35:42,970
pen tests and then have to start doing

779
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:46,290
fantastic as we run out of money and we

780
00:35:42,970 --> 00:35:49,180
had we had some copywriters come in and

781
00:35:46,290 --> 00:35:51,130
to help us with how we were going to

782
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:54,100
present ourselves on the website and

783
00:35:51,130 --> 00:35:56,860
everything was fear-mongering everything

784
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:59,710
was scare tactics everything was big red

785
00:35:56,860 --> 00:36:02,170
crosses and padlocks keep the bodies at

786
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:08,560
bay save yourselves from us I have that

787
00:36:02,170 --> 00:36:11,260
Cadiz on and we refuse to do that

788
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:13,720
digital interruption absolutely refuse

789
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:16,330
to frighten people into taking our

790
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:19,480
services yeah we literally do take

791
00:36:16,330 --> 00:36:21,490
ethical hacking as being ethical and we

792
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:26,320
make our business because of it now

793
00:36:21,490 --> 00:36:29,560
we're doping and but but in reality if

794
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:32,140
anyone wants to hire us we are okay but

795
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:34,359
that is the reality of course people are

796
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:37,180
scared averse they're scared of us

797
00:36:34,359 --> 00:36:39,279
because we scare them if we can actually

798
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:42,250
position ourselves as an industry which

799
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:45,190
is about helping people helping them be

800
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:47,640
secure making things better as opposed

801
00:36:45,190 --> 00:36:50,590
to every single time there's a breach

802
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:52,868
laughing at them making fun of them

803
00:36:50,590 --> 00:36:57,190
saying that the whole world is gonna

804
00:36:52,869 --> 00:36:59,050
crash into the Sun you know we can we

805
00:36:57,190 --> 00:37:02,200
can change the narrative if we want to

806
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:04,660
it's not in our interest because at the

807
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:07,660
moment fair is selling but what it's not

808
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:09,250
doing is securing and also it goes back

809
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:11,500
to what you're saying about the computer

810
00:37:09,250 --> 00:37:14,050
misuse Act over ahead and I don't know

811
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:17,619
how that goes into like you know a

812
00:37:14,050 --> 00:37:21,369
vendors perception of what you guys do

813
00:37:17,619 --> 00:37:23,109
and or you know and I think that this is

814
00:37:21,369 --> 00:37:24,920
also as we're talking for a

815
00:37:23,109 --> 00:37:26,540
multi-stakeholder thing where

816
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:28,400
there's so many people who don't like

817
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:30,259
this bill but when that's hanging over

818
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:32,360
you it becomes kind of impossible and

819
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:35,000
also has implications on on journalism

820
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:37,700
as well and like various facets of

821
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:40,760
society that just needs to be completely

822
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:42,950
ripped apart in order to like create a

823
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:46,430
more positive environment to work in

824
00:37:42,950 --> 00:37:49,069
I was thinking about when you start in

825
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:50,839
the industry just felt into it the front

826
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:53,620
of it was a narrative about security

827
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:57,110
about hackers about back bad things and

828
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:59,600
Bandos but you just have to pick a side

829
00:37:57,110 --> 00:38:03,860
if you want to stay and do good

830
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:05,779
popularity artwork come on to good

831
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:07,640
inside and good collegues that you have

832
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:10,700
to pick a side if young you come just

833
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:14,660
stay outside of it try to understand and

834
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:17,960
that's if I can suggest for the seniors

835
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:20,180
and people there from more times and you

836
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:25,550
is just can you explain me what's

837
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:28,730
happening try to stop making circulating

838
00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:30,410
all the story originality and this is

839
00:38:28,730 --> 00:38:31,880
very important because if you'll get

840
00:38:30,410 --> 00:38:34,399
your own point of view you can choose

841
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:37,040
and if you understand that okay many

842
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:39,080
things around me or not depending on me

843
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:41,870
and I can just relax and do my job and

844
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:44,000
help the others then you change the

845
00:38:41,870 --> 00:38:46,670
parity and when you go back to school

846
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:48,890
it's a difficult type about my school I

847
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:52,270
go back say Oliver is this company or

848
00:38:48,890 --> 00:38:55,310
see it's like it's it's dangerous it's a

849
00:38:52,270 --> 00:39:00,110
you do you talk to the others it's also

850
00:38:55,310 --> 00:39:03,380
us around it's very toxic and we have to

851
00:39:00,110 --> 00:39:06,440
break this in poor people getting into

852
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:09,230
cause a young industry and also for the

853
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:11,480
seniors to renew it to discos yeah and I

854
00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:12,650
think the same is like and I keep

855
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:14,210
drawing parallels but I think it's

856
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:16,340
important in order to create a narrative

857
00:39:14,210 --> 00:39:18,470
that we can actually like you know make

858
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:20,660
something happen but like in sort of

859
00:39:18,470 --> 00:39:22,850
knowing what you guys are doing from

860
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:25,129
from a user base like the media's very

861
00:39:22,850 --> 00:39:27,440
split on like who covers these who

862
00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:28,970
covers these issues basically or like

863
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:30,920
does responsible disclosure of

864
00:39:28,970 --> 00:39:33,140
vulnerabilities all this stuff and the

865
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:35,210
audiences are so divided that really

866
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:38,808
there's only the small section

867
00:39:35,210 --> 00:39:42,290
of like the entire world's population

868
00:39:38,809 --> 00:39:44,960
that knows like what like real hackers

869
00:39:42,290 --> 00:39:48,109
pen testers you know developers are

870
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:51,859
doing in the rest it's just like black

871
00:39:48,109 --> 00:39:53,720
mirror like in all those almost and

872
00:39:51,859 --> 00:39:56,660
again it's images I'm hungry I mean when

873
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:58,490
we did the symbiote hack um and that was

874
00:39:56,660 --> 00:40:00,410
fun trying to get them to place that

875
00:39:58,490 --> 00:40:02,990
vulnerability Paul Jay was banging his

876
00:40:00,410 --> 00:40:05,210
head against a wall but it kind of got

877
00:40:02,990 --> 00:40:07,430
out in the media and we were on the

878
00:40:05,210 --> 00:40:09,109
front page of BBC technology which was

879
00:40:07,430 --> 00:40:11,480
really awesome and we felt super famous

880
00:40:09,109 --> 00:40:14,960
for a day but by the time it got to the

881
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:18,349
Daily Mail and lad Bible yay

882
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:34,400
quality quality journalism I work at the

883
00:40:18,349 --> 00:40:36,230
Daily Mail again and you wanna read the

884
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:37,910
Daily Mail if you want to know how they

885
00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:39,589
like selling narrative like you need to

886
00:40:37,910 --> 00:40:41,240
study the Daily Mail it's like the first

887
00:40:39,589 --> 00:40:43,220
thing everyone has to go home and do

888
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:47,270
right now is just look for propaganda

889
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:49,609
it's like a perfect wine was perverted

890
00:40:47,270 --> 00:40:53,540
secrets of twenty thousand users

891
00:40:49,609 --> 00:40:55,700
released by hackers we literally had a

892
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:58,640
few email addresses you know they were

893
00:40:55,700 --> 00:41:00,529
new perverted secrets in spite of same

894
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:03,618
thing I was terrifying and there was the

895
00:41:00,530 --> 00:41:05,960
thing with the poeple that's mobile and

896
00:41:03,619 --> 00:41:08,089
this editor no I literally have it

897
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:14,750
screenshot it I'm so proud of it it's

898
00:41:08,089 --> 00:41:17,500
like my proudest moment that we really

899
00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:20,089
matter I think there's another question

900
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:23,359
we had I feel there's a question posed

901
00:41:20,089 --> 00:41:25,640
to her with regards to interaction with

902
00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:27,400
executives it almost sounds like the

903
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:30,920
same issue of

904
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:33,020
to me needs houston parents learn as

905
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:36,710
their responsibilities or speak in a way

906
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:39,200
that is as easy to understand for normal

907
00:41:36,710 --> 00:41:41,420
airport elvers without a development

908
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:45,149
community as well as journalists or is

909
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:47,040
it working for them so rhinos garlic

910
00:41:45,150 --> 00:41:49,470
[Music]

911
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:52,710
I think from and I'm sorry to jump in

912
00:41:49,470 --> 00:41:56,399
again but as a journalist in terms of

913
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:58,530
like speaking to vendors like just say

914
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:59,940
there was a vulnerability and Saskia

915
00:41:58,530 --> 00:42:02,640
told me and she's like you know I've

916
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:05,070
been trying to like contact them it

917
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:10,200
doesn't help I think that like whatever

918
00:42:05,070 --> 00:42:13,890
sort of methods that I use to have that

919
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:18,390
conversation might be more effective

920
00:42:13,890 --> 00:42:20,490
than maybe what like your community

921
00:42:18,390 --> 00:42:22,500
would be used to does that I mean but

922
00:42:20,490 --> 00:42:24,149
then from from my end when the when the

923
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:27,180
vet when the vendors like so what's

924
00:42:24,150 --> 00:42:29,070
wrong with it I'm like uh I don't know

925
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:31,740
how to fix it you know so then there has

926
00:42:29,070 --> 00:42:34,170
to be very communication where we need

927
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:37,740
standards because in reality we speak in

928
00:42:34,170 --> 00:42:39,480
riddles as security people we speak in

929
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:41,009
riddles so when we start talking about

930
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:43,470
all the technical stuff it gets

931
00:42:41,010 --> 00:42:45,119
incredibly confusing and then you got

932
00:42:43,470 --> 00:42:46,709
somebody like me who stands in the

933
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:50,130
middle who can speak nor me

934
00:42:46,710 --> 00:42:53,369
and even if it's as simple as saying

935
00:42:50,130 --> 00:42:54,660
it's all and you need to speak in

936
00:42:53,369 --> 00:42:56,970
a way that people can understand not

937
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:59,220
everybody is technical and and vendors

938
00:42:56,970 --> 00:43:01,319
don't think in terms of technical they

939
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:02,879
think in terms of money like they are

940
00:43:01,319 --> 00:43:05,130
literally there to make money that

941
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:07,859
that's they made us operandi do you

942
00:43:05,130 --> 00:43:09,270
think that vendors the question - I

943
00:43:07,859 --> 00:43:11,009
guess both of you do think that they've

944
00:43:09,270 --> 00:43:13,259
gotten better with like the

945
00:43:11,010 --> 00:43:15,089
implementation of GDP are like do you

946
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:17,490
think okay so there's no improvement

947
00:43:15,089 --> 00:43:20,160
whatsoever in terms of understanding

948
00:43:17,490 --> 00:43:22,950
what because I completely misunderstand

949
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:25,020
what the regulation is about really

950
00:43:22,950 --> 00:43:27,359
there's somebody who advises

951
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:29,880
organizations on GDP are some if the

952
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:33,930
vendors are doing a great job and macey

953
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:35,790
the ones I hire me and that's been with

954
00:43:33,930 --> 00:43:38,310
us because they're dealing with really

955
00:43:35,790 --> 00:43:40,230
really sensitive data sets and I

956
00:43:38,310 --> 00:43:41,790
specialize in very very sensitive data

957
00:43:40,230 --> 00:43:44,130
sacks I've done a lot of work with the

958
00:43:41,790 --> 00:43:48,150
NHS medical records all of this kind of

959
00:43:44,130 --> 00:43:51,060
stuff generally no it's a must I think

960
00:43:48,150 --> 00:43:56,069
it does give some companies a an excuse

961
00:43:51,060 --> 00:43:57,540
to think about security which it camp

962
00:43:56,069 --> 00:43:58,859
can be helpful you know sometimes that

963
00:43:57,540 --> 00:44:02,099
they want to have the converse

964
00:43:58,859 --> 00:44:03,960
but they they they struggle to have that

965
00:44:02,099 --> 00:44:06,000
conversation when they start on my GDP

966
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:07,680
are they gives them something to to at

967
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,760
least run with initially but it's a

968
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:10,560
regulation that doesn't make sense

969
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:11,970
what's a reasonable manager you must

970
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:13,470
take reasonable measures to secure

971
00:44:11,970 --> 00:44:15,450
information you must take reasonable

972
00:44:13,470 --> 00:44:17,069
measures to secure data you must take a

973
00:44:15,450 --> 00:44:20,098
risk-based approach but sophisticates

974
00:44:17,069 --> 00:44:22,800
the breach as long as you've record it

975
00:44:20,099 --> 00:44:25,079
you're fine well no you they big

976
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:28,800
literally mention encryption once in the

977
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:31,589
whole regulation there are 99 articles

978
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:33,960
in the GDP are and they mention in

979
00:44:31,589 --> 00:44:35,099
correction once and they suggest that it

980
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:39,359
might be something that you might like

981
00:44:35,099 --> 00:44:41,369
to do possibly so it's not standard it

982
00:44:39,359 --> 00:44:42,869
just doesn't mean anything the DDP are

983
00:44:41,369 --> 00:44:44,880
literally just means that you can be

984
00:44:42,869 --> 00:45:27,569
fined because somebody arbitrarily has

985
00:44:44,880 --> 00:45:29,010
decided that you've breached but for

986
00:45:27,569 --> 00:45:30,779
some organizations I would say that is a

987
00:45:29,010 --> 00:45:32,990
really good start because there's at

988
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:35,400
least get them thinking about security

989
00:45:32,990 --> 00:45:36,660
because that that's their okay to does

990
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:39,089
what those requirement for cyber

991
00:45:36,660 --> 00:45:41,250
essentials so I guess I'm thinking about

992
00:45:39,089 --> 00:45:43,560
it but again you know you're talking

993
00:45:41,250 --> 00:45:46,079
about responsible disclosure and things

994
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:48,599
like that I think that the focus should

995
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:50,880
be on trying to fix fix things early as

996
00:45:48,599 --> 00:45:52,890
as an industry rather than just telling

997
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:55,200
people they're wrong that's gonna help

998
00:45:52,890 --> 00:45:56,970
companies want to engage with security

999
00:45:55,200 --> 00:46:00,299
you know things like cyber centers I

1000
00:45:56,970 --> 00:46:01,828
don't think really is again it's kind of

1001
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:03,750
like the wrong approach is it's okay

1002
00:46:01,829 --> 00:46:05,280
let's just get this stamp book cause a

1003
00:46:03,750 --> 00:46:06,540
lock on these definitely do use it like

1004
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:08,910
that you know even though I think that

1005
00:46:06,540 --> 00:46:10,200
it can get comped I decide you know a

1006
00:46:08,910 --> 00:46:12,279
lot of companies they just see as the

1007
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:14,649
stamp and security is still

1008
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:17,230
a separate thing you know and anyone

1009
00:46:14,650 --> 00:46:18,820
raising an issue they actually they

1010
00:46:17,230 --> 00:46:20,680
don't want to hear about it because it's

1011
00:46:18,820 --> 00:46:24,150
expensive method them deal with it

1012
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:25,960
and unfortunately the CMAs is is

1013
00:46:24,150 --> 00:46:28,270
protecting vendors more than is

1014
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:30,400
protecting the security researchers but

1015
00:46:28,270 --> 00:46:31,990
also our motivations aren't always pure

1016
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:34,360
are they I mean when we go through

1017
00:46:31,990 --> 00:46:36,009
responsible disclosure is it because we

1018
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:38,320
want things to be safe or do we want the

1019
00:46:36,010 --> 00:46:40,840
media attention do we want to look like

1020
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:43,090
we're awesome leet hackers oh look at us

1021
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:45,960
we found this yay where's ooh clever I

1022
00:46:43,090 --> 00:46:48,400
mean barely because in reality

1023
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:51,000
responsible disclosure does very very

1024
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:55,000
little to actually securing things and

1025
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:57,460
insignia or in Xenia taking over twitter

1026
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:59,110
is a really good example so they reckon

1027
00:46:57,460 --> 00:47:00,960
they're all leet in everything but we've

1028
00:46:59,110 --> 00:47:03,040
known about that for what three years

1029
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:04,540
Twitter just didn't seem to think that

1030
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:06,910
it was a particularly big issue that

1031
00:47:04,540 --> 00:47:09,040
somebody could tweet on other people's

1032
00:47:06,910 --> 00:47:10,569
timelines until someone does it to

1033
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:15,580
Donald Trump and now we're at war with

1034
00:47:10,570 --> 00:47:23,040
Korea I think they're like in bed with

1035
00:47:15,580 --> 00:47:23,040
each other though we have we have a

1038
00:48:06,990 --> 00:48:10,870
there are so many challenges to solve

1039
00:48:09,460 --> 00:48:13,480
and I think all of us like the salt

1040
00:48:10,870 --> 00:48:15,100
challenges finding cross-site scripting

1041
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:16,630
to me is more impressive I'm never going

1042
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:20,140
to read a blog post about Isis ass but

1043
00:48:16,630 --> 00:48:21,730
yeah that was super cool but I will find

1044
00:48:20,140 --> 00:48:24,520
suitable is someone that - to go as an

1045
00:48:21,730 --> 00:48:25,349
organization and change how their

1046
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:26,940
developers

1047
00:48:25,349 --> 00:48:29,910
security like that would be a really

1048
00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:31,349
interesting thing to do I think we also

1049
00:48:29,910 --> 00:48:33,839
need to be quite careful when we're

1050
00:48:31,349 --> 00:48:36,809
looking at organizations that are

1051
00:48:33,839 --> 00:48:39,808
basically bounty hunters or coordinators

1052
00:48:36,809 --> 00:48:42,269
for bounty hunters as a method for

1053
00:48:39,809 --> 00:48:44,519
responsible disclosure because the

1054
00:48:42,269 --> 00:48:46,529
reality is they are not going to protect

1055
00:48:44,519 --> 00:48:49,828
you from the CMA they're not going to

1056
00:48:46,529 --> 00:48:52,259
protect you from the CFAA either it's

1057
00:48:49,829 --> 00:48:53,759
not tested yet but I reckon the minute

1058
00:48:52,259 --> 00:48:55,650
that there's legal action they will roll

1059
00:48:53,759 --> 00:48:57,599
over and throw you under the bus because

1060
00:48:55,650 --> 00:48:59,130
there is absolutely no motivation for

1061
00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:01,859
them other than money because they are

1062
00:48:59,130 --> 00:49:03,119
vendors as well so although it's cool to

1063
00:49:01,859 --> 00:49:05,430
walk around in your hacker one t-shirt

1064
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:06,869
and we all like to kind of it's a bit

1065
00:49:05,430 --> 00:49:09,058
cool to be pub bounty hunters at the

1066
00:49:06,869 --> 00:49:11,309
moment and I'm literally in that guy so

1067
00:49:09,059 --> 00:49:13,470
I'm not on anyone here I would

1068
00:49:11,309 --> 00:49:15,390
not trust them with my name I also would

1069
00:49:13,470 --> 00:49:18,499
not trust the NCSC because I think they

1070
00:49:15,390 --> 00:49:18,499
under the bus as well

[Music]

1072
00:49:36,109 --> 00:49:43,049
if TDP art has a small to play spectacle

1073
00:49:40,229 --> 00:49:45,269
because of my thinking because now the

1074
00:49:43,049 --> 00:49:47,819
trend is oh the business reputation is

1075
00:49:45,269 --> 00:49:50,609
at risk because the media is all blown

1076
00:49:47,819 --> 00:49:51,749
out is like even before the company

1077
00:49:50,609 --> 00:49:53,279
knows that they have been hacked the

1078
00:49:51,749 --> 00:49:55,468
video is already laid out front of

1079
00:49:53,279 --> 00:49:57,839
people in a city with another copy I

1080
00:49:55,469 --> 00:50:00,359
think the cost is a lot of push towards

1081
00:49:57,839 --> 00:50:01,859
moving security to the left because of

1082
00:50:00,359 --> 00:50:04,229
the cost thinking it's a very valid

1083
00:50:01,859 --> 00:50:06,960
point in this discussion of the vendors

1084
00:50:04,229 --> 00:50:08,460
and the cutting of like you know fixing

1085
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:10,229
it all the inning and the understand

1086
00:50:08,460 --> 00:50:12,089
changes because the fine and the

1087
00:50:10,229 --> 00:50:13,890
reputation because at the end of the day

1088
00:50:12,089 --> 00:50:15,808
if the business is all about gains the

1089
00:50:13,890 --> 00:50:18,029
reputation having booked like a decade

1090
00:50:15,809 --> 00:50:19,979
or 15 years to build that reputation

1091
00:50:18,029 --> 00:50:22,229
they understand the risk of losing my

1092
00:50:19,979 --> 00:50:25,499
product case a top top was an example

1093
00:50:22,229 --> 00:50:27,749
for that element about work space so I

1094
00:50:25,499 --> 00:50:30,450
think talking about threat modeling and

1095
00:50:27,749 --> 00:50:33,089
threat modeling is trying to help people

1096
00:50:30,450 --> 00:50:36,460
think about City of especially in there

1097
00:50:33,089 --> 00:50:38,660
is Iowa Capital One and they

1098
00:50:36,460 --> 00:50:40,520
what you have said about programs like

1099
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:43,129
you know start doing threateningly

1100
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:46,369
not security from light at the beginning

1101
00:50:43,130 --> 00:50:49,310
stage before even in Pinto sexy ICD $29

1102
00:50:46,369 --> 00:50:52,430
for having fixing at that level I think

1103
00:50:49,310 --> 00:50:53,869
is more of a tickle more layering trying

1104
00:50:52,430 --> 00:50:55,879
to figure the earliest retard effect

1105
00:50:53,869 --> 00:50:59,359
having anybody come up and say I think

1106
00:50:55,880 --> 00:51:01,820
is and I think I think the other

1107
00:50:59,359 --> 00:51:03,799
advantage is organizations that are

1108
00:51:01,820 --> 00:51:05,810
doing that they you know they do care

1109
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:09,200
more about security so they're probably

1110
00:51:05,810 --> 00:51:11,150
likely to have a better reporting

1111
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:12,919
process so if I find if some touch panel

1112
00:51:11,150 --> 00:51:15,020
ability they're gonna have a way to

1113
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:16,609
report it which actually means if they

1114
00:51:15,020 --> 00:51:18,200
put up a bug bounty program as well

1115
00:51:16,609 --> 00:51:20,750
which means that the stuff is in scope

1116
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:22,640
which means the CMA is not gonna affect

1117
00:51:20,750 --> 00:51:24,740
us so we can actually report knowing

1118
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:26,750
that we're reporting without any legal

1119
00:51:24,740 --> 00:51:27,649
issues but this sort of risk there isn't

1120
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:29,359
that because they can change their mind

1121
00:51:27,650 --> 00:51:30,589
at any point because a policy is

1122
00:51:29,359 --> 00:51:34,430
something that is move abroad

1123
00:51:30,589 --> 00:51:36,290
not again is more about you know if you

1124
00:51:34,430 --> 00:51:39,049
do have like if you do find it on the

1125
00:51:36,290 --> 00:51:42,099
busy I know I'd rather find one but and

1126
00:51:39,050 --> 00:52:10,490
have to report with mobilization I know

1127
00:51:42,099 --> 00:52:12,050
it's gonna be easy for me to PCI DSS is

1128
00:52:10,490 --> 00:52:13,939
a standard because they are held

1129
00:52:12,050 --> 00:52:17,140
accountable to it so every breach that

1130
00:52:13,940 --> 00:52:21,109
you haven't a PCI DSS it's 36 pounds

1131
00:52:17,140 --> 00:52:22,490
fine per breach and say for any large

1132
00:52:21,109 --> 00:52:28,040
organization it would knock the mean

1133
00:52:22,490 --> 00:52:30,049
that I say there's no accountability see

1134
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:33,079
I use - where these are not anything

1135
00:52:30,050 --> 00:52:40,250
Alex yeah American Express Visa and

1136
00:52:33,079 --> 00:52:43,190
MasterCard it's like their money or they

1137
00:52:40,250 --> 00:52:44,630
were not terribly coordinated and they

1138
00:52:43,190 --> 00:52:46,580
do have like

1139
00:52:44,630 --> 00:52:48,950
they have their own one yeah and it gets

1140
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:50,750
quite confusing again you know a

1141
00:52:48,950 --> 00:52:52,580
standard needs to be a measurement you

1142
00:52:50,750 --> 00:52:55,550
can't have two standards that's why this

1143
00:52:52,580 --> 00:52:57,500
is just utterly hilarious that we now

1144
00:52:55,550 --> 00:52:58,580
have a free and available standard

1145
00:52:57,500 --> 00:53:00,350
that's five years out of date and

1146
00:52:58,580 --> 00:53:01,970
superseded by another standard which

1147
00:53:00,350 --> 00:53:03,170
were all working T yeah he leaves a

1148
00:53:01,970 --> 00:53:04,790
security who's working towards a

1149
00:53:03,170 --> 00:53:06,920
standard that's out of date you know and

1150
00:53:04,790 --> 00:53:08,300
not to be salty about Katie because

1151
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:10,820
she's great and the work that she's

1152
00:53:08,300 --> 00:53:12,530
doing is amazing but the icing screwed

1153
00:53:10,820 --> 00:53:14,570
her because they've released this

1154
00:53:12,530 --> 00:53:16,190
standard for free because this is what

1155
00:53:14,570 --> 00:53:18,560
she's suggested that they do to make

1156
00:53:16,190 --> 00:53:20,750
things easier and the NCSC is back to

1157
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:22,160
were doing it and then six months later

1158
00:53:20,750 --> 00:53:24,830
they released another standard that

1159
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:26,930
they're now charging and what is it a

1160
00:53:24,830 --> 00:53:28,880
hundred and thirty six Swiss francs for

1161
00:53:26,930 --> 00:53:30,710
so they've literally just gone back on

1162
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:32,780
themselves and and it just makes a

1163
00:53:30,710 --> 00:53:34,550
mockery of everything I just think the

1164
00:53:32,780 --> 00:53:35,900
whole thing as well I so didn't like

1165
00:53:34,550 --> 00:53:38,120
whether we're looking at you know we

1166
00:53:35,900 --> 00:53:41,330
have these established programs like

1167
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:43,609
whether it's MasterCard or whoever but

1168
00:53:41,330 --> 00:53:45,680
like how do the sort of like young

1169
00:53:43,610 --> 00:53:48,140
security researchers are the developers

1170
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:51,740
who want to do security researchers I

1171
00:53:48,140 --> 00:53:54,740
get on that that you know chain when

1172
00:53:51,740 --> 00:53:56,330
when there's like all these sort of when

1173
00:53:54,740 --> 00:53:58,609
there's the lack of standards and then

1174
00:53:56,330 --> 00:54:00,560
when there's also the CMA hanging over

1175
00:53:58,610 --> 00:54:03,500
all of them so it's like I feel like

1176
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:08,509
unless you're an established person who

1177
00:54:03,500 --> 00:54:10,310
makes a living off of bounties then I do

1178
00:54:08,510 --> 00:54:12,290
many people make much of a living off

1179
00:54:10,310 --> 00:54:16,250
bounty hunting those and my colleague

1180
00:54:12,290 --> 00:54:17,830
just like puts it towards our parties so

1181
00:54:16,250 --> 00:54:20,510
I think this way he's like you know he's

1182
00:54:17,830 --> 00:54:24,230
he doesn't have to struggle on terms of

1183
00:54:20,510 --> 00:54:25,640
team yeah of course I think in the grand

1184
00:54:24,230 --> 00:54:27,800
scheme of things you know it's probably

1185
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:29,810
a small percentage of intersect and the

1186
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:31,580
most most possible working not in are

1187
00:54:29,810 --> 00:54:33,140
there yeah and to be honest the CMAs

1188
00:54:31,580 --> 00:54:35,990
that should be kind of the least of your

1189
00:54:33,140 --> 00:54:39,049
worries in terms of laws and like the

1190
00:54:35,990 --> 00:54:40,640
maximum jail sentence and the CMA is ten

1191
00:54:39,050 --> 00:54:43,340
years and kind of pretty much unlimited

1192
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:46,520
fines by the time you get to the stage

1193
00:54:43,340 --> 00:54:48,320
it's like 25 years to life

1194
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:50,150
and that for really not doing very much

1195
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:52,130
but that's the problem one of the

1196
00:54:50,150 --> 00:54:54,500
problem major problems with the CMA is

1197
00:54:52,130 --> 00:54:57,140
that the way that I think it's used to

1198
00:54:54,500 --> 00:55:01,930
easily extradite people to to the United

1199
00:54:57,140 --> 00:55:05,930
States and I think from my work covering

1200
00:55:01,930 --> 00:55:09,319
issues like tech tech policy for a long

1201
00:55:05,930 --> 00:55:10,879
time now you know it's it's fine that

1202
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:13,340
you know maybe the significant

1203
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:15,500
prosecution's maybe not that many and in

1204
00:55:13,340 --> 00:55:18,260
the scheme of things but the point is is

1205
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:20,420
this bad legislation stays around for so

1206
00:55:18,260 --> 00:55:23,090
long like you know it's just gonna take

1207
00:55:20,420 --> 00:55:25,160
a few more years before we see the

1208
00:55:23,090 --> 00:55:27,500
prosecution's really sort of laying on

1209
00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:30,140
and I think that if we don't fix it now

1210
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:31,910
then then it's gonna be a huge problem

1211
00:55:30,140 --> 00:55:34,460
particularly in this country where they

1212
00:55:31,910 --> 00:55:36,710
just pull it a law from the 1800s we're

1213
00:55:34,460 --> 00:55:39,470
gonna use this now to take this person

1214
00:55:36,710 --> 00:55:41,840
to jail for you know and these issues

1215
00:55:39,470 --> 00:55:43,640
I'm cool to chimney sweep for hate

1216
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:47,660
speeches the example I was thinking but

1217
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:48,770
that could also be a couple of minutes

1218
00:55:47,660 --> 00:55:50,359
left I don't know if anyone has any

1219
00:55:48,770 --> 00:55:55,730
other questions or comments before we

1220
00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:58,090
wrap up okay thank you for listening to

1221
00:55:55,730 --> 00:55:58,090
us round
