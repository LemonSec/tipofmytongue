1
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:07,290
however I've got so thanks like more

2
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:11,039
people magical I was aiming on eight

3
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:14,580
people but you know I won't want to go

4
00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:15,779
so this talk really is can't designed

5
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:18,420
for anyone

6
00:00:15,779 --> 00:00:19,770
well this tours come about because I get

7
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:23,060
a ridiculous amount of emails from

8
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:26,100
people wanting to be a pen tester and

9
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:27,479
lots and lots of different mistakes so

10
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:31,920
how many of you here tried to break into

11
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:33,750
the pentose to market yeah okay so I'm

12
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:37,110
going to kind of guess as 50% more there

13
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:38,880
two shots but the hands up basic I see

14
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:41,100
lots and lots of different ways of doing

15
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:42,750
it and I see lots of lots of the same

16
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:45,000
mistakes I just would it's kind of how

17
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:47,899
they were fun talk about you know common

18
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,570
common things that I see

19
00:00:47,899 --> 00:00:52,880
so basically been a pentose there's a

20
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:55,620
bit of a hard life

21
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:57,840
edan can testify to that he's word to me

22
00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:01,169
before and then most of you know Chloe

23
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,100
Chloe County boy to me but being a pen

24
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:07,590
tester for me

25
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:10,829
you know it's it's long days it's lots

26
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:13,799
of hard graft oh it's not about meeting

27
00:01:10,829 --> 00:01:15,329
their two interest in that right so pen

28
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:18,270
testing is a bit like GT sports car

29
00:01:15,329 --> 00:01:22,109
racing in many ways so I have it on

30
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:24,899
three go I raced GT cars gt3 TT Force I

31
00:01:22,109 --> 00:01:28,708
reckon the British GT and in the block

32
00:01:24,899 --> 00:01:30,990
pan on the way to the mom and what I do

33
00:01:28,709 --> 00:01:33,899
in the GT race in the g8 GT racing world

34
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:37,639
is the lifestyle is exactly the same as

35
00:01:33,899 --> 00:01:41,310
pen testing just slightly less glamorous

36
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:43,139
so what the similarities as a pen tester

37
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:46,200
you're gonna be working 12 hours + /

38
00:01:43,139 --> 00:01:47,848
done without doubt there are long days

39
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:50,639
they're quite hard days six days a week

40
00:01:47,849 --> 00:01:55,139
potentially and you are going to be on

41
00:01:50,639 --> 00:01:57,240
the road a lot a lot of the a lot the

42
00:01:55,139 --> 00:01:59,279
time you go out to client sites you're

43
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:01,169
living out of a single bag maybe two

44
00:01:59,279 --> 00:02:02,939
bags if you're driving your own car they

45
00:02:01,169 --> 00:02:06,090
using public transport and UK pretty

46
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:08,609
screwed so you can use in one bag and it

47
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:09,929
can be quite harsh harsh living

48
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:12,430
I know ever in the state's about a lot

49
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:15,100
of American pentesting friends

50
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:17,290
they spend sixty to seventy-five percent

51
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:21,220
at that time working away from home

52
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:22,929
working remotely it kind of it speaks

53
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:26,290
really to the attrition rate of the

54
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:28,000
industry the fact a lot of testers don't

55
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:29,109
last that long in the commercial testing

56
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,160
world because they get tired out and

57
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:36,040
they burn out really quickly what we do

58
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:37,780
why do in the GT racing world you know I

59
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:39,700
go out you none of you will have ever

60
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:42,430
seen my name in lights I fail

61
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:44,290
ninety-eight Sun at the time but I'm out

62
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:46,030
there I'm constantly out running every

63
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:47,769
single morning I'm constantly in the

64
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:50,500
simulator I'm constantly out testing

65
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:52,630
with my GT cars and I'm always working

66
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:53,620
hard I fight in third the middle of the

67
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:55,390
pack all the time

68
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:57,490
occasionally when in my class but never

69
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:59,709
making the podium in pentesting is

70
00:02:57,490 --> 00:03:01,990
exactly the same you know not yet at the

71
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:03,940
time we're failing at what we do but if

72
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:06,280
we fail consistently and we fail

73
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:07,900
properly when we succeed we succeed big

74
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:11,350
and we end up a shell which is what we

75
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:13,510
always want to do so there's a lot of

76
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:17,260
similarities my typical tip my typical

77
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:19,959
day in the pentesting world up at full

78
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:22,480
 shower shave bang out a one-off

79
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:24,730
mile run it just helps clear my mind get

80
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:27,429
me set up for the day then it's

81
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:32,200
breakfast then I'm out on the road go it

82
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:34,060
off out to client sites if I happen to

83
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:36,880
be using public transport I'll go and

84
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:40,150
check all my emails I'm on the road if

85
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:42,220
not try and do that before right so I

86
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:44,200
run a painting company myself so I've

87
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:46,210
got to be in touch to everyone our

88
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:48,369
clients like from nine possibly even

89
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:50,350
five more realistically leaving at 6:00

90
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:52,960
in the evening maybe pushing it later

91
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:54,870
depending on what we're doing food back

92
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:58,810
home write up what I've done for the day

93
00:03:54,870 --> 00:04:02,920
but sleep rinse and repeat six days a

94
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:06,810
week it's a wicked life I love it but

95
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:10,690
it's hard and I thought it does really

96
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:13,090
put a strain on your life it's great for

97
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:18,608
those of you young I've been doing this

98
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:21,790
now for 26 years all of my life

99
00:04:18,608 --> 00:04:23,919
it does grow it does grungy down but as

100
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:25,240
people that work me will attest

101
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:27,490
to three o'clock in the morning

102
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:29,919
understood online on the IRC on slack

103
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:33,909
shutting away and working I just done

104
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:36,460
sleep I've got used to it so really

105
00:04:33,909 --> 00:04:37,779
getting that first gig if you've got it

106
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:40,150
in your mind that this is what you want

107
00:04:37,779 --> 00:04:42,909
to do you want to be a pen tester

108
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:44,979
you've kind of got five challenges so

109
00:04:42,909 --> 00:04:46,900
you're gonna you're going to go out as a

110
00:04:44,979 --> 00:04:48,400
student or as someone who is looking to

111
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:51,758
break into pen testing market you've got

112
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:53,409
five five challenges really you need to

113
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:55,360
get a job to get a job you need to get

114
00:04:53,409 --> 00:04:57,550
in front in front of me to get an

115
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:00,279
interview and to do that you need to get

116
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:03,310
me to read your CV the world's hardest

117
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:07,479
thing so I receive on average on average

118
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:09,849
day fifteen hundred emails and most

119
00:05:07,479 --> 00:05:12,188
those are junk and I'll just I'll take

120
00:05:09,849 --> 00:05:14,830
control like shift delete get rid of

121
00:05:12,189 --> 00:05:17,770
emails but you need me to read that

122
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:19,839
email that email needs to stick out and

123
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:21,250
it needs to make an impression

124
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:24,099
and that's the thing needs to make an

125
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:26,080
impression to me if you're at usually

126
00:05:24,099 --> 00:05:28,659
please please please if you're gonna

127

00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,409
you because they're telling you

130
00:05:35,189 --> 00:05:39,639
it's true I mean you don't ask anyone

131
00:05:37,779 --> 00:05:42,520
that's been in the industry my role long

132
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:45,189
enough I ask you er right if you're

133
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:49,419
gonna fire off a template email it is

134
00:05:45,189 --> 00:05:50,889
gonna go straight in my recycle bin and

135
00:05:49,419 --> 00:05:54,849
if you're gonna word it badly and I've

136
00:05:50,889 --> 00:05:56,830
got some cool canned examples don't

137
00:05:54,849 --> 00:06:01,719
think any of them are from anyone in

138
00:05:56,830 --> 00:06:03,188
this room I'm not sure if the stuff on

139
00:06:01,719 --> 00:06:05,680
here is yours

140
00:06:03,189 --> 00:06:07,389
please take its constructive criticism

141
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:10,210
don't take it bad and don't want to make

142
00:06:07,389 --> 00:06:12,189
you cry you can send me any amount

143
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:14,830
you've got to make me rain it somehow

144
00:06:12,189 --> 00:06:17,289
then I'm gonna read your CV it has got

145
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:19,688
to stick out it has got to be memorable

146
00:06:17,289 --> 00:06:21,610
because it in the day in your first year

147
00:06:19,689 --> 00:06:23,949
you're asking for a salary but you're

148
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:25,899
asking for me to personally put 50,000

149
00:06:23,949 --> 00:06:29,139
pounds of training into you to turn you

150
00:06:25,899 --> 00:06:32,259
into a pen tester that's taking into

151
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:36,180
account things like desk space travel IT

152
00:06:32,259 --> 00:06:37,830
equipment training courses conferences

153
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:39,630
that first year you are not going to

154
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:40,409
know what you're doing every day you're

155
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:41,909
going to be running around like a

156
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:44,790
headless chicken and you're going to get

157
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:48,270
the jobs you are going to be

158
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:50,640
looking at code and done testing code

159
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:51,990
but I'm testing myself and I'm kind of a

160
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:53,969
list of things that are wrong with it

161
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:56,300
and I'm kind of hoping your than from at

162
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:59,070
least one of those sometimes you're done

163
00:06:56,300 --> 00:07:01,170
sometimes as Chloe's found out recently

164
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:03,870
you get thrown out on a pen test on your

165
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:05,660
own unexpected to survive and then we'll

166
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:08,880
see how well you do

167
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:11,070
so we're I'm investing a lot of money in

168
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:13,140
the MU if you come on board so you've

169
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:16,260
got a truck you've got to really stand

170
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:18,870
out from the crowd and on top of that

171
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:20,219
you want a salary as well which on the

172
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:22,020
subject of salaries if you're an intern

173
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:23,640
don't ask me for 26,000 pounds a year

174
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:27,900
because you just going straight in the

175
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:30,770
recycle bin so how do you get this gig

176
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:33,390
treat it like a pen test because it is

177
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:37,650
it's a it's a cross between social

178
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:39,210
engineering recon and testing you're

179
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:41,310
going to want me you're gonna want to

180
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:43,409
try and get me to read that covering

181
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:45,630
email or answer the phone shoes and how

182
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:48,080
do you do it well if you're coming

183
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:50,670
firstly who is it you want to work for

184
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,900
I'm gonna use me as an example so if you

185
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:53,640
want to work for a job security

186
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:55,710
you need to know who is it you're

187
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:57,930
addressing what you know where that

188
00:07:55,710 --> 00:08:00,330
sliders know okay so you need to know

189
00:07:57,930 --> 00:08:02,160
who it is that you're gonna be talking

190
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:03,690
to you want to know everything about

191
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,310
that person you want to be following

192
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:07,260
them on LinkedIn you only follow on

193
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:09,570
Twitter if you can find their Facebook

194
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:11,880
page see if you confront them you need

195
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:14,190
as much background information as I that

196
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:16,260
person as possible because you need to

197
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:20,040
make an approach that is going to stick

198
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:23,849
in their mind so if for instance you are

199
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:26,130
dying to be a placement person for next

200
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:28,170
academic year and you happen to rock up

201
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:30,920
at a testing day when I'm at one of my

202
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:33,659
new GT cars and talk to me about GT test

203
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:35,220
you're gonna stick in my mind and I'm

204
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:37,199
going to remember you for that time when

205
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:38,490
you then email me and say hey it was

206
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,680
really great to see you at the right at

207
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:42,030
the race circuit are you going to be

208
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:44,250
looking for a placement shooting next

209
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:49,110
year so an interesting approach was

210
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:49,980
quite impressed but you want to find a

211
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:51,750
way in now

212
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:54,029
if you're gonna do it cold you're gonna

213
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:55,560
flow you talk to any salesperson and

214
00:08:54,029 --> 00:08:58,500
I'll tell you if you send a cold email

215
00:08:55,560 --> 00:09:00,089
most time it's going to go nowhere if

216
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:02,190
you send the warm email you're on a

217
00:09:00,089 --> 00:09:04,170
50/50 chance of it ever being read if

218
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:06,779
you send an email that that person's

219
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:07,979
expecting you've got a much higher

220
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:09,899
chance so

221
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:10,970
you've gathered a lot of information

222
00:09:09,899 --> 00:09:13,170
about the person that you're targeting

223
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:15,870
now look at the people that they connect

224
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:17,370
to do you know any of those people so

225
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:20,250
for instance if you come after me

226
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:21,930
do you know Chloe do you know Stuart can

227
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:25,320
you get one of those to introduce you to

228
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:26,910
me it's a lot warmer playing this it's

229
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:31,740
all social engineering it's all

230
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:35,100
reconnaissance and numeration so recon

231
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:37,829
your target basically exactly what you

232
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:39,959
do at a normal test find out as much as

233
00:09:37,829 --> 00:09:42,899
you can about them and prepare your

234
00:09:39,959 --> 00:09:44,670
attack so work out how you're going to

235
00:09:42,899 --> 00:09:47,250
make that project build a portfolio your

236
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:49,229
work if you're going to send me a CV I'm

237
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:51,860
going to read and you get me to read

238
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:54,630
that CV and you'll see these sucks ass

239
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:56,339
you're going in the bin if you send me

240
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:58,620
your CV and you send me a portfolio your

241
00:09:56,339 --> 00:10:00,660
work so you've gone off and done some

242
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:02,519
like CTF thirty six five and you're a

243
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:04,860
kick-ass report on a cross-site script

244
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:07,680
in the sequel injection attacks is an

245
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:10,260
example of your work it means a massive

246
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:13,439
amount attest it to me you could be one

247
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:17,010
of the greatest technical testers that

248
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:20,250
exists if you can't write a good report

249
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:22,260
you're worth fuck-all to me you have to

250
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:24,510
be able to put what you've done in the

251
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:26,730
testing world into the real world and

252
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:28,649
you've got to be able to word it well so

253
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:34,170
that you can then communicate that to

254
00:10:28,649 --> 00:10:36,750
the client right launch your attack so

255
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:39,569
these this kind of works said the amount

256
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:42,899
wait see what happens but don't wait

257
00:10:39,569 --> 00:10:45,319
forever I'm not going to chase you wait

258
00:10:42,899 --> 00:10:48,300
said of those that follow up and funcle'

259
00:10:45,319 --> 00:10:51,719
then maybe help up on social media

260
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:53,819
try LinkedIn try Twitter if you're not

261
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:57,870
getting any engagement and this is the

262
00:10:53,819 --> 00:11:00,269
company you want to work for try again

263
00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:01,470

264
00:11:00,269 --> 00:11:03,730
if you want to go market pensive

265
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:07,029
partners engage with PT PT

266
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:08,709
on Twitter if you're a work at NCC hem

267
00:11:07,029 --> 00:11:11,199
up all the time start getting into

268
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:12,849
conversations it makes you memorable if

269
00:11:11,199 --> 00:11:17,699
you're memorable that doors gonna open

270
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:20,350

288
00:11:58,749 --> 00:12:02,739
Holman

289
00:12:00,119 --> 00:12:06,519
hello I'm not forwarding your emails for

290
00:12:02,739 --> 00:12:09,220
you attention to detail and things if

291
00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:11,439
you've done the crip the recon first you

292
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:15,069
know about that person so you'll be able

293
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:17,319
to work out how to address it I think

294
00:12:15,069 --> 00:12:18,868
Chloe started his/her opening mom was

295
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:21,669
hey Paige how are you today

296
00:12:18,869 --> 00:12:24,759
nice nice and informal that's pretty

297
00:12:21,669 --> 00:12:27,129
much how I kind of communicate if you're

298
00:12:24,759 --> 00:12:31,179
going to attach something do not send me

299
00:12:27,129 --> 00:12:33,459
a docx file a PPT hell no and don't so

300
00:12:31,179 --> 00:12:38,100
many a zip file or any other form of

301
00:12:33,459 --> 00:12:42,399
archived PDF is acceptable text is fine

302
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:45,009
but yeah PDF them all equally if you're

303
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:46,899
going through a recruiter just make sure

304
00:12:45,009 --> 00:12:48,999
your recruiters not doctoring your CV

305
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:52,480
because one of my favorite tricks is to

306
00:12:48,999 --> 00:12:54,100
do a shot some of your CV versus what

307
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,869
the recruiter sent me because I love

308
00:12:54,100 --> 00:13:00,249
comparing them and seeing whether

309
00:12:55,869 --> 00:13:01,449
they've been doctored or not I don't try

310
00:13:00,249 --> 00:13:04,660
and fish me by sending me a blank

311
00:13:01,449 --> 00:13:07,299
extension file it happens quite a lot so

312
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:09,939
I'll have CV dot nothing at all

313
00:13:07,299 --> 00:13:12,309
you're not gonna get read on top of that

314
00:13:09,939 --> 00:13:14,219
I don't use Windows as kind of this

315
00:13:12,309 --> 00:13:18,010
really demonstrates I've got no idea

316
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:21,860
right really bad examples of emails

317
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:22,939
make it flow but kind of get over what

318
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:25,010
it is you won

319
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:28,070
so in this email this such a really good

320
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:29,959
example of a generic email you know

321
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:30,470
there's nothing really that's wrong with

322
00:13:29,959 --> 00:13:32,959
this

323
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:35,120
it just doesn't stick in my mind it's

324
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:38,449
not interesting and it doesn't really do

325
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:42,470
it for me but this is probably a good a

326
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:54,890
good example of a average email come on

327
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:59,269
down okay way dumb one this is hilarious

328
00:13:54,890 --> 00:14:00,740
and yeah I love one-liners I come from

329
00:13:59,269 --> 00:14:02,750
the old school of Perl cut Perl

330
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:05,089
scripting if I could put on one single

331
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:08,779
line I will that's not the way to set an

332
00:14:05,089 --> 00:14:10,220
opening email with this one it was

333
00:14:08,779 --> 00:14:13,399
really really interesting in the fact

334
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:15,560
that I think they'd lifted a template

335
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:18,290
from someone because they had someone

336
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:21,529
else's name at the bottom before light

337
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:23,689
on so main to was different to name and

338
00:14:21,529 --> 00:14:25,850
I was like come on attention to detail

339
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:31,520
please you want me to employ you that's

340
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:35,089
not going to work yeah so yeah more

00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:38,449

00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:47,000
background before I'm going to know

347
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:48,110
everything he's post on the Internet

348
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,820
I'm going to drill into your social

349
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:51,980

350
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:53,600

that you're not actually that interested

359
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:20,750
build up your profile before you start

360
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:22,370

00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:25,430
yourself a good blog doesn't matter

363

364
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:29,680
but if they're interesting in a purse

365
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:32,149
you know it's really gonna help you

366
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:34,250
don't claim to have things that you

367
00:15:32,149 --> 00:15:37,790
haven't got if you have an OS if you

368

373
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:49,700

374
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:52,579

375
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:55,610
person are they a follow no ok I won't

376
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:57,529
talk to them so just be honest if you've

377
00:15:55,610 --> 00:16:00,020
got no experience at all and you're just

378
00:15:57,529 --> 00:16:02,510
really passionate about InfoSec and pen

379
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:03,470
testing that doesn't matter just show

380

381
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:09,380
you don't need to go and try and

382
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:11,600
embellish it on five ways to up an

383
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:14,390
interview dude I hacked your wireless

384
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:16,130
yep that's fine it means nothing to me

385
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:17,300
and you didn't have my permission so you

386
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:20,029
can make it a crime that tells me a lot

387
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:22,849
about your mentality towards what it is

388
00:16:20,029 --> 00:16:25,279
you're doing if you've got a country an

389
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:27,440
interview a lot of my interviews are

390
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:30,649
really random they will be over lunch

391
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:33,050
or they I might send a longitude and

392
00:16:30,649 --> 00:16:35,150
latitude and tell you that's where I

393
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:37,250
want you to meet me it's going to be

394
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:39,110
something interesting you have to look

395
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:41,630
into it I might say I'll just million

396
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:45,620
spoons by Manchester translation yeah at

397
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:47,630
midday now your job is to find me okay

398
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:49,700
being a pen tester means using your

399
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:51,589
intelligence and using all the tools

400
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:52,850
your disposal to come up with the answer

401
00:16:51,589 --> 00:16:54,680
I'm not going to give it to you on a

402
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:56,720
plate and I'm starting to see a lot more

403
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:58,069
companies do this now they're not going

404
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,900
to say I'll come to our offices at one

405
00:16:58,070 --> 00:17:03,560
o'clock for a formal interview it's

406
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:06,490
going to be a lot more random so great

407
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:09,349
one example so this particular person

408
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:11,900
understood who I was men stood

409
00:17:09,349 --> 00:17:15,559
everything about me they've really gone

410
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:18,199
into down from my background identified

411
00:17:15,559 --> 00:17:20,869
how to submit CV to me worked out they

412
00:17:18,199 --> 00:17:22,790
couldn't do it and subverted that

413
00:17:20,869 --> 00:17:25,760
systems or I put in a challenge on my

414
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:27,170
website which has had it was three

415
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:29,090
different steps no four different steps

416
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:31,309
had complete and one of the steps I'd

417
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:33,830
deliberately broken paint was a third

418
00:17:31,309 --> 00:17:35,720
step this person just as a vert enter

419
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:36,620
mother you know I don't think I could do

420
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:40,220
it his CV

421
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:41,090
with a really nice covering email you

422
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:43,669
know it worked

423
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:45,678
engage me over that sometime do enough

424
00:17:43,669 --> 00:17:47,720
relationship understanding who I was was

425
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:51,049
looking for and what the role entailed

426
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:53,690
and early on started in negotiations two

427
00:17:51,049 --> 00:17:56,418
ways they wanted to get out there join

428
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:59,000
us for lunch and got the job it was

429
00:17:56,419 --> 00:18:02,059
quite that simple I'll make it sound

430
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:05,659
simple so this was this is a exit

431
00:18:02,059 --> 00:18:09,770
example of a nice opening email an

432
00:18:05,659 --> 00:18:12,289
introductory mo that wasn't call that

433
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:17,330
wasn't cold so it's in the warm area

434
00:18:12,289 --> 00:18:20,690
which was nice and above all never ever

435
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:23,418
give up keep trying and if you keep

436
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:24,230
trying you will crack it and if you ever

437
00:18:23,419 --> 00:18:30,020
get stuck

438
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:32,390
do I think ping ping me a message advice

439
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:34,730
is free if you want some ideas on

440
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:37,520
sitting on your CV whether it looks good

441
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:39,020
if you just really stuck and Kong get

442
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:41,270
your head around how to make that

443
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:42,679
opening approach just give me a shout I

444
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:44,330
can give you some pointers I won't give

445
00:18:42,679 --> 00:18:45,770
you the answers but I'll point you in

446
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:48,379
the right direction I can critique four

447
00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:50,629
things for you so there you go a quick

448
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:54,649
introduction into possibly breaking into

449
00:18:50,630 --> 00:19:03,169
pest Pam yeah pen test them questions

450
00:18:54,649 --> 00:19:04,070
over to you guys drill me for free that

451
00:19:03,169 --> 00:19:06,350
could also work

452
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:08,600
see that's another that's just another

453
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:15,408
way of doing it yeah I see you could

454
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:16,490
quite happily do that right so if your

455
00:19:15,409 --> 00:19:17,409
LinkedIn says you currently work for

456
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:19,850
someone else

457
00:19:17,409 --> 00:19:22,220
there was actually a specific example of

458
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:24,289
that they were working for a different

459
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:26,899
testing company but the task of them

460
00:19:24,289 --> 00:19:29,480
selling far worse on but if they're

461
00:19:26,899 --> 00:19:30,678
working full-time somewhere else why are

462
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:34,250
they looking for a pen testing

463
00:19:30,679 --> 00:19:35,750
internship it's just one one of those

464
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:37,549
things it really doesn't make sense if

465
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:41,029
you've got it you're going after a

466
00:19:37,549 --> 00:19:42,289
specific internship theoretically you're

467
00:19:41,029 --> 00:19:44,419
going to be putting a lot of time into

468
00:19:42,289 --> 00:19:45,890
your studying if you're working

469
00:19:44,419 --> 00:19:47,390
somewhere else and you've got really

470
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:49,660
good reasons around that then that's

471
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:54,670
fine but don't

472
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:56,380
I wouldn't make an approach Antwoord

473
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:58,030
basically I wouldn't make an approach

474
00:19:56,380 --> 00:20:00,670
knowing that I'm working full time and

475
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:02,530
not disclose it so I'd be really open

476
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:04,240
with it right for the outset so I'm

477
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:06,820
where I'm working in this environment

478
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:08,490
here really considering pentesting as a

479
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:10,480
career I'm looking for an internship

480
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:13,600
understand that I would I would need to

481
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:21,930
step away from my full-time role and I'm

482
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:21,929
making you making it opening like that a

483
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:29,620
hot email coming down to the British GT

484
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:31,090
hanging out there talking to me about

485
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:35,020
racing and then dropping in that you're

486
00:20:31,090 --> 00:20:36,250
looking for a internship after you've

487
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:37,420
been like three or four times and you

488
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:41,860
kind of got to know me and got to know

489
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:44,080
him a team equally another hot way of

490
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:45,280
doing it is just super said back will

491
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:47,050
come up to reception but cannot

492
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:49,120
reception already knowing some of the

493
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:51,129
team so coming in just hanging out with

494
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:53,919
some other team shooting pool joining

495
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:57,490
the team down the pub going to be sides

496
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:59,080
and go to the ups show party and having

497
00:20:57,490 --> 00:21:01,030
a few drinks and getting to know the

498
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:03,220
people it's all about knowing people

499
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:04,960
it's all about social engineering and

500
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:15,280
engineering the outcome that you want to

501
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:19,390
you desire animal sure sorry done well

502
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:22,810
might look for in a person someone who's

503
00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:24,160
outgoing reasonably confident within the

504
00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:26,800
specs of the industry because I know

505
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:30,040
like most of us are socially awkward

506
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:31,210
people drive ambition

507
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:34,360
someone who really wants to learn

508
00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:36,190
someone who's got an identified area of

509
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:38,469
passion so it could be that they'll

510
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:40,660
really really interested in doing random

511
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:42,700
 with raspberry PI's it could be

512
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:45,220
that they're really really interested in

513
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:48,070
web technologies but it's just how

514
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:49,960
having something that is more than yeah

515
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:52,110
I saw Penta thing I say it pays a lot of

516
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:52,110
money

517
00:21:54,110 --> 00:22:41,969
and see these would you say that he

518
00:22:38,910 --> 00:22:50,970
would like search engine optimization

519
00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:52,560
probably they won't say if you're going

520
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:55,560
for one of the big bigger corporate

521
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:57,480
companies it still makes a lot of sense

522
00:22:55,560 --> 00:23:00,659
to target the person that has the

523
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:03,810
overall say the decision maker at the

524
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:06,630
end of the day if you can I get it way

525
00:23:03,810 --> 00:23:08,580
back Christ in about twelve years ago

526
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:10,830
talk did the specific person that I

527
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:13,679
wanted to work for and got them to a

528
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:15,780
point where when the CV went into HR it

529
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:17,190
got read because they'd already said oh

530
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:19,200
we've had I've seen this guy

531
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:21,780
you see these really really strong and

532
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:25,350
he's got the experience so it's just a

533
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:27,149
case of promoting yourself a tea here

534
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:29,399
really it's kind of like marketing

535
00:23:27,150 --> 00:23:31,830
yourself and just making sure that your

536
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:33,930
own brand image is at front of the

537
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:38,570
people of mindset making decisions to do

538
00:23:33,930 --> 00:23:38,570
to hire damn much again to marketing

539
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:48,179
I'll either you are evil I hate

540
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:51,750
recruiters you know that and you're a

541
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:54,630
cruise in the audience awesome right so

542
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:56,670
I know I'm going to charge you thirty

543
00:23:54,630 --> 00:23:57,240
five percent of your salary to come and

544
00:23:56,670 --> 00:24:00,420
work for me

545
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:01,300
no recruiters want so if you're on say

546
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:03,100
fifty

547
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:04,659
you want of salary 50 grand recruits

548
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:07,600
gonna want to charge the company recruit

549
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:11,560
you 35 percent on what to give them the

550
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:14,500
CV it's just like no recruiters are evil

551
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:16,629
don't you use them you know it's a good

552
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:20,290
way to get your name out there it's a

553
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:23,260
good way to find it easy or easier jobs

554
00:24:20,290 --> 00:24:25,510
but I don't go straight to the companies

555
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:27,490
instead it's much easier recruit us a

556
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:43,810
horrible people sorry

557
00:24:27,490 --> 00:24:47,500
