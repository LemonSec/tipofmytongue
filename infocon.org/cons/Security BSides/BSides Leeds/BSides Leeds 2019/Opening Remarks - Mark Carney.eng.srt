36
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:45,310
program but not on any page hidden in a

37
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:48,979
left-wing place is another clue got it

38
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:51,950

53
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:30,780
mental health village this is

54
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:33,929

wonderment I haven't got them on me now

61
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:51,660
there were some cards available for

62
00:02:49,709 --> 00:02:54,630
anyone with anxiety if you see someone

63
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:57,239
wearing a green card talk to them if you

64
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:58,530
see some wearing a yellow card that

65
00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:01,650
might have a curved edge on the bottom

66
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:04,770
then only talk to them if you know them

67
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:06,480
and if you see someone wearing a red

68
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:09,030
card you also have a point for the

69
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,649
colorblind then please do not talk to

70
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:13,080
them they're having a moment it's fine

71
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:14,760
okay if you would like one of those

72
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:18,660
please go to a mental health village

73
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:22,079
they have all that capacity today I hope

74
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:25,590
that helps some people who are here we

75
