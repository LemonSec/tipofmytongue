1
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:11,370
good afternoon everyone hey Dean my name

2
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:13,700
is Karen Wilson a life lesson when Rory

3
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:16,590
Alsop says hey we're going to talk about

4
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:18,210
make sure that your commas actually

5
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:19,920
leave a separate line between the name

6
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:21,420
of your talk because actually the name

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,179
of the talk is just the first line and

8
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:25,769
the second and third line of the talk

9
00:00:24,179 --> 00:00:27,598
heading were actually things I put into

10
00:00:25,769 --> 00:00:32,220
the email afterwards but we thought let

11
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:36,750
us stick number six is actually quite

12
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:38,460
dull so my name is Karen Wilson I work

13
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:39,630
in security for longer than I care to

14
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:41,610
remember there are people in this

15
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:44,790
audience who I work with three decades

16
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:45,780
ago not quite three thirty years but

17
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:48,450
almost there

18
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:52,500
and I'm gonna talk to you about the top

19
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:54,930
ten devices found in UK homes but I want

20
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:56,220
to know a bit about you so this is going

21
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:59,850
to be a show of hands everyone has to

22
00:00:56,220 --> 00:01:03,420
take part hands up who works or studies

23
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:06,200
in academia right I'm counting yeah

24
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:08,729
quite a lot who works in government

25
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:12,479
that's the spooks sorted out thank you

26
00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:14,390
and who works into a corporate big

27
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:17,189
enterprise that type of stuff

28
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:18,149
yeah okay quite a lot okay that's

29
00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:23,100
interesting that's going to become

30
00:01:18,149 --> 00:01:26,939
relevant in a minute so so we start with

31
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:30,178
this number is that the average day rate

32
00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:32,850
for a consultant in Edinburgh is that

33
00:01:30,179 --> 00:01:34,890
the number of Internet of Things devices

34
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:37,048
and you were listening no it's not

35
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:38,789
actually that is a volume in dollars and

36
00:01:37,049 --> 00:01:42,409
that's the total amount that garner

37
00:01:38,789 --> 00:01:45,899
predict will be spent in security in

38
00:01:42,409 --> 00:01:47,219
2019 seems quite quite a lot and they've

39
00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:49,859
actually done their sums on this they've

40
00:01:47,219 --> 00:01:51,719
been working for every year counting up

41
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:54,079
using accounting records to say that

42
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:58,109
basically you know application security

43
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:59,999
2.4 billion dollars cloud half a billion

44
00:01:58,109 --> 00:02:03,208
data security and they're measuring how

45
00:01:59,999 --> 00:02:05,729
these things change through the years as

46
00:02:03,209 --> 00:02:08,789
well and then the consultants get 64

47
00:02:05,729 --> 00:02:11,110
billion dollars I've probably paid some

48
00:02:08,788 --> 00:02:13,989
consultants 64 billion dollars

49
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:15,490
and even what I love about Ghana even

50
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:17,230
though they're doing estimates they

51
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:18,640
still have other what enough that's for

52
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:20,920
thirty two point two billion dollars

53
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:22,179
down the back of the sofa but it's the

54
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:23,920
last figure that want to draw your

55
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:26,590
attention to and that's consumer

56
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:28,989
security six point six billion dollars

57
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:32,620
and it sounds like a lot of money but it

58
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:33,790
isn't basically consumers are screwed if

59
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:38,950
you work that out it's about ninety

60
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:40,239
cents per consumer for 2019 and at the

61
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:42,780
end of the day who are we actually

62
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:45,490
protecting all the rest of this is

63
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:47,470
protecting the corporation or the

64
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:50,010
governmental entity or academic

65
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:55,390
institution there's not a lot actually

66
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:59,079
protecting the consumer another number

67
00:02:55,390 --> 00:03:00,700
five hundred and this is the last of the

68
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:03,880
research numbers don't worry we're going

69
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:06,190
to come on some real data in a minute by

70
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:09,640
2022 Garner predicted it would have five

71
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:11,530
hundred smart devices in the home that

72
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:13,540
seems like quite a lot because I can

73
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:16,300
tell you today that actually the real

74
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:17,859
numbers are rough that on average for

75
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:20,590
each of those different geographical

76
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:21,370
areas and you're gonna say Tom how'd you

77
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:24,220
know this stuff

78
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:25,480
how'd you actually know this so garner

79
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:26,800
went out with a clipboard they worked

80
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:28,660
out the number of five hundred devices

81
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:31,330
in the home they've done research to

82
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:33,940
work how much we're spending in IT

83
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:35,320
security these are real numbers this is

84
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:37,359
what I'm presenting you today so

85
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:42,190
everything than the rest of this pack is

86
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:44,980
real data that's come from a system that

87
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:46,450
we put together so basically we few

88
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:49,269
years ago we thought how are we gonna

89
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:52,899
work out what are people actually

90
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:54,580
running in their home so we thought of

91
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:57,459
different ways about doing this and

92
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:59,410
really it came down to a nap so put

93
00:03:57,459 --> 00:04:01,660
together this up it's called secure

94
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:03,160
smart I'm not going to be talking too

95
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:04,750
much about the app but I want to show

96
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:06,820
you where all the data came from so I

97
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:09,430
can tell you what the top ten things Mac

98
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:13,180
found in smart homes is number six is to

99
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:16,870
dial to mention essentially we very

100
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:18,430
quickly we provided app customer's

101
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:21,450
download that they use it on their

102
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:23,400
telephone identifies devices and know

103
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:24,930
it doesn't use any map and we had to

104
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,520
build something a bit more unique to

105
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:27,990
actually find things and map actually is

106
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:30,539
not very good at finding devices on the

107
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:33,090
network would you believe and it

108
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:37,680
provides results as you can see this is

109
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:39,419
actually my home here net gear GS 74 is

110
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,370
absolutely terrible bit of equipment

111
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:43,260
with loads of Stevie's probably best not

112
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:45,060
to have in the home and the idea being

113
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:46,260
is that consumer to run this and you get

114
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:48,420
an idea about what's good and bad

115
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:50,250
actually in your home and you get some

116
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:52,020
advice and guidance about what actually

117
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:53,970
you're going to do next and it's written

118
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:56,190
in such a way that the normal consumer

119
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:59,130
can use none of you are normal by the

120
00:04:56,190 --> 00:05:01,320
way in that category so do i junk it do

121
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:07,200
I update it where's the manual all that

122
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:10,710
sort of stuff so data the byproduct of

123
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:12,599
this system is that to get free app we

124
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:15,210
ask consumers to consent us just knowing

125
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,930
what what actual devices they have in

126
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:17,909
their home network

127
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:20,010
we don't ask who you are we're not

128
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:22,560
interested in that we simply say if

129
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:23,700
you've got Netgear gs-7 240 and your

130
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:28,320
home would just like to know that you

131
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:30,570
have so oh my god data and you've heard

132
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,380
all those date as the new oil and all

133
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:33,360
that sort of thing

134
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:36,690
data it's not really the new oil data's

135
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:41,790
data is a new petrol with some flammable

136
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:43,410
liquid around so in our data model and

137
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:44,700
this will become important at moma we

138
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:48,060
start going through the top 10 things

139
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:50,250
number 6 and remember each device has

140
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:52,020
what we call a personality the

141
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:55,590
personalities built up from its network

142
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:59,280
fingerprint and also that's behavior so

143
00:05:55,590 --> 00:06:00,359
if you have a samsung smart cooker then

144
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:03,419
it's probably going to be switched on

145
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:04,980
during meal times if you have a set-top

146
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:07,110
box it's probably switched on all the

147
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:10,440
time if it's a child's toy it's probably

148
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:12,780
switched on when the child is actually

149
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:15,780
using it but basically behaviors about

150
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:17,580
the way we use devices fingerprint is

151
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:19,469
about what does it look like and from

152
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:22,440
that we can start working out what the

153
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:25,230
top 10 things in a smart home are so

154
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:26,790
starting off number 10 it's like those

155
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:29,430
things you see on channel 4 later now

156
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:32,090
you just can't stop watching number 10

157
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:36,050
is music devices

158
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:40,880
in the lead is sawn offs they have a

159
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:44,419
great set of hardwired music devices the

160
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:45,620
play play one I think is rocky would

161
00:06:44,419 --> 00:06:47,419
come in at number two with their

162
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:50,060
streaming stick and if you're a UVU

163
00:06:47,419 --> 00:06:52,280
watcher you probably got one which I

164
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:55,039
just rebranded Roku devices and then

165
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:56,780
things like Yamaha and provide musical

166
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:58,159
equipment so if you're jamming you can

167
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:59,380
plug it into a network and do all the

168
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,910
things that you need to do what's

169
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:04,039
properly interesting about this is some

170
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:07,550
of these products do things that you

171
00:07:04,039 --> 00:07:09,979
wouldn't expect and we picked this up in

172
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:14,270
our data with one of these now I've very

173
00:07:09,979 --> 00:07:16,880
badly tried to pixelate the name of this

174
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:18,948
device but it's a high-end audio

175
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:22,789
receiver it's designed to have really

176
00:07:18,949 --> 00:07:24,710
good sound quality from a tee at 4k TV

177
00:07:22,789 --> 00:07:26,930
with all the proper sound system it's a

178
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:28,909
blu-ray player and does a lot of things

179
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:31,009
but the actual model is not important

180
00:07:28,909 --> 00:07:32,690
the manufacturer of this device probably

181
00:07:31,009 --> 00:07:36,759
use the same software across all of them

182
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:38,870
but something interesting your phone and

183
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:40,370
about this and it does some really

184
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:41,960
unusual things so the first thing we did

185
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:43,370
was look at the manual like you should

186
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:47,479
of course we all read the manual don't

187
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:50,750
we now it's a 290 page money and I read

188
00:07:47,479 --> 00:07:52,310
the whole thing I can tell you you plug

189
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:53,930
it into your network and it can get your

190
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:55,610
Spotify list it can do all the sort of

191
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:57,650
things you'd expect it to do is all very

192
00:07:55,610 --> 00:08:00,409
good we know why there's a laptop in

193
00:07:57,650 --> 00:08:02,030
that picture but there is and it's when

194
00:08:00,409 --> 00:08:04,030
you start to look at things like that

195
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:05,869
that are out there in the manual I think

196
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:07,400
these guys have built a network

197
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:10,610
connected device but don't really

198
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:14,479
understand it and it all came about

199
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:16,250
because our scanning product showed that

200
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:18,949
this was actually running a web server

201
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:22,219
port 80 with no authentication and you

202
00:08:18,949 --> 00:08:23,719
may say well who cares I would care if

203
00:08:22,219 --> 00:08:25,520
you turn it up to 11 in the middle of

204
00:08:23,719 --> 00:08:27,680
night and start playing howling noises

205
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:29,359
or whatever through someone's home and

206
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,770
you got to remember that we're talking

207
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,209
about consumers here rather than the

208
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:34,819
corporate marketplace this is where

209
00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:36,520
people live is where we all live you own

210
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:40,279
your home you don't want to feel

211
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:43,900
targeted inside your home interestingly

212
00:08:40,279 --> 00:08:46,120
this particular one had 5 stars

213
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:49,120
what - I'll give somebody a pound that

214
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:52,080
they can find anyone any what - report

215
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:54,700
that has less than the four stars but

216
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:56,200
the interesting of all those pages never

217
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,760
thought to say this had an open web

218
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:59,380
server and it wasn't even clear what it

219
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:04,050
was used for it was just a part of the

220
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:07,450
software package but it was new in 2014

221
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:09,130
when I buy things at home like my fridge

222
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:11,230
and my cooker they last for years and

223
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:12,910
years and years and what our data shows

224
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:15,339
and this will come will reflect this in

225
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:17,980
the talk is that when people buy things

226
00:09:15,339 --> 00:09:22,000
at home and they work really well we

227
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:24,160
just keep them and from a security point

228
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,529
of view things get a bit old

229
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:29,800
will the as battabox say the name of the

230
00:09:26,529 --> 00:09:31,060
manufacturer will the manufacturer build

231
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:33,459
this will they keep that out today

232
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:35,839
actually answers no for this one that

233
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:37,050
firmware hasn't been available for years

234
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:40,270
[Music]

235
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:43,180
number nine casting devices we've all

236
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:47,020
got them that is the original chrome

237
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:51,939
class audio they sold about 50% more

238
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:54,579
chrome crust version - but what's quite

239
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:59,470
interesting is the chrome cast of one

240
00:09:54,580 --> 00:10:02,290
has 69% of the install base now what do

241
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:03,850
I mean by that I'm pretty sure that if

242
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:05,650
you go to Google and say how many

243
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:08,200
chromecast did you sell they're going to

244
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:10,750
say we actually sold more and chromecast

245
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:12,670
audios than we did chromecast version

246
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:14,560
once but because our scanning app is

247
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:16,449
scanning what's actually running in

248
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:18,400
people's hands and not in the top drawer

249
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:20,410
everyone's got stuff in the top drawer

250
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:22,540
bottom drawer filing cabinet of all that

251
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:24,040
old stuff you don't use anymore this is

252
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:25,689
what's actually running this is what

253
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:28,060
becomes important because when you talk

254
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:30,339
about the attack surface of a smart home

255
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:32,290
it's what's running today not what's

256
00:10:30,339 --> 00:10:36,120
running what was running yesterday or

257
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:38,349
was switched off and not being used

258
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:40,270
funny enough actually we provide advice

259
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:42,279
and guidance on the chromecast v1

260
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:45,670
because even though it's actually a

261
00:10:42,279 --> 00:10:47,080
really well-built tool great updates and

262
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:49,689
it's a fabulous

263
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:52,570
custom device it does allow users to

264
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:54,230
cast without any authentication and

265
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:55,910
anyone with a child

266
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:58,280
below the age of nine you probably had

267
00:10:55,910 --> 00:11:00,589
chromecast Wars in your home where it's

268
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:02,630
versus you know use versus Peppa Pig or

269
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:05,920
something you know and it keeps being

270
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:07,790
taken over certainly in my home anyway

271
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:09,890
but when you're searching through

272
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:12,050
networks you start to see all sorts of

273
00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:14,150
data and so I thought I'd just open the

274
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:16,520
lid a little bit and what we see so

275
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:18,199
trying to identify devices on a network

276
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:20,780
to really hard anyone who's done that in

277
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:23,690
the corporate environment even with the

278
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:25,699
greatest CMDB it's really really

279
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:27,830
difficult to work out what everything is

280
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:31,310
and for us because we could see we're

281
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:34,730
scanning consumer homes we have to do a

282
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:36,020
reasonable amount of I call it guesswork

283
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:39,200
that there's any investors in the

284
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:41,660
audience we call it machine learning and

285
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,250
so here you go here's an example when

286
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:45,500
you're trying to detect you know what

287
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:47,960
Google's back catalogue is obviously you

288
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:49,700
can see there's a gap there and that's

289
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:51,080
this scoring is the blue numbers down

290
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:53,060
the right-hand side we use a sort of

291
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:54,740
Bayesian scoring probabilistic matching

292
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:57,229
mechanism to work out what things

293
00:11:54,740 --> 00:12:00,020
actually are in this example you can see

294
00:11:57,230 --> 00:12:01,580
the MAC addresses MAC address is just a

295
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:03,380
unique number that's assigned to every

296
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:07,040
networking device and least you hope

297
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:09,170
that's neat and the I Triple E the

298
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:10,880
institution electrical electronic

299
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:13,910
engineers something like that they

300
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:16,100
actually register the Mac block large or

301
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:18,620
so the first three are tests of the MAC

302
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:21,020
address and as a manufacturer you're

303
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:22,400
then permitted to use that MAC address

304
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:25,449
and you can work out how you're number

305
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:28,100
everything in your manufacturing process

306
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:30,470
so always the easy as that sometimes you

307
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:32,420
get things like this so in one network

308
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:34,160
we spotted three consecutive MAC

309
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:37,910
addresses that's like winning the

310
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:39,949
lottery three times over oh I see

311
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:43,160
actually they're fake they're fake MAC

312
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:46,220
addresses VMware as virtual computers

313
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:47,660
and thus basically just a silent its own

314
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:49,280
MAC addresses

315
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:50,750
and VMware will have some sort of

316
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:53,030
knowledge of the network it's in to make

317
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:54,710
sure it doesn't assign to MAC addresses

318
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:57,410
to the same device because if anything

319
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:59,780
happened like that you're in all sorts

320
00:12:57,410 --> 00:13:01,810
of trouble in fact I've got a Nintendo

321
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:05,620
Wii old school with the

322
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:09,489
an Ethernet adapter and it has the MAC

323
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:11,290
address a a BBC seaworld 123 3 so if I

324
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:14,139
had two of them in my network all sorts

325
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:15,248
of chaos would ensue my art table beam

326
00:13:14,139 --> 00:13:18,309
our kids and the things would stop

327
00:13:15,249 --> 00:13:20,309
working and weird in wonderful ways it

328
00:13:18,309 --> 00:13:22,779
was get some other unusual things

329
00:13:20,309 --> 00:13:25,180
private most private that's not a

330
00:13:22,779 --> 00:13:28,689
company I know actually it is if a

331
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:31,959
certain members the audience the private

332
00:13:28,689 --> 00:13:34,149
is where a company has registered with

333
00:13:31,959 --> 00:13:36,638
the I Triple E that they don't want to

334
00:13:34,149 --> 00:13:38,079
be known who they are it's a very

335
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:40,509
strange situation you have to pay a

336
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:44,319
little bit extra to get this one of

337
00:13:40,509 --> 00:13:46,029
those is an Argos tablet 50 pounds Argos

338
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:47,559
tablet tablet God knows why they

339
00:13:46,029 --> 00:13:52,360
bothered spending the extra money to

340
00:13:47,559 --> 00:13:54,730
register as a private company with their

341
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:55,720
with it with the I Triple E and that

342
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:57,819
means that actually these things are

343
00:13:55,720 --> 00:14:00,519
very hard to detect you can clearly see

344
00:13:57,819 --> 00:14:04,029
some from similar manufacturers ten to a

345
00:14:00,519 --> 00:14:06,490
60 it's a manufacturer that we haven't

346
00:14:04,029 --> 00:14:08,379
identified yet I could well be this is

347
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:11,019
test equipment so if you've got a test

348
00:14:08,379 --> 00:14:14,379
lab and you're making the brand new

349
00:14:11,019 --> 00:14:15,699
version of a TV or a Playstation five or

350
00:14:14,379 --> 00:14:18,579
whatever you might register it's private

351
00:14:15,699 --> 00:14:21,839
to begin with and then go on to you know

352
00:14:18,579 --> 00:14:23,979
Sony Entertainment Limited or whatever

353
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:26,649
sometimes just get things like this and

354
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:29,470
that's just not helpful guys get total

355
00:14:26,649 --> 00:14:31,779
fake MAC address isn't anyone use anyone

356
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:33,009
who's haptens an 80 to 1 X network with

357
00:14:31,779 --> 00:14:34,990
network address control in your

358
00:14:33,009 --> 00:14:37,990
corporation when though how easy it is

359
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:39,490
to spoof MAC addresses we actually seen

360
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:43,720
this and we think someone was mucking

361
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:46,480
around with our head so network attached

362
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:48,850
storage it's actually really difficult

363
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:52,559
to detect what is network attached

364
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:56,379
storage in the home so this pie chart

365
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:58,719
wakey-wakey it's after lunch shows the

366
00:14:56,379 --> 00:15:02,350
50% of all a scam networks have either

367
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:04,870
FTP SFTP or SMB running or I should

368
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:07,480
release a SCP running that's what we say

369
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:09,339
is network attached storage it's quite

370
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:10,720
high and I think that's because a lot of

371
00:15:09,339 --> 00:15:12,970
people don't actually realize they're

372
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:14,530
running it so we

373
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:18,940
where there is network attached storage

374
00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:20,500
running a network 40% FTP 53% SMB that's

375
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:22,420
probably your Windows laptops within

376
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:26,830
switched on potentially a network

377
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:29,650
attached storage device and 33% SSH

378
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:30,850
running SCP and so on what gets quite

379
00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:31,300
interesting is we start merging it

380
00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:33,670
together

381
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:36,390
and you start seeing devices that are

382
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:38,709
running all three so two percent of of

383
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:41,260
all network attached storage what we're

384
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:42,670
classifying as nas is actually run all

385
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:46,720
three and that's a bit strange because

386
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:50,650
why would you run FTP and SSH together

387
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:53,470
or why'd you run SSH and SMB it's not

388
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:55,390
always absolutely clear we think most

389
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:57,190
consumers don't realize and just got

390
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:59,080
ticked all the boxes and let this thing

391
00:15:57,190 --> 00:16:00,640
this these things are all completely

392
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:02,350
open and of course two of those

393
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:05,199
protocols are in clear text and

394
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:07,390
certainly old SMB which is Windows File

395
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:10,360
Sharing for those don't know she will

396
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:15,189
transmit passwords or the hashes of

397
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:17,890
passwords in the clear broadcasting now

398
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:20,530
of those there's different types of ways

399
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:22,960
of detecting things in a home network so

400
00:16:20,530 --> 00:16:24,339
obviously finding FTPS cessation SMB you

401
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:26,530
can look at what ports are open on a

402
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:29,260
device start to learn about that device

403
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:31,510
but also some devices you do the

404
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:33,610
equivalent of hey who's got SMB on the

405
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:35,170
network and then 6% of them will come

406
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:37,390
back and say hey I've got something by

407
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:39,250
the way here's all the information in

408
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:44,560
order to connect and this is using

409
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:46,270
protocols like mdns mdns is like a it's

410
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:48,130
like a handy helper in the network it's

411
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:49,840
trying to help you configure things so

412
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:51,880
you have a mobile app that needs to

413
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:53,650
connect to something then the device

414
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:57,010
itself will say hey this is how you

415
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:58,480
connect to me again great for hacking

416
00:16:57,010 --> 00:17:01,450
networks if you're into that sort of

417
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,440
thing because you no longer if you did

418
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:04,180
the port scan

419
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:05,980
typically you'll be picked up as a port

420
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:07,780
scan and blocked by any sensible

421
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:09,490
networking equipment but if you use

422
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:11,109
broadcast addressing everything just

423
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:12,819
tells you what it is you don't even need

424
00:17:11,109 --> 00:17:13,179
to do any work and we like that we're

425
00:17:12,819 --> 00:17:17,920
lazy

426
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:19,650
oh yeah security conference you can't

427
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:23,589
put a black arm on a black background

428
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:25,020
rather this black arm on ours we seek

429
00:17:23,589 --> 00:17:28,740
few of these it's not

430
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:30,990
massively we don't see huge numbers of

431
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:33,060
these running across the world but there

432
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:36,390
are a number and they have turn there's

433
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:38,669
a really bad CV so a CV is a common

434
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:39,930
vulnerability exposure we've talked a

435
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:42,180
little bit about that this morning some

436
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:45,870
the other talks they have a score

437
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:47,820
associated them called the CBS s common

438
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:49,919
vulnerability scoring system essentially

439
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:52,050
if you've got a 10.0 it means that

440
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:53,280
device is going to get totally owned it

441
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:54,960
means it can be owned as an

442
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:57,330
administrative access from a network

443
00:17:54,960 --> 00:18:00,770
without any physical access to the

444
00:17:57,330 --> 00:18:03,780
device that's during all your files a

445
00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:06,570
lot of the older this is this particular

446
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:08,490
black arm on ours is from about 2012

447
00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:10,409
2013 but people are still running them

448
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:14,340
today because they still work it's in

449
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:16,860
the home it's not like a corporate Sam

450
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:21,590
policy or storage policy where you you

451
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:21,590
recycle and devices of a period of time

452
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:27,840
but I've got perimeter security

453
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:29,460
now this starting to think my way my

454
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,929
notice is interesting so what we're

455
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:33,000
saying here is homes that almost like

456
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:35,520
our workplaces where a few years ago

457
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:38,580
quite a technically thick outer shell

458
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:40,110
soft machine interior it's going to be

459
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:42,720
no excuse we'll talk a bit all about

460
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:45,300
that later so number seven home

461
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:47,670
automation my favorite for any of you

462
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:50,010
who have not seen mr. robot this is at

463
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:52,560
the beginning of series two where the

464
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:55,379
hacker group F society I've got the

465
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:58,200
t-shirt are trying to hack into this

466
00:18:55,380 --> 00:19:00,750
fancy flyer that has full automation

467
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:03,360
blinds the garage door the lights the

468
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:06,120
media center and cooker hot water

469
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:09,149
everything and they are taking over this

470
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:12,300
lady's house and basically she's on the

471
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:13,620
phone to clearly whoever had provided

472
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:17,280
those equipment she says what am I

473
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:19,679
supposed to do um plug what but

474
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:21,300
everything's inside the walls that's how

475
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:24,420
it was when I install I bought the home

476
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:29,360
pocket and we've seen a bit of this with

477
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:31,740
home automation the first version of the

478
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:34,199
Honeywell Honeywell controllers or

479
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:36,030
central heating had a pretty serious bug

480
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:38,080
with and I've seen no way of updating

481
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:40,600
anything well it's not that expensive

482
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:42,189
just replace it and anything well I've

483
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:44,080
got to call out a heating engineer have

484
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:45,130
no heating no hot water whilst they do

485
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:47,199
that and then I've got to make a

486
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:50,920
decision whilst the thing is broken

487
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:52,660
about whether my can heat my family I'll

488
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:54,549
move out the house so these things have

489
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:59,559
quite big ramifications in the world of

490
00:19:54,549 --> 00:20:02,410
of home automation the marketplace in

491
00:19:59,559 --> 00:20:04,299
terms of what we see running today is

492
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:06,970
roughly that with a bigger the circle

493
00:20:04,299 --> 00:20:09,970
the more we see of them these are the

494
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:11,200
big guys must have had some problems and

495
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:12,850
in fact they've all had problems in the

496
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:14,410
past pretty much now fixed there but

497
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:16,120
they've got big companies behind them

498
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:19,270
most of them have good disclosure

499
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:21,189
processes and they have pen tests being

500
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:24,309
operated but interestingly they've all

501
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:25,929
had problems the nest one was because

502
00:20:24,309 --> 00:20:27,010
people were guessing passwords but also

503
00:20:25,929 --> 00:20:30,669
they had some problems of the nest

504
00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:33,790
cameras where there's the crack kr ACK

505
00:20:30,669 --> 00:20:36,429
hack on them and there's a few other

506
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:38,740
bits and pieces we don't see so many

507
00:20:36,429 --> 00:20:40,630
light wave systems because all you

508
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:42,850
really see is the hub and lightwei it

509
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:44,080
means a radiofrequency light wave RF to

510
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:46,330
them to connect out to all your light

511
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:49,570
switches and so on an interesting new

512
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:52,360
entrant into the arena's IKEA IKEA has a

513
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:53,590
25-pound home so a hub thing and it's

514
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:55,629
really interesting how what the play is

515
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:57,459
going to be there are they going to

516
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:58,630
start moving into the home automation so

517
00:20:57,460 --> 00:21:00,370
you just pick up your home automation

518
00:20:58,630 --> 00:21:02,230
stuff when you go to buy wooden

519
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:04,510
furniture I don't know it looks like

520
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:07,600
it's going to be that way but Philips

521
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:10,030
our nests are really you know we see a

522
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:14,020
lot of these actually running today in

523
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:18,970
in networks not I'm good like that I'm

524
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:21,580
not this fellow this we saw this in

525
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:24,490
Berlin at the ephah show which is like

526
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:25,809
CES for Europe it's an enormous

527
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:28,809
conference where they show off all the

528
00:21:25,809 --> 00:21:30,940
latest devices and this is Mikey and

529
00:21:28,809 --> 00:21:36,280
this is a consortium that's been led by

530
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:38,290
Siemens who showed off this new device

531
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:40,810
that basically would interpret your

532
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:42,250
fridge cooker and you kitchenware type

533
00:21:40,810 --> 00:21:44,679
devices and the sort of questions you

534
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:45,160
could ask is based on what I have in my

535
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:47,310
fridge

536
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:49,900
what can I cook for myself tonight and

537
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:52,419
this but the scariest thing about Mikey

538
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:53,650
is that the head arrangement had a sort

539
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:55,750
of because obviously it's winking at us

540
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:58,150
in that right-hand picture but had a

541
00:21:55,750 --> 00:22:00,160
whole set of facial expressions and as

542
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:04,440
you walk past Mikey the head would turn

543
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:08,530
around and face you pretty scary stuff

544
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:13,350
so scary that when I tried to buy one it

545
00:22:08,530 --> 00:22:13,350
never made it to market thank the Lord

546
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:18,190
number six to remember it's just too

547
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:21,610
tough now we're going to cover number

548
00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:24,970
six number six they are the ancients of

549
00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:26,500
home networking they old-school the very

550
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:29,110
first things that were connected to home

551
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:32,320
networks and these are the printers

552
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:34,209
their printers printers are great I love

553
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:35,590
printers print is just you just connect

554
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:37,600
them they print whatever you tell em to

555
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:41,949
print you don't ask you for anything it

556
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:43,449
just print it also a really easy to spot

557
00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:45,610
using network scanning techniques

558
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:47,020
because they tell you everything taking

559
00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:49,030
all sorts of information there is some

560
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:51,400
MD and s scans here where there Rick or

561
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:53,050
which is a color that's Africa is quite

562
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:55,390
a big sort of multifunction printer that

563
00:22:53,050 --> 00:22:57,190
someone's got but interestingly that's

564
00:22:55,390 --> 00:23:00,430
the red oblong on the right hand side

565
00:22:57,190 --> 00:23:02,950
actually has a serial number which it

566
00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:04,750
presents to you for free when you ask

567
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:06,820
for it to a broadcast tell me everything

568
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:09,400
about a PDL data stream you can have my

569
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:10,960
serial number and the serial numbers all

570
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:12,820
you need to register that Rick at

571
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:14,110
records website and then you can start

572
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:15,580
doing all sorts of things you can take

573
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:17,590
control of the printer because it has a

574
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:19,929
clouds function to it you can start

575
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:21,550
ordering lots of new toner and you can

576
00:23:19,930 --> 00:23:25,300
reject print jobs you can make it do

577
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:27,580
things other little things like the

578
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:32,710
bottom one that HP Envy which is a sort

579
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:35,770
of a home class printer re displays its

580
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:37,780
MAC address in mdns where at the moment

581
00:23:35,770 --> 00:23:39,100
isn't such a big deal because you've got

582
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:40,750
the MAC address anyway if you're on the

583
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:42,969
network but if you're using sort of

584
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:45,280
modern Apple iOS devices that prevent

585
00:23:42,970 --> 00:23:47,440
you over have been able to scan Network

586
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:49,299
Sookie she didn't know Apple change the

587
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:51,190
rules on iOS about two years ago and

588
00:23:49,299 --> 00:23:54,160
said that we're no longer to allow any

589
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:57,809
application to scan networks except for

590
00:23:54,160 --> 00:24:00,820
their own which you have to pay for so

591
00:23:57,809 --> 00:24:02,410
tools like ours and like faying and like

592
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:05,678
some of the other networks gaming

593
00:24:02,410 --> 00:24:07,750
products simply don't work on Apple iOS

594
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:09,220
anymore but you can still get the

595
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:10,530
information because things like printers

596
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:13,270
are giving you that information

597
00:24:10,530 --> 00:24:17,730
you also get some interesting things so

598
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:20,289
the middle to there it says HP Envy 5530

599
00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:22,299
act simons iMac and that's because

600
00:24:20,289 --> 00:24:24,990
they've connected in a USB printer into

601
00:24:22,299 --> 00:24:28,389
a I mark in this case and it's Murray

602
00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:32,230
and the computers acting as their server

603
00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:34,480
for the for the for the printer that got

604
00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:35,980
me thinking so did a quick search just

605
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:38,350
the other evening across our database

606
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:44,549
and we found hundreds and hundreds of

607
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:46,658
these so broadcast network scanning your

608
00:24:44,549 --> 00:24:49,030
devices start telling the world about

609
00:24:46,659 --> 00:24:50,620
who they are and in this case quite a

610
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:52,928
lot of people like to for some reason

611
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:54,939
when the Apple device like to put their

612
00:24:52,929 --> 00:24:57,640
name on it so here it belongs to and

613
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:59,620
Apple are quite happy to tell everyone

614
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:01,870
who that name is so in your home it's

615
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:03,399
not such a big deal but outside if

616
00:25:01,870 --> 00:25:06,158
you're in the airport lounge or if

617
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:07,419
you're browsing from public Wi-Fi then

618
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:08,890
people can start building up this

619
00:25:07,419 --> 00:25:11,200
picture about you and I'm hoping that

620
00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:13,570
you start to see that the information

621
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:15,490
that we use for home scanning Keys be

622
00:25:13,570 --> 00:25:17,020
equally applied to public networks to

623
00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:21,429
your corporate networks your academic

624
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:22,929
network at university and by the way

625
00:25:21,429 --> 00:25:26,380
people put their full names and they say

626
00:25:22,929 --> 00:25:28,270
Joe I just redacted that just in case is

627
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:30,159
very small likelihood Joe's in this

628
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:34,950
audience and my luck sometimes works

629
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:37,570
like that but yeah toys and games

630
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:40,390
you remember Ken Monroe at previous

631
00:25:37,570 --> 00:25:42,220
conferences was talking about my friend

632
00:25:40,390 --> 00:25:42,669
Kayla and a view robot and that sort of

633
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:48,340
thing

634
00:25:42,669 --> 00:25:51,010
I think actually what happened was that

635
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:53,649
this started to change the way the

636
00:25:51,010 --> 00:25:55,210
industry works and we've actually we

637
00:25:53,650 --> 00:25:55,690
worked with a company called whale stuff

638
00:25:55,210 --> 00:25:57,460
and

639
00:25:55,690 --> 00:25:59,500
I've never heard of well stuff I buy

640
00:25:57,460 --> 00:26:02,350
toys for my kids while stuff the third

641
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:04,960
biggest designer manufacturer of toys

642
00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:06,908
and they did Toys Science Museum sorts

643
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:08,320
of really cool stuff and we've been

644
00:26:06,909 --> 00:26:11,409
talking to them about sort of compliance

645
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:13,029
package for for toys making sure that

646
00:26:11,409 --> 00:26:14,590
they're safe and they meet the same

647
00:26:13,029 --> 00:26:17,320
criteria we would have on corporate

648
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:19,539
assets in the company Network and really

649
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:21,639
where it works is like this and I think

650
00:26:19,539 --> 00:26:23,470
that some of the the findings for the my

651
00:26:21,639 --> 00:26:25,508
friend Kayla Fiasco a couple years ago

652
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:28,509
is start to change this model and it's

653
00:26:25,509 --> 00:26:29,799
really important to say in any security

654
00:26:28,509 --> 00:26:31,240
problem you have either where there's

655
00:26:29,799 --> 00:26:34,000
home scaling like us or when you're

656
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:36,370
scaling corporate networks say who is

657
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,360
responsible it's actually not clear-cut

658
00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:39,610
of the toy industry

659
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:40,990
you got retailers the person who sold

660
00:26:39,610 --> 00:26:43,570
you I don't care

661
00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:45,250
they sold it to you the distributors do

662
00:26:43,570 --> 00:26:47,649
have it insurance bar in the case things

663
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:51,100
is set on fire or choking hazards for

664
00:26:47,649 --> 00:26:52,989
toys but not really responsible for

665
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:55,000
firmware updates or for keeping things

666
00:26:52,990 --> 00:26:57,279
fresh or from being able to handle

667
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:59,649
disclosure events she go back to the toy

668
00:26:57,279 --> 00:27:01,509
designers and toy designs really

669
00:26:59,649 --> 00:27:04,299
interesting because basically right

670
00:27:01,509 --> 00:27:06,250
today they are not designing toys for

671
00:27:04,299 --> 00:27:07,929
this Christmas all the Christmas after

672
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:10,539
right now they're designing the toys

673
00:27:07,929 --> 00:27:13,509
that we will see in our stockings in

674
00:27:10,539 --> 00:27:16,509
2021 so they're looking very far ahead

675
00:27:13,509 --> 00:27:21,370
so by the time that you buy that toy or

676
00:27:16,509 --> 00:27:22,840
Santa delivers it do we know there would

677
00:27:21,370 --> 00:27:24,580
be nobody there to be able to answer the

678
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:26,049
question to be to deal with a disclosure

679
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:28,809
to be able to update the firmware

680
00:27:26,049 --> 00:27:30,639
they're long gone and really when you

681
00:27:28,809 --> 00:27:31,899
start to say well okay I don't really

682
00:27:30,639 --> 00:27:34,029
know who's responsible who's going to

683
00:27:31,899 --> 00:27:36,668
have the biggest loss you look at the

684
00:27:34,029 --> 00:27:38,529
licenses and the license or so who

685
00:27:36,669 --> 00:27:41,919
really rule the industry in the toy in

686
00:27:38,529 --> 00:27:45,610
the toy industry they are the you know

687
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:48,460
Barbie from Mattel and the Pixar and

688
00:27:45,610 --> 00:27:49,689
Disney with a few exceptions like Lego

689
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:52,450
and matchbox and some of the other

690
00:27:49,690 --> 00:27:55,120
brands as well but the licenses hold all

691
00:27:52,450 --> 00:27:57,879
the way and they will massively lose

692
00:27:55,120 --> 00:28:00,250
imagine if the my friend Kayla door was

693
00:27:57,879 --> 00:28:02,290
a well known and well

694
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:04,720
his Brown like action man or Barbie or

695
00:28:02,290 --> 00:28:07,930
whatever it would have crucified them

696
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:11,770
the accountant over the name of the

697
00:28:07,930 --> 00:28:13,390
company that the of my friend Kate I

698
00:28:11,770 --> 00:28:15,010
think was called that Mediacom or

699
00:28:13,390 --> 00:28:16,960
something like that I can't remember but

700
00:28:15,010 --> 00:28:18,400
they had a thousand people working for

701
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:21,100
them there's a hundred million dollar

702
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:22,990
enterprise that no longer exists but the

703
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:25,629
license wars are a fact of a hundred

704
00:28:22,990 --> 00:28:26,920
bigger than that so there's been a bit

705
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:30,700
of an ease and and what you'll see today

706
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:31,420
is a lot of the toys and games that are

707
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:33,850
smart

708
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:35,230
typically a Bluetooth connected and

709
00:28:33,850 --> 00:28:37,980
connected through another device as a

710
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:41,170
proxy device so we don't see very many

711
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:44,530
in our scanning database we don't see so

712
00:28:41,170 --> 00:28:45,670
many directly connected devices but

713
00:28:44,530 --> 00:28:47,830
we're working with the next generation

714
00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:49,690
of toys which are absolutely brilliant

715
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:52,810
I can't tell anything about that I've

716
00:28:49,690 --> 00:28:55,210
sworn to secrecy we do see Playstations

717
00:28:52,810 --> 00:28:58,060
Xboxes and the odd Nintendo that's

718
00:28:55,210 --> 00:28:59,980
connected it what's quite interesting is

719
00:28:58,060 --> 00:29:02,460
we see a lot more PlayStation 4s than

720
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:05,590
anything else that's largely because

721
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:06,850
they're switched on all the time even

722
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:10,260
when you switch them off they keep the

723
00:29:06,850 --> 00:29:13,510
network card running that's quite common

724
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:15,520
amongst other devices such as set-top

725
00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:17,050
boxes and so on and Rob as your home

726
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:18,879
router stays on all the time but some

727
00:29:17,050 --> 00:29:22,360
devices were going to sleep mode Xbox

728
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:25,870
sleeps from time to time so we see Xbox

729
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:28,090
is when they're switched on mostly Xbox

730
00:29:25,870 --> 00:29:31,780
one rather than some of the older

731
00:29:28,090 --> 00:29:34,209
versions PlayStation 3s have got

732
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:36,100
Seavey's against them there's not a lot

733
00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:40,510
of people knew which I don't think have

734
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:43,270
been fixed number for TVs and set-top

735
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:47,920
boxes I hope you like my Amazon bar

736
00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:50,050
graph amazon reached the UK europe after

737
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:54,870
they after a while it took a few years

738
00:29:50,050 --> 00:29:56,889
before they launched here so our

739
00:29:54,870 --> 00:29:57,459
database shows things are actually

740
00:29:56,890 --> 00:30:00,460
running today

741
00:29:57,460 --> 00:30:03,790
the first product the TV cube and the

742
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:06,820
tvs fire TV were mostly launched and

743
00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:08,560
mostly used by customers in the USA I'm

744
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:10,139
sure there's a few early adopters here

745
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:14,879
that might have bought one

746
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:17,790
so the fire TV sticks 1 & 2 Maithili

747
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:20,370
massively outnumber those but again it's

748
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:22,920
kind of like the chromecast you've got

749
00:30:20,370 --> 00:30:24,959
the older version of the device has way

750
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:26,370
more actually out there so if you start

751
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:29,490
looking about the attack surface of

752
00:30:26,370 --> 00:30:32,459
Amazon TV sticks so I fire TV sticks

753
00:30:29,490 --> 00:30:34,950
it's more the old version than the new

754
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:37,830
version even if someone says put mine my

755
00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:39,090
device tidy up today is past what about

756
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:39,360
the old versions they're still running

757
00:30:39,090 --> 00:30:44,100
today

758
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:45,990
so what's the responsibility for the for

759
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:48,510
the whoever's maintaining these devices

760
00:30:45,990 --> 00:30:49,740
to be able to stay with them because at

761
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:52,080
the end of the day there's not much in

762
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:54,720
terms of regulation for maintaining

763
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:57,120
things once we've bought them just for

764
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:58,860
interests sake that's about I said this

765
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:00,899
is a bar graph of things were actually

766
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:04,500
running all types of chromecast are

767
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:07,620
vastly we have vastly more running

768
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:09,450
instances of fire Amazon fire stuff then

769
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:11,699
Google chromecast I know that they're

770
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:12,900
not quite both casting devices they do

771
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:16,770
slightly different things but just for

772
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:21,809
interest sig but that's not the only

773
00:31:16,770 --> 00:31:24,990
thing that can run media streams set-top

774
00:31:21,809 --> 00:31:27,290
boxes and TVs right so we could wake

775
00:31:24,990 --> 00:31:29,160
your hands up who connects their TV

776
00:31:27,290 --> 00:31:33,360
directly to the internet through Wi-Fi

777
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:35,760
or Ethernet okay you will spread out and

778
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:37,770
I can sort of see is about quarter who

779
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:42,990
connects a set-top box whether it's a

780
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:44,760
skybox a human or a year view right it's

781
00:31:42,990 --> 00:31:46,650
kind of 50/50 that's kind of ruined my

782
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:49,110
whole slide so thanks for that she

783
00:31:46,650 --> 00:31:51,870
didn't pay more attention we actually

784
00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:53,399
see three times the amount of running

785
00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:56,668
set-top boxes than we do

786
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:58,110
televisions although there's a Wii we

787
00:31:56,669 --> 00:31:59,429
accept that we've gotta do some work on

788
00:31:58,110 --> 00:32:00,809
there and that's probably cuz the TVs

789
00:31:59,429 --> 00:32:02,820
weren't all switched on at the time

790
00:32:00,809 --> 00:32:05,399
whereas a set-top box has to be switched

791
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:07,918
on for its PVR capabilities to write a

792
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:09,270
view program EastEnders at 7:30 it has

793
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:14,520
to be switched on and ready to beam to

794
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:16,260
record across the world we see B BSkyB

795
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:17,850
or skyboxes but they come in various

796
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:19,570
flavors the Australian ones show up

797
00:32:17,850 --> 00:32:21,639
exactly the same

798
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:25,149
when we look at them in and I using our

799
00:32:21,639 --> 00:32:26,590
scanning techniques to the UK ones I

800
00:32:25,149 --> 00:32:29,289
guess it's the same company behind the

801
00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:31,178
scenes pace and eros and a few others

802
00:32:29,289 --> 00:32:33,340
manufacture the devices on behalf of sky

803
00:32:31,179 --> 00:32:37,119
so we see the same sort of things you

804
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:41,019
see Hume axes which is replacement

805
00:32:37,119 --> 00:32:43,228
satellite boxes ISP TV is sort of like

806
00:32:41,019 --> 00:32:45,249
this seems to be a whole bunch of new

807
00:32:43,229 --> 00:32:48,580
ISPs particularly in Europe that are

808
00:32:45,249 --> 00:32:50,259
packaging TV deals with your so if

809
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:51,340
you're a sky customer virgin to me that

810
00:32:50,259 --> 00:32:53,440
you've probably got this you probably

811
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:59,519
get some sort of media packet or an

812
00:32:53,440 --> 00:33:01,869
extra box that gets plugged in I'm Cody

813
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:04,090
seven runs cozy but doesn't tell anyone

814
00:33:01,869 --> 00:33:06,099
but Cody we actually begin to take Cody

815
00:33:04,090 --> 00:33:10,209
running on raspberry PI's or whatever

816
00:33:06,099 --> 00:33:13,479
people are running on that's obviously

817
00:33:10,210 --> 00:33:14,739
part of our our poster say to consumers

818
00:33:13,479 --> 00:33:15,849
give them advice and divers if

819
00:33:14,739 --> 00:33:17,169
something's not quite good doesn't mean

820
00:33:15,849 --> 00:33:19,450
there's just a vulnerability you could

821
00:33:17,169 --> 00:33:22,450
say actually this particular device can

822
00:33:19,450 --> 00:33:25,359
go on fire and there was a there's a

823
00:33:22,450 --> 00:33:27,549
database that there's that's curated I

824
00:33:25,359 --> 00:33:29,080
think by the DCMS department culture me

825
00:33:27,549 --> 00:33:33,700
the sport that says anything that has a

826
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:35,080
hazard and that particular Cody box had

827
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:36,789
some sort of fire has another I would

828
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:38,349
warn that the Sun isn't a great thing to

829
00:33:36,789 --> 00:33:41,200
sight that's the first way I could find

830
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:43,149
on Google and also this was actually

831
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:44,200
written by the anti-piracy Alliance so

832
00:33:43,149 --> 00:33:47,109
they might have had some skin in the

833
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:48,820
game about this particular article but

834
00:33:47,109 --> 00:33:50,349
that's the cool thing about identifying

835
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:52,239
devices on the network suddenly you can

836
00:33:50,349 --> 00:33:53,649
start to work out things like hey how

837
00:33:52,239 --> 00:33:54,099
much power has been consumed how much is

838
00:33:53,649 --> 00:33:55,539
it worth

839
00:33:54,099 --> 00:33:57,220
you know what could you replace it with

840
00:33:55,539 --> 00:33:59,889
what vulnerabilities that are either

841
00:33:57,220 --> 00:34:01,539
going to go on fire that's okay because

842
00:33:59,889 --> 00:34:03,340
I don't run a set-top boxes I plugged my

843
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:07,389
TV directly into the Internet so I'm

844
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:09,159
safe actually I'm not my TV listens to

845
00:34:07,389 --> 00:34:12,969
me it's the only thing that listens to

846
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:14,530
me I think this was actually mentioned

847
00:34:12,969 --> 00:34:17,319
in one of the earlier things I won't go

848
00:34:14,530 --> 00:34:19,329
too much into it but Samsung on page 129

849
00:34:17,319 --> 00:34:21,190
of their license terms and conditions

850
00:34:19,329 --> 00:34:23,679
said don't have private conversations in

851
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:26,049
front of your TV all I can say is that

852
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:27,579
in my house some poor bloke in Samsung

853
00:34:26,049 --> 00:34:29,210
must be thinking what on earth is going

854
00:34:27,579 --> 00:34:32,460
on in there

855
00:34:29,210 --> 00:34:33,960
but how does a consumer know this what's

856
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:36,120
who's telling them this you can get some

857
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:39,679
exciting rapport and BBC news or in the

858
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:41,609
Sun or whatever but really you know it's

859
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:46,850
there's no one really looking out for

860
00:34:41,610 --> 00:34:49,230
the consumer they ask good three

861
00:34:46,850 --> 00:34:50,400
SmartPlug so we're getting into the top

862
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:51,780
three here this is where it gets

863
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:53,120
exciting I bet you're guessing wonder

864
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:57,540
what number one is

865
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:59,750
okay I did a bit of research on smart

866
00:34:57,540 --> 00:35:01,920
folks this is the smart plug in my house

867
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:03,420
apologies the pictures a bit day I

868
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:06,960
didn't clean up before take the picture

869
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:08,760
I could never really work out how these

870
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:10,890
things work because I can't use my phone

871
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:11,910
which is not connected to my Wi-Fi push

872
00:35:10,890 --> 00:35:14,339
the battery and the light would

873
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:16,379
immediately come on how can it go that

874
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:17,610
fast I've built big and price systems

875
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:19,680
before unusually there's some sort of

876
00:35:17,610 --> 00:35:21,110
latency and in such an on-off on-off I

877
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:23,730
could do it from here

878
00:35:21,110 --> 00:35:26,910
it's not how enough does this work so

879
00:35:23,730 --> 00:35:30,780
rewiring my home a little and using some

880
00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:32,399
wires art this is how it works what they

881
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:34,800
do is when they power up they send a DNS

882
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:37,880
query outside of your network to a

883
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:40,800
specific DNS server on the in the cloud

884
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:43,350
that then responds with the details of

885
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:46,080
an AWS winter server now I actually

886
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:50,009
bought this plug it came free with a an

887
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:51,540
Amazon I paused there because I can't

888
00:35:50,010 --> 00:35:53,610
say the word Alexa in my home because

889
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:57,240
suddenly she wakes up and see I just

890
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:59,040
called it as she we have big arguments

891
00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:02,100
and the favorite thing in our houses

892
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:04,800
Alexa stop and bet it came free with an

893
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:06,990
Amazon echo device voice assistant voice

894
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:09,000
assistant speaker and I've always since

895
00:36:06,990 --> 00:36:10,589
ever watching Star Trek is a youngster

896
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,720
always what a debate to make my lights

897
00:36:10,590 --> 00:36:13,920
to come on for a voice command it's a

898
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:15,899
thing a wired it

899
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:17,190
and this plug came basically free I

900
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:17,660
think you could buy them for less than a

901
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:21,300
fiver

902
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:23,370
so the cloud responds that so the dinner

903
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:26,100
service bonds with the details on AWS

904
00:36:23,370 --> 00:36:27,569
rent a server and this is not Amazon

905
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:29,700
that the branded I think this one was

906
00:36:27,570 --> 00:36:31,650
called long back subject it then makes

907
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:34,470
our long live TCP connection out to that

908
00:36:31,650 --> 00:36:36,750
server it just stays on and if you power

909
00:36:34,470 --> 00:36:38,040
off the switch the actual plug itself at

910
00:36:36,750 --> 00:36:39,400
the end just reconnect afterwards it

911
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:42,800
just stays on all the time

912
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:44,210
and that's how it works because when you

913
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:47,030
are then using the app there's a picture

914
00:36:44,210 --> 00:36:48,859
of the app basically what it's doing is

915
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:51,830
it's connecting to the cloud system

916
00:36:48,859 --> 00:36:55,009
which has a long live permanent or

917
00:36:51,830 --> 00:36:57,500
semi-permanent connection to the cloud

918
00:36:55,010 --> 00:37:00,260
and that's how it does it that stuff you

919
00:36:57,500 --> 00:37:02,359
sell to ask a few questions how on earth

920
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:05,780
does the business how does that work in

921
00:37:02,359 --> 00:37:07,430
terms of I got that plug from pretty

922
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:08,840
much free or I could buy it for five

923
00:37:07,430 --> 00:37:10,640
pounds and I've had it for four years

924
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:13,940
already who's paying for that Amazon

925
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:17,060
rent a server is it Amazon maybe because

926
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:19,100
they're selling more Alexa devices who

927
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:20,720
is it and also why is it that when they

928
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:22,609
put that little image on the right was

929
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:24,230
just a screenshot from my phone did a

930
00:37:22,609 --> 00:37:26,119
Google search images on it I found about

931
00:37:24,230 --> 00:37:28,609
50 exactly the same from all different

932
00:37:26,119 --> 00:37:30,140
companies there's something going on

933
00:37:28,609 --> 00:37:32,060
here they don't fully understand and I

934
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:35,240
think that basically there's a b2b play

935
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:37,880
in these these plugs for what I can work

936
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:40,669
out is and this is still to be figured

937
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:42,490
out I think that basically there is some

938
00:37:40,670 --> 00:37:44,900
sort kickback scheme happening or

939
00:37:42,490 --> 00:37:47,029
potentially that plug is telling its

940
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:48,950
lords and masters more about my network

941
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:53,060
than perhaps I know about or I've

942
00:37:48,950 --> 00:37:54,560
consented to but we see quite a few of

943
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:56,690
these we see different ones and

944
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:59,480
obviously this is a generic brand with a

945
00:37:56,690 --> 00:38:01,220
brand you never heard of and there are

946
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:03,440
some bad ones and this and worse ones I

947
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:05,600
imagine - but here's the thing I'm a

948
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:07,580
security perspective right hack that AWS

949
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:09,710
realtor which I now know the name of and

950
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:13,330
let's face it I've never heard of any

951
00:38:09,710 --> 00:38:13,330
Amazon servers ever been hacked

952
00:38:13,790 --> 00:38:17,390
I could have control of all this power

953
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:20,270
across the energy grid I could switch

954
00:38:17,390 --> 00:38:22,279
things on and off I can I could burn

955
00:38:20,270 --> 00:38:24,440
down a nuclear power plant where I

956
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:25,730
couldn't but you know you can have a

957
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:27,800
sort of critical national infrastructure

958
00:38:25,730 --> 00:38:31,609
problem if you kid across the world as

959
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:32,990
well so really interesting and I think

960
00:38:31,609 --> 00:38:34,970
there's a long way to go

961
00:38:32,990 --> 00:38:36,229
I'm fully expecting that smart plug just

962
00:38:34,970 --> 00:38:39,439
to stop working one day when those

963
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:40,430
Amazon bills stop getting paid it

964
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,960
doesn't tell you that when you buy it

965
00:38:40,430 --> 00:38:44,029
never mentioned anything about

966
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:45,830
protecting out to a another server in

967
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:46,869
order to for it to work of course it

968
00:38:45,830 --> 00:38:50,630
wouldn't

969
00:38:46,869 --> 00:38:54,480
number two CCTV

970
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:57,570
all-seeing eye seems to be they're great

971
00:38:54,480 --> 00:39:00,540
devices in the home network we did some

972
00:38:57,570 --> 00:39:02,730
research last year and presented cyber

973
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:05,430
UK last year and IITs F last year where

974
00:39:02,730 --> 00:39:07,530
we did a correlation of people with CCTV

975
00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:09,750
cameras and firm that will try to work

976
00:39:07,530 --> 00:39:11,820
out average value of their products in

977
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:14,040
their home network and found that people

978
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:16,770
with Apple Mac equipment and more likely

979
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:19,200
to have CCTV equipment but also more

980
00:39:16,770 --> 00:39:22,440
likely to have really bad quality CCTV

981
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:24,600
equipment so your classic security

982
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:25,710
theater so how do you how do you work

983
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:27,750
out what some of these new is well

984
00:39:25,710 --> 00:39:31,290
firstly you look at some protocols like

985
00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:34,070
real time streaming protocol it's a

986
00:39:31,290 --> 00:39:36,570
protocol boy of the 1980s it has

987
00:39:34,070 --> 00:39:40,590
functions such as play fast-forward

988
00:39:36,570 --> 00:39:42,570
rewind record so anyone who's under the

989
00:39:40,590 --> 00:39:45,720
age of 35 has got no idea what I'm

990
00:39:42,570 --> 00:39:49,740
talking about and it's a protocol that

991
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:51,990
has essentially optional security which

992
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:53,850
when I mean optional in most of the

993
00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:55,649
retail products that we see in our in

994
00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:57,930
the homes goes no one's got passwords on

995
00:39:55,650 --> 00:40:00,360
this stuff it's just completely open and

996
00:39:57,930 --> 00:40:02,609
we all we've all heard about showdown we

997
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:04,310
might even hello we peek at showdown dot

998
00:40:02,610 --> 00:40:06,330
are you which is a website that shows

999
00:40:04,310 --> 00:40:09,690
people's cameras and you can see

1000
00:40:06,330 --> 00:40:11,549
people's backyards and or worse but this

1001
00:40:09,690 --> 00:40:13,950
they're just that people have done

1002
00:40:11,550 --> 00:40:15,060
something nutty enough to export or do

1003
00:40:13,950 --> 00:40:17,970
port forwarding through their home

1004
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:19,680
router but inside the home all this data

1005
00:40:17,970 --> 00:40:21,870
is available so if you drop another

1006
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:23,279
device in there that's a bad device or

1007
00:40:21,870 --> 00:40:24,480
it's been hacked to suddenly get access

1008
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:29,010
to all this stuff I've been talking

1009
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:31,350
about so RTSP it's really easy to detect

1010
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:34,590
and to be able to see the video feeds

1011
00:40:31,350 --> 00:40:36,330
and for you it depends what that cameras

1012
00:40:34,590 --> 00:40:38,010
pointing at your risk appetite would be

1013
00:40:36,330 --> 00:40:40,950
different to mine yours may be facing

1014
00:40:38,010 --> 00:40:44,820
the garden mine might be a baby monitor

1015
00:40:40,950 --> 00:40:47,970
which I do care but consumers don't know

1016
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:51,090
this stuff some of the better ones in

1017
00:40:47,970 --> 00:40:53,759
his custom broadcast broadcast

1018
00:40:51,090 --> 00:40:54,720
techniques some use UPN pH and only

1019
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:56,460
gonna cover too much in this

1020
00:40:54,720 --> 00:41:00,359
presentation but operates in a very

1021
00:40:56,460 --> 00:41:01,730
simple way where you say hey you PNP

1022
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:03,470
device determine what you are

1023
00:41:01,730 --> 00:41:04,790
come back with a massive configuration

1024
00:41:03,470 --> 00:41:07,549
including everything you need to connect

1025
00:41:04,790 --> 00:41:10,400
to them coming similar to mdns and axis

1026
00:41:07,550 --> 00:41:12,730
which are mainly of a major manufacturer

1027
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:15,859
of CCTV cameras mostly for the corporate

1028
00:41:12,730 --> 00:41:20,960
marketplace do this properly obviously

1029
00:41:15,859 --> 00:41:24,170
and they use mdns oh damn oh there we go

1030
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:26,210
some run HTTP service I like the one

1031
00:41:24,170 --> 00:41:28,100
called Nets of Bay loans they start to

1032
00:41:26,210 --> 00:41:31,970
work out these HTTP servers tend to be

1033
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:34,790
HTTP and not HTTP allows you change the

1034
00:41:31,970 --> 00:41:36,290
Umrah point tilt zoom and do all sorts

1035
00:41:34,790 --> 00:41:38,840
of things with people's cameras there

1036
00:41:36,290 --> 00:41:40,160
should you wish but there's always one

1037
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:41,690
isn't there's always somebody it was

1038
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:44,089
ooofff top 10 never build your own

1039
00:41:41,690 --> 00:41:45,650
security where we find we found one

1040
00:41:44,090 --> 00:41:47,270
actually a CCTV camera that somebody

1041
00:41:45,650 --> 00:41:51,369
created and put together properly and is

1042
00:41:47,270 --> 00:41:57,740
still running the basic is through

1043
00:41:51,369 --> 00:41:59,570
fantastic these are just not reading

1044
00:41:57,740 --> 00:42:01,970
there to look for the red dots this is

1045
00:41:59,570 --> 00:42:05,119
just some CVS from there very handy

1046
00:42:01,970 --> 00:42:07,220
website CVE details comm we looked up to

1047
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:09,050
three manufacturers and these are

1048
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:11,390
reasonably big manufacturers we see call

1049
00:42:09,050 --> 00:42:13,940
out from across the across various smart

1050
00:42:11,390 --> 00:42:15,170
homes just count the red blobs the three

1051
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:17,210
at the bottom and one of the ones in the

1052
00:42:15,170 --> 00:42:21,410
middle is a 10.0 and I was totally

1053
00:42:17,210 --> 00:42:24,050
earned these ones were mostly code

1054
00:42:21,410 --> 00:42:25,670
execution and vulnerabilities if you

1055
00:42:24,050 --> 00:42:28,520
remember mirror mirror I took advantage

1056
00:42:25,670 --> 00:42:30,800
of this and was able to install its own

1057
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:33,080
firmware and then be part of a bot and

1058
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:35,480
of course CCTV cameras are great they've

1059
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:37,580
got some attributes they've got big CPUs

1060
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:40,970
because they're running 4k video they've

1061
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:42,319
got amazing network interfaces and very

1062
00:42:40,970 --> 00:42:46,450
handy if you want to denial-of-service

1063
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:49,880
crabs on security as it turned out so

1064
00:42:46,450 --> 00:42:51,710
these worms go back just a couple of

1065
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:53,420
years for three magnified remember

1066
00:42:51,710 --> 00:42:55,730
imagine what it's like for all the CC

1067
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:58,160
devices that are not even in they missed

1068
00:42:55,730 --> 00:43:01,250
national vulnerability database with all

1069
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:03,549
the other CVS and another finally from

1070
00:43:01,250 --> 00:43:06,410
this and take takers away is that the

1071
00:43:03,550 --> 00:43:11,470
CVE databases don't really include much

1072
00:43:06,410 --> 00:43:14,970
in the way of home IOT or home devices

1073
00:43:11,470 --> 00:43:17,339
number one the worst device in the home

1074
00:43:14,970 --> 00:43:20,279
is also the one we rely on for security

1075
00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:21,690
home Reuters so whenever you're thinking

1076
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:25,310
about a device think about attack

1077
00:43:21,690 --> 00:43:30,000
surfaces it's just scary to think that

1078
00:43:25,310 --> 00:43:33,180
62% of home users don't have just don't

1079
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:34,680
even run HTTPS it's scarier to think

1080
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:39,149
that 10% of them run teller

1081
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:40,980
I love the ones on 23:23 hey we've run

1082
00:43:39,150 --> 00:43:43,740
out in 23 23 no one will thinkers tell

1083
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:46,650
me but it actually is some of the open

1084
00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:48,930
Mountain protocols like CW MP and a few

1085
00:43:46,650 --> 00:43:50,400
have held up for some weird reason which

1086
00:43:48,930 --> 00:43:53,460
I can only imagine is some sort of

1087
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:55,080
someone scans their workplace I can tell

1088
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:58,800
you have to drink about what people have

1089
00:43:55,080 --> 00:44:01,080
actually scanned but we can also tell

1090
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:03,390
how old things are and this is a graph

1091
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:06,390
that shows the last firmware date for

1092
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:09,000
devices that we see do you think I just

1093
00:44:06,390 --> 00:44:10,650
thought t5 camera you know the quite a

1094
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:13,440
lot of them were patched in 2018 less

1095
00:44:10,650 --> 00:44:16,020
than a year away but this is a this is

1096
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:17,520
about the actual manufacturers if we

1097
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:18,990
look about what's actually running in

1098
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:22,110
people's homes we get a very different

1099
00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:24,180
picture we get that and what's happening

1100
00:44:22,110 --> 00:44:26,100
there is there was a bump in the curb

1101
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:29,359
when a lot of UK cities and towns went

1102
00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:31,410
into ADSL - were given route and so oh

1103
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:35,010
if you look at the area under the graph

1104
00:44:31,410 --> 00:44:37,259
around 2014 to 2016 there's a huge

1105
00:44:35,010 --> 00:44:39,480
number of home routers that were

1106
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:41,670
probably supplied by the ISP that are

1107
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:44,940
just old and not being passed and this

1108
00:44:41,670 --> 00:44:47,340
is the sole security device we have in

1109
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:49,170
the home typically and then if you take

1110
00:44:47,340 --> 00:44:50,430
part the other known categories of

1111
00:44:49,170 --> 00:44:52,050
things have just been talking about and

1112
00:44:50,430 --> 00:44:53,399
all the problems with them you start to

1113
00:44:52,050 --> 00:44:55,200
say well wait a minute we've got a

1114
00:44:53,400 --> 00:45:01,530
problem here so people's homes are

1115
00:44:55,200 --> 00:45:03,000
operating it too much risk security 15

1116
00:45:01,530 --> 00:45:04,380
years ago in companies and most of you

1117
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:07,470
put your hands up see you worked in

1118
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:08,910
companies had these four major problems

1119
00:45:07,470 --> 00:45:10,680
there's reliant and by the way I

1120
00:45:08,910 --> 00:45:11,790
apologize if you're actually facing

1121
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:14,190
these today you've got bigger problems

1122
00:45:11,790 --> 00:45:16,410
in your company if your reliance on

1123
00:45:14,190 --> 00:45:17,460
perimeter security lack of encrypted

1124
00:45:16,410 --> 00:45:19,710
protocols inside the network

1125
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:21,720
unmaintainable outbound connections and

1126
00:45:19,710 --> 00:45:25,200
patching compliance is pretty much

1127
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:26,310
non-existent the problem we see today is

1128
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:30,629
actually

1129
00:45:26,310 --> 00:45:33,890
is also in homes today and there's no

1130
00:45:30,630 --> 00:45:36,000
one there to look out for the consumer

1131
00:45:33,890 --> 00:45:38,100
so thank you hope you enjoyed the

1132
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:40,490
insight into UK homes they've got any

1133
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:40,490
questions

1134
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:53,260
what someone's gonna say what's running

1135
00:45:51,430 --> 00:45:56,339
in my home

1136
00:45:53,260 --> 00:45:56,339
[Music]

1137
00:45:57,779 --> 00:46:03,579
be aware just be aware of what you're

1138
00:46:01,569 --> 00:46:06,969
actually running information is them

1139
00:46:03,579 --> 00:46:09,279
just knowing what you actually have in

1140
00:46:06,969 --> 00:46:10,749
your home is really important and that's

1141
00:46:09,279 --> 00:46:12,099
what our app actually tries to do is

1142
00:46:10,749 --> 00:46:14,379
give the consumer some advice because

1143
00:46:12,099 --> 00:46:15,940
what you want to do with a particular

1144
00:46:14,380 --> 00:46:17,440
bad device in your home will be

1145
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:19,569
different to what I have because we have

1146
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:20,950
different risk appetites you may have

1147
00:46:19,569 --> 00:46:22,269
young children in the home and they

1148
00:46:20,950 --> 00:46:24,160
might have children who've already left

1149
00:46:22,269 --> 00:46:25,660
to go to university or whatever or they

1150
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:27,729
might just a different profile might be

1151
00:46:25,660 --> 00:46:29,618
living in the flat students so the most

1152
00:46:27,729 --> 00:46:32,259
important thing is just knowing and

1153
00:46:29,619 --> 00:46:34,170
being aware of what actually where the

1154
00:46:32,259 --> 00:46:41,140
vulnerabilities are what the risks are

1155
00:46:34,170 --> 00:46:44,440
in your home it's yeah there's a QR code

1156
00:46:41,140 --> 00:46:46,709
it's actually all changed he sprays he's

1157
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:48,819
gone so there's a zoo

1158
00:46:46,709 --> 00:46:51,430
it's all happening here because if you

1159
00:46:48,819 --> 00:46:55,209
put back slide three please top there

1160
00:46:51,430 --> 00:47:01,629
all right here we go click click keep

1161
00:46:55,209 --> 00:47:04,749
them in order ok we go that is the QR

1162
00:47:01,630 --> 00:47:06,609
code for apt is there it's called secure

1163
00:47:04,749 --> 00:47:16,959
smart to search for purple they've a lot

1164
00:47:06,609 --> 00:47:18,759
of purple in our branding yes yeah

1165
00:47:16,959 --> 00:47:20,319
that's right so CBA they're scoring as a

1166
00:47:18,759 --> 00:47:22,539
score of one to ten

1167
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:24,130
obviously a score one to hundred because

1168
00:47:22,539 --> 00:47:26,170
we felt that consumers would work a

1169
00:47:24,130 --> 00:47:28,390
little bit better than that we also use

1170
00:47:26,170 --> 00:47:31,420
some configuration scoring so that if we

1171
00:47:28,390 --> 00:47:33,729
see for example a Rooter with toner on

1172
00:47:31,420 --> 00:47:36,969
it that would get points deducted from

1173
00:47:33,729 --> 00:47:39,519
over and above any CVS so for example

1174
00:47:36,969 --> 00:47:42,640
the Netgear GS 74 had two CVS rated at

1175
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:43,959
7.8 but also had open toner and just

1176
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:46,359
basically everything wrong with it and

1177
00:47:43,959 --> 00:47:47,410
so it's called a really barb zero and

1178
00:47:46,359 --> 00:47:48,848
when you click on the button it gives

1179
00:47:47,410 --> 00:47:50,879
you advice and guidance about what to do

1180
00:47:48,849 --> 00:47:50,880
next

1181
00:47:53,009 --> 00:47:59,300
anyone for any more so thank you oops

1182
00:47:58,569 --> 00:48:17,060
sorry what

1183
00:47:59,300 --> 00:48:20,360
I I trust all my devices absolutely no I

1184
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:22,850
don't I totally don't I run a zero trust

1185
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:25,040
network at home the problem is is what

1186
00:48:22,850 --> 00:48:27,049
humans live there apart from me humans

1187
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:29,660
also live in my home and they like this

1188
00:48:27,050 --> 00:48:31,280
sort of stuff and so you make a decision

1189
00:48:29,660 --> 00:48:34,460
in life or whether you trust the devil

1190
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:35,900
but at least I know you know I can make

1191
00:48:34,460 --> 00:48:37,280
decisions about things if I got some

1192
00:48:35,900 --> 00:48:39,470
particularly sensitive work information

1193
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:42,320
I can segregate my network and run in a

1194
00:48:39,470 --> 00:48:46,000
different way for example we actually

1195
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:49,070
had a case where somebody had a musical

1196
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:50,810
receiver used for plugging musical

1197
00:48:49,070 --> 00:48:53,030
instruments in and it was had two

1198
00:48:50,810 --> 00:48:55,040
network ports and it was B it was

1199
00:48:53,030 --> 00:48:56,570
actually implicitly bridging two parts

1200
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:59,150
of a network together this was somebody

1201
00:48:56,570 --> 00:49:00,350
who worked in a sensitive environment

1202
00:48:59,150 --> 00:49:02,390
was trying to keep a family life away

1203
00:49:00,350 --> 00:49:04,400
from work life so it'll be really really

1204
00:49:02,390 --> 00:49:07,520
careful about what you actually run but

1205
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:09,890
turns out Amazon and other does Google

1206
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:11,660
have a Google home and how many and so

1207
00:49:09,890 --> 00:49:14,029
on there's all sorts of voice assistant

1208
00:49:11,660 --> 00:49:16,190
devices you make choices in life about

1209
00:49:14,030 --> 00:49:18,740
when you want to trust or not it does do

1210
00:49:16,190 --> 00:49:23,420
some freaky things then one for another

1211
00:49:18,740 --> 00:49:26,649
talk I think that's it thank you very

1212
00:49:23,420 --> 00:49:26,650
much have a great day
