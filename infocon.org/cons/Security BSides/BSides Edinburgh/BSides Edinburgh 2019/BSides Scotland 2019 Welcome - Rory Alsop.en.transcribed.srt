2
00:00:07,189 --> 00:00:10,830
besides event in Scotland there's a

3
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:12,450
second one in here but it's very

4
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:16,530
refurbed from last time so it's looking

5
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:19,980
rather nice and we've got a pretty

6
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:21,960
pretty full day the one times we do have

7
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:23,600
is on the kids track one of our sets of

8
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:27,180
speakers unfortunate had to pull out so

9
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:28,890
those of you here with kids the lockpick

10
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:32,269
guys the car hacking village guys and

11
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:35,610
first I've tried I said that'd be very

12
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:38,220
welcoming to Kate's so feel free to to

13
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:43,110
let them go on and play in those teams

14
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:44,310
and we've got a couple of we've got

15
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:45,630
lunch break we've got a coffee break

16
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:49,350
later on as well but generally we're

17
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:51,780
doing pairs of talks so after our

18
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:53,809
keynote we've got supper talks then a

19
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:58,350
break the cup of talks and coffee then

20
00:00:53,809 --> 00:01:00,328
talk to finish the brochure you've got

21
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:03,989
four programs slightly wrong we've

22
00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:07,200
replaced Brian with Sean and I think

23
00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:09,570
we've got potentially Calum and Thomas

24
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,570
might be swapping times so keep an eye

25
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:15,899
on it on who's who's going but it should

26
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:18,960
all work he said hopefully we would not

27
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:21,450
expect any firearm tests so if there are

28
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:23,850
fire alarms actually signage for fire

29
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:25,140
exits is really good and you can follow

30
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:26,820
the light towards the front from that

31
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:29,010
that way there are a number of doors out

32
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:31,229
to Queen Street and if that happens just

33
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:34,619
wait out there and we'll we'll do an

34
00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:38,039
attendee list there are toilets on

35
00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:40,369
pretty much every floor and there's

36
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:43,320
workshops running throughout the day

37
00:01:40,369 --> 00:01:47,880

38
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:50,250
hacking mobile hacking talks JPMorgan

39
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:51,720

40
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:55,650
room down in the workshop space as well

41
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:58,048

00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:08,310
that point I encourage you all to chat

46
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:11,640
to the sponsors during the breaks

47
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:13,410
because they pay for all of this we were

48
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:15,220
not for profit we literally Ryeon them

49
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:17,410
to fund the venue Kate

50
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:18,910

51
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:21,490
their while have a chat

52

53
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:24,550

58
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:36,880
ugly so we'll kick off with our keynote

59
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:39,670

60
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:40,900
everyone here in this room we weren't

61
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:43,149
sure how many would turn up nice and

62
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:44,560
early we've sold far more tickets than

63
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:46,870
this room copes with so we were going to

64
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:49,510
livestream through to the Great Hall as

65
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:52,120

66
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:54,790
lucky to have Todd Renner from the FBI

67
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:56,080
