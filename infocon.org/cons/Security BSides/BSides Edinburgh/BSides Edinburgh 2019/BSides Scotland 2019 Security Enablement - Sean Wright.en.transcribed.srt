1
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:08,440
thanks thanks event for coming

2
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:11,110
unfortunately Brown Porter I'm not him

3
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:12,759
I know the program was a bit too late to

4
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:13,259
change so I'm fully a name for Brian

5
00:00:12,759 --> 00:00:16,650
Porter

6
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:20,530
so unfortunately wasn't able to make it

7
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:24,099
so today I'm going to talk about a term

8
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:27,130
I don't say it invented but kind of

9
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:27,810
thought about whether the last nine

10
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:31,660
months or so

11
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:34,469
so just a quick bit about myself I'm

12
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:37,559
focused many an application security

13
00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:40,629
responsible for the technical lead on a

14
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:43,870
security engineering team

15
00:00:40,629 --> 00:00:47,199
Carlita of our Scotland along with Rob

16
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:50,199
who's at the back there

17
00:00:47,199 --> 00:00:53,559
via farm is member if you can see I fell

18
00:00:50,199 --> 00:00:57,989
this morning I'm on Twitter do quite a

19
00:00:53,559 --> 00:01:01,178
lot of tweeting and I do security stuff

20
00:00:57,989 --> 00:01:03,428
so I don't know how many of you feel

21
00:01:01,179 --> 00:01:06,579
like this when you try to talk security

22
00:01:03,429 --> 00:01:10,479
to devs and that at harm's but it can

23
00:01:06,579 --> 00:01:13,329
often lead to your frustrating farm the

24
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:17,469
other don't follow your advice or ignore

25
00:01:13,329 --> 00:01:20,500
what appears to ignore you not for any

26
00:01:17,469 --> 00:01:22,839
practices and so on and so forth and too

27
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:26,200
often carry on trying to do the same

28
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:27,729
thing over and over and over so over the

29
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,509
last two months I've try to take a

30
00:01:27,729 --> 00:01:31,210
different stance

31
00:01:28,509 --> 00:01:34,020
change direction and be a little bit

32
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:36,699
more engaging with our development teams

33
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:40,500
QA teams and so on and so forth so

34
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:42,820
that's kind of where this talk is going

35
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:46,539
security and a woman this kind of we are

36
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:50,288
derived from for Spotify have a model

37
00:01:46,539 --> 00:01:54,310
that is a squad based model I company

38
00:01:50,289 --> 00:01:55,600
put this on a couple years ago and the

39
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:58,929
whole motion around swatch is a

40
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:02,589
self-contained unit that is responsible

41
00:01:58,929 --> 00:02:05,380
for developing testing and deploying the

42
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:07,030
word that they do so in essence they

43
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:09,940
become a self-contained team that are

44
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:12,730
responsible solely for their system

45
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:15,880
service that they maintain and develop

46
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:20,410
on if you want to read a bit more

47
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:23,290
there is a guard or a blog that's what

48
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:26,140
if I produced that explained dozens more

49
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:28,359
yeah and within the squadron world model

50
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:31,630
you get a concept of squads puts other

51
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:33,730
teams tribes which kind of go a little

52
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:37,150
bit further and then build wood across

53
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:40,959
many squads and the idea is you get

54
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:45,640
something that my idea was to get a

55
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:49,150
security focused group and concept

56
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:51,970
behind us and what's all purpose of this

57
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:54,880
is to try to get these squads to follow

58
00:02:51,970 --> 00:03:00,310
best security practices and get them all

59
00:02:54,880 --> 00:03:03,280
focused on security so kind of taking it

60
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:06,250
a step back and seeing how different

61
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:08,530
people use security a fire I try to look

62
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:12,160
these up online and these are kind of

63
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:13,720
the best thing they could find and I

64
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:19,390
fast my mom she thinks I'm some

65
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:21,970
superhero which I'm not the society

66
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:24,220
things we all wear hoodies or balaclavas

67
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:26,950
we'll just choppin or a computer like

68
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:30,370
that but what we really did this work

69
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:34,329
like anyone else as going a step further

70
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:36,400
security engineers as much as I'd like

71
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:38,530
to think we don't party all the time in

72
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,810
fact as I get older don't party anymore

73
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:43,300
[Music]

74
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:45,520
if my partner thinks I sit back and sit

75
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:49,420
on my seat all day looking at a computer

76
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:54,790
screen at somebody yell at the computer

77
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:57,609
as well and when we think about it what

78
00:03:54,790 --> 00:04:01,570
do our team members think of and it's

79
00:03:57,610 --> 00:04:04,830
usually shouting scolding as well as our

80
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:08,859
robot oh no not those security for you

81
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:13,060
when we get to delivering a new project

82
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:17,590
or a product we often the last piece

83
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:21,280
that need to be engaged and approve the

84
00:04:17,589 --> 00:04:24,700
release and we trying to need to try to

85
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:26,109
change this perception so the purpose of

86
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:27,570
this talk is trying to find ways and

87
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:33,810
tools a method

88
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:35,460
that can help change this perception so

89
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:39,540
as I said we're trying to change from

90
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:43,620
the police's them forces the the people

91
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:46,200
who are preventing things moving forward

92
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:48,090
and change into something a bit more

93
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:52,469
engaging become the teacher

94
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:53,700
guarding helping those who have less of

95
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:57,060
a knowledge gain a better understanding

96
00:04:53,700 --> 00:05:07,380
of what it is that we try and accomplish

97
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:09,030
and I will try improve security so what

98
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:10,710
we're looking at that we also need to

99
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:12,659
understand the businesses are changing

100
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:15,359
so go on another day is where you have

101
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:18,090
this big waterful models so I like that

102
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,590
the notion of a tanker with the

103
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:22,950
containers where you can think each

104
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:24,929
container is the individual changes back

105
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:28,500
in the day you used to have Goliath

106
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:31,470
releases which contain many changes and

107
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:34,230
this was okay from a security point of

108
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:37,200
view because you had one major change so

109
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:40,050
you could spend months training plan for

110
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:44,570
it get the resources get the tools

111
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:47,700
together get the relevant ten tests and

112
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:50,040
scans all of that before the release

113
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:52,469
Fanny went out so it was a lot easier to

114
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:56,640
check and get keep things yes there was

115
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:58,680
a a lot of things to check but you knew

116
00:05:56,640 --> 00:06:01,200
you up and when that was happening so

117
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:04,710
you could plan for it what's forward in

118
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:08,070
today we have a very fast on dynamic

119
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:11,219
nature things are changing extremely

120
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:14,990
quicky it come changes coming in

121
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:19,620
different sizes ranging from a

122
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:20,070
relatively big change fair bus so taxi

123
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:21,990
smoke

124
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:25,290
sizes even maybe a murder bar might be a

125
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:28,590
few bug touches and it's no longer

126
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:32,700
possible to use the old ways that we had

127
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:35,039
where he planned a big release to checks

128
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:37,520
at the end of that it's just not going

129
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:40,460
to scale so

130
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:43,250
it's time of tranny change things trying

131
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:48,560
able teams to hopefully take some of

132
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:51,620
that on now before we go down the road

133
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:53,840
of China gets themes on board and

134
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:56,810
implement tools it's really important

135
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:59,330
that you get your management involved

136
00:06:56,810 --> 00:07:01,449
and approval for management almost

137
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:04,280
everything else rather speak about

138
00:07:01,449 --> 00:07:06,979
you'll find it quite difficult to

139
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:09,859
implement without that we will form your

140
00:07:06,979 --> 00:07:13,280
management and that's increased from the

141
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:15,440
top down getting them involved getting

142
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:17,630
approval from them we'll make sure you

143
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:19,550
don't have things like why wasn't never

144
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:22,550
consulted and I don't agree with this

145
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:25,130
this allows you to debate with

146
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:26,930
management and make sure that you both

147
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:28,370
come up with I understand it I

148
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:30,229
understand what's been trying to be

149
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:32,060
accomplished as well as making sure what

150
00:07:30,229 --> 00:07:35,479
you trying to accomplish lands up with

151
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:45,789
Boden's gold so you end up being on the

152
00:07:35,479 --> 00:07:52,610
same page so the first step and road to

153
00:07:45,789 --> 00:07:54,590
security enablement is awareness so you

154
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:58,639
can't fix something that you're not

155
00:07:54,590 --> 00:08:01,630
familiar with this is something that

156
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:05,000
I've seen quite often you get many

157
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:07,940
pupils or students coming out of

158
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,370
university especially in my time where

159
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:12,830
we're never taught anything around

160
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:15,770
security things like cross our script in

161
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:18,258
sequin jetson those are completely

162
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:20,120
foreign to us so how can you expect

163
00:08:18,259 --> 00:08:24,529
development for your development team

164
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:26,479
developers to not implement cross-site

165
00:08:24,529 --> 00:08:28,130
scripting in their code or sequin

166
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:30,510
Junction if they don't say anything

167
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:33,299
about it will exists

168
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:35,669
creating some sort of awareness will

169
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:39,240
help them understand that hey maybe this

170
00:08:35,669 --> 00:08:42,900
is an issue hey I need to be aware of

171
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:46,830
this when I'm generating the webpage to

172
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:49,740
choosing a new tool framework that way

173
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:54,120
we can get them on the road to Ward's

174
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:55,860
better training but it's just to spark

175
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:58,830
that initial interest but I several

176
00:08:55,860 --> 00:09:02,670
tools that you can help always pop

177
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:04,980
they're really really great tool I'm

178
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:07,680
sure most people don't know what this is

179
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:12,450
I use it in some of the folks that I

180
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:16,410
geared for I recently for a training

181
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:19,260
organization again it's not going into

182
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:20,550
the weeds and starting to provide hey

183
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:23,400
this is how you do cross site scripting

184
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:25,349
or fuel injection it's more along the

185
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:28,260
lines of hey this is what these things

186
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:28,920
are the problem and this is why they're

187
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:32,520
problem

188
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:35,490
so often we see things like cross-site

189
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:37,380
scripting trainer leadbox but not

190
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:40,320
showing what the repercussions are why

191
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:44,700
is across that's pretty important to

192
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:46,530
prevent it in Co subscription can

193
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:48,960
essentially are in the browser show you

194
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:50,850
some real examples again that will help

195
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:52,920
the engagement it's no longer boring a

196
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:55,920
little the pop I'll show you a little

197
00:09:52,920 --> 00:10:02,910
box that pops up similarly there's sans

198
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:05,459
top 25 line along the top ten but 2015

199
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:09,920
more and then cwe is a really good tool

200
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:12,330
as well so common weakness in numeration

201
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:14,849
these are basically categories that

202
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:17,460
vulnerability scan for ENT again not

203
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:19,320
going into the depth but at least make

204
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:22,530
people aware of them so when I see these

205
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:28,650
types of terminologies come up that can

206
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:31,410
relate to it some are now following on

207
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:33,689
from training and where the tray for

208
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:35,850
your awareness you start going down into

209
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:37,230
more in-depth things so this is where

210
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:38,680
your training starts becoming more

211
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:41,470
focused

212
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:45,489
and the first thing I want to say avoid

213
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:47,829
the mandatory training I've seen several

214
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:50,589
occasions where we've had managed

215
00:10:47,829 --> 00:10:52,180
through training and not even a week

216
00:10:50,589 --> 00:10:54,369
later we get asked a question that was

217
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:56,649
in that mandatory training it simply

218
00:10:54,369 --> 00:10:59,529
doesn't work finally throw something at

219
00:10:56,649 --> 00:11:01,269
certain someone expecting them to take

220
00:10:59,529 --> 00:11:02,829
it on board and take everything and it's

221
00:11:01,269 --> 00:11:08,199
just not going to work while they're

222
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:09,998
trying to do their job and also remember

223
00:11:08,199 --> 00:11:12,639
that perception it's we don't want to be

224
00:11:09,999 --> 00:11:16,420
seen as these people porting Android

225
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:19,389
blocks and talking down essentially at

226
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:22,118
people when you try to be engaging so I

227
00:11:19,389 --> 00:11:23,829
get them on the same level as out so

228
00:11:22,119 --> 00:11:26,110
things that can help with that in terms

229
00:11:23,829 --> 00:11:28,029
of training gamification let's start

230
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:31,569
making things a bit more fun let's make

231
00:11:28,029 --> 00:11:33,459
things could happen - there are products

232
00:11:31,569 --> 00:11:36,420
out there that have leaderboards you can

233
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:39,300
set up different sort of challenges

234
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:44,229
these things get your security teams

235
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:47,229
engaged with your ordinary developers in

236
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:49,689
QA as well at the same time getting the

237
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:52,600
really important training to them and

238
00:11:49,689 --> 00:11:54,819
understanding of what it means to have a

239
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:57,399
cross-site scripting or sequin injection

240
00:11:54,819 --> 00:12:01,310
and understand the concepts behind it

241
00:11:57,399 --> 00:12:04,680
how they actually used by attackers

242
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:07,109
Brownback's again something that you can

243
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:12,569
do especially if you have a security

244
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:15,810
team just give hope such as this put on

245
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:20,970
different topics it doesn't have to be

246
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:23,430
technical it can be soft skills it's

247
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:26,759
just the main thing is you starting to

248
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:29,569
engage and share any knowledge and then

249
00:12:26,759 --> 00:12:33,269
the last one for me is really important

250
00:12:29,569 --> 00:12:38,130
capture the flag something I'm terrible

251
00:12:33,269 --> 00:12:41,579
at but the one thing I learned when I do

252
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:44,399
my first one last year is not how bad I

253
00:12:41,579 --> 00:12:48,359
am edit but it gets you out of your

254
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:50,790
comfort zone as I've been in my current

255
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:53,009
role for a good number of years and you

256
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:57,300
become very accustomed to you roll it

257
00:12:53,009 --> 00:13:01,079
cameras focus in and not be aware of the

258
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:02,880
different thing going on having a CTF

259
00:13:01,079 --> 00:13:06,329
can boarding a script gets you outside

260
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:08,040
of your comfort zone and by doing that

261
00:13:06,329 --> 00:13:12,779
it's going to allow you to get others

262
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:15,779
involved and again kind of related to

263
00:13:12,779 --> 00:13:18,439
you gamification getting them involved

264
00:13:15,779 --> 00:13:21,300
building that theme in coordination day

265
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:24,959
so there's two aspects to CTF one to

266
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:27,540
help your your team learn the current

267
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:30,268
technologies out there the new exploits

268
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:34,790
the new vulnerabilities and then also

269
00:13:30,269 --> 00:13:37,949
from the less technically focused way

270
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:40,139
get them involved in some security stuff

271
00:13:37,949 --> 00:13:43,800
get them involved difference and act

272
00:13:40,139 --> 00:13:45,839
like a hacker so to speak it just makes

273
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:48,359
things more chart and then mundane

274
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:50,730
studying in front of a PowerPoint

275
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:53,069
presentation clicking through and then

276
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:55,470
finally in our main questions as many

277
00:13:53,069 --> 00:13:58,370
times as you can to get the right answer

278
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:58,370
just two parts

279
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:07,850
so again coming back to the men

280
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:11,750
mandatory training it's often a deadline

281
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:14,180
so often something that's placed upon

282
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:19,160
your employees that you have to do this

283
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:21,290
by day tech try to change it to your

284
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:23,360
training to be do it whenever you're

285
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:25,819
free do it when you have some free time

286
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:29,420
allow them to do their day job without

287
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:33,290
having the extra pressure make it easy

288
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:35,240
to get too often you might have to I've

289
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:37,670
seen you have to go through this portal

290
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:40,730
and then go to that portal just make it

291
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:44,870
a few clicks of the body make it easy to

292
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:47,330
understand and sometimes things can get

293
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:49,700
really complicated bring it down to

294
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:51,320
their level if they developers they

295
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:54,610
might understand something some

296
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:59,810
development and I'll argue today just as

297
00:14:54,610 --> 00:15:03,080
some other a different tone the night at

298
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:06,170
your own pace again colors related to

299
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:11,000
the salt hull where if they're hits a

300
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:14,510
problem allow them to get it when they

301
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:16,850
need you and the other thing is relevant

302
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:18,860
in focused you're not going to want a

303
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:22,030
web developer learning about buffer

304
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:24,890
overflows that's not going to help them

305
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:28,250
so make sure that you're training a

306
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:31,580
portal for the job specs that you target

307
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:33,710
see that's going to help them stay on

308
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:36,790
track understand what they need to know

309
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:39,980
to do the job as opposed to wearing a

310
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:44,209
wide variety that's probably not going

311
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:47,150
to help them and keep it current often

312
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:49,730
our seeing some training programs that

313
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:51,829
have not been updated for years and the

314
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:53,870
development fear especially with

315
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:55,720
technologies things change at an

316
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:58,660
alarming rate

317
00:15:55,720 --> 00:16:01,840
I myself had fallen down behind some of

318
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:03,600
the technologies used today when I left

319
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:07,180
University

320
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:10,290
jte puts an inch past version Java for

321
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:13,359
the web that stuck was the end thing now

322
00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:15,910
let's consider legacy you've got no J

323
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:21,280
yes JavaScript all these weird things

324
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:23,500
and what boy has come new attack vectors

325
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:25,689
your vulnerabilities these things to

326
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:28,810
look out for so make sure your training

327
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:31,060
is kept up-to-date and the other thing

328
00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:34,180
is cost effective don't go throwing

329
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:39,189
money at it just because hey you check

330
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:41,050
the box make sure it's relevant that the

331
00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:43,000
money that you're paying is going to get

332
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:45,550
you the results that you need

333
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,920
monitor your training make sure that

334
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:49,990
it's been actually used there's no point

335
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:51,150
in spending money on your training of no

336
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:56,980
one's going to use it

337
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:59,290
reevaluate this ask get feed that

338
00:16:56,980 --> 00:17:00,870
there's already important things because

339
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:02,709
otherwise this is going to be turn money

340
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:04,930
that's something that's not going to

341
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:07,870
help and you know just they might have

342
00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:14,530
some pointers that might help you on

343
00:17:07,869 --> 00:17:18,239
your way so security champions is kind

344
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:21,700
of like another squad type thing it is

345
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:23,770
well they're not specific to squads it

346
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:26,620
is a actual real thing so if you guys

347
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:29,920
look boss be quite a bit of bad up on

348
00:17:26,619 --> 00:17:34,310
this and there's something that I'm

349
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:37,430
quite keen on implementing

350
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:40,370
so security champions are yearly

351
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:42,830
volunteers so they already have a vested

352
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:46,850
interest in security so there will be a

353
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:49,730
more engaging and I also want to learn

354
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:53,570
more and this is obviously going to be

355
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:56,720
very important if you want to have

356
00:17:53,570 --> 00:18:00,290
someone there as a ambassador so to

357
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:01,550
speak with your security but at the same

358
00:18:00,290 --> 00:18:05,090
time we're going to act as a middleman

359
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:07,850
between your developers QA and your

360
00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:12,139
security team so they'll have the

361
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:14,030
understanding of what it is what

362
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:15,950
products are working on the troubles

363
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:19,010
that they're facing in and getting that

364
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:20,480
those products developed and then at the

365
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:22,460
same time they're gonna understand some

366
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:24,980
of the security issues some of the

367
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:27,020
frustrations from the security teams so

368
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:30,200
that kind of act as that middleman the

369
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:34,820
buffer and hopefully that will start

370
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:38,690
driving towards a security culture sorry

371
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:40,310
um so a security culture is ultimately

372
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:44,870
the goal that you should be driving

373
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:48,710
force by having a team that focus on

374
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:51,739
security or always kind of thinking

375
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:54,650
insecure under that of demands when they

376
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:57,910
developing things is gonna certainly

377
00:18:54,650 --> 00:19:00,200
help drive your security going forward

378
00:18:57,910 --> 00:19:02,240
some other things that security

379
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:06,320
champions can up with is reduce the

380
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:09,080
burden on the security martin is really

381
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:11,510
small by having additional hands where

382
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:14,740
we don't even need to go to the business

383
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:18,830
and say look neither hiring people

384
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:23,420
you're gonna get immediate of hopefully

385
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:26,510
approval from managers a map not be as

386
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:28,730
much as a couple of full-time security

387
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:31,550
people but are certainly going to help

388
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:33,740
reduce the burden especially on some of

389
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:38,149
the more trivial or mundane security

390
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:40,430
things additionally because they're

391
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:42,830
closer to the source especially around

392
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:45,050
developments and releases they might be

393
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:46,230
able to help identify things sooner than

394
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:48,300
later

395
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:50,330
many times I've seen things released and

396
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:53,879
you found out afterwards and I met

397
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:57,960
extremely frustrating not to mention

398
00:19:53,880 --> 00:20:04,020
advanced risky but they again being a

399
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:05,730
metal man or woman they might be able to

400
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:11,400
spot this and sooner or raise them up

401
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:14,250
sooner so some of the things to try you

402
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:18,660
can try use to get people are on board

403
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:21,810
with your security champion program it

404
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:23,490
looks good and series I mean security is

405
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:27,330
not going away there's something that's

406
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:31,950
growing it's a challenge that I don't

407
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:36,320
see will be solved in anytime soon so

408
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:39,770
it's a good thing to put on the CD you

409
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:43,020
can possibly attend or some conferences

410
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:45,510
please that that's just this one few

411
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:51,230
nice if your budget great you might even

412
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:53,129
be able to coax him what Vegas and then

413
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:55,590
related to the last point on the

414
00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:58,530
previous slide casting sooner than later

415
00:20:55,590 --> 00:21:01,139
it's just going to help the company of

416
00:20:58,530 --> 00:21:04,080
the development teams help the security

417
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:06,780
teams structuring things after the fact

418
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:08,760
is always a lot more costly than fixing

419
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:11,460
them sooner so the sooner you can get

420
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:18,780
the the issues found the better that's

421
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:20,010
going to be and the less Carsten so the

422
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:25,200
other thing you need in your Arsenal's

423
00:21:20,010 --> 00:21:27,270
tool and fools help with many things so

424
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:30,780
they come in different flavors so to

425
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:33,540
speak will join Razoo groups the first

426
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:35,340
one being a static analysis tools so

427
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:37,710
think of these tools as your source code

428
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:39,959
analysis tools they scan occurred

429
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:42,990
looking for common vulnerabilities so

430
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:46,290
they'll see things that Karen's hard

431
00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:48,390
coded passwords are using weeks after

432
00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:49,370
sweet for you encryption those kind of

433
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:52,850
things

434
00:21:49,370 --> 00:21:56,360
dynamic analysis scan tools

435
00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:59,090
though what I'd like to think is more

436
00:21:56,360 --> 00:22:01,969
automated pen tests so there were

437
00:21:59,090 --> 00:22:05,300
actually poor service running and detect

438
00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:08,630
common vulnerabilities a web service

439
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:10,240
running boards whether at any cross-site

440
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:14,780
scripting vulnerabilities

441
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:19,250
what's your TLS implementation like the

442
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:22,480
next one dependency library monitoring

443
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:25,520
this has becoming a really hot topic

444
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:30,200
garna the days of development from the

445
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:33,620
ground up you see come up with a new

446
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:37,040
product and there were no emotions of

447
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:40,909
github or even maven was it in its

448
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:42,649
infancy when I left University fast

449
00:22:40,910 --> 00:22:44,150
forward to today it's no longer

450
00:22:42,650 --> 00:22:45,830
developed in the ground up you just

451
00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:47,750
grabbing lobbies all over the page and

452
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:50,960
why have you development now is more

453
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:54,320
about doing the lobbies together I've

454
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:57,130
gone through dependency foal a few times

455
00:22:54,320 --> 00:23:00,590
where you run it through the tool and

456
00:22:57,130 --> 00:23:03,770
there's a vulnerability great I'll go

457
00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:06,649
change the version no it's a dependency

458
00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:09,440
of it anythi of it ends so annoying

459
00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:11,720
these nine where the risks lie is really

460
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:15,050
important I mean we see in the lots of

461
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:17,690
Equifax that standby our dependency

462
00:23:15,050 --> 00:23:21,649
vulnerability that they just society

463
00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:25,850
update so having these tools will help

464
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:28,010
you hopefully fix them if not be able to

465
00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:30,350
identify that the different risks and

466
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:33,500
even how he put things like firewalls or

467
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:35,689
wax or something in place and then the

468
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:40,490
last one was assets and vulnerability

469
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:43,520
scan this is a lot higher level more

470
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:48,500
around your appointment so many times we

471
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:50,570
seeing different organizations being

472
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:52,430
completely unaware that hey I've had

473
00:23:50,570 --> 00:23:57,800
this thing wide open on the internet

474
00:23:52,430 --> 00:24:02,570
even know about the big thing as or the

475
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:05,360
MongoDB s and the other sort of noise

476
00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:06,570
sequel databases so I mean you know wide

477
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:08,758
open on the Internet

478
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:11,850
identification and people are not even

479
00:24:08,759 --> 00:24:13,679
aware about them so having these sort of

480
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:15,928
acid scans that are scanning your

481
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:17,460
perimeter and finding what's open and

482
00:24:15,929 --> 00:24:20,149
really important because you can't fix

483
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:22,740
what you don't know so many

484
00:24:20,149 --> 00:24:24,779
vulnerability scanning kind of related

485
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:27,210
to your dependencies game making sure

486
00:24:24,779 --> 00:24:30,870
that your RS packages are kept

487
00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:33,899
up-to-date yet you didn't have any open

488
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:36,768
ports that you might not want open going

489
00:24:33,899 --> 00:24:40,469
look on shredder color for our DP

490
00:24:36,769 --> 00:24:49,679
lorries the Lloyds of Windows with my

491
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:54,000
desktop sessions are them why are you

492
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:56,100
choosing your tools it's important that

493
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,580
you spend time and tranny choose the

494
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:58,370
right cool

495
00:24:56,580 --> 00:25:01,230
[Music]

496
00:24:58,370 --> 00:25:02,969
I've gone down the road of just

497
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:05,399
something grabbing at all because hairy

498
00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:10,110
the profound and amazing and it turns

499
00:25:05,399 --> 00:25:12,239
out it was a complete waste the fighting

500
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:17,008
was on us not not the teams that we were

501
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:20,039
testing take your time make sure that

502
00:25:17,009 --> 00:25:24,120
you research the tool see how others

503
00:25:20,039 --> 00:25:26,309
have used the tool see how wild work for

504
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:29,908
them avoid things like marketing have

505
00:25:26,309 --> 00:25:31,710
false positives zero false positive is a

506
00:25:29,909 --> 00:25:35,570
really popular one with scanning tools

507
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:38,549
great how does it help me if it doesn't

508
00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:41,789
it is great that it doesn't find any

509
00:25:38,549 --> 00:25:43,889
fault both positives but doesn't

510
00:25:41,789 --> 00:25:47,669
actually find anything worth finding

511
00:25:43,889 --> 00:25:50,729
if I have a hard-coded password does it

512
00:25:47,669 --> 00:25:53,309
find that it doesn't help I rather go

513
00:25:50,730 --> 00:25:56,129
through ten false positive and have a

514
00:25:53,309 --> 00:25:59,759
report in issues that I have then report

515
00:25:56,129 --> 00:26:02,059
nothing so many you get the right tool

516
00:25:59,759 --> 00:26:02,059
for the job

517
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:12,658
darn go for it because flashy and claims

518
00:26:10,049 --> 00:26:15,230
to fix the world in that make sure that

519
00:26:12,659 --> 00:26:19,530
you use the tool for what it's intended

520
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:21,390
and as I said previously research

521
00:26:19,530 --> 00:26:23,639
and there's also a misconception around

522
00:26:21,390 --> 00:26:26,250
open-source I'm not saying open-source

523
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:29,070
is bad it's great I'm a firm believer of

524
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:33,720
open source but sometimes open source is

525
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:35,850
not always free free in the sense of yes

526
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:39,030
the software may be free but you still

527
00:26:35,850 --> 00:26:43,889
have resources to maintain keep it

528
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:46,050
running set it up to nuts a good example

529
00:26:43,890 --> 00:26:48,570
is mud security

530
00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:50,760
great product but you have to invest

531
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:53,760
time and tune in to your needs

532
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:54,330
where you could get something like awful

533
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:58,110
soap

534
00:26:54,330 --> 00:27:02,280
Wow where they already spent the time

535
00:26:58,110 --> 00:27:04,139
and money and effort so be careful with

536
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:06,750
that and as I said previously

537
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:08,940
don't ask around see what others have

538
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:11,460
done often when I'm looking at the tool

539
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:14,850
or on Twitter and just ask and see what

540
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:16,590
other people's feedback travois getting

541
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:18,540
stuck in the same situation that they

542
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:22,530
are in they might have had some issues

543
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:29,760
that you may have or may not and you can

544
00:27:22,530 --> 00:27:33,570
help something else out Automation is

545
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:36,360
really key as I mentioned in the

546
00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:38,010
beginning business is changing things

547
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:41,399
are being delivered faster and faster

548
00:27:38,010 --> 00:27:44,129
and faster we can no longer spend time

549
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:48,150
doing manual reviews for each release

550
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:49,470
that's just not gonna scale crpd what's

551
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:54,030
the continuous integration continuous

552
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:55,890
delivery it's a notion of how you passes

553
00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:58,410
these tests the boys in production

554
00:27:55,890 --> 00:28:00,690
there's no manual deployment anymore so

555
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:02,250
even if you wanted to do manual pen test

556
00:28:00,690 --> 00:28:05,700
you probably weren't even Lorenson

557
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:08,070
production so embedding things within

558
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:10,910
your deployment process in the

559
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:14,629
development process will go a long way

560
00:28:10,910 --> 00:28:17,370
and it's this whole notion of ship lift

561
00:28:14,630 --> 00:28:19,830
she's quite often living in products

562
00:28:17,370 --> 00:28:22,219
that sell themselves on them what that

563
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:23,550
means is you're trying to get into the

564
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:26,340
pipeline

565
00:28:23,550 --> 00:28:30,570
you'll deployment pipeline as possibly

566
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:32,159
as early as possible the other thing

567
00:28:30,570 --> 00:28:36,540
they have important bits in order to

568
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:38,340
solve this is you need less effort so

569
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:41,220
the last thing your developers and QA

570
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:44,970
want to do is spend a whole bunch of

571
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:46,679
time and effort trying to do the right

572
00:28:44,970 --> 00:28:51,350
thing if you make it as simple as

573
00:28:46,679 --> 00:28:54,360
possible that essentially got no excuse

574
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:57,750
when to although in perfume opens walls

575
00:28:54,360 --> 00:29:01,169
in soon literally as two lines of code

576
00:28:57,750 --> 00:29:03,540
to write a security test by any

577
00:29:01,170 --> 00:29:06,900
developer QA that says that's too much

578
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:09,290
effort I'd probably have a word with

579
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:11,880
them and it goes for the second point

580
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:16,409
put all the security knowledge behind

581
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:18,360
the tool itself that way again they

582
00:29:16,410 --> 00:29:21,810
don't have to have all the experience

583
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:26,240
and knowledge good examples TLS it's

584
00:29:21,810 --> 00:29:29,550
really complicated even for the seasoned

585
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:32,040
professionals what protocols should have

586
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:33,810
supports what cipher suites should have

587
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:36,270
support wash them and support them when

588
00:29:33,810 --> 00:29:38,370
should I support them and you can

589
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:41,670
quickly see how a developer get really

590
00:29:38,370 --> 00:29:44,520
confused make the tool to make all those

591
00:29:41,670 --> 00:29:47,670
decisions and then just have the

592
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:48,990
developer write the test that way they

593
00:29:47,670 --> 00:29:51,110
can get the feedback when they need to

594
00:29:48,990 --> 00:29:55,260
they can engage you if they need to or

595
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:59,639
the security champion and you got your

596
00:29:55,260 --> 00:30:01,080
security bugs in so as I said this is

597
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,760
the biggest one for security in my

598
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:04,580
opinion

599
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:07,260
trying to get in as early as possible I

600
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:08,460
don't want to say force yourself in but

601
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:13,110
essentially that's what it is

602
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:14,640
putting yourself in the beginning kind

603
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:18,750
of putting your foot in the door and

604
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:21,210
making sure you stick there and the

605
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:23,640
benefit of that is it doesn't matter how

606
00:30:21,210 --> 00:30:26,970
fast the business delivers because you

607
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:29,490
built into that process it should form a

608
00:30:26,970 --> 00:30:32,490
part of that process if it speeds up the

609
00:30:29,490 --> 00:30:35,480
test we'll just have to speed up already

610
00:30:32,490 --> 00:30:35,480
speed up along the way

611
00:30:39,190 --> 00:30:48,409
another thing that our I came across a

612
00:30:44,899 --> 00:30:51,649
company last year was they did not

613
00:30:48,409 --> 00:30:59,080
really have a security issue or bug

614
00:30:51,649 --> 00:31:01,668
versus gaining insight into your

615
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:04,178
security issues is really important from

616
00:31:01,669 --> 00:31:08,139
a risk management point of view

617
00:31:04,179 --> 00:31:10,490
understanding what issues you face and

618
00:31:08,139 --> 00:31:13,939
how much of a risk that presents you

619
00:31:10,490 --> 00:31:16,549
organization security is not always

620
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:22,190
about fixing everything it's about

621
00:31:16,549 --> 00:31:24,559
managing risk and your security issues

622
00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:27,710
bugs or perhaps the biggest particles so

623
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:30,950
when you ever a you need to have a

624
00:31:27,710 --> 00:31:33,740
process for filing them tracking them

625
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:36,519
and priority' so when you have things

626
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:38,509
are pin tests make sure you those

627
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:41,440
varnishes full - into this process

628
00:31:38,509 --> 00:31:44,629
issues get track that JIRA there's

629
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:45,789
bugzilla and I don't know what else

630
00:31:44,629 --> 00:31:49,149
there is

631
00:31:45,789 --> 00:31:53,950
but have your bank management

632
00:31:49,149 --> 00:31:56,870
essentially track your security issues

633
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:59,600
in addition by doing so you're going to

634
00:31:56,870 --> 00:32:02,590
be able to help do some sort of reports

635
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:04,850
and analysis on your security issues

636
00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:05,658
identify which systems of more point

637
00:32:04,850 --> 00:32:09,860
than the others

638
00:32:05,659 --> 00:32:10,429
oops teams may need some more help than

639
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:13,189
others

640
00:32:10,429 --> 00:32:19,009
maybe maybe teams struggling on one part

641
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:20,750
or and another part so you can then come

642
00:32:19,009 --> 00:32:23,029
along and give them guidance give them

643
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:24,679
additional training and the other

644
00:32:23,029 --> 00:32:26,899
important thing is it's all available

645
00:32:24,679 --> 00:32:30,549
while saying hey we had these tools we

646
00:32:26,899 --> 00:32:33,469
have these procedures this new program

647
00:32:30,549 --> 00:32:37,129
but unless you start measuring it how do

648
00:32:33,470 --> 00:32:38,899
you know if you get in any better so

649
00:32:37,129 --> 00:32:40,969
it's really important to have something

650
00:32:38,899 --> 00:32:43,008
to measure that you can feed back to

651
00:32:40,970 --> 00:32:44,990
managing his remember all the way in the

652
00:32:43,009 --> 00:32:48,260
beginning let's give an from management

653
00:32:44,990 --> 00:32:50,110
that online no dark points see some sort

654
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:53,920
of reporting on how

655
00:32:50,110 --> 00:33:01,990
progress is being made so a security

656
00:32:53,920 --> 00:33:06,280
issue the right way of showing that the

657
00:33:01,990 --> 00:33:08,910
other thing is look Chavez don't

658
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:12,428
reinvent the wheel

659
00:33:08,910 --> 00:33:14,620
don't try come up with your own unique

660
00:33:12,429 --> 00:33:16,570
thing when there's something already

661
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:20,610
said now someone's already done it and

662
00:33:16,570 --> 00:33:28,178
when he giving out their free or even

663
00:33:20,610 --> 00:33:29,799
sometimes paid for security community is

664
00:33:28,179 --> 00:33:32,500
very helpful that's all the one thing

665
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:35,260
I've learned since engaging on the lack

666
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:37,480
of Twitter that people are always

667
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:41,860
willing to help out each other give

668
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:45,040
advice give recommendations tweeting is

669
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:47,080
a good example like hey I recommend this

670
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:48,490
tool because I find it useful and

671
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:52,949
there's I didn't find that's really

672
00:33:48,490 --> 00:33:55,750
useful in that and also giving back

673
00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:57,669
sometimes helps as well because you

674
00:33:55,750 --> 00:34:01,960
never know someone might be in the same

675
00:33:57,669 --> 00:34:05,440
position that you were in and another

676
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:08,830
way to look at is see what different

677
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:10,740
organizations are doing so Netflix are

678
00:34:08,830 --> 00:34:13,029
good example that they have whole

679
00:34:10,739 --> 00:34:15,908
repository of all the tools that they've

680
00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:19,060
developed so I give you some indication

681
00:34:15,909 --> 00:34:21,450
of what they do me mention the beginning

682
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:25,690
Spotify they have a squat model

683
00:34:21,449 --> 00:34:28,868
Facebook yes or no that's yeah few

684
00:34:25,690 --> 00:34:32,470
smirks but there has some fantastic

685
00:34:28,869 --> 00:34:35,919
tools in all honesty always query really

686
00:34:32,469 --> 00:34:38,580
great tool there see a transparency tool

687
00:34:35,918 --> 00:34:42,389
again great tool

688
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:44,750
and also importantly you don't make the

689
00:34:42,389 --> 00:34:47,489
same mistakes you can avoid some

690
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:50,730
frustrations some fun perhaps even

691
00:34:47,489 --> 00:34:52,259
financial losses by avoiding the same

692
00:34:50,730 --> 00:34:59,270
mistakes that some of the other

693
00:34:52,260 --> 00:35:07,350
organizations groups will compliment and

694
00:34:59,270 --> 00:35:08,280
some other advice I'd like to give so we

695
00:35:07,350 --> 00:35:12,360
all human

696
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:16,260
it's you're often in security we kind of

697
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:20,570
put ourselves on a pedestal and warn you

698
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:23,670
solve everything and be perfected

699
00:35:20,570 --> 00:35:27,690
perfect in the descent and I know I'm a

700
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:29,820
perfectionist myself and it sometimes

701
00:35:27,690 --> 00:35:31,680
drives me up the wall when I get told no

702
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:33,840
I can't do this all we have to allow

703
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:37,290
this through but sometimes you just have

704
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:39,690
to accept that there are going to be

705
00:35:37,290 --> 00:35:43,020
times when you're perhaps going to be

706
00:35:39,690 --> 00:35:46,470
breached and as I mention on our talked

707
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:51,660
earlier with the B opponent companies

708
00:35:46,470 --> 00:35:53,459
are more often remembered for how they

709
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:56,940
handled the beach world and the beaches

710
00:35:53,460 --> 00:36:01,080
stop and the other important thing is

711
00:35:56,940 --> 00:36:05,760
learn from that so when you reach a

712
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:09,590
human be that if you are take a step

713
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:12,510
back form a plan how you're going to

714
00:36:09,590 --> 00:36:14,490
respond to that breach and in there

715
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:16,800
include how you going to learn from from

716
00:36:14,490 --> 00:36:19,979
that beach but further measures what

717
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:22,310
you're going to put in place think of it

718
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:25,590
as a learning exercise

719
00:36:22,310 --> 00:36:31,549
the other thing again really really

720
00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:34,380
horrible because I have none is patience

721
00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:36,810
remember we are the professionals and

722
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:39,660
security your development of

723
00:36:36,810 --> 00:36:42,759
professionals and development the QA

724
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:45,490
czar professional than testing

725
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:48,430
so it's easy to lose their patience and

726
00:36:45,490 --> 00:36:52,180
get angry and frustrated when they don't

727
00:36:48,430 --> 00:36:54,190
follow something that people did you

728
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:55,990
take the time to explain it to them did

729
00:36:54,190 --> 00:36:59,320
you take the time to explain the

730
00:36:55,990 --> 00:37:00,970
repercussions so sometimes you just need

731
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:03,460
to take this step back and just let them

732
00:37:00,970 --> 00:37:05,439
give you a thing sometimes I might make

733
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:07,960
mistake but that's when you step back

734
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:10,330
and you help guide them correct them if

735
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:12,460
you got your security champions get them

736
00:37:10,330 --> 00:37:17,140
to do it they'll be a lot closer to that

737
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:22,630
person other thing is asking for help

738
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:24,490
and knowing when see and this could be

739
00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:27,760
asking for help in terms of security

740
00:37:24,490 --> 00:37:30,939
thanks because let's face it we're not

741
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:32,940
all we don't know anything it's

742
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:35,080
impossible for us to know everything

743
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:37,740
there's many things that I don't know

744
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:40,779
and I'm learning on a day-by-day basis

745
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:44,470
but asking others is the only way and

746
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:47,859
then you get to Venice similarly you

747
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:51,220
have professionals that are well versed

748
00:37:47,859 --> 00:37:54,400
on the topic that they are working on so

749
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:58,689
your developers may be how to know a

750
00:37:54,400 --> 00:38:00,400
javo experts or Nijs experts and the

751
00:37:58,690 --> 00:38:02,650
finger I've found that's become really

752
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:05,800
difficult is keeping track of all these

753
00:38:02,650 --> 00:38:07,420
technologies coming up the really

754
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:09,820
difficult thing of my job is I

755
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:12,250
essentially have to be an expert in all

756
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:13,350
technologies use that's just not going

757
00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:17,830
to happen

758
00:38:13,350 --> 00:38:19,630
so I have to engage with my teams to

759
00:38:17,830 --> 00:38:22,270
make sure I understand that the

760
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:27,070
different concepts and technologies

761
00:38:22,270 --> 00:38:32,050
being used so in addition I become the

762
00:38:27,070 --> 00:38:35,560
kind of student and I've mentioned this

763
00:38:32,050 --> 00:38:38,080
before Twitter so what is a really good

764
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:40,090
way and that forms part of engaging with

765
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:40,960
the community already but having the

766
00:38:40,090 --> 00:38:43,570
spoke together

767
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:46,420
engaging with the community get to dance

768
00:38:43,570 --> 00:38:49,630
come through some of these tools as I

769
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:51,340
mentioned security champions but there's

770
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:52,990
no reason why your development team or

771
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:55,820
your QA team content

772
00:38:52,990 --> 00:38:59,770
it just helps break down those barriers

773
00:38:55,820 --> 00:39:02,900
VCG IDT the development team the QA team

774
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:05,840
and you can flats ideas of one another

775
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:08,630
start sharing ideas start learning new

776
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:10,940
things I know some people are spoken to

777
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:14,090
and we we've bounce ideas off each other

778
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:16,790
and it's already started blossoming into

779
00:39:14,090 --> 00:39:20,500
new things are not providing resources

780
00:39:16,790 --> 00:39:23,630
for others as well as the relationships

781
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:26,360
at the end of the day we're all human so

782
00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:28,430
we still need to interact with one

783
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:31,580
another humans are built on

784
00:39:28,430 --> 00:39:34,730
relationships it's all very well talking

785
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:44,840
through a computer or market plane but

786
00:39:34,730 --> 00:39:47,660
nothing compares to a face-to-face so

787
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:50,180
there are quite a few slides there on

788
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:53,720
the different tools and methodologies

789
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:58,759
that you do so as a sort of trust sum it

790
00:39:53,720 --> 00:40:01,129
up in one side is best possible at the

791
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:03,580
end of the day the security teams your

792
00:40:01,130 --> 00:40:05,900
development teams the QA teams

793
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:09,170
regardless of actually in fact what team

794
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:12,350
you're on your day to achieve the same

795
00:40:09,170 --> 00:40:17,660
goal and that way company organization

796
00:40:12,350 --> 00:40:22,060
would be at a service a function and

797
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:27,560
product but that's what you're there for

798
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:34,460
doesn't matter your job role the company

799
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:36,830
or organization has to make money and as

800
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:41,510
cheesy as it sounds you all want him at

801
00:40:36,830 --> 00:40:43,910
the end of the day so you should be

802
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:47,510
working together to achieve that same

803
00:40:43,910 --> 00:40:49,609
goal and hopefully by using some of

804
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:52,630
these tools and methodologies it can

805
00:40:49,610 --> 00:40:52,630
help do that

806
00:40:52,690 --> 00:40:58,130
in addition trying to leverage security

807
00:40:56,180 --> 00:41:00,379
and change the perception form of being

808
00:40:58,130 --> 00:41:04,920
a robot to be something that can help

809
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:07,859
engage help help team that

810
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:09,749
I've had several example or instances

811
00:41:07,859 --> 00:41:11,788
where I've implemented some security

812
00:41:09,749 --> 00:41:15,959
function and it's actually helped

813
00:41:11,789 --> 00:41:20,690
improve user experience or help identify

814
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:27,779
areas that needed better performance or

815
00:41:20,690 --> 00:41:31,349
better engagement a really important

816
00:41:27,779 --> 00:41:32,759
thing elbow is allowing teams to do the

817
00:41:31,349 --> 00:41:36,569
right thing with the least amount of

818
00:41:32,759 --> 00:41:40,769
effort if you do this well you'll

819
00:41:36,569 --> 00:41:42,869
probably nail that rather my head Lucas

820
00:41:40,769 --> 00:41:45,538
teams won't have excuse and often

821
00:41:42,869 --> 00:41:48,779
developers and QA wanna do the right

822
00:41:45,539 --> 00:41:52,009
thing but going back to the how business

823
00:41:48,779 --> 00:41:58,710
is changing its deliver deliver deliver

824
00:41:52,009 --> 00:42:01,369
and deliver at any cost so for them the

825
00:41:58,710 --> 00:42:04,739
delivery is going to far outweigh the

826
00:42:01,369 --> 00:42:07,920
security that they need to do so if you

827
00:42:04,739 --> 00:42:10,739
make it really simple it should help

828
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:14,369
them embed security within I don't know

829
00:42:10,739 --> 00:42:18,650
a couple of minutes well great there's

830
00:42:14,369 --> 00:42:21,420
no excuse not to do it and I kind of

831
00:42:18,650 --> 00:42:25,589
drive to the second point of training as

832
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:30,329
a security culture a cretinous culture

833
00:42:25,589 --> 00:42:32,339
of hey let's do the right thing and you

834
00:42:30,329 --> 00:42:34,529
get ton of fun upon when you by your

835
00:42:32,339 --> 00:42:38,150
peers that's really important now

836
00:42:34,529 --> 00:42:40,819
probably security people by your peers

837
00:42:38,150 --> 00:42:45,720
then you start getting better results

838
00:42:40,819 --> 00:42:47,099
because hey Fred you didn't do that

839
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:50,598
correctly you might want to check that

840
00:42:47,099 --> 00:42:53,549
by checking on a pride review did you do

841
00:42:50,599 --> 00:42:56,369
checks for malicious characters and I

842
00:42:53,549 --> 00:42:58,950
didn't well let it go often do that it's

843
00:42:56,369 --> 00:43:03,660
not me as a security professional or

844
00:42:58,950 --> 00:43:09,689
John security team hiding them it's Jane

845
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:12,029
on the development team so it's breaking

846
00:43:09,690 --> 00:43:14,420
down those barriers and hopefully that

847
00:43:12,029 --> 00:43:14,420
can help

848
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:32,080
so of any questions yes okay so the

849
00:43:30,250 --> 00:43:34,000
question was do you have any suggestions

850
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:40,840
for metrics that can report that to

851
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:42,070
management on oh yeah just to repeat it

852
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:46,720
yeah do you have any suggestions for

853
00:43:42,070 --> 00:43:50,860
metrics ones that you've seen there than

854
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:52,569
successful yourself in particular yeah

855
00:43:50,860 --> 00:43:55,870
so coming back to the security process

856
00:43:52,570 --> 00:44:00,340
the security issue important that's why

857
00:43:55,870 --> 00:44:01,690
I was hesitant about putting that in but

858
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:04,510
I thought it's actually important

859
00:44:01,690 --> 00:44:06,040
because it deals kind of with that it

860
00:44:04,510 --> 00:44:08,350
might not be the sole metric you're

861
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:10,029
allowed but it paints you a really good

862
00:44:08,350 --> 00:44:13,839
picture so if you start prioritizing

863
00:44:10,030 --> 00:44:16,540
what we use as the CB SS for suppose you

864
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:20,920
don't like a common vulnerability sub

865
00:44:16,540 --> 00:44:24,840
scoring system it's basically a industry

866
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:28,390
standard way of partying rates basically

867
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:31,360
takes into account things that says is

868
00:44:28,390 --> 00:44:33,100
this network exploitable how hard is

869
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:36,130
that to exploit and what is the

870
00:44:33,100 --> 00:44:39,759
repercussions do so many expenses so

871
00:44:36,130 --> 00:44:41,320
you'll see a little triangle and then I

872
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:45,490
comes out with a school so we use that

873
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:47,230
to then write to 14 our bugs right in

874
00:44:45,490 --> 00:44:50,080
writing from that kind of critical all

875
00:44:47,230 --> 00:44:52,510
the way down and then trying to take

876
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:55,450
council worries and see hey how many

877
00:44:52,510 --> 00:44:58,150
criticals have we had was my versus how

878
00:44:55,450 --> 00:45:01,180
many releases never had this much okay

879
00:44:58,150 --> 00:45:03,820
great the ratio is looking good or it's

880
00:45:01,180 --> 00:45:06,460
getting worse right well which teams the

881
00:45:03,820 --> 00:45:08,040
new criticals come in and you can start

882
00:45:06,460 --> 00:45:10,740
forming a better picture and

883
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:13,990
understanding where you'll risk slab

884
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:15,948
which teams our path and the Performing

885
00:45:13,990 --> 00:45:19,069
and

886
00:45:15,949 --> 00:45:23,829
additional help another area that you

887
00:45:19,069 --> 00:45:27,769
can use those n tests so pensive for

888
00:45:23,829 --> 00:45:31,849
often mandatory special third party

889
00:45:27,769 --> 00:45:37,158
contest for some companies compliance

890
00:45:31,849 --> 00:45:41,869
reasons and you can it's it's difficult

891
00:45:37,159 --> 00:45:44,029
though but you can use previous Panthers

892
00:45:41,869 --> 00:45:45,739
reports and try scale to see how are you

893
00:45:44,029 --> 00:45:47,179
doing especially if you do manual ones

894
00:45:45,739 --> 00:45:51,380
but if you have a whole bunch of new

895
00:45:47,179 --> 00:45:52,309
reduces perhaps but the reason why I say

896
00:45:51,380 --> 00:45:54,709
it's difficult

897
00:45:52,309 --> 00:45:57,140
I left you get the same time tester than

898
00:45:54,709 --> 00:45:59,479
that you might get varying results

899
00:45:57,140 --> 00:46:03,999
specially if you got a really useful

900
00:45:59,479 --> 00:46:07,459
penthouse company and a not-so-good one

901
00:46:03,999 --> 00:46:17,269
does that answer your question yeah

902
00:46:07,459 --> 00:46:19,399
thanks as I guess when you start the

903
00:46:17,269 --> 00:46:23,359
talk he talked about movement towards

904
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:25,939
self-contained teams in the agile

905
00:46:23,359 --> 00:46:28,689
well how how do you ensure

906
00:46:25,939 --> 00:46:31,549
accountability for security within those

907
00:46:28,689 --> 00:46:35,419
self-contained teams especially given a

908
00:46:31,549 --> 00:46:37,759
lot of I guess the bits that you're

909
00:46:35,419 --> 00:46:39,919
suggesting were quite voluntary or

910
00:46:37,759 --> 00:46:42,859
elective when it comes to sort of

911
00:46:39,919 --> 00:46:47,209
security champions guidance things like

912
00:46:42,859 --> 00:46:49,159
that Griffin so within the squad model

913
00:46:47,209 --> 00:46:55,519
and again not all companies are adopting

914
00:46:49,159 --> 00:46:58,069
this I think it is new things but within

915
00:46:55,519 --> 00:47:01,549
a squad model teams are accountable for

916
00:46:58,069 --> 00:47:02,029
themselves and so you have national

917
00:47:01,549 --> 00:47:04,339
squad

918
00:47:02,029 --> 00:47:06,679
each squad has its own squad leader and

919
00:47:04,339 --> 00:47:10,219
that's what neither pulses up to a kind

920
00:47:06,679 --> 00:47:13,519
of broader manager that's responsible

921
00:47:10,219 --> 00:47:16,909
for service ones so ultimately a lot of

922
00:47:13,519 --> 00:47:20,089
the security issues would falter all the

923
00:47:16,909 --> 00:47:20,460
way up to that manager and that manager

924
00:47:20,089 --> 00:47:24,720
would

925
00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:26,460
we held accountable subscribe that as

926
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:28,740
soon as that manager has a bit of

927
00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:30,690
pressure parts of them quickly that's

928
00:47:28,740 --> 00:47:32,790
all this would say I don't want to be

929
00:47:30,690 --> 00:47:37,140
seen in this bad lot so you better fix

930
00:47:32,790 --> 00:47:39,150
this and having that that again come of

931
00:47:37,140 --> 00:47:43,850
coming back to the other parts of the

932
00:47:39,150 --> 00:47:49,050
issue thing having some sort of SLA

933
00:47:43,850 --> 00:47:52,020
around your certain priorities with both

934
00:47:49,050 --> 00:47:54,950
varieties can help draw both the

935
00:47:52,020 --> 00:47:58,380
accountability as was the measurement

936
00:47:54,950 --> 00:47:58,740
and my criticals need to be fixed in six

937
00:47:58,380 --> 00:48:00,810
weeks

938
00:47:58,740 --> 00:48:04,259
otherwise you have exception process an

939
00:48:00,810 --> 00:48:06,060
exception doesn't look too good so that

940
00:48:04,260 --> 00:48:16,560
again can help drive some of their

941
00:48:06,060 --> 00:48:18,930
content um hi you seem to be against

942
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:21,779
mandatory training and for gamification

943
00:48:18,930 --> 00:48:23,940
and other methods and but how do you

944
00:48:21,780 --> 00:48:27,720
scale that for very large global

945
00:48:23,940 --> 00:48:29,430
companies and also how do you track

946
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:31,140
engagement because there's some people

947
00:48:29,430 --> 00:48:32,220
who will be naturally interested and

948
00:48:31,140 --> 00:48:33,629
others you're gonna have to drag them

949
00:48:32,220 --> 00:48:36,419
kicking and screaming to get them

950
00:48:33,630 --> 00:48:44,030
engaged and if it's voluntary that just

951
00:48:36,420 --> 00:48:44,030
may not happen again good question so

952
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:48,869
[Music]

953
00:48:49,220 --> 00:48:53,790
you thread it correct that I'm trying to

954
00:48:52,590 --> 00:48:55,650
get everyone engaged

955
00:48:53,790 --> 00:48:59,009
I'm not going to happen I mean people

956
00:48:55,650 --> 00:49:00,780
have to financials and I think for me

957
00:48:59,010 --> 00:49:02,490
and I'm sure many others I'm alone I'm

958
00:49:00,780 --> 00:49:04,560
always find like how can you not be

959
00:49:02,490 --> 00:49:06,509
interested in security well it's much

960
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:10,380
like how I'm not interested in

961
00:49:06,510 --> 00:49:14,040
performing this is just some people just

962
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:15,420
simply nothing being existed it kind of

963
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:18,000
comes back to my point of security

964
00:49:15,420 --> 00:49:20,850
culture but hopefully trying to create

965
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:25,830
this culture hey we need to focus and

966
00:49:20,850 --> 00:49:26,759
security because bad things happen in AD

967
00:49:25,830 --> 00:49:30,359
20

968
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:34,080
but another way as I hear people say hey

969
00:49:30,359 --> 00:49:35,480
security is not my job so I don't need

970
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:38,130
to worry about it

971
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:41,310
well when we get breached

972
00:49:38,130 --> 00:49:44,840
Angelis customers and you have

973
00:49:41,310 --> 00:49:48,560
redundancies all my issues years ago so

974
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:52,130
yeah it's perhaps very much your

975
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:55,920
responsibility as a say Cheesie not

976
00:49:52,130 --> 00:49:57,600
security is everyone's responsibility so

977
00:49:55,920 --> 00:50:01,220
every keep our building that national

978
00:49:57,600 --> 00:50:05,520
security culture where that kind of

979
00:50:01,220 --> 00:50:10,250
saying you might lose your job kind of

980
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:12,300
thing obviously saved like that but that

981
00:50:10,250 --> 00:50:16,230
fulfilled all that security culture

982
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:20,720
where others they think that way or that

983
00:50:16,230 --> 00:50:25,980
is not nothing sir hey because of jobs

984
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:27,629
back up kind of thing and again changing

985
00:50:25,980 --> 00:50:29,880
away from those mandatory training

986
00:50:27,630 --> 00:50:35,070
upping through them I've even had to do

987
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:38,100
security once that's complete so you

988
00:50:35,070 --> 00:50:40,080
have all gamification thing it makes

989
00:50:38,100 --> 00:50:43,410
things more classy and especially the

990
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:45,720
competitive nature a lot of there's QA

991
00:50:43,410 --> 00:50:48,240
another very competitive especially not

992
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:51,200
the team this one that can have to be
