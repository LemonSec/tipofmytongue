1
00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:07,370
all right so good afternoon everybody I

2
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:10,010
know your butt sore sore your brains are

3
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:11,300
full and most of your thinking please

4
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:14,840
hurry up because we want to go to the

5
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:16,789
pub totally appreciate that so let's

6
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:20,119
start our story our story tonight begins

7
00:00:16,789 --> 00:00:22,100
at a lovely autumn day in New York or

8
00:00:20,119 --> 00:00:25,730
New York City if you're a tourist or New

9
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:30,050
York if you live down so at 8:46 a.m. on

10
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:33,859
September 11th 2001 American Airlines

11
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:36,979
flight 11 crashed into world trout World

12
00:00:33,859 --> 00:00:40,280
Trade Center tower number one about 20

13
00:00:36,979 --> 00:00:43,519
minutes later America and United

14
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:45,920
Airlines flight 175 crashed into tower

15
00:00:43,519 --> 00:00:48,469
number two and right away there are

16
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,659
about two thousand six hundred and six

17
00:00:48,469 --> 00:00:54,199
people killed over six thousand people

18
00:00:50,659 --> 00:00:57,049
injured and in terms of the fire service

19
00:00:54,199 --> 00:01:00,079
there are 343 firefighters from the FDNY

20
00:00:57,049 --> 00:01:01,519
were also killed that day fast forward

21
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:04,760
about half an hour later at Arlington

22
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:07,780
Virginia 937 am American Airlines flight

23
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:10,790
77 hit the west side of the Pentagon

24
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:12,080
nice little photo from that here not one

25
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:13,370
there were only a hundred and eighty

26
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,710
five people killed there should have

27
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:17,240
been a lot more but fortunately there

28
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:18,110
were some renovations going on at that

29
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:20,630
point in time they're actually

30
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:21,740
reinforcing the structure making it

31
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:25,100
basically more bomb-proof

32
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:27,560
and also because you have like very

33
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:29,780
aggressive type-a personalities or very

34
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:31,220
disciplined individuals they managed to

35
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:33,230
evacuate and take care of each other

36
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:35,300
very quickly and so that actually

37
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:37,670
reduced the casualties of September 11th

38
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:40,130
so why are we talking about this at a

39
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:41,630
cybersecurity conference I want to talk

40
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:43,610
a little bit today about the fire

41
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:46,850
service responses in New York and a

42
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:49,400
Washington DC the reason is quite simple

43
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:52,490
we can learn a lot from the fire service

44
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:55,790
on how to manage cyber incidents in our

45
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:57,619
own industry but before we go there as a

46
00:01:55,790 --> 00:02:01,250
good speaker I get to do a little family

47
00:01:57,620 --> 00:02:03,229
self-promoting my day job I'm c74 ing

48
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:05,540
I'm responsible for fraud and cyber at a

49
00:02:03,229 --> 00:02:07,760
large global bank I'm happy to say I'm a

50
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:09,679
CTF winner from Def Con from a long time

51
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:12,260
ago but more

52
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:13,609
and more importantly I used to moonlight

53
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:15,709
as a firefighter in the Northern

54
00:02:13,609 --> 00:02:16,849
Virginia area that our department

55
00:02:15,709 --> 00:02:18,290
actually was one of the departments that

56
00:02:16,849 --> 00:02:19,969
responded to the Pentagon attack in

57
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:21,920
September 11th

58
00:02:19,969 --> 00:02:24,829
i'ma Fire Service I was known for my

59
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:28,208
work ethic a very dedicated hard-working

60
00:02:24,829 --> 00:02:30,469
person you know great leadership

61
00:02:28,209 --> 00:02:32,659
training our people all the time in the

62
00:02:30,469 --> 00:02:35,888
station and of course at the Fire

63
00:02:32,659 --> 00:02:38,149
Academy my professionalism was unfounded

64
00:02:35,889 --> 00:02:41,180
you just don't get more professional

65
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:43,700
than that org - yeah we worked really

66
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:46,159
hard that being said we did do a real

67
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:47,298
stuff in the fire service so it's not

68
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:50,379
just a little bit of show-and-tell and

69
00:02:47,299 --> 00:02:52,370
silliness we're doing firefighter stuff

70
00:02:50,379 --> 00:02:54,048
the stuff we want to talk about today

71
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:56,299
are largely the conclusions of other

72
00:02:54,049 --> 00:02:59,209
people people who are actual experts in

73
00:02:56,299 --> 00:03:00,799
the field so did a lot of research and

74
00:02:59,209 --> 00:03:02,870
did a lot of reading so there's a

75
00:03:00,799 --> 00:03:04,430
thousands of hours of after-action

76
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:06,200
reports and research that went in

77
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:08,780
through the fire department responses in

78
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:11,268
the Pentagon and a Washington DC sorry

79
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:12,919
and in New York and in fact the Pentagon

80
00:03:11,269 --> 00:03:16,190
the response in Northern Virginia has

81
00:03:12,919 --> 00:03:19,669
become a textbook response on what goes

82
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:21,500
well in an incident response these

83
00:03:19,669 --> 00:03:23,030
slides will be available later for those

84
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:25,519
that are actually interested in sources

85
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:26,959
and also I have a little bit of relevant

86
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:28,099
training on Incident Response and

87
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:29,840
incident management from the fire

88
00:03:28,099 --> 00:03:31,849
service perspective so here's a couple

89
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,859
classes I've taken some of them are

90
00:03:31,849 --> 00:03:36,078
actually a week-long and that's a a

91
00:03:33,859 --> 00:03:38,959
week-long on incident management it's a

92
00:03:36,079 --> 00:03:40,459
week you'll never get back that said in

93
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:41,900
my current role is to see so it's

94
00:03:40,459 --> 00:03:44,509
probably the most relevant training I've

95
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:45,650
had so far and most of the training of

96
00:03:44,509 --> 00:03:47,720
course was in the National Incident

97
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:49,250
Management System in the US did of a

98
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:51,259
disclaimer the day started with an

99
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:53,439
American it's not ending with one I

100
00:03:51,259 --> 00:03:55,939
sound like one but I'm actually Canadian

101
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:57,530
so calling me an American is for those

102
00:03:55,939 --> 00:04:00,470
of you or from north of Hadrian's it's

103
00:03:57,530 --> 00:04:01,970
like calling you English so you can't

104
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:03,919
blame me for Trump and that's my only

105
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:05,599
political joke for the day so let's

106
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:07,189
start with FDNY a little bit of

107
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:09,948
background on the incident self

108
00:04:07,189 --> 00:04:11,689
September 11th was the largest fire

109
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:13,939
service response in the history of the

110
00:04:11,689 --> 00:04:15,530
United States of America but before we

111
00:04:13,939 --> 00:04:16,579
go in a little bit of details and a

112
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:18,168
little bit of groundwork

113
00:04:16,579 --> 00:04:20,029
I'm sure you've heard the phrase single

114
00:04:18,168 --> 00:04:22,530
alarm 5 alarm three alarm can you ball

115
00:04:20,029 --> 00:04:24,659
watch TV which shows that have firefight

116
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:27,059
in New York a single arm gets you three

117
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:28,530
engines two ladder trucks and a

118
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:30,510
battalion chief which is the guy little

119
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:32,219
fire SUV who kind of tells people and

120
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:34,890
points at things and gets their picture

121
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:36,030
in the paper pointing every time if you

122
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:37,409
want to get your photo in the paper and

123
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:39,599
a fire scene pointed something while

124
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:41,640
leaning on somebody they've worked it's

125
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:44,760
magic I've even done it

126
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:47,159
a typical five alarm fire in the New

127
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:48,810
York area is forty four units so for the

128
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:51,030
math nerds in the room of course five

129
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:52,440
times six does not equal forty four but

130
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:54,419
you end up getting additional units in

131
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:56,210
there you get light and air units things

132
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:59,370
that provide more lighting on the scene

133
00:04:56,210 --> 00:05:00,989
cylinder changes for your bottles which

134
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:02,340
it's other support units and it's often

135
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:04,230
more importantly a canteen it will

136
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:07,109
typically have stale snicker bars and a

137
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:08,520
watered-down coffee but you're actually

138
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:09,810
I'm always happy to see the canteen is

139
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:12,659
probably your favorite minute on scene

140
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:14,610
the September 11th response included two

141
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:17,300
hundred and fourteen units so there was

142
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:19,950
a lot of people who arrived on the scene

143
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:21,660
so if you can imagine each engine had

144
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:24,090
four people in it each ladder truck had

145
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:26,370
five people and so forth

146
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:28,080
you've got you know a couple thousand

147
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:29,430
people there running around doing all

148
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,109
sorts of stuff so can you imagine

149
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:33,470
running and commanding an incident like

150
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:37,320
that be very complicated and very tricky

151
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:39,840
when we so when I supposed to have a

152
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:41,880
slide here no reminder never mind I

153
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,530
remember what I'm doing now so some of

154
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:45,510
the issues with New York I decided to

155
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:48,090
keep it in New York so they had some

156
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:51,030
communication issues and part of the e

157
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:52,229
issues let me just throw back the

158
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:53,909
information where I am all right

159
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:55,770
I should have reviewed a little bit more

160
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:57,660
in I apologize so these are the main

161
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:59,820
issues that they had here there's six

162
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:01,620
issues and communications I'll talk more

163
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:04,349
about this you guys can read it all of

164
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:06,090
the slides here and these are if you

165
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:07,980
think about how many people have been

166
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:10,530
involved in breaches or cyber incidents

167
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:13,590
in her own world does this look this

168
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:17,369
looked pretty familiar to you I think it

169
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:18,539
does it does to me so common problem

170
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:21,210
with some comments let's talk about

171
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:23,550
communications so for September 11th

172
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:25,710
there was not a protocol in place so

173
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:27,930
when units were dispatched they didn't

174
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:29,609
respond on a radio to say hey engine you

175
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:31,680
know four is responding we're going to

176
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:33,780
miss so there's no confirmation for the

177
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,210
dispatchers to know who even actually

178
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:37,280
received the calls and

179
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:38,690
went to the scene so problem number one

180
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:41,030
of course you don't know who's there but

181
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:43,039
that ties in no accountability via

182
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:43,669
communications and themselves were a

183
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:45,318
problem

184
00:06:43,669 --> 00:06:47,719
these are old-fashioned radios they work

185
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:49,310
their analog radios they weren't the 800

186
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:51,470
and 900 megahertz radios that are in use

187
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:52,699
today with encrypted channels and all

188
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:55,699
sorts of cool stuff with built-in

189
00:06:52,699 --> 00:06:57,770
repeaters these these radios were low

190
00:06:55,699 --> 00:06:58,819
low range of radios that needed portable

191
00:06:57,770 --> 00:07:01,789
repeaters so you have to bring a

192
00:06:58,819 --> 00:07:03,080
repeater with you and fortunately a lot

193
00:07:01,789 --> 00:07:04,430
of those repeaters were set up in the

194
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:06,409
World Trade Center largely around the

195
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:08,810
command center which was between towers

196
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:11,449
1 & 2 so we can see some of the issues

197
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:13,550
where that would have come another

198
00:07:11,449 --> 00:07:15,919
problem they had is the language they

199
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:17,120
spoke when the fire service in New York

200
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:19,250
they used something that's called 10

201
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:21,320
codes so instead of saying we have a

202
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:24,590
fire at a single-family home they would

203
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:26,360
say we have a 1017 which is great if you

204
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:27,500
know what the codes are but now if

205
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:31,250
you're trying to talk to the police

206
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:32,599
department the Harbor Patrol the FBI the

207
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:34,099
other units that are on the scene and

208
00:07:32,599 --> 00:07:36,530
you're used to communicating in 10 codes

209
00:07:34,099 --> 00:07:37,969
that's a bit of a problem it's we don't

210
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:40,008
speak the same language as everybody

211
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:41,419
else there and of course in a security

212
00:07:40,009 --> 00:07:42,229
industry we've never been accused of

213
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:44,120
that ourselves

214
00:07:42,229 --> 00:07:47,360
people understand everything we say in

215
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:48,860
our world right so that's one of the

216
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,810
other things the other problem we had is

217
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:52,190
because the chief because of

218
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:54,590
communications to people who were

219
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:56,210
running the incident didn't know really

220
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:57,859
what was going on very well they're in

221
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:59,299
their command headquarters the incident

222
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:01,340
command post as I mentioned was between

223
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:02,930
towers 1 & 2 as part of the World Trade

224
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:04,880
Center complex they've even know what

225
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:06,289
was going on very well because they

226
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:08,630
couldn't hear four reports from the

227
00:08:06,289 --> 00:08:10,460
people up in there different levels in

228
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:11,750
the building so a bit of a problem how

229
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:12,799
do you steer and manage an incident

230
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:14,419
where you don't know what your teams are

231
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,250
doing and you don't know who's where

232
00:08:14,419 --> 00:08:17,990
what's going on what resources you need

233
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:20,570
are you making progress how you're not

234
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:22,280
making progress normally at a small

235
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:24,050
house fire you can tell how things are

236
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,979
going about watching the smoke if your

237
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:26,810
smoke turns white

238
00:08:24,979 --> 00:08:29,810
that means this fire is being converted

239
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:31,280
to steam or the what and you're making

240
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:32,779
progress if it gets black and thick and

241
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:35,990
becomes more violent you're losing the

242
00:08:32,779 --> 00:08:37,130
battle it's easy to tell here they

243
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:39,979
didn't they didn't have a really good

244
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:41,570
way of knowing and then of course when

245
00:08:39,979 --> 00:08:45,290
the towers came down that complicated

246
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:47,000
things as well so you know we don't need

247
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:47,689
to talk too much about where we went on

248
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,220
that

249
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:51,590
fact the communications were so bad that

250
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:54,200
even when the first tower collapsed

251
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:56,840
which was tower two folks are in Tower

252
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:58,640
one didn't even know about it and you

253
00:08:56,840 --> 00:09:00,710
think they would know right because if a

254
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:03,439
tower collapsing would be credibly loud

255
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:06,830
but fires Believe It or Not are really

256
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:08,090
loud you've got the fire is a loud thing

257
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:09,790
and then of course you shouting each

258
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:12,560
other you're on your breathing apparatus

259
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:13,699
yes you've got adverse conditions these

260
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,500
buildings would have been filled full of

261
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:18,380
smoke because of the fire with the

262
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:20,810
airline fuel you know so you've got all

263
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:22,490
those conditions communications and

264
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:24,500
official awareness is also very very

265
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:27,230
limited so there are a lot of issues and

266
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:28,820
problems with communications now self

267
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:31,010
dispatching is another problem this is

268
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:33,170
self dispatching is when people just

269
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:34,580
show up and there's like well-intended

270
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:36,020
like I have skills

271
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:38,240
I'm a firefighter by gears in a truck

272
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:40,610
I'm just gonna show up and help people

273
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:42,260
did that the other problem that we're

274
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:44,150
going to talk about is recall and that's

275
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:46,550
that that's the process by which you get

276
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:47,240
other people to show up so people who

277
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:49,520
are off-duty

278
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:50,720
it's your right how do you get in how do

279
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:53,360
you notify them to get them to come to

280
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:55,310
work common problems that we have in our

281
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:58,130
incident programs also in a cyber world

282
00:09:55,310 --> 00:10:00,560
hub lower self dispatching wasn't too

283
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:01,700
bad an issue in DC it was horrendous in

284
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:05,479
Northern Virginia we'll talk about that

285
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:07,430
in a second I'm only four units actually

286
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:08,960
self dispatch two of them responded but

287
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:10,849
they get on the radio and said we're

288
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:12,380
going to this put us on and dispatch

289
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:15,230
said no you're not like yeah we are

290
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:17,300
there's a bit of a back-and-forth and so

291
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:18,680
they went a couple of other units people

292
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:21,199
only knew that one of them was there

293
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:23,089
when the engine crew radio say hey run

294
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,980
236 for we've got a few victims we need

295
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:27,290
help getting them out and people like

296
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:28,520
wait who are you where what's going on

297
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:32,829
and that's just not the sort of thing

298
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:35,569
you want my number two thanks for coming

299
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:37,490
so the recall procedure was also a bit

300
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:40,060
of a problem because New York they

301
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:43,280
hadn't tried it in 30 years

302
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:44,000
so it's just okay don't work nope nobody

303
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:46,790
knew how to do it

304
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,380
so being creative and of course it was

305
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:50,060
on the news they asked the media to help

306
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:52,339
out and the media actually put a call

307
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:54,319
saying hey FDNY personnel please report

308
00:10:52,339 --> 00:10:56,510
to your normal station your normal duty

309
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:59,570
station and as a result thankfully

310
00:10:56,510 --> 00:11:00,920
because it was around shift change a lot

311
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:02,690
of people were able to get back to the

312
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:05,990
stations and they're able to police a a

313
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:06,470
whole lot of apparatus any questions so

314
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:08,540
far

315
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:10,279
feel free to make this interactive if

316
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:12,319
you have questions as we go happy to

317
00:11:10,279 --> 00:11:15,439
hear them because I'm sure you want to

318
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:16,730
hear other voices other than mine now

319
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,990
thank you for the courtesy laughs all

320
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:20,750
right moving right along

321
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:22,820
so accountability is basically making

322
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:25,279
sure you know who's there and what

323
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:27,380
people are doing so one of the problems

324
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:29,689
we had in New York is people were told

325
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:31,699
to stage so imagine if you have 200 fire

326
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:33,290
trucks showing up where do you put them

327
00:11:31,699 --> 00:11:35,149
that's obviously a bit of a problem

328
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:38,360
because fire trucks are big especially

329
00:11:35,149 --> 00:11:40,130
in the States so people were told to

330
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:42,110
stage in certain areas but they didn't

331
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:43,730
they went to different places and that

332
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:45,760
made a problematic tracking who was

333
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:47,959
actually arriving and who was there and

334
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:50,540
when you don't know who's on your scene

335
00:11:47,959 --> 00:11:52,518
or who's available and if people are

336
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:53,719
there and you think people are there but

337
00:11:52,519 --> 00:11:55,880
you're not sure then you end up calling

338
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:56,839
for more units because you don't think

339
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:59,240
you've got the right number of people

340
00:11:56,839 --> 00:12:00,589
which meant fire houses had less people

341
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:03,050
to respond to the other things that

342
00:12:00,589 --> 00:12:05,180
we're going on in City because of course

343
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:07,310
New York doesn't stop even with

344
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:09,410
something like 911 happening there were

345
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:10,959
still fires there are accidents the fire

346
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:12,890
department was still very busy that day

347
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:14,810
although interesting enough people

348
00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:16,610
actually called in were very apologetic

349
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:18,290
for calling 911 one that afternoon

350
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:20,899
because they knew they were busy so

351
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:22,880
that's actually kind of nice so yeah as

352
00:12:20,899 --> 00:12:24,440
I just mentioned so a lot of units went

353
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,699
to the World Trade Center that wouldn't

354
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:27,589
necessarily have had to go so that

355
00:12:25,699 --> 00:12:28,910
depleted resources and other needed area

356
00:12:27,589 --> 00:12:31,370
is putting the local population in

357
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:33,439
harm's way and the other problem we had

358
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:35,810
is incident command post as we mentioned

359
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:37,850
it was part of the collapse all of the

360
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:39,290
records for who was on scene all of the

361
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:41,690
fancy command boards where they track

362
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:44,000
all of that was now buried in thousands

363
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:45,709
of tons of rubble so the one source that

364
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,260
they had to track everybody nowadays

365
00:12:45,709 --> 00:12:49,790
it's easy it's all computer run you have

366
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:51,890
a mobile dispatch turtle on your

367
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:53,930
terminal on your fire truck when you

368
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:55,579
respond and hit a button and boom

369
00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:57,589
computers know where you are they

370
00:12:55,579 --> 00:12:58,969
already know your staffing it's all done

371
00:12:57,589 --> 00:13:01,459
your accountability is taken care of

372
00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:02,870
you're not GPS tracking so it's there's

373
00:13:01,459 --> 00:13:04,819
even newer models so you don't even have

374
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:05,839
to put a button cuz like they push the

375
00:13:04,819 --> 00:13:07,399
button they say they know you've left

376
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:08,720
the station we're marking you is

377
00:13:07,399 --> 00:13:10,880
responding so you don't even have to

378
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,700
talk on the radio anymore much easier

379
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,260
back then

380
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:15,390
you had to talk on the radio and of

381
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:18,600
course was only six single-channel and

382
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:20,189
it was very complicated so imagine if

383
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:21,690
that now situation you've got two towers

384
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:22,560
that have gone down and you don't even

385
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:24,900
know who's there

386
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:27,479
bit of a problem situation for New York

387
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:29,520
and so when people were managing their

388
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:31,320
things it was very chaotic and ad-hoc so

389
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:32,850
which is basically oh you outrank me and

390
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:34,980
what do you want me to do there was no

391
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:36,960
coherent plan and how they are moving

392
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:38,820
forward it's the day started with one

393
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:41,370
but due to events in the unforeseen

394
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:43,170
collapse of the towers nobody knew what

395
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:45,510
was going on or really how to control or

396
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:48,569
manage an incident again something we've

397
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:49,950
kind of seen in our industry as well so

398
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:53,010
the chain of command is the other part

399
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:55,110
is who do you actually report to so the

400
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:57,210
first question in a breach at your

401
00:13:55,110 --> 00:14:02,220
organization's do you know who is

402
00:13:57,210 --> 00:14:03,810
actually in charge at my back you know I

403
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:05,550
look at their management team look to me

404
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:07,979
after see so they say ok you're in

405
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:10,109
charge and I respond no I shouldn't be

406
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:11,730
but do I have the authority at the bank

407
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:13,230
to shut down our trading floor if we

408
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:14,970
have you know say a significant

409
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:16,860
situation where we could say we might

410
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:19,020
exfiltrate two to three hundred million

411
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:21,060
euros of money that day because of

412
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:23,160
nefarious things that are going on sure

413
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:26,719
I can shut down our trading floors what

414
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:29,550
I have a job the next day probably not

415
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:31,260
you know so those are very senior

416
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:33,180
business decisions that I have no base

417
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:35,460
is doing my job is ultimately to steer

418
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:38,459
and manage an incident but we'll talk

419
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:40,320
about that again in a second so people

420
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:41,610
had conflicting instructions as you're

421
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,040
gonna get in these complicated things

422
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:46,410
there's a lot of chaos going on between

423
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:48,689
the noise the collapses the broken

424
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:50,670
communications it was if you're part of

425
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:54,000
the expression it was a show there

426
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:57,089
was not top you know loss of life's not

427
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:59,580
awesome life notwithstanding it was not

428
00:14:57,090 --> 00:15:01,230
a good day people were told you had

429
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:02,670
multiple units doing the same thing you

430
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:04,590
had things that would need to get done

431
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:06,390
that weren't being assigned which of

432
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:07,710
course now puts more risk to the

433
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:09,540
firefighters because you're putting more

434
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:10,680
firefighters in harm's way and you're

435
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:12,420
not getting the firefighter and

436
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:13,829
life-saving resources that's where

437
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:16,530
they're all made it to help do civilian

438
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:19,950
rescues so again putting people in a bad

439
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:22,110
thing here we have largely talked about

440
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:25,260
what we have going on so we can skip

441
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:28,170
that slide mutual aid

442
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:31,170
mutual aid is basically the engagement

443
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:32,370
of other departments now FDNY is one of

444
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:34,079
the largest are I think it is the

445
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:36,960
largest fire department in the United

446
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:39,570
States the thought that FDNY would need

447
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:43,860
to call on surrounding jurisdictions for

448
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:45,330
bodies and tools and fire trucks never

449
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:48,240
really occurred to them so they didn't

450
00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:49,950
have you know they it never it never

451
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:52,410
happened so they didn't have a process

452
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:54,300
to even determine what situations need

453
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:56,219
to happen where we need mutual aid how

454
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:57,839
do we need other you know who are we

455
00:15:56,220 --> 00:16:00,060
going to call how are we going to do it

456
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:02,130
they didn't even have a means to call

457
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:04,829
people they don't know who to call

458
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:08,760
and what's wow there's a type of

459
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:10,200
interesting and once they were called

460
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:12,330
how do you integrate the people into the

461
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:13,560
local operations you know these guys

462
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:15,900
they don't know your language they don't

463
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:18,689
know your ten codes they have different

464
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:20,040
staffing what could be a heavy rescue in

465
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:22,020
one jurisdiction might not be a heavy

466
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:24,329
rescue in another people have different

467
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:25,439
definitions for things so these are some

468
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:29,340
of the common problems that that

469
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:32,130
happened there's and when you repeat

470
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:34,050
when people calling requests it was just

471
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:36,270
it was unclear because of these these

472
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:37,560
problems and the other thing they had is

473
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:39,900
they didn't even know what yet

474
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:41,670
surrounding jurisdictions could offer so

475
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:43,709
also problematic hey we need more

476
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:45,170
tankers because you know we don't have

477
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:48,570
an underground water supply anymore

478
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:50,069
where do we get them these were problems

479
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:51,960
that folks have to solve on the ground

480
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:53,670
so not a good day for the fire

481
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:57,390
department in New York for a lot of

482
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:58,680
things but let's try moving some little

483
00:16:57,390 --> 00:17:00,240
lighter let's talk about where things

484
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:02,339
started going a little bit better in

485
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:04,560
Arlington County Virginia which is home

486
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:06,120
to the Pentagon Arlington is a bit of

487
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:08,579
background is the smallest county in the

488
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:11,250
United States so I like 26 square miles

489
00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:15,569
or for those of you that like metric 67s

490
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:17,550
where come whatever opinion is their

491
00:17:15,569 --> 00:17:21,030
entire department consisted at the time

492
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:23,550
of 292 firefighters so if we look at the

493
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:25,170
New York response literally ten almost

494
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:28,230
ten times as many people responded in

495
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:30,780
New York as they were on duty or could

496
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:32,850
be on duty in Arlington they only had

497
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:36,430
ten stations that are staffed 24/7 with

498
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:39,010
13 paramedics and in 2001

499
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:42,040
the council of governance I apologize

500
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:44,430
for the acronyms but just keeping I

501
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:46,420
believe in left text and more pictures

502
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:48,280
the council of governance which is

503
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:50,740
basically the group that managed the

504
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:53,350
local counties they decided to adopt

505
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:54,510
some in the NIMS ICS model which is the

506
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:56,980
National Incident Management System

507
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:58,780
incident command structure so remember I

508
00:17:56,980 --> 00:18:01,059
show that long list of all the crap I've

509
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:03,490
been trained in that's what this is in

510
00:18:01,059 --> 00:18:05,050
fact after 9/11 it became a federal

511
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:06,610
requirement for any department than one

512
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:08,110
in federal funding but all of their

513
00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:09,580
personnel had to be trained in a

514
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:12,610
standard incident management framework

515
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:14,110
which in this case is ICS so northern

516
00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:16,149
genia about six months before they

517
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:18,669
decided to adopt this standardized

518
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:20,559
framework on how to respond and it

519
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:22,960
wasn't just in Arlington it was the

520
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:24,520
neighboring counties was Alexandria and

521
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,590
was Loudoun County where I was a fire

522
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:28,059
fire firefighter with Fairfax County

523
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:30,189
Stafford County in Prince William County

524
00:18:28,059 --> 00:18:32,770
so we're known otherwise known as the

525
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:35,050
Nova cog so if I talk about Nova region

526
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:37,389
by being those five counties and I am

527
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:38,620
going to talk about Nova Region so you

528
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:41,080
know I buy a beer for anybody who

529
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:43,570
remembers the name of the counties so

530
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:45,990
this was very relevant because at the

531
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:47,980
911 response at the Pentagon and

532
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:49,780
challenging I can't give you exact

533
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:52,240
numbers here and we'll explain why in a

534
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:56,830
second there were thousands of people

535
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:58,420
there so it was a big deal happily most

536
00:18:56,830 --> 00:19:01,809
of those people who showed up had a

537
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:04,510
standardized way of working so some of

538
00:19:01,809 --> 00:19:07,750
the things that went well and went bad

539
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:10,720
we had a lot of these you'll see as a

540
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:13,650
common theme and again common to our own

541
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:17,290
world in our old world in cybersecurity

542
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:19,210
so self dispatching this was a big

543
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:20,770
problem at the Pentagon in the Northern

544
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:23,410
Virginia region there were tons of all

545
00:19:20,770 --> 00:19:25,360
into your fire fighters myself being one

546
00:19:23,410 --> 00:19:26,530
of them who decided to throw their gear

547
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:29,590
and their and their pack of their pickup

548
00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:31,450
trucks and add to the Pentagon because

549
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:32,649
they want it to help of course when it

550
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:33,820
get there they've got their gear but

551
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:35,470
they don't have breathing apparatus they

552
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:36,790
don't have any tools and nobody knows

553
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:39,040
who they are what their capabilities

554
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:40,000
what they can do what they can't do what

555
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:41,500
they're trained in what they're good at

556
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,300
what they're bad at there's just

557
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:45,820
somebody with a fire man's hat and they

558
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:47,649
showed up to help and at that point into

559
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:50,379
the first couple days like sure come on

560
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:51,850
in help because you

561
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:53,169
they needed it it got a little more

562
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:55,059
structured which also became a bit of a

563
00:19:53,169 --> 00:19:55,900
problem later the incident commander

564
00:19:55,059 --> 00:19:58,418
James shorts

565
00:19:55,900 --> 00:20:00,490
he ended up installing a fence around

566
00:19:58,419 --> 00:20:02,740
the Pentagon to stop this from happening

567
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:03,850
because this is also the Pentagon this

568
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:06,220
is the headquarters for the United

569
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:07,389
States military you need as a general

570
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:09,490
rule the minimum was secret level

571
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:12,309
clearance just to get at the facility to

572
00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:14,679
walk in the door actually it's a working

573
00:20:12,309 --> 00:20:16,200
sub-basement in north wing well that's a

574
00:20:14,679 --> 00:20:18,490
story for another time

575
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:20,350
so they had they also had a big problem

576
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:21,610
how do you track who was there when I

577
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:24,189
said at the beginning of thousands of

578
00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:26,080
people showed up still today they don't

579
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:29,049
know who is actually at this response a

580
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:30,850
bit problematic because they're handing

581
00:20:29,049 --> 00:20:32,200
out really cool ribbons and awards and

582
00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:33,789
stuff like for hey thanks for coming

583
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,960
people got letters from George Bush at

584
00:20:33,789 --> 00:20:38,470
the time which they actually

585
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:42,250
appreciative of those letters has no

586
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:43,900
political joke intended and so that was

587
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:45,520
great but not everybody who showed up

588
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:48,760
was able to be thanked not everybody who

589
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:50,559
showed up was recognized so it's still

590
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:52,750
problematic because there are going to

591
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:54,330
be medical complications as a result of

592
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:56,289
the things that have happened the

593
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:58,149
byproducts of these accidents to buy

594
00:20:56,289 --> 00:21:00,010
part of the incidence of my products

595
00:20:58,150 --> 00:21:01,900
have been complete combustion are highly

596
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:03,370
carcinogenic and they also do really bad

597
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:05,140
things to your lungs and all sorts of

598
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:07,780
different ways there's all sorts of

599
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:09,640
nasty stuff in there and firefighters

600
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:11,950
more firefighters have died since

601
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:14,200
September 11th because of September 11th

602
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:16,270
but that's again that's a that's a story

603
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:17,890
for the pub not for here I'm you know

604
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:20,500
I'm trying to end on a real positive

605
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:21,970
note kind of not happening right don't

606
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:23,860
worry it gets better

607
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:25,270
so and the other problem of these

608
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:26,830
additional security measures if they

609
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:28,418
actually impacted who was getting there

610
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:31,149
they ended up instituting badge checks

611
00:21:28,419 --> 00:21:33,700
and of course the FBI at that point and

612
00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:35,320
he's gone out they you know taking a

613
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:36,520
little more lead in what was going on

614
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:38,830
they started saying well we should

615
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:39,940
change the badge colors every day which

616
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:41,110
is problematic when you have people

617
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:43,690
coming in and out literally by the

618
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:45,580
hundreds in some cases thousands so

619
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:46,750
shift people would finish those shifts

620
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:48,158
we were waiting three or four hours

621
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:50,350
sometimes for their relief crew you come

622
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:52,539
get them so people were working extra

623
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:54,309
time and pretty hostile conditions

624
00:21:52,539 --> 00:21:55,809
putting themselves to create a risk of

625
00:21:54,309 --> 00:21:57,039
cardiac episodes and things like that

626
00:21:55,809 --> 00:21:59,799
which are actually the number one killer

627
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:01,600
of firefighters in the u.s. random facts

628
00:21:59,799 --> 00:22:03,250
on average about 100 firefighters are

629
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,090
killed in line of duty in the US every

630
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:06,670
year the numbers been

631
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:08,260
pretty consistent more than half of them

632
00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:10,150
are for cardiac related incidents it's

633
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:12,370
not actually from the structural

634
00:22:10,150 --> 00:22:13,870
collapse or fire related things it's

635
00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:15,820
largely because they're out of shape in

636
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:16,929
their heart says yeah I'm done but if

637
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:18,700
you think about it you go from sound

638
00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:20,050
asleep so three minutes later you're

639
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:21,850
going boom down the road full when

640
00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:23,620
you're geared to go do your whatever it

641
00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:26,020
is you got dispatch to do something

642
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:31,989
pretty stressful on the body I mean heck

643
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:34,450
I'm only 24 sorry anyway so going back

644
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:35,980
to command and control we had a bomb

645
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:38,200
prevented and interestings

646
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:40,780
a situation prevent presidential

647
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:43,210
decision directive number 39 says the

648
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:44,860
FBI has jurisdiction on all terrorism

649
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:47,860
attacks on US soil

650
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:49,240
of course the attack took place I see

651
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:51,969
what went on my pictures over the text

652
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:53,470
the text the attack took place at a

653
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:54,970
Department of Defense facility being the

654
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:57,160
Pentagon of course the headquarters as I

655
00:22:54,970 --> 00:22:59,860
mentioned for the US military so lots of

656
00:22:57,160 --> 00:23:02,560
interesting information there and a big

657
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:04,990
hole in the building and of course

658
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:06,010
Pentagon security forces it's a separate

659
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:07,420
group the works for Department of

660
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:08,860
Defense their job is to secure the

661
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:10,930
perimeter of the Pentagon make sure

662
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:14,560
people go in and out as we mentioned the

663
00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:18,840
FBI had jurisdiction so it problematic

664
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:22,629
however everybody played nice together

665
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:25,600
so because of the integration of the the

666
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:27,130
incident command framework can we talk

667
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:29,439
about ICS which we'll talk a little bit

668
00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:31,420
more about that towards the end the the

669
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:32,970
folks there actually had good

670
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:35,410
relationships they knew each other

671
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:37,900
people knew who to talk to and it went

672
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:41,140
well so that was a nice thing the fire

673
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:42,850
service stayed in charge while it was

674
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:44,680
the fire suppression activity and then

675
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:47,409
the FBI took over when it became a crime

676
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:50,080
scene investigation and the chain of the

677
00:23:47,410 --> 00:23:52,810
command was smooth and very well-defined

678
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:56,800
and had actually largely been agreed on

679
00:23:52,810 --> 00:23:58,179
before this happened communications here

680
00:23:56,800 --> 00:24:00,639
was also a bit of an interesting problem

681
00:23:58,180 --> 00:24:02,050
by the way for those of you that are

682
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,670
history buffs and I doubt there's

683
00:24:02,050 --> 00:24:06,340
anybody here in this room know what this

684
00:24:03,670 --> 00:24:08,380
is I wouldn't expect you to but I

685
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:09,850
thought it's worth asking this is what's

686
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:10,960
called the minitor this is what you

687
00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:12,909
would wear if you're a volunteer

688
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:15,640
firefighter or an off-duty firefighter

689
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:17,530
it's kind of like a pager it would make

690
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:19,120
it really annoying beep but only

691
00:24:17,530 --> 00:24:21,490
for certain units and for certain stage

692
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:23,590
station so it was actually mapped to

693
00:24:21,490 --> 00:24:25,690
your individual firehouse so if your

694
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:27,879
fire station was dispatched on something

695
00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:30,340
is back back in those days not all the

696
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:32,260
stations had 24 hours staffing a lot of

697
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:33,639
times the firefighters at least in the

698
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:35,440
volunteer districts would sleep at home

699
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:37,330
because they weren't running calls every

700
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,680
night they weren't super busy so they

701
00:24:37,330 --> 00:24:40,510
carried something like this it would

702
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:41,980
buzz and then they would hear the

703
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:43,180
dispatcher radio announcement they would

704
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:45,100
go to the firehouse and they would know

705
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:47,380
why what piece of equipment anything

706
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:49,469
they'd know where to go really cool a

707
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:53,700
little bit of fire history there that

708
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:56,380
actually I've broken several of those

709
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:57,760
firefighters played Kings so part of the

710
00:24:56,380 --> 00:25:00,490
radio issues of course for the Pentagon

711
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:03,100
it's a secure facility radio waves are

712
00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:05,530
by design not supposed to be going

713
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:07,360
places so you really have to rely on

714
00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:09,940
basically line-of-sight communications

715
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:11,290
on your radios and even then it didn't

716
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:13,540
work very well so that was a fairly

717
00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:16,210
problematic so they decided well let's

718
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:17,830
use cell phones of course I had a big

719
00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:20,800
incident like that the cell phone towers

720
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:22,330
get saturated since 9/11 they actually

721
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:24,280
have priority numbers and every member

722
00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:25,570
of a critical infrastructure team has a

723
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:28,149
little card I actually had one of my

724
00:25:25,570 --> 00:25:29,649
wallet with a special number to dial and

725
00:25:28,150 --> 00:25:32,410
all that kind of stuff that's a priority

726
00:25:29,650 --> 00:25:33,850
number so you can actually use a mobile

727
00:25:32,410 --> 00:25:35,740
communication system when they're

728
00:25:33,850 --> 00:25:38,379
saturated if there's a large scale event

729
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:40,720
of some kind going on so but cell phones

730
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:44,230
were working pagers actually worked

731
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:46,690
really well but not everybody had pagers

732
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:49,210
so bit problematic here again the

733
00:25:46,690 --> 00:25:51,130
communications as a recurring theme not

734
00:25:49,210 --> 00:25:53,410
a good thing the other thing that went

735
00:25:51,130 --> 00:25:55,390
wrong at the Pentagon was the lack of a

736
00:25:53,410 --> 00:25:57,070
joint information center as a rule of

737
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:59,830
thumb when you're doing a joint command

738
00:25:57,070 --> 00:26:01,270
with inter agencies you end up having an

739
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:03,550
information center whose job it is to

740
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:05,050
talk to the media because the Pentagon

741
00:26:03,550 --> 00:26:07,149
would normally would have normally been

742
00:26:05,050 --> 00:26:09,610
staffed with several thousand people on

743
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:11,050
the west side and you know they're

744
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:12,760
expecting several thousand casualties

745
00:26:11,050 --> 00:26:14,560
and that was what was being reported in

746
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:16,030
the media it was less than 200

747
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:18,190
fortunately but so there was a lot of

748
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:20,110
misinformation going up there which was

749
00:26:18,190 --> 00:26:22,990
of course causing additional panic and

750
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:24,189
drama with civilians and that's just not

751
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:28,090
a good thing you always want to control

752
00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:29,620
your message and yeah talked about that

753
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:30,178
and the other probably of course with it

754
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:31,529
we have the

755
00:26:30,179 --> 00:26:33,090
and on one of the normal things you do

756
00:26:31,529 --> 00:26:35,190
in the fire service is you get to know

757
00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:37,350
your response area you know for example

758
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:39,090
if you've got a shopping center you know

759
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:41,129
what all the entrance points are you

760
00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:43,230
know what to call them you know where to

761
00:26:41,129 --> 00:26:44,699
plug your fire truck in the get water or

762
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:46,230
to push water you know where to get it

763
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:48,059
you know where the connector you do

764
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:49,200
what's called pre-planning of course

765
00:26:48,059 --> 00:26:50,759
it's a pentagon they're not really

766
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,769
inviting the fire department around so

767
00:26:50,759 --> 00:26:55,259
don't do all that kind of stuff they do

768
00:26:52,769 --> 00:26:56,879
now but they didn't then so this was

769
00:26:55,259 --> 00:26:58,490
also a bit of a problem for obvious

770
00:26:56,879 --> 00:27:02,309
reasons

771
00:26:58,490 --> 00:27:04,080
questions where we are so far all right

772
00:27:02,309 --> 00:27:39,299
still with us you wanna go to the pub I

773
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:41,428
do see had no it wasn't so the question

774
00:27:39,299 --> 00:27:42,720
for those who didn't hear it apologize

775
00:27:41,429 --> 00:27:44,460
for the oversimplification was

776
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,929
ultimately who actually ran the incident

777
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:48,210
because over here it's a little

778
00:27:45,929 --> 00:27:50,460
different and how it played out for the

779
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:51,840
incident commander for the for the first

780
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:54,450
few days while they were doing fire

781
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:56,428
suppression was a Arlington County Fire

782
00:27:54,450 --> 00:27:58,139
Department assistant chief Schwartz he

783
00:27:56,429 --> 00:27:59,610
was the formal incident commander for

784
00:27:58,139 --> 00:28:01,559
the large majority of the incident there

785
00:27:59,610 --> 00:28:03,600
was an FBI agent whose name I don't

786
00:28:01,559 --> 00:28:05,490
remember who was actually working

787
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:08,129
side-by-side with him as a primary

788
00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:09,809
liaison but overall the fire service

789
00:28:08,129 --> 00:28:11,820
while there was still fire to be put out

790
00:28:09,809 --> 00:28:14,340
and a rescue activities to perform the

791
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:16,408
fire department was in charge once the

792
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:17,939
the fire risk was taking care of the

793
00:28:16,409 --> 00:28:19,769
risk of structural collapse in fact they

794
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:21,720
called the evacuation tones four times

795
00:28:19,769 --> 00:28:23,279
which is frustrating for the firefighter

796
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:25,769
you make progress putting the fire out

797
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:27,749
then you have to evacuate and then the

798
00:28:25,769 --> 00:28:29,100
fire goes back where you were and allow

799
00:28:27,749 --> 00:28:29,460
me just work for four or five hours for

800
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:32,820
nothing

801
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:34,499
you go back and forth but uh fire the

802
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:37,529
FBI took over what's once the fire

803
00:28:34,499 --> 00:28:40,019
element whereas without anything else

804
00:28:37,529 --> 00:28:42,460
and while I'm going I need to speed up

805
00:28:40,019 --> 00:28:43,929
sorry so

806
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:45,970
the contamination is a bit of an issue

807
00:28:43,929 --> 00:28:48,249
at first because you've got all the bad

808
00:28:45,970 --> 00:28:49,960
stuff in the air and when you're dealing

809
00:28:48,249 --> 00:28:52,269
with a lot of unburned jet fuel which is

810
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:53,529
also toxic you have to be contaminant

811
00:28:52,269 --> 00:28:54,970
your firefighters there when you have a

812
00:28:53,529 --> 00:28:57,070
lot of firefighters there there's a lot

813
00:28:54,970 --> 00:28:59,049
of infrastructure needed in an event

814
00:28:57,070 --> 00:29:00,668
I've got a really cool picture towards

815
00:28:59,049 --> 00:29:02,230
the end that actually shows the setup

816
00:29:00,669 --> 00:29:04,539
the use of the Pentagon for the

817
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:06,190
infrastructure batteries you don't think

818
00:29:04,539 --> 00:29:08,559
much about batteries you typically have

819
00:29:06,190 --> 00:29:10,539
a box light on your fire truck for each

820
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:12,999
firefighter that that light lasts about

821
00:29:10,539 --> 00:29:14,919
six hours which is great for even

822
00:29:12,999 --> 00:29:18,249
advanced operations now the Pentagon of

823
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:19,899
course you know there's no lighting if

824
00:29:18,249 --> 00:29:22,149
the power's out for obvious reasons you

825
00:29:19,899 --> 00:29:24,039
know they needed batteries in fact they

826
00:29:22,149 --> 00:29:25,658
call the local Home Depot which is the

827
00:29:24,039 --> 00:29:29,440
equivalent of what's the hardware Center

828
00:29:25,659 --> 00:29:33,460
here again that's Orange or so yeah

829
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:35,559
thank you that one and they call the

830
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:37,659
hope in about 10 10 minutes at 10:00

831
00:29:35,559 --> 00:29:39,549
p.m. you have actually open it useful

832
00:29:37,659 --> 00:29:41,169
times over there which is helpful I live

833
00:29:39,549 --> 00:29:43,690
in Belgium stuff closes at 5:00 and 6:00

834
00:29:41,169 --> 00:29:45,850
it's frustrating but so they call that

835
00:29:43,690 --> 00:29:50,019
about an hour later a truck with every

836
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:51,668
battery in the shop showed up so kind of

837
00:29:50,019 --> 00:29:54,220
cool to see the community come so but

838
00:29:51,669 --> 00:29:56,860
logistics was a is a huge problem in a

839
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:59,169
large scale events air supply is also a

840
00:29:56,860 --> 00:30:01,240
bit of a problem and I don't mean that

841
00:29:59,169 --> 00:30:03,399
great eighties band I put this up here

842
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:05,350
to make sure you're all awake you know

843
00:30:03,399 --> 00:30:07,869
I'm all out of love and so are my bad

844
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:09,129
jokes but moving back along air supply

845
00:30:07,869 --> 00:30:10,619
was an issue because when you have that

846
00:30:09,129 --> 00:30:12,789
many firefighters during fire

847
00:30:10,619 --> 00:30:14,678
suppression activities and you're on

848
00:30:12,789 --> 00:30:16,570
your apparatus apparatus you typically

849
00:30:14,679 --> 00:30:19,539
get depending on your fitness levels and

850
00:30:16,570 --> 00:30:20,710
activity levels 30 to 60-minute use and

851
00:30:19,539 --> 00:30:22,629
when you're talking several hundred

852
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:24,970
people doing operations on the ground at

853
00:30:22,629 --> 00:30:27,248
any given time you need quite a bit of

854
00:30:24,970 --> 00:30:30,249
infrastructure to refill those cylinders

855
00:30:27,249 --> 00:30:31,749
to complicate matters not everybody in

856
00:30:30,249 --> 00:30:35,350
the Northern Virginia District use the

857
00:30:31,749 --> 00:30:37,299
same brand of cylinders so some people

858
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:39,100
had a company called MSA and other

859
00:30:37,299 --> 00:30:42,158
companies use a dragger which is German

860
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:44,428
company a lot of folks you Scott and so

861
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:46,480
that added to the complications again

862
00:30:44,429 --> 00:30:48,789
I'm still going back to the air supply

863
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:50,289
the badging we talked about how do you

864
00:30:48,789 --> 00:30:52,269
actually identify the people that are

865
00:30:50,289 --> 00:30:53,640
coming in and out that was also

866
00:30:52,269 --> 00:30:56,260
problematic there

867
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:57,760
nowadays is simple you get a badge it

868
00:30:56,260 --> 00:31:00,040
has a little two-dimensional barcode

869
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:01,750
with your nationally accredited records

870
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:04,149
and certifications on there so you can

871
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:05,980
show up at a scene they can scan it with

872
00:31:04,150 --> 00:31:07,810
a certain kind of reader and they know

873
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:09,580
you're trained in hazardous materials

874
00:31:07,810 --> 00:31:12,040
you're trained in technical rescue you

875
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:13,870
can drive fire trucks aerials well all

876
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:15,730
these things or you can't do any of

877
00:31:13,870 --> 00:31:16,810
these things now there's a standardized

878
00:31:15,730 --> 00:31:19,450
approach in Northern Virginia that's

879
00:31:16,810 --> 00:31:20,590
actually all in everybody's ID card so

880
00:31:19,450 --> 00:31:22,330
that's actually really helpful

881
00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:25,360
especially when you're doing mutual aid

882
00:31:22,330 --> 00:31:28,780
and and complex situations on a little

883
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:30,399
fun story this is a story one of the

884
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:33,370
problems with the Pentagon is one of the

885
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:36,120
main access routes had a stone foot

886
00:31:33,370 --> 00:31:39,340
bridge and that foot bridge was low and

887
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:41,500
to do there's a in the fire service if

888
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:43,629
you've got big flyer you want big water

889
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:46,180
so that's where you use typically a

890
00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:47,850
tiller truck or a ladder truck I do you

891
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:51,370
guys know what tiller trucks are I

892
00:31:47,850 --> 00:31:53,350
didn't think so so here's a picture of

893
00:31:51,370 --> 00:31:55,149
one this is the one it's the classic

894
00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:58,870
fire truck you see with the driver in

895
00:31:55,150 --> 00:32:00,220
the back we're good it does so pretty

896
00:31:58,870 --> 00:32:02,229
tall you put out somebody who steers at

897
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:04,990
the back and you know the big rig at the

898
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:06,610
front so these guys it's a small

899
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:10,690
volunteer fire company this little fire

900
00:32:06,610 --> 00:32:13,689
truck picture here it's a 1955 b85 Mac

901
00:32:10,690 --> 00:32:15,460
tiller truck unless you're a nerd you

902
00:32:13,690 --> 00:32:17,170
won't know anything about that but it's

903
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:18,700
really cool it's an old vintage piece

904
00:32:17,170 --> 00:32:21,520
but the cool thing about it is called an

905
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:22,690
open cab fire truck they're not allowed

906
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:25,389
anymore because of health and safety

907
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:28,270
regulations the bottom line is all that

908
00:32:25,390 --> 00:32:30,160
top stuff wasn't there and it's because

909
00:32:28,270 --> 00:32:32,620
it's older and fire trucks have gotten

910
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:34,810
in the u.s. much bigger this fire truck

911
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:37,629
somebody knew about it and they called

912
00:32:34,810 --> 00:32:38,950
for and these guys got dispatch drove

913
00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:40,780
all the way to the Pentagon going about

914
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:42,730
65 miles an hour because that's as fast

915
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:45,460
as the truck would go downhill with a

916
00:32:42,730 --> 00:32:47,950
good wind and it went under the bridge

917
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:49,360
and they were able to flow about eight

918
00:32:47,950 --> 00:32:51,400
nine hundred gallons of water per minute

919
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:53,679
so multiply that by four roughly four

920
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:57,220
liters per minute and so that helps

921
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:59,560
until Arlington decided to cut the cab

922
00:32:57,220 --> 00:33:00,880
tops off of there tiller truck and then

923
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:02,310
brought it in because that one could be

924
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:05,020
about 2,000 gallons of water per minute

925
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:07,000
so they got very creative and how they

926
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:09,120
solve some of their logistics of

927
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:11,350
rotary k12 saw a little bit of willpower

928
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:15,219
by the way those fire trucks costs

929
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:17,918
almost a million dollars I would love to

930
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:19,600
be the guy who saw I gotta admit

931
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:21,039
so anytime you're doing extended

932
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:23,110
operations support you need toilet

933
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:25,658
facilities the canteen I mentioned all

934
00:33:23,110 --> 00:33:28,330
of these things are problematic and also

935
00:33:25,659 --> 00:33:30,130
relevant and large investigations and

936
00:33:28,330 --> 00:33:32,500
cyber incidents at our own organizations

937
00:33:30,130 --> 00:33:34,450
you can't always deliver pizza deliver

938
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:35,559
to two o'clock in the morning and Haken

939
00:33:34,450 --> 00:33:37,390
that part of the world I live in

940
00:33:35,559 --> 00:33:39,940
nothing's open at two o'clock in the

941
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:41,320
morning it's not even open outside I

942
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:44,500
mean not even churches were open on

943
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:46,689
Sunday in Belgium it's a sorry Pat joke

944
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:48,400
again mutual aid as I mentioned we have

945
00:33:46,690 --> 00:33:49,809
the COG agreement in place so all the

946
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:51,039
fire departments we had standardized

947
00:33:49,809 --> 00:33:53,710
playbooks which we'll come to in a

948
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:55,809
second there was already an exercise

949
00:33:53,710 --> 00:33:58,510
planned for the Pentagon so there was a

950
00:33:55,809 --> 00:34:00,940
lot of homework already done on how to

951
00:33:58,510 --> 00:34:03,280
respond to a big event at the Pentagon

952
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:05,620
so Arlington County Alexandria County

953
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:07,570
knew how to make stuff work they have

954
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:08,739
standardized response playbook so I'll

955
00:34:07,570 --> 00:34:11,349
show you an example of that in just a

956
00:34:08,739 --> 00:34:14,049
second also have standard communication

957
00:34:11,349 --> 00:34:16,089
protocols each County is assigned with a

958
00:34:14,050 --> 00:34:19,000
number of my fire my County was number

959
00:34:16,089 --> 00:34:20,739
six so our fire trucks add six aza fire

960
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:23,879
station 11 it said six eleven on our

961
00:34:20,739 --> 00:34:25,928
fire truck our radio channel was six

962
00:34:23,879 --> 00:34:28,359
really you got to keep it simple for

963
00:34:25,929 --> 00:34:30,280
firefighters and it works so we all know

964
00:34:28,359 --> 00:34:33,279
how to talk to each other we knew if we

965
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:34,450
talked you know if engine 514 called we

966
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:36,460
knew they're from Prince William County

967
00:34:34,449 --> 00:34:38,830
it's a really easy way of knowing who

968
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:42,010
they are and we had standard builds in

969
00:34:38,830 --> 00:34:45,879
terms of what all of our units work also

970
00:34:42,010 --> 00:34:47,710
back to this one of the other things

971
00:34:45,879 --> 00:34:49,899
that was really cool is all the

972
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:51,820
supporting jurisdictions in the area

973
00:34:49,899 --> 00:34:53,859
basically called Arlington hey whatever

974
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:56,050
you need just say the word we'll have it

975
00:34:53,859 --> 00:34:58,540
on standby thing I love about the fire

976
00:34:56,050 --> 00:35:00,369
service is it it is truly a family that

977
00:34:58,540 --> 00:35:02,980
help each other and it's it's one of the

978
00:35:00,369 --> 00:35:04,630
things I miss so moving on to things

979
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:06,609
let's lighten it up a little bit and

980
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:08,320
let's talk on how to have our own

981
00:35:06,609 --> 00:35:10,359
incident responses and our own world's

982
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:13,060
take some of the lessons from September

983
00:35:10,359 --> 00:35:14,529
11th and actually get some benefit from

984
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:16,070
the things that went horribly wrong but

985
00:35:14,530 --> 00:35:18,230
also the things that went well

986
00:35:16,070 --> 00:35:20,150
so the first one we need to look at of

987
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:21,880
course is command and control we're

988
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:24,680
going to talk about communications and

989
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:26,450
training and the exercises associated

990
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:28,210
with this all of these after-action

991
00:35:26,450 --> 00:35:30,319
reports identified about half a dozen

992
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:32,360
elements and they were all common themes

993
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:35,270
but I think the three most important

994
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:38,180
ones are these three so command and

995
00:35:35,270 --> 00:35:40,910
control in order Virginia we have a

996
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:43,040
manual that has the talked about how to

997
00:35:40,910 --> 00:35:44,629
do command and control how many of us

998
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:49,070
have where we work have infinite

999
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:51,410
response plans and stop please help me

1000
00:35:49,070 --> 00:35:53,150
out here Wake optical alright how many

1001
00:35:51,410 --> 00:35:54,910
of you guys don't have incident response

1002
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:56,780
plans where you work

1003
00:35:54,910 --> 00:35:57,920
okay that's should've been the better

1004
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:59,090
question all right because that means

1005
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:00,440
you don't have to put you at most of you

1006
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:01,070
don't put your hands up alright so I'm

1007
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:04,790
happy with that

1008
00:36:01,070 --> 00:36:09,110
do your incident command modules have a

1009
00:36:04,790 --> 00:36:16,370
detailed basically process and procedure

1010
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:19,340
on how to manage an incident so we do

1011
00:36:16,370 --> 00:36:21,950
and I'll show you what it looks like but

1012
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:23,780
the first problem is who's in charge as

1013
00:36:21,950 --> 00:36:25,609
I mentioned it shouldn't be the see so

1014
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:27,350
in my opinion we shouldn't be in charge

1015
00:36:25,610 --> 00:36:28,550
I'll talk about where we should be in

1016
00:36:27,350 --> 00:36:30,350
just a second

1017
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:32,600
at my old bank where I was working in

1018
00:36:30,350 --> 00:36:34,279
the u.s. our general counsel for

1019
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:35,990
significant events they were in charge

1020
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:39,170
because at some point you want the

1021
00:36:35,990 --> 00:36:41,750
lawyers making the big decisions span of

1022
00:36:39,170 --> 00:36:43,280
control you don't want more than five to

1023
00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:45,320
seven people reporting to you at any

1024
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:47,180
given time on in a crisis situation

1025
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:48,980
because it's hard to manage resources

1026
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:52,899
more than that there have been lots of

1027
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:54,830
workplace studies five to seven is ideal

1028
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:56,930
for those of you that have more than

1029
00:36:54,830 --> 00:36:58,310
that report reporting to you at work you

1030
00:36:56,930 --> 00:37:00,589
have my sympathies and I've got the same

1031
00:36:58,310 --> 00:37:03,080
problem chain of command is also a bit

1032
00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:05,030
of an issue and that's really whose

1033
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:06,920
instructions do you actually follow if

1034
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:09,620
there's a cyber breach at your

1035
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:11,030
organization who is actually the person

1036
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:12,470
you should be listening to if you're

1037
00:37:11,030 --> 00:37:14,360
running the saw or if you're running the

1038
00:37:12,470 --> 00:37:16,339
team they're doing their forensics who

1039
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:18,950
is the one person that should be telling

1040
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:22,580
you what you need to do next is that

1041
00:37:18,950 --> 00:37:24,350
clearly defined these are the three

1042
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:27,860
these are things that you really need to

1043
00:37:24,350 --> 00:37:28,790
address so the other considerations with

1044
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:31,130
that you

1045
00:37:28,790 --> 00:37:32,750
want to have your crew on a general

1046
00:37:31,130 --> 00:37:34,970
crisis management framework in your

1047
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:37,040
organization the u.s. is National

1048
00:37:34,970 --> 00:37:39,230
Incident Management System is I think a

1049
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:41,570
very good crisis management framework

1050
00:37:39,230 --> 00:37:43,460
here in the UK and across Europe we do

1051
00:37:41,570 --> 00:37:45,830
gold silver bronze three-tier things

1052
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:47,540
which are great for what levels but they

1053
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:50,000
don't actually go to their granularity

1054
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:52,279
on an incidence actually how to

1055
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:54,320
tactically manage things in a broad way

1056
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:56,150
they're more operations geared and

1057
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:58,940
definitely more for law enforcement it's

1058
00:37:56,150 --> 00:38:00,710
not a good generic framework this is

1059
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:01,850
just my own opinion here those of you

1060
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:04,310
who've been involved in those things or

1061
00:38:01,850 --> 00:38:06,529
use them I have made no offence but a

1062
00:38:04,310 --> 00:38:08,060
generation Eric framework is important

1063
00:38:06,530 --> 00:38:11,240
because you can activate the pieces you

1064
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:12,830
need and you don't and don't activate

1065
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:15,200
the pieces you don't so it needs to be

1066
00:38:12,830 --> 00:38:16,580
very modular and more importantly you

1067
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:19,129
need to have a list of well-defined

1068
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:20,720
roles you need to plan ahead what are

1069
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:23,690
all the functions that we are going to

1070
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:26,509
need in a worse case of event how do we

1071
00:38:23,690 --> 00:38:27,860
define those roles how do we train how

1072
00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:29,300
do we identify who's going to be in

1073
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:31,040
those roles and then how do we train

1074
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:33,710
those people so that when an event

1075
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:37,250
happens they actually know what to do

1076
00:38:33,710 --> 00:38:40,220
and I highly recommend that you separate

1077
00:38:37,250 --> 00:38:42,230
the management sort of y'all from the

1078
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:44,299
operations side because the last thing

1079
00:38:42,230 --> 00:38:46,880
your forensics teams need is the CIO the

1080
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:48,200
C so the CEO somebody's showing up hey

1081
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:50,720
how long it's going to take because on

1082
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:52,220
TV it takes five minutes you know some

1083
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:54,140
of our queries of course take the days

1084
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:56,540
to run like if we go away if we have a

1085
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:58,700
situation at my bank it can sometimes

1086
00:38:56,540 --> 00:39:00,200
take us days to run queries to find out

1087
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:02,899
what's the potential impact of certain

1088
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:04,580
situations it's been a tough battle to

1089
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:06,110
get management to understand that that's

1090
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:09,770
how the real world works

1091
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:13,580
CSI screw you you have really ruin it

1092
00:39:09,770 --> 00:39:16,340
for all of us it just doesn't help so

1093
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:18,140
this is this is the National Incident

1094
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:20,990
Management generic command structure

1095
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:23,359
this is how they manage all incidents in

1096
00:39:20,990 --> 00:39:26,060
the fire service this is what we use the

1097
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:27,710
FBI this is what they use as a bit of

1098
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:28,940
history this command structure was

1099
00:39:27,710 --> 00:39:31,610
actually developed by California

1100
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:34,490
firefighters as a way to manage large

1101
00:39:31,610 --> 00:39:36,560
area fire responses and it's now the

1102
00:39:34,490 --> 00:39:38,450
standard for the u.s. you really got

1103
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:40,279
four main branches just at the top you

1104
00:39:38,450 --> 00:39:41,810
have your incident commander generic

1105
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:42,410
term but that is the person who's in

1106
00:39:41,810 --> 00:39:44,299
charge

1107
00:39:42,410 --> 00:39:46,520
that doesn't have to be the most senior

1108
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:48,170
person but it has to be a person who's

1109
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:50,300
good at coordinating and organizing and

1110
00:39:48,170 --> 00:39:52,400
managing things you've got then your

1111
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:53,420
public information officer in our world

1112
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,650
this would be a communications

1113
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:56,540
department these are the people that'll

1114
00:39:54,650 --> 00:39:58,370
talk with your social media these are

1115
00:39:56,540 --> 00:40:00,080
people that yeah basically do your

1116
00:39:58,370 --> 00:40:01,790
outbound communications you have

1117
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:03,920
somebody who does liaison in so if you

1118
00:40:01,790 --> 00:40:05,120
are getting like calling a man from

1119
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:07,130
police Scotland to come down and help

1120
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:09,170
you out you know we want somebody there

1121
00:40:07,130 --> 00:40:10,790
to interface with police Scotland or if

1122
00:40:09,170 --> 00:40:12,500
you've got third party companies or four

1123
00:40:10,790 --> 00:40:14,240
vendors involved you need to have a

1124
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:17,060
dedicated person or a dedicated team

1125
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:19,160
whose sole job is interacting with the

1126
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:20,720
other organizations you have there we

1127
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:23,060
have course have a safety officer in the

1128
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:27,290
fire service because we're firefighters

1129
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:28,910
and we we do silly things and yeah I'm I

1130
00:40:27,290 --> 00:40:30,320
have multiple injuries I kept showing

1131
00:40:28,910 --> 00:40:32,420
you those pictures from stuff I've done

1132
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:33,380
on duty that's really stupid Beth one

1133
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:35,900
getting carbon monoxide poisoning

1134
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:38,480
wearing a Santa suit on top of the fire

1135
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:40,730
truck during a Santa Claus Parade that's

1136
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:42,980
why we have safety officers people like

1137
00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:45,380
me but moving right along to the core

1138
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:47,240
part this is split into four sessions

1139
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:48,740
you have operations these are basically

1140
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:50,569
the people that are putting water on the

1141
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:53,839
fire the ones that are doing the real

1142
00:40:50,570 --> 00:40:55,610
work so this would be in my mind your

1143
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:57,980
sock manager or whoever's running your

1144
00:40:55,610 --> 00:41:00,230
security operations on the planning side

1145
00:40:57,980 --> 00:41:01,520
of things that's I think where the CSO

1146
00:41:00,230 --> 00:41:04,520
should go this is really what are you

1147
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:06,860
doing over the next 12 to 24 hours what

1148
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:09,080
are your next steps how what is it you

1149
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:10,730
need to do logistics is straightforward

1150
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:14,120
once you decided what you need to do

1151
00:41:10,730 --> 00:41:15,650
their job is to figure out you know how

1152
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:17,630
to get you the supplies if you need more

1153
00:41:15,650 --> 00:41:20,270
people if you need more tools if you

1154
00:41:17,630 --> 00:41:22,790
need Pizza whatever it is the job of the

1155
00:41:20,270 --> 00:41:24,970
logistics branch is to solve that now

1156
00:41:22,790 --> 00:41:27,200
finance of course are the unsung heroes

1157
00:41:24,970 --> 00:41:28,759
let's face it if you have a significant

1158
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,750
incident the purse strings open up and

1159
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:32,390
checkbooks are there

1160
00:41:29,750 --> 00:41:33,890
spend what you need but an order you

1161
00:41:32,390 --> 00:41:36,770
better be able to defend every pence you

1162
00:41:33,890 --> 00:41:38,330
spent on the back end so get the finance

1163
00:41:36,770 --> 00:41:40,009
people involved right away so you can

1164
00:41:38,330 --> 00:41:42,170
have that paper trail procurement we'll

1165
00:41:40,010 --> 00:41:43,610
make exceptions if you don't have an

1166
00:41:42,170 --> 00:41:45,710
arrangement with a third party and help

1167
00:41:43,610 --> 00:41:47,660
you with your breach responses do it now

1168
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:49,460
because it'll be a lot cheaper if you

1169
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:51,319
have a contract signed and the day off

1170
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:54,170
you know there's a difference between a

1171
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:55,850
digit and those daily rates typically so

1172
00:41:54,170 --> 00:41:57,470
at a high level this

1173
00:41:55,850 --> 00:41:58,970
is very generic command structure does

1174
00:41:57,470 --> 00:42:01,580
this make sense for you guys pretty

1175
00:41:58,970 --> 00:42:04,129
clear I like this we've actually mapped

1176
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:05,450
this and at my back my old back we are

1177
00:42:04,130 --> 00:42:08,090
currently mapping this right now where I

1178
00:42:05,450 --> 00:42:10,930
work to do our incident management and

1179
00:42:08,090 --> 00:42:13,250
incident response so command and control

1180
00:42:10,930 --> 00:42:15,589
they need to be well defined but they

1181
00:42:13,250 --> 00:42:17,990
still need to be generic you have to

1182
00:42:15,590 --> 00:42:19,130
train people that I wanted to end on a

1183
00:42:17,990 --> 00:42:21,560
lighter note so the pictures are gonna

1184
00:42:19,130 --> 00:42:23,840
be more fun this was actually a joke

1185
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:26,120
picture by it was I think in Norwegian

1186
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:27,470
Fire Department these train tracks

1187
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:29,240
weren't in use but they're not training

1188
00:42:27,470 --> 00:42:31,810
I thought that would be funny it was of

1189
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:34,399
course a viral photo but I just loved it

1190
00:42:31,810 --> 00:42:36,740
you have to train people make sure that

1191
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:38,960
the rolls that you do are also mapped to

1192
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:40,040
how your organization works you want to

1193
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:40,670
be you want to have some kind of

1194
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:43,670
alignment

1195
00:42:40,670 --> 00:42:45,170
we relied your contact information make

1196
00:42:43,670 --> 00:42:46,850
sure that it's verified there's nothing

1197
00:42:45,170 --> 00:42:48,470
worse than trying to call people and

1198
00:42:46,850 --> 00:42:49,040
they don't even work at your institution

1199
00:42:48,470 --> 00:42:53,270
anymore

1200
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:56,330
not helpful so have multiple alternates

1201
00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:58,970
offer all of your roles and of course

1202
00:42:56,330 --> 00:43:00,620
with a with these structures you only

1203
00:42:58,970 --> 00:43:03,160
activate the bits you need if it's not a

1204
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:05,870
big incident don't activate everybody

1205
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:07,759
communications very straightforward

1206
00:43:05,870 --> 00:43:10,220
first of all manage with your

1207
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:12,290
expectation or expectations with your

1208
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:15,189
executive teams talk to them about how

1209
00:43:12,290 --> 00:43:17,480
long investigations take if it's not TV

1210
00:43:15,190 --> 00:43:18,590
that will save you a whole lot of time

1211
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:19,970
so that they don't fall in your ever

1212
00:43:18,590 --> 00:43:22,130
behalf now are looking for updates when

1213
00:43:19,970 --> 00:43:24,319
you're trying to do your job you know

1214
00:43:22,130 --> 00:43:26,450
make sure internally you have a formal

1215
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:28,580
way of communicating with your executive

1216
00:43:26,450 --> 00:43:30,890
team and that they know what it is and

1217
00:43:28,580 --> 00:43:33,350
that they bought off on it for your

1218
00:43:30,890 --> 00:43:35,089
external communications already go

1219
00:43:33,350 --> 00:43:37,069
through legal and your social media

1220
00:43:35,090 --> 00:43:38,330
departments and all that have stuff

1221
00:43:37,070 --> 00:43:40,550
that's pre-approved and have

1222
00:43:38,330 --> 00:43:42,890
fill-in-the-blank information so you

1223
00:43:40,550 --> 00:43:44,870
just you just put in some values and

1224
00:43:42,890 --> 00:43:47,210
nobody's arguing about verbiage and

1225
00:43:44,870 --> 00:43:48,830
today's social media world you need to

1226
00:43:47,210 --> 00:43:50,150
respond quickly and you need to respond

1227
00:43:48,830 --> 00:43:52,430
accurately remember the Tesco breach

1228
00:43:50,150 --> 00:43:54,050
from about a year and a half ago it hit

1229
00:43:52,430 --> 00:43:56,569
the news on a Saturday was gone on a

1230
00:43:54,050 --> 00:44:00,210
Tuesday they managed it well then of

1231
00:43:56,570 --> 00:44:02,849
course there's talk talk exactly

1232
00:44:00,210 --> 00:44:05,010
so we taught social media expectations

1233
00:44:02,849 --> 00:44:06,630
we've talked about that but make sure

1234
00:44:05,010 --> 00:44:07,950
you've got people who are going to

1235
00:44:06,630 --> 00:44:11,160
communicate internally and externally

1236
00:44:07,950 --> 00:44:14,279
and if the corresponding and partners

1237
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:16,020
know who they are and also within your

1238
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:18,390
own institutions have a redundant

1239
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:20,069
communication means because it could be

1240
00:44:18,390 --> 00:44:22,618
your network is down and if you've got

1241
00:44:20,069 --> 00:44:25,230
voice over IP phones that's problematic

1242
00:44:22,619 --> 00:44:27,359
if the bad guys are in your network and

1243
00:44:25,230 --> 00:44:28,859
you're managing your call out with a

1244
00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:30,390
VoIP phone that could also be

1245
00:44:28,859 --> 00:44:33,150
problematic depending on how skilled

1246
00:44:30,390 --> 00:44:34,770
they are so have good we're done and out

1247
00:44:33,150 --> 00:44:37,020
of means out of and means of

1248
00:44:34,770 --> 00:44:39,300
communication and also have multiple

1249
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:40,740
channels for the different functions so

1250
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:43,109
you're not over saturating in one

1251
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:45,660
communications mean training it's

1252
00:44:43,109 --> 00:44:47,369
straightforward as I mentioned try to

1253
00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:48,420
separate operations from the executive

1254
00:44:47,369 --> 00:44:50,250
piece because there's a difference

1255
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:52,140
between you know standing at the fire

1256
00:44:50,250 --> 00:44:54,390
SUV and pointing at things and saying

1257
00:44:52,140 --> 00:44:56,009
put water there and actually knowing how

1258
00:44:54,390 --> 00:44:59,098
to pull your hose off the fire truck and

1259
00:44:56,010 --> 00:45:01,200
how to operate that effectively do

1260
00:44:59,099 --> 00:45:02,730
tabletop exercises I highly recommend

1261
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:05,189
you do them at least quarterly because

1262
00:45:02,730 --> 00:45:07,290
it verifies that your processes work it

1263
00:45:05,190 --> 00:45:09,000
also gives confidence to your management

1264
00:45:07,290 --> 00:45:10,829
team that they know you've got the ball

1265
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:13,349
and more importantly they know what they

1266
00:45:10,829 --> 00:45:14,940
need to do as well and it also is a good

1267
00:45:13,349 --> 00:45:17,099
opportunity to get more funding for

1268
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:18,809
shiny things typically and we all like

1269
00:45:17,099 --> 00:45:20,730
our shiny things when you do your

1270
00:45:18,809 --> 00:45:22,079
training don't insist it everybody is

1271
00:45:20,730 --> 00:45:23,460
there because not everybody is going to

1272
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:25,770
be there when something really happens

1273
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:27,270
so it's okay if key decision-makers

1274
00:45:25,770 --> 00:45:28,410
aren't there make sure you've got some

1275
00:45:27,270 --> 00:45:30,690
alternates because that's how it's going

1276
00:45:28,410 --> 00:45:33,029
to play out in the real world and also

1277
00:45:30,690 --> 00:45:34,670
track the lessons learned and have that

1278
00:45:33,030 --> 00:45:37,619
feedback loop for those improvements

1279
00:45:34,670 --> 00:45:39,540
also where possible if you're a large

1280
00:45:37,619 --> 00:45:41,730
organization coordinate with HR so when

1281
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:43,290
you're hiring new senior people you get

1282
00:45:41,730 --> 00:45:44,490
an opportunity to sit down with them if

1283
00:45:43,290 --> 00:45:46,020
they've got a role in and it's at a

1284
00:45:44,490 --> 00:45:47,970
response to the organisation that they

1285
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:49,799
know what that role is and try to do

1286
00:45:47,970 --> 00:45:51,629
that right away they'll say it's a great

1287
00:45:49,799 --> 00:45:53,609
opportunity to meet them gain some

1288
00:45:51,630 --> 00:45:54,839
political credibility and more

1289
00:45:53,609 --> 00:45:57,210
importantly it could be helpful when the

1290
00:45:54,839 --> 00:45:57,869
bad stuff happens and on your day to day

1291
00:45:57,210 --> 00:46:00,510
activities

1292
00:45:57,869 --> 00:46:02,910
try to use the same structures as you

1293
00:46:00,510 --> 00:46:04,740
would in the fire department we had if

1294
00:46:02,910 --> 00:46:06,180
we had three units so if we had like an

1295
00:46:04,740 --> 00:46:08,308
inside gas leak which gave you two

1296
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:10,348
engines in a ladder truck we use the

1297
00:46:08,309 --> 00:46:12,720
incident command process and we invoke

1298
00:46:10,349 --> 00:46:13,920
that structure so that it became second

1299
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:15,299
nature to us we

1300
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:16,920
use the same terminology the same

1301
00:46:15,299 --> 00:46:18,930
language and it was a very effective way

1302
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:20,490
of doing stuff and our sock in our

1303
00:46:18,930 --> 00:46:23,220
incident management teams our blue teams

1304
00:46:20,490 --> 00:46:24,750
are now doing that in our own bank and

1305
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:26,399
we're doing that now to help them get

1306
00:46:24,750 --> 00:46:29,490
used to the language that's been very

1307
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:32,010
helpful so the important thing train the

1308
00:46:29,490 --> 00:46:34,430
way you play because there's you know

1309
00:46:32,010 --> 00:46:37,380
different ways of putting out your fires

1310
00:46:34,430 --> 00:46:38,660
how much is too much and I know right

1311
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:40,980
now we're you're looking at your clocks

1312
00:46:38,660 --> 00:46:43,290
in the fire department in Northern

1313
00:46:40,980 --> 00:46:45,240
Virginia these are all of the manuals we

1314
00:46:43,290 --> 00:46:47,549
have these are all the different play

1315
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:51,299
books for the different kinds of

1316
00:46:47,549 --> 00:46:53,069
responses so as a firefighter you need

1317
00:46:51,299 --> 00:46:54,420
to learn your job as a driver you need

1318
00:46:53,069 --> 00:46:55,619
to learn your jobs and all of these as

1319
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:58,380
an officer you need to learn everybody's

1320
00:46:55,619 --> 00:47:01,619
job a lot of stuff to learn and these

1321
00:46:58,380 --> 00:47:03,270
play books are detailed with your

1322
00:47:01,619 --> 00:47:05,040
playbooks they need to be easy to read

1323
00:47:03,270 --> 00:47:07,140
you need to be able to find them don't

1324
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:09,270
store everything online for obvious

1325
00:47:07,140 --> 00:47:10,950
reasons because you want to be able to

1326
00:47:09,270 --> 00:47:14,190
be able to get at them if stuff goes

1327
00:47:10,950 --> 00:47:15,779
horribly wrong in your network and also

1328
00:47:14,190 --> 00:47:17,130
they assume that people know how to pull

1329
00:47:15,780 --> 00:47:18,540
the hose off the fire truck so you're

1330
00:47:17,130 --> 00:47:20,339
not saying this is how you work dark

1331
00:47:18,540 --> 00:47:22,440
Trace you don't want that level of

1332
00:47:20,339 --> 00:47:25,290
granularity but you want to people to

1333
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:27,480
know do the following things and again

1334
00:47:25,290 --> 00:47:29,339
with your table tops review them or

1335
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:33,450
regularly you can never train too much

1336
00:47:29,339 --> 00:47:36,150
so let's just very quickly on the

1337
00:47:33,450 --> 00:47:38,430
command structure this is the index of

1338
00:47:36,150 --> 00:47:41,819
the incident command manual so we've got

1339
00:47:38,430 --> 00:47:44,339
just under 170 pages on how to manage an

1340
00:47:41,819 --> 00:47:46,680
incident and it talks about all the

1341
00:47:44,339 --> 00:47:49,319
roles that are in the incidents so it's

1342
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:51,450
very thorough and very defined so if you

1343
00:47:49,319 --> 00:47:53,130
have a playbook on how to manage an

1344
00:47:51,450 --> 00:47:56,250
incident and it's half a dozen pages I

1345
00:47:53,130 --> 00:47:57,960
promise you it's not enough it's not

1346
00:47:56,250 --> 00:48:00,089
well thought-out it would be well

1347
00:47:57,960 --> 00:48:02,760
intended but it won't be very effective

1348
00:48:00,089 --> 00:48:06,150
so that's what it looks like on how to

1349
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:08,720
manage an incident for operations this

1350
00:48:06,150 --> 00:48:12,960
is a sample from one of ours in terms of

1351
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:15,118
it's like about 7080 pages and that's

1352
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:16,349
for a specific type of fire which are

1353
00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:19,549
the mid rise building fires which are

1354
00:48:16,349 --> 00:48:21,809
buildings between 6 and 10 stories so

1355
00:48:19,549 --> 00:48:23,640
there's a lot of information and that's

1356
00:48:21,809 --> 00:48:25,440
how to put out a fire in that kind of

1357
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:26,740
building so let's recap what are the key

1358
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:29,830
things we've learned on command

1359
00:48:26,740 --> 00:48:31,990
control we want to define who's in

1360
00:48:29,830 --> 00:48:33,670
charge understand your chain of command

1361
00:48:31,990 --> 00:48:35,830
make sure you have well-defined roles

1362
00:48:33,670 --> 00:48:37,150
and don't have a span of control that's

1363
00:48:35,830 --> 00:48:40,690
too crazy you don't want too many people

1364
00:48:37,150 --> 00:48:43,470
reporting to you communications use the

1365
00:48:40,690 --> 00:48:47,140
same language use normal English

1366
00:48:43,470 --> 00:48:49,480
wherever possible avoid geek speed don't

1367
00:48:47,140 --> 00:48:54,279
use lead speak nobody wants that anyway

1368
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:56,650
that's that's like 1990s stop it but use

1369
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:58,330
normal English language because you'll

1370
00:48:56,650 --> 00:49:00,820
be interfacing with third party a or

1371
00:48:58,330 --> 00:49:03,340
agencies and vendors and they might not

1372
00:49:00,820 --> 00:49:05,040
know your acronyms they're not going to

1373
00:49:03,340 --> 00:49:08,230
sort of try to be very common and

1374
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:10,420
practice everything you do as often as

1375
00:49:08,230 --> 00:49:11,470
you can because in the fire department

1376
00:49:10,420 --> 00:49:13,570
you don't just practice pulling your

1377
00:49:11,470 --> 00:49:13,779
hose off once if you're not busy that

1378
00:49:13,570 --> 00:49:15,220
day

1379
00:49:13,780 --> 00:49:17,980
you're pulling hose you're throwing

1380
00:49:15,220 --> 00:49:20,819
ladders and in our world we need to be

1381
00:49:17,980 --> 00:49:23,320
doing the same thing every day so that

1382
00:49:20,820 --> 00:49:25,060
is the picture that I had promised of

1383
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:27,970
this with the logistics setup in the

1384
00:49:25,060 --> 00:49:29,650
parking lot at the Pentagon a lot of

1385
00:49:27,970 --> 00:49:33,009
stuff going on it has showers canteens

1386
00:49:29,650 --> 00:49:33,880
dining halls lots of toilets all sorts

1387
00:49:33,010 --> 00:49:35,369
of things because they're literally

1388
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:39,160
couple thousand people there every day

1389
00:49:35,369 --> 00:49:40,810
so that is how to run a large

1390
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:46,720
complicated incident which i think is

1391
00:49:40,810 --> 00:49:49,270
really cool are there any questions as a

1392
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:57,189
point of information just before that

1393
00:49:49,270 --> 00:49:59,590
fire was taken I was whoops here there's

1394
00:49:57,190 --> 00:50:02,200
a great day we got 11 save one goldfish

1395
00:49:59,590 --> 00:50:05,619
into cats I care more about the cats

1396
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:08,500
I'm sure the goldfish was happy people

1397
00:50:05,619 --> 00:50:11,109
you can always make more babies but um

1398
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:27,280
anyway questions sorry we're totally

1399
00:50:11,109 --> 00:50:28,569
running late yes that is always the

1400
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:30,130
tricky part the best thing you could do

1401
00:50:28,570 --> 00:50:32,859
is if you can try to find an executive

1402
00:50:30,130 --> 00:50:34,119
sponsor and when somebody is a senior

1403
00:50:32,859 --> 00:50:36,460
person on the business side in your

1404
00:50:34,119 --> 00:50:37,599
organization and get them and just

1405
00:50:36,460 --> 00:50:39,010
target on them because in most

1406
00:50:37,599 --> 00:50:41,590
organizations generally somebody who

1407
00:50:39,010 --> 00:50:43,330
kind of gets it get them to send out the

1408
00:50:41,590 --> 00:50:44,710
invites the most thing of the person

1409
00:50:43,330 --> 00:50:46,299
that sends out the invites that's why

1410
00:50:44,710 --> 00:50:48,400
you get your people if you're just

1411
00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:49,869
coming out from from a god I'm a fairly

1412
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:51,760
senior person in my own organization if

1413
00:50:49,869 --> 00:50:53,800
I send them oh people are going to show

1414
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:56,050
up but if our CEO sense about people

1415
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:58,390
show up so you have to be very strategic

1416
00:50:56,050 --> 00:51:00,250
in building those key relationships try

1417
00:50:58,390 --> 00:51:02,259
to find a stakeholder that doesn't have

1418
00:51:00,250 --> 00:51:04,270
the word security in a title in fact

1419
00:51:02,260 --> 00:51:05,140
don't ever use that word it's a bad word

1420
00:51:04,270 --> 00:51:07,390
stop it

1421
00:51:05,140 --> 00:51:08,770
it doesn't it doesn't help talk about

1422
00:51:07,390 --> 00:51:10,750
value talk about risk

1423
00:51:08,770 --> 00:51:13,150
stop saying security but that's the only

1424
00:51:10,750 --> 00:51:14,349
generic advice I can give we can talk

1425
00:51:13,150 --> 00:51:16,660
after I get a little granular

1426
00:51:14,349 --> 00:51:20,640
information on your organization and now

1427
00:51:16,660 --> 00:51:20,640
people little bit more that way yes sir

1428
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:39,720
right so to make sure I could hear that

1429
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:41,310
I think the question was should we have

1430
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:47,730
playbooks for things like DDoS is

1431
00:51:41,310 --> 00:51:50,970
malware yeah yeah short answer is

1432
00:51:47,730 --> 00:51:53,040
absolutely with all of these things

1433
00:51:50,970 --> 00:51:55,169
there are standard repeatable tasks that

1434
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:58,410
you'll do to manage a DDoS attack or a

1435
00:51:55,170 --> 00:52:00,980
malware infection or a phishing incident

1436
00:51:58,410 --> 00:52:02,549
or some other indicator of compromise

1437
00:52:00,980 --> 00:52:04,290
there are things that are pretty

1438
00:52:02,550 --> 00:52:06,030
standard so those you should document

1439
00:52:04,290 --> 00:52:09,540
and make repeatable and make sure you

1440
00:52:06,030 --> 00:52:11,280
know who's doing what because part of

1441
00:52:09,540 --> 00:52:14,070
the problem is okay well we've got this

1442
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:15,300
okay now what do we do so it's great to

1443
00:52:14,070 --> 00:52:17,100
open up a little binder flip through

1444
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:18,690
pages and let's do this unless the

1445
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:21,000
situation warrants something different

1446
00:52:18,690 --> 00:52:22,620
and the playbooks I showed as the first

1447
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:24,660
arriving officer you have the right to

1448
00:52:22,620 --> 00:52:26,790
change what's going on because you're

1449
00:52:24,660 --> 00:52:28,140
the you've got eyes on scene and you'd

1450
00:52:26,790 --> 00:52:29,670
say okay we're not doing a normal player

1451
00:52:28,140 --> 00:52:31,379
we're gonna do a B and C you get on the

1452
00:52:29,670 --> 00:52:33,210
radio and you communicate it you do the

1453
00:52:31,380 --> 00:52:35,430
same thing in our own in our own world

1454
00:52:33,210 --> 00:52:36,870
as well I see you in the corner of my

1455
00:52:35,430 --> 00:52:41,160
eye Rory but I'm still asking for more

1456
00:52:36,870 --> 00:53:16,500
questions anyone else okay we had one

1457
00:52:41,160 --> 00:53:18,029
last one right the simplest way to

1458
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:20,160
answer that so the question is if you're

1459
00:53:18,030 --> 00:53:22,110
a smaller organization who's going to do

1460
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:23,399
the night work who's you know you don't

1461
00:53:22,110 --> 00:53:25,650
have all those resources have read

1462
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:26,670
people 24/7 it's just summarized and

1463
00:53:25,650 --> 00:53:28,950
then for the sake of the recording as

1464
00:53:26,670 --> 00:53:30,270
well is that a fair summary of your

1465
00:53:28,950 --> 00:53:32,370
question okay

1466
00:53:30,270 --> 00:53:34,920
so the simple answer you're going to

1467
00:53:32,370 --> 00:53:36,359
need external parties you there's no way

1468
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:38,070
you can do it yourself there's no harm

1469
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:41,040
and basically putting a standby

1470
00:53:38,070 --> 00:53:44,610
agreement with a third party firm so

1471
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:45,750
if we need you you know this is what

1472
00:53:44,610 --> 00:53:48,210
it's going to cost this is what we're

1473
00:53:45,750 --> 00:53:50,340
gonna do your I do recommend if you do

1474
00:53:48,210 --> 00:53:51,990
use third parties you have them come

1475
00:53:50,340 --> 00:53:53,340
when you do your training exercises so

1476
00:53:51,990 --> 00:53:55,140
they're familiar with your organization

1477
00:53:53,340 --> 00:53:56,490
a little bit as well you of course have

1478
00:53:55,140 --> 00:54:00,240
to pay their consulting rates for that

1479
00:53:56,490 --> 00:54:02,430
but you know really you can't do it

1480
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:04,109
yourself if you're a small team and

1481
00:54:02,430 --> 00:54:06,810
here's your point yeah per note it's

1482
00:54:04,110 --> 00:54:07,920
it's brutal and you're getting that

1483
00:54:06,810 --> 00:54:09,660
you're gonna your teams are gonna be

1484
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:13,020
there anyway because that's just how

1485
00:54:09,660 --> 00:54:14,970
people are so make sure you have some

1486
00:54:13,020 --> 00:54:19,740
food on hand and don't do it in Belgium

1487
00:54:14,970 --> 00:54:22,890
I thought bias against Belgium it's a

1488
00:54:19,740 --> 00:54:27,120
nice place Rory yes you have things to

1489
00:54:22,890 --> 00:54:30,140
say yep we are sorry so first off and I

1490
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:30,140
thought I was going to be done quick
