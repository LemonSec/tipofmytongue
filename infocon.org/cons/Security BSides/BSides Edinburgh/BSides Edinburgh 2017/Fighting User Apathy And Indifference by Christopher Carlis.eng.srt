00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:40,510
wife's go then check that out yet to

7
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:45,040
cancel then I wanted to talk about a way

8
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:46,930
I think that maybe we can we can fight

9
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:50,800
this problem will loop back around to

10
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,340
some more complaining then we'll have

11
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:56,620
some open discussion some question and

12
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:59,530
answer which officially a little aston a

13
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:02,440
few minutes unofficially it's going to

14
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:06,729
last the rest of my life that I ruined

15
00:01:06,729 --> 00:01:08,920
everybody on board already miss to talk

16
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:12,750
cool this is not like a dense

17
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:15,280
informational II you know intensive talk

18
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,610
it's me up here talking about this idea

19
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:20,290
I had for like a half hour and then we

20
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:22,890
go and have some snacks problem so

21
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:27,729
mighty news replication difference I'm a

22
00:01:27,729 --> 00:01:31,060
penetration tester a member of the red

23
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:33,610
team is secured and like a lot of

24
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:35,470
penetration testers I have a compulsive

25
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:37,030
need to tell you that I'm a penetration

26
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:39,280
tester and then talk about penetration

27
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:44,079
testing for a while so let's do that how

28
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:45,369
did I get here how did I get to be up

29
00:01:45,369 --> 00:01:47,979
here complaining about user apathy and

30
00:01:47,979 --> 00:01:53,439
indifference penetration testing it's

31
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:55,090
one of the things that there's always

32
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:56,829
some debate about how to define it what

33
00:01:56,829 --> 00:01:58,869
it really means same thing with red team

34
00:01:58,869 --> 00:02:01,540
testing but essentially I'm a fake

35
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:06,700
criminal for hire I test security I test

36
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:10,000
things by trying to break the rules it's

37
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,860
the best job there is this the best job

38
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:12,849
out there I don't know what your job is

39
00:02:12,849 --> 00:02:16,090
but sorry mine's better

40
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:18,840
with most penetration test they are

41
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:22,390
focused on a specific area of an

42
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:24,670
organization security I but that's the

43
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:26,560
internal network with that external

44
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,540
network wireless is it good lots of

45
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:31,629
different stuff each can provide value

46
00:02:31,629 --> 00:02:33,099
to the organization they can identify

47
00:02:33,099 --> 00:02:36,930
weaknesses but they are inherently

48
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:39,340
restrained they're restricted to

49
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:41,170
whatever is being tested an external

50
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:42,819
penetration test is only going to test

51
00:02:42,819 --> 00:02:46,420
the external network with with a red

52
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:48,730
team test we get to take the gloves off

53
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:53,200
of it we get to get a bit more into the

54
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:58,840
role and it's really pretty simple I'm a

55
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:02,470
bad guy you have something that I want

56
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:04,060
to steal I don't know what it is maybe

57
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:06,459
its credit card information maybe it's

58
00:03:06,459 --> 00:03:08,230
personal health names business secrets

59
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:12,819
whatever it is I want it so I'm coming

60
00:03:12,819 --> 00:03:18,209
for you now I don't want to go to jail

61
00:03:18,209 --> 00:03:21,250
so I'm going to try to choose a text

62
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:24,280
that well and I think they're effective

63
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,260
they follow through my level of

64
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:28,900
acceptable risk they're not going to be

65
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:32,040
noticed they're not going to be caught

66
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:38,980
awesome I hold it lazy I don't want to

67
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:41,980
work too hard stealing your stuff sue

68
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:44,319
and yourself at the business for me I'm

69
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:45,910
not looking to waste resources I got

70
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:49,599
bill cheap and effective for me the

71
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:51,849
attacks is going to trump something

72
00:03:51,849 --> 00:03:54,730
that's flashing expensive and and

73
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:58,060
finally I don't feel any real need to

74
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:01,030
play by your rule I don't feel need to

75
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:03,010
just stick to just the external or just

76
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:06,989
a wide line everything is in scope and

77
00:04:06,989 --> 00:04:10,630
as has your bad guy i'm going to use

78
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:14,190
whatever works so what we know works

79
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:16,810
with with a disturbing degree of

80
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:23,940
reliability is attacks against the user

81
00:04:24,539 --> 00:04:28,510
social engineering USB key drops

82
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:33,430
aiding in the building's fishing the

83
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:37,630
user is a week p week users a weak point

84
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:40,810
in your defenses and that that's

85
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:42,370
something that will exploit that's

86
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:44,380
something we'll take advantage it we

87
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:46,350
will find someone at your organization

88
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:50,410
having a bad security day and will

89
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:53,350
leverage that in pursuit of stealing all

90
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:57,790
your stuff and yeah that's a lot of fun

91
00:04:57,790 --> 00:05:05,560
but I'm not really a bad guy and you're

92
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:09,100
not paying me to just break in a call

93
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,860
smogon American I need to provide some

94
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:15,070
sort of like actual response some sort

95
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:17,080
of recommendations on how you can stop

96
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,450
whatever attacks were successful during

97
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:23,290
this test and traditionally the

98
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:25,870
recommendations that we provide tend to

99
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:28,260
fall into a couple of different groups

100
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:30,700
I've wandered away from the podium and

101
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:32,470
Jey flies and I have the thing that lets

102
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:34,420
me change slides as I carried around I'm

103
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:38,770
going to keep leaving it here the person

104
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:39,910
which is well I think of us as

105
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:42,450
technological solutions and we like me

106
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:46,420
these are comfortable user employee

107
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:49,090
allowed tailgating in the building you

108
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:51,820
should buy and install a turnstile for

109
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:55,750
your honors fishing was effective thises

110
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:59,290
secure email gateway 9000 plugging to

111
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:02,770
your network something bad happened by

112
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:07,690
this thing it'll make it better we like

113
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:11,350
these beasts as technology enthusiast

114
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:13,390
these fall in line with our way of

115
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:16,150
trying to solve problems yeah they can

116
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:18,670
be expensive but it's something we can

117
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:25,120
control the problem is that for a large

118
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,180
part we're doing here is treating the

119
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:31,060
symptoms we're putting some band-aids on

120
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:33,490
some bullet wounds we have here yes they

121
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:36,520
work they do you know stuff they do what

122
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,410
they're pretty much supposed to do the

123
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:41,470
best they can but

124
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:44,140
they often end up being more of a speed

125
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:46,180
bump to an attacker rather than that

126
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:47,860
that brick wall that we're all hoping

127
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:54,000
for all right what else do you recommend

128
00:06:54,300 --> 00:07:00,120
user education I love this will say

129
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:03,670
provide your users with information

130
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:07,060
security awareness training information

131
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:12,280
security awareness training I die just a

132
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:15,730
little bit inside secret honest it and I

133
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:18,100
say it's white I don't know what but

134
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:19,890
information security awareness training

135
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:22,750
undeniably it's a good idea it's

136
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,760
critically important that we can't you

137
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,740
can't afford lycra mass ignorance of the

138
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:33,310
topic but everyone hates it everyone

139
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:37,930
even we as security professionals don't

140
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:40,510
like security awareness training so much

141
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:43,330
so that in a lot of places what have we

142
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:45,430
done we've taken the whole thing and we

143
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:47,140
shut it over to the human resources

144
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:49,440
department that here you deal with it

145
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,220
information security awareness training

146
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:54,520
has turned into a 40-minute PowerPoint

147
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,650
slides egg that you click through as

148
00:07:56,650 --> 00:07:59,229
fast as you can it's next to the ethics

149
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:01,030
training and the annual harassment

150
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:03,820
training this is what we've done with

151
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:10,660
them and sadly I guess it's working as

152
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:18,640
intended let's talk about not here the

153
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,410
human resources department at your

154
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:22,270
organization exists to protect the

155
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:26,169
company from the employee so in that

156
00:08:26,169 --> 00:08:29,860
regard the information security

157
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:32,320
awareness training doing exactly what

158
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,630
they wanted to do because when what if

159
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:38,349
these users inevitably after receiving

160
00:08:38,349 --> 00:08:42,010
training clicks a link in an email well

161
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:45,310
now you can you can reprimand them you

162
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:49,690
can yell okay so do a live demo of how

163
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:52,690
that light though yell meow scary

164
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:56,320
well dad gore pointing right at you much

165
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,300
that like can you help me out that night

166
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:04,300
ah so in this scenario a user who's

167
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:08,160
click pumping I've come dealing Eric off

168
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,750
amen he clicked the link in that

169
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:13,090
phishing email why why did you do that

170
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:15,190
who told you remember eight months ago

171
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:17,050
you took that training to said hey don't

172
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:25,930
do that promise alright well I mean the

173
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:30,160
CFO click the same link so try not to

174
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,740
move again all right yeah that's it

175
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:37,420
thank you that's essentially what is

176
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:40,420
coming down to its a way that that we

177
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:41,860
can get people in a little bit of

178
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:43,890
trouble if they don't follow the rules

179
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:49,390
so we're fighting a battle here how does

180
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:51,940
look like we're doing do we have

181
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:54,220
technological solutions are they

182
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:57,330
expensive and do they annoy our users

183
00:09:57,330 --> 00:10:00,610
yeah that's how we know they're working

184
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:04,570
we have user education is it boring yeah

185
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:05,530
that's tough how we know it's

186
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:11,470
educational right the user they're

187
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:15,580
informed they know but they don't care

188
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:21,520
they don't care enough to act and some

189
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:24,280
of the problem is that we as information

190
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:27,700
security professionals we're not good at

191
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:30,540
making people care about me Computers

192
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:33,760
Computers are still tricky but getting

193
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,980
juven very actual people to care about

194
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:40,270
something it's a bit outside our core

195
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:42,569
skills

196
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:55,110
we need to approach this problem in a

197
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:56,400
different way clearly what we're trying

198
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:59,610
yeah it's working you know what it

199
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:02,430
suppose to do but it's going to continue

200
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:06,930
to be a problem we can get back a bit

201
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:11,670
what we have is a nice probably

202
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:13,830
relatively simple idea something that

203
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:18,600
our users could do do that would make a

204
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:22,050
security better everybody needs the

205
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:27,750
magic don't click every link in the

206
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:30,720
email with you get choose a complex

207
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:36,720
password and user where trainees we've

208
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,450
tried to logging Lee gently force them

209
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:43,170
to do it with the technological

210
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:46,950
solutions we have it trying to sell it

211
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:49,860
there's like that's gonna get burned the

212
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:52,080
Nexus showing this to them once in a

213
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,660
while but it's this message out there

214
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:57,420
kid it engraved it so that they can't

215
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:59,370
stop thinking about dead stopped working

216
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:01,680
about it squeezing this muffin fair to

217
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:13,760
Gloucester doll we might be we should

218
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:18,180
you invest the help of marketing

219
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:21,990
professionals to sell security to our

220
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:27,890
users marking professional marketing is

221
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:30,630
telling people about an idea and then

222
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:33,210
giving them to act I that's like exactly

223
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:37,650
what we want and all right yeah it's not

224
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:39,990
it's not a completely new novel idea

225
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:41,540
people look on the internet to find

226
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:44,900
references to it going back for years

227
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:48,180
but it doesn't seem to be either widely

228
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:54,450
implemented or well in connected but

229
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:56,190
that doesn't mean it's not a good idea

230
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:58,500
you can see how you might hear about it

231
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:02,000
and say use marketing for sale security

232
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
users if they call it that makes sense

233
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,700
but online marketing is not what I do

234
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:17,810
and then the ideas sighs when we head

235
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:26,240
outside there we go when you head

236
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:30,740
outside I see advertisements billboards

237
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:38,420
logos everywhere you watch television

238
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:42,530
there's commercial product placement you

239
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:46,550
go on the internet and you're not using

240
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:49,610
an adblocker some region advertisement

241
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:53,360
score when you head into the office that

242
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,010
is that with advertising pretty much

243
00:13:55,010 --> 00:13:59,480
drops off hopefully penny will work and

244
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:02,080
what we have is more of a blank slate

245
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:05,420
this is where we could target our reach

246
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:08,089
our target audience this is where we

247
00:14:08,089 --> 00:14:10,430
have an opportunity on every blank wall

248
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:12,650
and every screen on every internal

249
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:16,910
website to get this idea this simple

250
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:19,550
security idea where in front of the

251
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:23,950
users not not look here during training

252
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:29,200
you can in front of them every deck and

253
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:34,600
marketing marketing can help ensure that

254
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:41,260
this message is communicated defensively

255
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:45,080
effective communication we'll talk more

256
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:48,680
about that in just a minute after these

257
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:52,430
messages yeah that's a commercial break

258
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:54,410
in my talk at the time you guys try this

259
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:57,050
one this is this is a pretty good son I

260
00:14:57,050 --> 00:15:00,640
can't get it back in the States but

261
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:03,820
I'm hoping to get a sponsorship deal all

262
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:06,640
right fine maybe I should not define

263
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,650
it's not actually intermission going no

264
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:17,950
one get up and leave can hardly look at

265
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:19,800
me I've had too much sugar as it is I

266
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,690
possibly too much caffeine today what do

267
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:26,530
we got all right let's say for the sake

268
00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:27,940
of argument that you don't think I'm

269
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:30,070
crazy you like this idea maybe you think

270
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:32,230
well how can we possibly get it going in

271
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:34,060
my organization I've been thinking about

272
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:35,830
that too we have so much in common we

273
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:39,700
should hang out how can we do this of

274
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:42,670
what option make looking we can do it

275
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:44,890
internally it's quite likely that that

276
00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:48,360
wherever you're working has some sort of

277
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,440
marketing personnel already working

278
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:53,710
there maybe you could look them illicit

279
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:56,500
their health and developing an internal

280
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,680
information security marketing campaign

281
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:01,180
they understand your corporate culture

282
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:02,410
they know what resources you have

283
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:04,120
available maybe a good working

284
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:07,990
relationship anything happen place all

285
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:09,280
of that I'm not disappear saying like

286
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,790
everything's great clear problems

287
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:15,240
possibly coming up primarily is that

288
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:18,490
working on your security campaign is

289
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:20,680
probably not their job they have their

290
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,450
own marketing stuff to do that's

291
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:26,560
presumably making the company money what

292
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:31,240
else is going to cost a certain amount

293
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,840
of Maya do this who's paying for this I

294
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:37,840
who was this idea who hates this idea

295
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,520
who's fighting with the people who love

296
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,800
or hate this idea corporate politics

297
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:44,920
always fun to feel it it's something

298
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,240
where you'll need to have done your

299
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,820
homework try to find someone on the

300
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:50,470
marketing team where you can you know

301
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:52,450
get there by an idea come at it from two

302
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:55,840
directions find a champion in marketing

303
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,820
that seems to be done needed to get

304
00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:01,260
anything done in in a large organization

305
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:03,730
heavier no arguments ready as to why

306
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:06,160
this is going to help solve a problem

307
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:13,290
that your company is having okay well

308
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:17,289
look we hired an outside consultant to

309
00:17:17,289 --> 00:17:20,699
do this work speaking as a consultant

310
00:17:20,699 --> 00:17:22,929
hiring a consultant is often an

311
00:17:22,929 --> 00:17:26,679
excellent idea the Eclipse you could

312
00:17:26,679 --> 00:17:28,659
contract the company fine company that

313
00:17:28,659 --> 00:17:31,630
has the experience in both marketing and

314
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:34,570
security to come in and help identify

315
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:36,549
problems and weaknesses it and build

316
00:17:36,549 --> 00:17:38,440
that information security marketing

317
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,779
campaign you could maybe try to fly past

318
00:17:40,779 --> 00:17:42,640
some of the internal politics you don't

319
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:46,230
need to pull from your marketing team

320
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:49,539
they're still obviously some problems

321
00:17:49,539 --> 00:17:53,799
potentially consultants at the very

322
00:17:53,799 --> 00:17:57,880
least cost money I don't know I didn't

323
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:00,850
do the math but there's not a line item

324
00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:02,440
to the budget who's going to pay for

325
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:05,049
this Oh decisions need to be made we're

326
00:18:05,049 --> 00:18:07,539
back at politics so I think consulting

327
00:18:07,539 --> 00:18:09,580
is a pretty good idea and you may be

328
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:11,350
thinking this guy work secure work

329
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:13,360
Brandon Ellis lies is he about to stand

330
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,159
up here and say that secure words has a

331
00:18:15,159 --> 00:18:17,830
brand new service offering where we come

332
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:19,750
in and do marketing no no we're not

333
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:23,169
going on sighs I'm pushing for it maybe

334
00:18:23,169 --> 00:18:25,649
we'll all someday but we'll see how

335
00:18:25,649 --> 00:18:28,240
convincing my arguments are to the

336
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:34,630
bonkers finally a third way thinking

337
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:36,730
about this what I think that has was a

338
00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:43,539
good deal merit couch college interns

339
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:45,789
college school sydney university

340
00:18:45,789 --> 00:18:48,490
students happen to be here sweet not

341
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:50,980
here marketing students doesn't what we

342
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:53,799
need we can bring in a marketing intern

343
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:56,380
and for that semester of whatever you

344
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:58,450
have here they would be more than just

345
00:18:58,450 --> 00:18:59,890
bringing the marketing department some

346
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:02,649
coffee and doughnuts they would work to

347
00:19:02,649 --> 00:19:06,090
develop an internal marketing security

348
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:09,340
campaign if right now you've got nothing

349
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:11,350
literally anything these students do

350
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:12,970
would be better than nothing that you

351
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:16,690
have your team could provide what you

352
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:19,149
want them to sell as well as various

353
00:19:19,149 --> 00:19:20,919
health and resources the marketing

354
00:19:20,919 --> 00:19:22,570
department could help out providing

355
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:26,620
guidance and direction this benefit the

356
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:26,980
organ

357
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:28,750
station because they get some kind of

358
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:31,840
security campaign it benefits the intern

359
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,290
who would get some unique experience

360
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:38,650
fairly up-and-coming line of work it

361
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:40,809
would benefit you if your users just

362
00:19:40,809 --> 00:19:42,820
stop clicking on things for five seconds

363
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:43,870
while they're looking at whatever this

364
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:50,470
kid made and then helping us out of the

365
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:58,360
day they are so right now it should be

366
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:00,040
fairly obvious to you that I'm just some

367
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:02,020
hackers standing up here saying like hey

368
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:06,160
I got a good idea and go forth go out

369
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:08,530
there and and talk to marking and good

370
00:20:08,530 --> 00:20:10,750
things will happen i promise i'm going

371
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:12,549
to stay safe over here in my consultant

372
00:20:12,549 --> 00:20:14,080
problem not talk to strangers because

373
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,660
they're scary yeah I didn't want to be

374
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:18,340
completely hypocritical coming up here

375
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:22,030
talking about that so I tried to myself

376
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:25,870
I went out to a member of our own

377
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:29,250
security marketing team I went out to

378
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:31,900
local colleges in the Chicago area where

379
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:34,780
I lived and hunted down Murphy

380
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:38,590
professors I wanted to get their

381
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:40,780
professional input I wanted to say may I

382
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:42,820
have this idea do you think it has an

383
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:45,700
area what potential problems you think

384
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,559
we may have and trying to pull this off

385
00:20:47,559 --> 00:20:50,080
if we were to try it what what potential

386
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,210
issues what can we do to maybe make it

387
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:54,970
more successful there could be big

388
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:56,950
problems I would just have no idea cuz

389
00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:59,799
I'm I'm not in marketing i spending go

390
00:20:59,799 --> 00:21:01,809
school for it's never been my job I'm

391
00:21:01,809 --> 00:21:03,460
standing up here saying it's a great

392
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:07,929
thing I also wanted to do this so i

393
00:21:07,929 --> 00:21:09,940
would have the experience I think I

394
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:14,260
didn't know you guys I didn't have

395
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:16,440
introductions never met them before I

396
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:19,240
wanted to look like 22 approaching

397
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:23,290
strangers with an ID I had and say you

398
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:25,390
know how would it be to try to interact

399
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:27,179
with anything and get their involvement

400
00:21:27,179 --> 00:21:29,590
so I came to make his questions and they

401
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:35,910
said larger now instead

402
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:42,590
I get that along they said either

403
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:46,520
overwhelming on each one I spoke to was

404
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:48,840
interested they thought the idea had

405
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:50,970
merit they they offered their inputs or

406
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:55,550
recommendations and perhaps even even

407
00:21:55,550 --> 00:21:59,550
funny they were expressed an interest in

408
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:01,850
continuing to work with me in the future

409
00:22:01,850 --> 00:22:04,170
developed appeared to say like a good

410
00:22:04,170 --> 00:22:07,050
idea to get out of here I mean I'm 40 so

411
00:22:07,050 --> 00:22:08,550
they're not going to call me okay but

412
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:11,940
still it was right to the madam and it's

413
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:13,560
something that's that really inspired me

414
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:16,740
to Achilles this isn't just me Daniel

415
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:18,240
you're saying hey I think this is a good

416
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,180
idea it's me and also a couple guys over

417
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:22,860
in America that you don't know and I'm

418
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:24,810
coming over here to back me up what can

419
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:28,680
you do so not as if a critical as I

420
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:33,560
would have been otherwise that's what

421
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:37,080
loop back around to effective

422
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:43,560
communication by possible that this idea

423
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:47,730
of marketing security is already a play

424
00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:50,580
in your organization being used to try

425
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:52,530
to fight off this user apathy and

426
00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:56,550
indifference i get 2 i'm lucky enough i

427
00:22:56,550 --> 00:22:59,280
get to visit a lot of companies and see

428
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,310
what they got going on in security watch

429
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:03,150
sometimes they even knowing they're

430
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:07,200
doing that but I've seen a few things

431
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,910
and some stuff I like and some stuff I

432
00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:11,100
don't like one of the things that that I

433
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:13,980
found people doing more and more it

434
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:17,160
seems pretty cool is the gamification of

435
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:20,700
fishing detention this is where anyone

436
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:24,120
please you this any one company yeah all

437
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:27,870
right good um hopefully you don't like

438
00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:28,980
completely disagree with me as I

439
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:33,540
continue to talk so this is where users

440
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:35,520
are encouraged to report suspicious

441
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:38,640
emails not just because that training

442
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,980
said you should totally do that but

443
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:43,789
because there's some sort of competition

444
00:23:43,789 --> 00:23:45,619
this some sort of contest they can

445
00:23:45,619 --> 00:23:49,850
possibly win some sort of prize and what

446
00:23:49,850 --> 00:23:51,919
if presented to the users it's not it's

447
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:54,529
not a footnote on a PowerPoint slide

448
00:23:54,529 --> 00:23:56,299
deck it comes out a little bit of

449
00:23:56,299 --> 00:23:57,919
excitement it gets to users thinking

450
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:01,549
like hey I could win some maybe not too

451
00:24:01,549 --> 00:24:03,919
shabby prize by just reading my emails

452
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:06,799
and complaining about stuff redeem and

453
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:08,359
complaining about this is pretty much

454
00:24:08,359 --> 00:24:14,359
all of you anyway so but various people

455
00:24:14,359 --> 00:24:16,249
i talk about that has been deployed it's

456
00:24:16,249 --> 00:24:19,159
in your organization the texts attention

457
00:24:19,159 --> 00:24:21,049
analogously rave but it's definitely

458
00:24:21,049 --> 00:24:23,899
they've seen certain benefits of it and

459
00:24:23,899 --> 00:24:29,320
it's a example of a security idea that

460
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:32,840
has been marketed better you know we've

461
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,369
already told them like reports that this

462
00:24:34,369 --> 00:24:38,450
officious suspicious email and they

463
00:24:38,450 --> 00:24:41,539
weren't really doing it but it took that

464
00:24:41,539 --> 00:24:43,970
instead lows let's work with the human

465
00:24:43,970 --> 00:24:45,409
condition a little bit let's work and

466
00:24:45,409 --> 00:24:48,229
find a way to try to get people to you

467
00:24:48,229 --> 00:24:51,409
know actually act actually move on this

468
00:24:51,409 --> 00:24:53,149
simple idea that we want to do it and

469
00:24:53,149 --> 00:25:26,539
review concept is not working yes is

470
00:25:26,539 --> 00:25:29,690
there is there any reward both rom

471
00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:31,129
matters is just something where there's

472
00:25:31,129 --> 00:25:32,179
like

473
00:25:32,179 --> 00:25:43,879
oh they feel ya okay the history of the

474
00:25:43,879 --> 00:25:45,619
program is different and I've heard

475
00:25:45,619 --> 00:25:48,110
about programs where they people win

476
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:50,659
amazon gift cards if your if your team

477
00:25:50,659 --> 00:25:52,970
is your group it reports the most

478
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:55,159
suspicious emails and they're even maybe

479
00:25:55,159 --> 00:25:57,710
ranked like like these were no obvious

480
00:25:57,710 --> 00:25:59,419
dishes that these were actually like

481
00:25:59,419 --> 00:26:00,919
scary stuff and you did good job

482
00:26:00,919 --> 00:26:03,710
pointing out on your team could could

483
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:06,919
win prizes keep the party I don't know

484
00:26:06,919 --> 00:26:09,049
whatever people that who have real jobs

485
00:26:09,049 --> 00:26:13,850
like so it's something that i steam it

486
00:26:13,850 --> 00:26:15,710
I'm like that that is we need more of

487
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:17,419
that or at least that kind of thinking

488
00:26:17,419 --> 00:26:19,220
to say like what we're trying right now

489
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:21,169
by just telling them to do it isn't

490
00:26:21,169 --> 00:26:25,999
hitting the job done on the other end of

491
00:26:25,999 --> 00:26:28,460
the spectrum and there's probably more

492
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:35,779
people with with this they have a the

493
00:26:35,779 --> 00:26:38,899
bulletin board somewhere in your office

494
00:26:38,899 --> 00:26:43,999
in the break room a hallway there's a

495
00:26:43,999 --> 00:26:45,860
bulletin board and on that bulletin

496
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:49,580
board wedged between parking regulations

497
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:53,629
or just wedge between the parking

498
00:26:53,629 --> 00:26:55,429
regulations and whatever else is up

499
00:26:55,429 --> 00:27:00,830
there is a piece of paper and maybe says

500
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:02,299
like security at the top with my

501
00:27:02,299 --> 00:27:05,840
keyboard ID and then it says although we

502
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:08,029
don't really know it says maybe it says

503
00:27:08,029 --> 00:27:11,419
report suspicious visitors or don't

504
00:27:11,419 --> 00:27:15,049
click phishing email sorry lady maybe it

505
00:27:15,049 --> 00:27:18,499
says who knows no no one it might as

506
00:27:18,499 --> 00:27:20,899
well be camouflaged I mean we all we all

507
00:27:20,899 --> 00:27:23,679
know that it's there but it's

508
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:27,409
ineffective communication this is the

509
00:27:27,409 --> 00:27:28,940
kind of stuff that that left to our own

510
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:30,499
the voice devices i think we come up

511
00:27:30,499 --> 00:27:32,090
with like we need to tell people about

512
00:27:32,090 --> 00:27:33,919
security things all right when we won't

513
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:36,559
fit open up word and change the color to

514
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:39,619
red as Reds important it is it's up

515
00:27:39,619 --> 00:27:42,889
there and nobody knows what it says yes

516
00:27:42,889 --> 00:27:44,539
that's not true that nobody knows what

517
00:27:44,539 --> 00:27:46,130
it does

518
00:27:46,130 --> 00:27:49,160
I don't know I know what what your sign

519
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:51,920
says because when I break into your

520
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,750
organization when I break into your

521
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:57,100
office and I'm creeping around the place

522
00:27:57,100 --> 00:28:00,350
looking the seal saw or attached up your

523
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:03,500
network I work for these could they make

524
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:06,320
me smile outlook for them any when I see

525
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,330
them I take a picture of that or

526
00:28:08,330 --> 00:28:12,130
sometimes I'll take a selfie with them

527
00:28:12,130 --> 00:28:18,500
yeah so I'm cater behind you says if you

528
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:22,340
see something say something nobody's

529
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:29,420
there I told that dangled in front of

530
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:32,240
people it was delicious still nobody

531
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:38,330
says anything we motivating people to do

532
00:28:38,330 --> 00:28:41,060
any sort of action this is what you're

533
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:49,899
fighting it is so you can do this I mean

534
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:53,660
you can find a way to make your

535
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:55,250
communication more effective to use

536
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:59,090
marketing to work with them to make

537
00:28:59,090 --> 00:29:03,740
security better talk to Marge mean most

538
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:06,770
known pretty good people run on keep

539
00:29:06,770 --> 00:29:09,290
your guard up a little bit you shouldn't

540
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:13,250
feel the need in this battle you

541
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:15,020
shouldn't feel like you have to be

542
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:18,020
constrained to whatever comfortable

543
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:20,510
solutions we've you know past and

544
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:22,490
working before whatever duct tape half

545
00:29:22,490 --> 00:29:26,630
measures that you've tried the past it's

546
00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:28,730
clearly you know not working well enough

547
00:29:28,730 --> 00:29:32,930
or we wouldn't have jobs feel free to

548
00:29:32,930 --> 00:29:36,460
take a page from our bad guy play ball

549
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:41,830
you guys should use whatever world so

550
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:46,130
that's pretty much it short talk if you

551
00:29:46,130 --> 00:29:48,680
have fun with that I don't care but I

552
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:50,270
appreciate everyone showing up I preach

553
00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:52,220
thanks besides for letting me come and

554
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:54,380
talk hopefully you're not going to just

555
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:55,860
be super mad at me

556
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:59,460
okay at this point discussion if you

557
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:02,400
have questions I will pretend to try to

558
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,590
answer them while desperately thinking

559
00:30:04,590 --> 00:30:06,240
of a way to get out of the situation if

560
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,590
you want to talk about penetration

561
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:09,720
testing clearly I cannot shut up about

562
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:12,780
that if you want to talk about the

563
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:14,429
person who's currently the American

564
00:30:14,429 --> 00:30:17,970
president I can't because I haven't been

565
00:30:17,970 --> 00:30:22,860
drinking heavily but is there any

566
00:30:22,860 --> 00:31:09,740
questions you guys hated date me oh yeah

567
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:12,510
and that's what we got we have secured

568
00:31:12,510 --> 00:31:14,880
in a stick potentially i mean it could

569
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:17,190
just be the stake but who wants to work

570
00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:18,270
with the place where it's just this

571
00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:20,549
thick hopefully there's also some

572
00:31:20,549 --> 00:31:25,410
carrots we should do saying accuses

573
00:31:25,410 --> 00:31:27,419
aspect of the gamification like you know

574
00:31:27,419 --> 00:31:30,630
if you're consistently not playing the

575
00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:32,790
game you're failing every every fishing

576
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:34,559
test if you're becoming almost a

577
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:38,760
liability company because you suddenly

578
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:42,780
don't care it's punishment in order oh

579
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:45,179
I've never liked the negative

580
00:31:45,179 --> 00:31:47,220
reinforcement again I don't have to deal

581
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:49,559
with it but at a personal level I'm like

582
00:31:49,559 --> 00:31:53,190
now let's not punish people it in D

583
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:54,390
motivates them I think rather than

584
00:31:54,390 --> 00:31:57,710
motivate some zzz's

585
00:31:59,659 --> 00:32:15,450
ok I see ok so like pushing the problem

586
00:32:15,450 --> 00:32:23,399
off on foot down so like they bring

587
00:32:23,399 --> 00:32:27,509
their own like vices I I'm always really

588
00:32:27,509 --> 00:32:28,860
they're like either bring their phone in

589
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:30,389
and then connect your corporate laptop

590
00:32:30,389 --> 00:32:31,859
their phone and bypass that needed

591
00:32:31,859 --> 00:32:33,330
restrictions next thing you know that

592
00:32:33,330 --> 00:32:35,249
corporate laptops popped and yeah

593
00:32:35,249 --> 00:32:36,960
actually I like from that happens this

594
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:41,749
is me doing it thank you I the other Oh

595
00:32:41,749 --> 00:33:00,049
Becca now you have you all right I

596
00:33:00,049 --> 00:33:04,350
didn't want to have to do this what I'm

597
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:10,070
sorry I couldn't understand you yeah oh

598
00:33:17,869 --> 00:33:24,330
yeah I'm definitely there's a I'm sorry

599
00:33:24,330 --> 00:33:28,679
I'm not pushing certainly different

600
00:33:28,679 --> 00:33:30,659
different and I think any congestion

601
00:33:30,659 --> 00:33:33,289
consultants full backing up in this on

602
00:33:33,289 --> 00:33:36,119
certain businesses or in certain fields

603
00:33:36,119 --> 00:33:37,980
you get a test for and it's like ours

604
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:42,330
this is going to be fun healthcare you

605
00:33:42,330 --> 00:33:44,460
really hope that that health care

606
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:46,679
companies would have stuff locked down

607
00:33:46,679 --> 00:33:50,869
and you have my health information know

608
00:33:50,869 --> 00:33:53,549
some of the Skerries contest that that

609
00:33:53,549 --> 00:33:56,669
I've done are at a hospital and I was

610
00:33:56,669 --> 00:33:58,139
seriously considering trying to steal a

611
00:33:58,139 --> 00:34:01,080
baby because that was the level of

612
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:04,189
access that I again

613
00:34:04,739 --> 00:34:10,089
other organizations I've seen you know

614
00:34:10,089 --> 00:34:12,429
certain financial places they they know

615
00:34:12,429 --> 00:34:15,909
what their issues are they done a good

616
00:34:15,909 --> 00:34:17,799
job of segmenting things off and locking

617
00:34:17,799 --> 00:34:20,409
them down so that it makes a little bit

618
00:34:20,409 --> 00:34:22,899
more challenging for the tester really

619
00:34:22,899 --> 00:34:27,069
large organizations frequently have some

620
00:34:27,069 --> 00:34:28,869
things that they're doing quite well and

621
00:34:28,869 --> 00:34:32,859
then and you're worried as a tester for

622
00:34:32,859 --> 00:34:34,059
a little bit that it's going to be hard

623
00:34:34,059 --> 00:34:36,460
and then you find the fact that they're

624
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:37,780
huge means they're screwing up a whole

625
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:41,489
bunch other stuff and can attack that

626
00:34:41,489 --> 00:34:43,839
yeah definitely certain organizations

627
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:46,510
are certain certain feel a little bit

628
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:50,679
more lockdown in others but it's not a

629
00:34:50,679 --> 00:34:53,260
hard and fast rule there's been this

630
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:55,270
surprising the crafting security pretty

631
00:34:55,270 --> 00:35:32,799
much everywhere you go so kiss me yeah

632
00:35:32,799 --> 00:35:41,109
the airport it's I mean it's an airport

633
00:35:41,109 --> 00:35:43,599
security yeah we have we all know that a

634
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:47,829
security theater same with your

635
00:35:47,829 --> 00:35:51,190
organization the people's it does I mean

636
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:52,780
to a certain degree like you're wearing

637
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:54,910
your your badge on a lanyard around your

638
00:35:54,910 --> 00:35:56,410
neck through all the people in your

639
00:35:56,410 --> 00:35:58,900
organization wear them on their hips

640
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:02,260
damn I clip there or is it where your

641
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:06,450
lanyard around your neck and that's okay

642
00:36:06,450 --> 00:36:10,780
what if the attacks that we use a lot in

643
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:14,710
physical penetration testing when we

644
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:15,510
spend the

645
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:19,020
I mentioned tailgating or following

646
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:21,420
people in the building we've actually

647
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:25,250
moved are moving away from that because

648
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:27,660
so because it is too easy because of the

649
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:29,040
problems like this like how do you tell

650
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,900
how do I tell you how to stop that

651
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:32,910
that's not like tell people not to do

652
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:37,710
that or put a turnstile in your already

653
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:39,480
you know telling you want to do that in

654
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:41,760
turn styles are expensive will do an

655
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:44,130
attack that involves badge money you

656
00:36:44,130 --> 00:36:46,380
have you know that keen on the editors

657
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:49,680
we have long-range Badgerys proxmark you

658
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:53,190
invite that badge so we target people

659
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:56,430
coming in heading out at the coffee shop

660
00:36:56,430 --> 00:36:59,790
and steal the badge and make a clone and

661
00:36:59,790 --> 00:37:04,140
walk in and when I'm asked on nine how

662
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:06,240
do we how do we stop that I can talk

663
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,220
about some more technological solutions

664
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:10,800
which are going to be like oh maybe move

665
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,690
I class readers are a different bag to

666
00:37:12,690 --> 00:37:15,630
put numbered pads on the doors so that

667
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:17,940
when people need to punch an echo in the

668
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:21,140
changes Elise in the sensitive areas but

669
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:24,030
something else Falls Rahman is have your

670
00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:26,280
folks where their badges on the lanyard

671
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:29,010
around their map as opposed to on your

672
00:37:29,010 --> 00:37:30,720
side because mine because it's hard for

673
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,490
me to get a read my holding that up to

674
00:37:32,490 --> 00:37:34,410
your chest and steal your badge that way

675
00:37:34,410 --> 00:37:37,440
it's not perfect solution but it makes

676
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:40,200
my job a little bit harder also you have

677
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:43,380
badge discipline had your badge always

678
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:44,550
on display while you're walking around

679
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:46,500
the facility but when you leave when you

680
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:48,510
go outside put it away put it in your

681
00:37:48,510 --> 00:37:50,970
bag so I don't know that someone sitting

682
00:37:50,970 --> 00:37:54,600
out GM dash he's really worked there I

683
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:58,830
don't know that's kind of I talked to

684
00:37:58,830 --> 00:38:00,330
Wallace we have to feed her question I'm

685
00:38:00,330 --> 00:38:01,710
like I'll talk about other stuff and

686
00:38:01,710 --> 00:38:19,170
make okay that's not good okay hyster

687
00:38:19,170 --> 00:38:25,100
security theater of I'm not fan

688
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:27,930
professionally but in regardless will it

689
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:30,210
help us with what we're trying to do as

690
00:38:30,210 --> 00:38:33,690
far as committee people that they they

691
00:38:33,690 --> 00:38:35,700
need to do whatever security action that

692
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:38,370
we really want me to do to a certain

693
00:38:38,370 --> 00:38:40,200
degree i think it might be okay if you

694
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:43,710
can do something like oh we've talked

695
00:38:43,710 --> 00:38:45,510
about scenario we're like tailgating

696
00:38:45,510 --> 00:38:47,640
happens you need to like scare anyone

697
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:49,800
for a week by having like really insane

698
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:53,190
entry and exit procedures and maybe

699
00:38:53,190 --> 00:38:54,690
don't give them all the information but

700
00:38:54,690 --> 00:38:56,640
lets the rumor mill vela circulate that

701
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:59,550
there's a security problem so um you

702
00:38:59,550 --> 00:39:01,740
know exactly what happened but you've

703
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:04,590
raised everyone's awareness by causing

704
00:39:04,590 --> 00:39:07,560
some hats on their life i don't know i

705
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:49,110
wish i may be a curie office and they

706
00:39:49,110 --> 00:39:51,960
had made up of mock movie posters of

707
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:54,450
current it's like movies and then they

708
00:39:54,450 --> 00:39:56,820
had swapped out like the curious it was

709
00:39:56,820 --> 00:39:58,290
like the new Mission Impossible movie

710
00:39:58,290 --> 00:40:01,290
but you know is I don't want their like

711
00:40:01,290 --> 00:40:03,330
mission impossible not clicking links

712
00:40:03,330 --> 00:40:05,460
and fish Neil but it was instead of that

713
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:07,500
boring piece of paper it looked like you

714
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:11,310
know the legit movie posters that that

715
00:40:11,310 --> 00:40:13,260
they had up and complaceme also had like

716
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:16,140
hand out free book for these I side I

717
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:19,850
stole a couple cuz they're pretty cool

718
00:40:19,850 --> 00:40:22,190
but

719
00:40:22,190 --> 00:40:25,800
exactly but you know most often think I

720
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,330
think the Cure works probably had

721
00:40:27,330 --> 00:40:29,520
something else in our breakroom Jane

722
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:31,770
like don't give out information over the

723
00:40:31,770 --> 00:40:34,740
phone and we test their people on that

724
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:36,420
and most part yeah we don't give out

725
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:37,950
information of a song which is annoying

726
00:40:37,950 --> 00:40:39,960
if you're calling in as an employee

727
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:42,360
trying to get information out of them so

728
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:48,270
yeah it does happen but I I doubt in

729
00:40:48,270 --> 00:40:50,040
that case that it was just the security

730
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:52,860
person coming up with that on her own it

731
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:55,500
was more likely that she teamed up with

732
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:58,800
someone in that in the movie studio to

733
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:01,260
like hey Camille he was already working

734
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:03,540
on the idea without ever having the joy

735
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:06,180
of listening to me talk for however long

736
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:13,530
I've been time I uh well then I'll stop

737
00:41:13,530 --> 00:41:15,720
I leave you all to go about your day

738
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:17,970

739
00:41:17,970 --> 00:41:21,240
listening to me talk on my Twitter dress

740
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:23,190
up there feel free to ignore that

741
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:24,750
because I hadn't logged in and months

742
00:41:24,750 --> 00:41:28,740
but I mean via check it out if you like

743
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:32,160
um I work for security I don't want to

744
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:35,520
plug them too much but there's lots of

745
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,130
you know security options out there

746
00:41:37,130 --> 00:41:40,730
we're also one of them so check out

747
