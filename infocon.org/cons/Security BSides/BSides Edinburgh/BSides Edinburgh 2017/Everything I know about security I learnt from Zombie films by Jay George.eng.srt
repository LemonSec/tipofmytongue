1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,759
yeah welcome to the last concert yeah

2
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:08,970
last i4d in the vent hole oh good Jesus

3
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:10,950
talk about an introduction to

4
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:14,340
information secure so where did I wake

5
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:17,130
up this afternoon so I realize it's the

6
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:18,720
end of what spots are pretty long and

7
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,609
vain it's only the keynote are after

8
00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:22,710
after this so it kind of falls to me to

9
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:24,840
list all your spirits at at some point

10
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:26,970
and end on something a bit of a lighter

11
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:28,170
note and some of the technical tools

12
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:30,300
you've had so my name is Jay and if

13
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:31,349
there's one thing I love more than

14
00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:32,460
information security

15
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:34,829
it's the undead and I particularly love

16
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:36,210
seeing them eat grisly ends and all

17
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:37,620
sorts of interesting creative ways

18
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:39,989
implying providing us with some sort of

19
00:00:39,989 --> 00:00:42,510
lessons about information security along

20
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:45,329
along the way before we get started a

21
00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:47,640
little warning though this talk will

22
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,340
feature graphic depictions of

23
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:52,530
decapitation disembowelment

24
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:56,449
and of course brains it will not feature

25
00:00:56,449 --> 00:01:00,300
fluffy bunnies unless of course they're

26
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,940
being decapitated disemboweled or having

27
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:06,420
their brains eaten by the undead so if

28
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:08,850
seeing brains get spattered by a group

29
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:11,070
of gung-ho zombie Holocaust survivors

30
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:13,770
isn't your thing suggest you find your

31
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:17,430
safe space now oh there may be dull

32
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:19,439
swearword as well - hey you know if you

33
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,150
have young Ben coming towards you trying

34
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:22,619
to eat your brain if you say probably

35
00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:25,710
little bit more than oops all right then

36
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:29,670
let's get messy there's some people

37
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:31,829
sheltered we're fulfilled with climbing

38
00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:33,509
trees making dens and running around

39
00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:34,920
their friends playing cowboys and

40
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,720
Indians but it would eat each other

41
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,520
I spent my youth cover themselves in

42
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,439
green paint walking around with a fake

43
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:42,740
em limb controlling the fence faces off

44
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:44,939
probably sounds like a normal childhood

45
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:47,729
in Wales to you but mine was more due to

46
00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:50,310
my love of zombie films a very early age

47
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:53,299
thought to the coming under pocalypse

48
00:01:53,299 --> 00:01:56,729
pretty clearly stuttering ate mold so

49
00:01:56,729 --> 00:01:58,259
while most of my childhood friends

50
00:01:58,259 --> 00:01:59,520
through indirect growth of the

51
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,159
astronauts or Simon are dreamed of a

52
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:04,500
world chock full of cool ways to kill

53
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,680
zombies so far for two-thirds hunger

54
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,750
time and it seems the security world is

55
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:11,620
borrowing terms the films of my

56
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:14,230
now we talk about max DDoS attacks by

57
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:16,870
zombicide computers and things like the

58
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:19,840
epidemic is spreading so is anyone

59
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,459
though we use easily understood terms

60
00:02:21,459 --> 00:02:23,590
like that when the security world is

61
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:26,140
full of confusing jargon like this

62
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:28,480
I mean anyone would think all these

63
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,329
slang and acronyms were to stop him from

64
00:02:31,329 --> 00:02:32,950
getting involved in security at all

65
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:35,110
instead of fostering the idea that

66
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:36,790
security is everyone's responsibility

67
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:39,280
really I mean try talking to a local

68
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,409
thankfully businesses about penetration

69
00:02:41,409 --> 00:02:43,450
testing and you can get raised eyebrows

70
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:45,579
[ __ ] from some rather than look of

71
00:02:45,579 --> 00:02:47,440
concern engagement than you really want

72
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,810
to house lots of people looking to break

73
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:52,450
into the world affairs security as a job

74
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:54,160
is sometimes feel like a bit of a closed

75
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,989
shop where the inside to keep their

76
00:02:55,989 --> 00:02:57,730
knowledge to themselves and get up to

77
00:02:57,730 --> 00:02:59,349
speed on some of the concepts can be a

78
00:02:59,349 --> 00:03:01,269
little bit tricky at times now if

79
00:03:01,269 --> 00:03:02,349
there's one thing that is easy to

80
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:08,109
understand survival so have a little

81
00:03:08,109 --> 00:03:09,909
look into the world of zombie films and

82
00:03:09,909 --> 00:03:11,650
some of the pauses lessons they can

83
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:14,140
offer us start with some of the basic

84
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:17,760
tenets of network security

85
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:29,620
I'm never seen an infection

86
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:35,370
and I get you something like a glass of

87
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:37,580
water

88
00:03:39,709 --> 00:03:43,760
Anna Anna

89
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:11,290
anyone know one name

90
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:15,980
not in vain

91
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:29,359
[Music]

92
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:41,860
[Music]

93
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:45,289
classic kill sale you who wonders who

94
00:04:45,289 --> 00:04:46,849
I'm start with there and I don't me

95
00:04:46,849 --> 00:04:48,409
making sure you've got a handy fire

96
00:04:48,409 --> 00:04:51,589
poker lying around all times you're

97
00:04:51,589 --> 00:04:53,179
going to survive past the first thing in

98
00:04:53,179 --> 00:04:55,879
the under few future or managing

99
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:57,860
corporate networks some kind you reach

100
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:59,929
it enforce quality and segregation

101
00:04:59,929 --> 00:05:02,089
control to every opportunity the Academy

102
00:05:02,089 --> 00:05:04,129
let's be honest that woman looked pretty

103
00:05:04,129 --> 00:05:04,849
ill yeah

104
00:05:04,849 --> 00:05:06,319
and then she was lying in the middle of

105
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:08,059
a room with lots of perfectly healthy

106
00:05:08,059 --> 00:05:11,389
definitely not dead people to I mean

107
00:05:11,389 --> 00:05:12,949
I'll to make sure she could have come in

108
00:05:12,949 --> 00:05:15,169
with that this a case of severe sniffles

109
00:05:15,169 --> 00:05:18,229
and a really bad Sun bed job but the

110
00:05:18,229 --> 00:05:19,729
consequences could have been considering

111
00:05:19,729 --> 00:05:20,839
more serious there's which I've

112
00:05:20,839 --> 00:05:23,719
inspected opt was around Sony maybe they

113
00:05:23,719 --> 00:05:25,909
thought of locking her away observing

114
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:27,800
her for a while can add some tests

115
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,179
before letting them mix into gen-pop

116
00:05:29,179 --> 00:05:31,759
then the emergency fire poker treatment

117
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:34,069
would have been needed after all and it

118
00:05:34,069 --> 00:05:35,299
should be the same when you considered

119
00:05:35,299 --> 00:05:37,599
allowing data to enter your networks to

120
00:05:37,599 --> 00:05:40,039
all data to be screened before being

121
00:05:40,039 --> 00:05:42,379
landed in fact the Yukon control which

122
00:05:42,379 --> 00:05:44,689
means email attachments things download

123
00:05:44,689 --> 00:05:46,669
from the web and theta said to you by

124
00:05:46,669 --> 00:05:48,499
your customers your clients and your

125
00:05:48,499 --> 00:05:51,229
business partners to and if you can't be

126
00:05:51,229 --> 00:05:53,119
sure whether it's safe then really to

127
00:05:53,119 --> 00:05:55,399
quarantine it until some some someone

128
00:05:55,399 --> 00:05:57,499
else can and extends a separating your

129
00:05:57,499 --> 00:05:59,389
network into zones of trust to me you're

130
00:05:59,389 --> 00:06:02,059
the big red infinite pie Odo's on the

131
00:06:02,059 --> 00:06:04,129
right there I prefer to call it the Wild

132
00:06:04,129 --> 00:06:06,019
West you know and those people shouldn't

133
00:06:06,019 --> 00:06:08,269
aspire to connect ins your networks and

134
00:06:08,269 --> 00:06:09,619
be able to do anything on your systems

135
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:11,479
and services that they am like am I

136
00:06:11,479 --> 00:06:13,129
having public-facing web servers that

137
00:06:13,129 --> 00:06:15,019
have some particular services running on

138
00:06:15,019 --> 00:06:16,879
on the water lives and get through

139
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:18,619
through to those you only live in

140
00:06:18,619 --> 00:06:21,199
segregated behind a firewall to so

141
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:22,459
people can't get straight the crown

142
00:06:22,459 --> 00:06:24,139
jewels when you've got your databases of

143
00:06:24,139 --> 00:06:26,919
your financial data sits sitting on that

144
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:28,999
wireless network to know there's the old

145
00:06:28,999 --> 00:06:31,099
additive cannot throw in the network

146
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:32,869
cables out of the window really anyone

147
00:06:32,869 --> 00:06:34,759
can connect to connect to that and they

148
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:37,369
want to throw your your wireless clients

149
00:06:37,369 --> 00:06:41,599
behind a behind a firewall to great

150
00:06:41,599 --> 00:06:42,709
example and that couldn't met with

151
00:06:42,709 --> 00:06:45,349
segregation gone wrong t.j.maxx reach

152
00:06:45,349 --> 00:06:47,400
way back from 2000

153
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,440
now so TAC has gone through a very

154
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,060
poorly configured why is that Wireless

155
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:52,830
and that network and then go on would

156
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:54,720
access to other parts of the network to

157
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,370
somewhere rather than able to get ahold

158
00:06:56,370 --> 00:06:58,620
of loader employee credentials to access

159
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:01,199
databases and they started the harvest

160
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:03,000
the credit card details of t.j.maxx his

161
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,100
clients so conservative estimate was

162
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:06,810
that forty five million credit card

163
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:09,240
details were briefed possibly looking up

164
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,550
to as much as 100 million now those

165
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:12,570
attackers are in the network for

166
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:14,940
eighteen months before they were found

167
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:17,610
and a total cost is estimated to be up

168
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:19,490
to roughly two hundred fifty six mil

169
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:23,550
million bucks so a not inconsequential

170
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:27,810
thing so let's have another look at a

171
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:31,039
bit of security what I want

172
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:46,190
Huy just going so it's not just the

173
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:48,790
toilets a glass degree that'll kill you

174
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:56,720
lesson from this anyone around Waverly

175
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,419
stations sure yeah well a healthy sense

176
00:07:59,419 --> 00:08:02,210
of skepticism is a good thing to have in

177
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:04,190
your security mindset you know going

178
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:05,780
into the previous point about second

179
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:07,130
some little items to come into your

180
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:09,139
network you should really make sure the

181
00:08:09,139 --> 00:08:10,669
end users of their information systems

182
00:08:10,669 --> 00:08:12,470
are checking things that make it through

183
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:14,630
our filters to to come the Platt fix for

184
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:16,700
malware to hide inside seemingly useful

185
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:18,229
pieces of software that they're made

186
00:08:18,229 --> 00:08:20,180
available website to download or senate

187
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:22,520
invite by email for unsuspecting to

188
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,470
click on and open up a month usually

189
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:25,880
when they're sitting on your most

190
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,130
protected corporate networks many the

191
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:30,320
phishing scams evolved over years change

192
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,940
for the emails offering almost too good

193
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:33,979
to be true deals there's lots of CEO

194
00:08:33,979 --> 00:08:36,650
whaling effects that we see seen a but

195
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:38,510
attackers mimic a trusted or internal

196
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:40,429
domain and we look at the highlighted in

197
00:08:40,429 --> 00:08:42,529
yellow up here as an RN masquerading at

198
00:08:42,529 --> 00:08:45,440
integrating S&M though people can be

199
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,600
easily fooled by by these things and

200
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,490
then trying to learn someone with enough

201
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:51,560
rights to authorize a very high value

202
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,420
payments the person can at the attack

203
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:55,730
here and just in case you think this

204
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:57,320
isn't really as much of a problem as it

205
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,770
seems well the FBI's data the CEO

206
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:02,720
wailings cost us businesses around 2.3

207
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,220
billion dollars over the last three

208
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:07,580
years and fact last year the CEO of an

209
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:09,620
aircraft parts firm got fired after

210
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:11,029
falling to one of these scams

211
00:09:11,029 --> 00:09:13,730
cost the company just shy of 41 million

212
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:18,040
million euros so that's a fair and dead

213
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:21,290
okay one more of the basics before we go

214
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:24,250
with the rest of these steps

215
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:31,999
[Music]

216
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:41,720
[Music]

217
00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:01,710
all right so the first thing that does

218
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:03,120
come to my mind is that looks a hell of

219
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,590
a like trees and they on top of that

220
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:07,680
truck but hey hey this one's actually a

221
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,540
hotbed of advice all crammed into one

222
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:11,220
delightful nugget of brain splattered

223
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:13,410
loveliness so if you dig a little bit

224
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:14,820
deeper into the blood and the goal well

225
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:18,660
what can we learn well first before most

226
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,670
learn to value importance of having a

227
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:22,710
bucket of some kind when we talk about

228
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:24,360
the pillars of security people tend to

229
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,010
focus on confidentiality and integrity

230
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:28,230
and they kind of leave availability to

231
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:30,120
one side let's be totally honest about

232
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,430
about things availability is effectively

233
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:34,200
the services that you need to deliver

234
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,540
the business that you run you don't have

235
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:37,980
those services in place at all

236
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:40,230
you're not going to generate any any

237
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:41,580
income or all those other nice things

238
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:44,790
your company's supposed to be doing so

239
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:45,990
when you think through the Horde of the

240
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:48,030
undead intent on having having you for

241
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:50,070
lunch having a spare gun going to get

242
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:51,210
everybody tight hope

243
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:53,190
if your organization systems that you're

244
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:54,810
trying to protect and back in everything

245
00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:56,370
up before making that og change your

246
00:10:56,370 --> 00:10:58,380
public-facing web server is it good

247
00:10:58,380 --> 00:10:59,820
means rolling back should something go

248
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,740
wrong you know there's a few things can

249
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:03,840
will lose you job quicker than an

250
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,760
embarrassing outage it could have been

251
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,370
prevented by hit with big red backup

252
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:10,740
button of course the organization big

253
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:12,750
issues most long as aces these days is

254
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:15,150
ransom way all your important data get

255
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:16,770
scrambled by the bad guys who then

256
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:18,450
demand a stack of cash in return for

257
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:20,850
decrypting your files instead make it in

258
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:22,350
for worthless junk for all time

259
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:24,510
well my backups you really going to have

260
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:27,030
to pay so when us police force did you

261
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:29,010
know very embarrassing for them we do

262
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:31,170
not negotiate with terrorists online

263
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:34,050
criminals find are we going to lose all

264
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:35,880
of the data you have which again another

265
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,380
you ethically sourced they're they're

266
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:39,390
the last eight years worth of digital

267
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:42,270
evidence in one go they claim to time

268
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:43,560
not all of it was critical stuff but

269
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,760
there's a really great quote from one of

270
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,230
the defense lawyers involved about

271
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:47,790
whether it was critical data or not I

272
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:49,440
said well depends what side the jail

273
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:54,540
cell you see it really and again just in

274
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:57,750
case is solely us police force issue 57%

275
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,940
NHS trust in Scotland have been hit by

276
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:02,280
ransomware attack and writing start of

277
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,580
this year the logs

278
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:07,020
NHS trust in England got called out to

279
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:09,220
now an extension of this is to have a

280
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:11,350
really solid rollback plan as well if

281
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:12,130
you know you're going to be surrounded

282
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:14,410
by halls with flesh eaters then keep one

283
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:16,240
on your exit not despised it's probably

284
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,490
going to save your lives too and you

285
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:19,810
really should document your plan to

286
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:21,190
return to your original state with its

287
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:23,320
Mason systems as well before you get

288
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,670
your attitude I mean before someone

289
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:28,480
notices I enacted some kind now an

290
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,040
important point from that scene as well

291
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:33,910
it's not to go solo on anything you need

292
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:35,560
to plan your security work in the team

293
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,510
spread the load out a bit but that's

294
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:39,040
pulling in the multidisciplinary team

295
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,450
from your course your organization's

296
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:42,460
whole grants sourcing for experts to

297
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:45,310
complete your 24/7 security monitoring

298
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:47,320
on your behalf that you need to involve

299
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:53,710
each other that's it anyone done started

300
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:56,050
to first view zombie halls or plan a few

301
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:57,790
dead ends and fought your way with

302
00:12:57,790 --> 00:12:59,470
nothing but dust bin Laden some sharp

303
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:02,320
it's a drain drain pipe great so let's

304
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,820
start thinking about the long-term

305
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:05,860
survival in a world where everyone's out

306
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:08,140
to attack us the danger behind every

307
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:09,970
door to lead and we'll mix an offensive

308
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:12,120
and defensive skills in order to survive

309
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,560
for the modern throat landscape you

310
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:14,950
ready

311
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:19,390
so limbered up tides of shoelaces cardio

312
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:23,280
done let's crack on

313
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:36,230
and girl I'm a twisty little girl

314
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:49,119
[Music]

315
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:04,450
[Music]

316
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:08,640
she's not going to ask the school club

317
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:12,060
today Ishii but it's fine because her

318
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:13,800
sacrifice it's for the benefit to the

319
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,600
rest of us as a perfectly illustrate the

320
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,050
point never underestimate your opponent

321
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:20,820
now we've moved on considerably from the

322
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:22,380
days when it's solely bedroom hackers

323
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:23,640
and crackers think to a long line

324
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,770
systems of fun we're into a world of

325
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:27,770
highly organized well rehearse

326
00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:30,150
well-funded threat actors who have

327
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:31,920
considerable experience in separating

328
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,470
you feel data and your funds notes

329
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:36,270
groups like the Russian business and

330
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:38,430
network sound little bit Chamber of

331
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:40,290
Commerce see that they've been around

332
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:42,660
for years actually would expire botnets

333
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:44,070

recently of course the hot topic has

00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:53,610
been allegations of Russian involvement

339
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:56,130

00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:02,670
apparent misinformation campaigns - and

343
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:04,320
of course there's this unassuming

344
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,240
building on the outskirts of Shanghai

345

identified you know like a normal job

350
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:19,589
there's a great interview with Obama

351
00:15:19,589 --> 00:15:21,440
from a few years back and he's

352
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:25,350
recounting a a meeting with some Chinese

00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,430
be as brazen as that just shows that

362
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:49,050
people have concluded comfortable

363
00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:51,959
carrying activities such as this now a

00:15:51,959 --> 00:15:54,480

lovely headlines in the Daily Mail

it's going to apply patch to a system or

395
00:17:15,809 --> 00:17:17,220
making infrastructure change you should

396
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:19,319
really verify afterwards anytime that

397
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:21,630
you run can you know make sure the thing

398
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:23,160
you fixed has introduced some other

399
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,420
issues and the thing you're trying to

400
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:26,040
fix did actually get fixed as well

401
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,780
there's a reason why the PCI data

just make sure ms stuff in anyway

however that's not everything everything

chunk of cash in a significant amount of

412
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:48,179

items that they need six

eventually wasted all that investment of

time and money and having video work you

420
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,429
know and because these are old

421
00:18:05,429 --> 00:18:06,720
vulnerabilities that are in place and

422
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,920
they've been in the public domain for a

423
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,290
long time it's much more likely at that

424
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:12,030
point that someone with the skill level

425
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:14,220
of a script kiddie could find an usually

426
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:16,920
an exploit and own those systems there

427
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:19,590
you know and that's quite a worrying

428

graph from the Verizon data breaches

429
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:25,230

vulnerabilities from years past but

00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,360
absolutely used to compromise

433
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,940
it's no good having a patent program if

434
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:37,060
you don't actually do the tactile then

435
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:38,560
there's some anecdotal tales about

commercial banks that I won't name

suffered and attack they had a whole

heap of vulnerable systems they knew

about for quite a long amount of time

not exactly stealthy you can't argue

503
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:11,890
with the effectiveness of it though I'll

504
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:13,360
open it up to the floor what can this

505
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:17,850
delightful piece of glory offer to us

506
00:22:20,430 --> 00:22:24,070
pretty in that you know sometimes you

507
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:25,210
just have to admit defeat

508
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:26,530
what's the whole thing invoke your

509
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:28,210
nuclear options and start from scratch

510
00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:31,030
way back in 2011 Microsoft started

511
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:33,040
recommend that recommending you

512
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,900
reinstall the operating system if you

513
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:36,850
got caught by a particular rootkit and

514
00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:38,350
this is software these days evolve

515
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:40,390
deployment even non-targeted commercial

516
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:42,610
malware has such advanced debate evasion

517
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:45,520
capabilities built-in in into it it's

518
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,500
probably going to persist the cleaning

519
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:50,200
efforts try to you and run Sony's

520
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,300
blender is a really good one here you

521
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:53,650
know trying to put some anti-piracy

522
00:22:53,650 --> 00:22:56,470
measures in a really under underhanded

523
00:22:56,470 --> 00:23:00,130
way salting bit of your fury sure or you

524
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:01,600
man it's a copy to protecting rootkit

525
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,460
that I've had you know they provided a

526
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:04,990
fix to remove the software for that

527
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:06,520
employer and opened up the endpoints to

528
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:09,630
even more worse form from ability to

529
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:12,250
this goes beyond malware incidents as

530
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:14,470
well you know applies to the breaches of

531
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:16,960
all kind so we live in a very litigious

532
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,940
world world now and there's a lot more

533
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:21,070
finger-pointing between businesses that

534
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:22,750
comes to dodging the blame for security

535
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:24,550
breaches taking place and the amount of

536
00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:26,320
assurance around good security

537
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,910
throughout the supply chain just go up

538
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:30,010
and up so it's going to just boot an

539
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:32,140
attacker out of your system or do want

540
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:33,910
to rebuild the whole thing so from a

541
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:35,920
known good good backup you have or even

542
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:38,020
start from that scratch it's going to

543
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:39,700
take a hell of a lot of it's a lot of X

544
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:41,530
explaining the same system got

545
00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:43,540
compromised twice and that's not sort of

546
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:48,400
explaining I enjoy doing so what have we

547
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:48,730
learned

548
00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:50,470
well apart from the whole budget of use

549
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:51,820
we'll start by closing security

550
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:53,890
techniques we should remember one thing

551
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:56,410
there's no cure for the zombie virus and

552
00:23:56,410 --> 00:23:58,090
there's no end state for security either

553
00:23:58,090 --> 00:24:00,430
moving target comes from vigilance

554
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:02,860
learning and determination required to

555
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:04,900
protect your important data and keep the

556
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:07,330
fleshies as a bakery so keep a spare

557
00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:09,070
click close the hands make sure your

558
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:11,140
security chains actually works and you

559
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:12,220
never know what you might find in a

560
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:14,440
sporting goods shop so thanks for your

561
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:14,740
time

562
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:16,480
let's take a moment to reflect on one

563
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:20,340
thing if the rabbit made it out alive
