philippe peters i've been working as a

7
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,520
principal security engineer and security

8
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,160
research at soup innovation

9
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,680
super innovation it's a brazilian

10
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,199
company and the focus in uh exponential

11
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:28,240
growing and to give a

12
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,640
awesome experience to the developers guy

13
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,479
you know and uh the peoples and i am a

14
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:35,040
security research and instructor that's

15
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,280
uh hacker secure or hack security

16
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,440
whatever and uh this company is

17
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,760
responsible to provide some courses of

18
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,600
the uh you know pen

19
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,160
and uh about the red team blue team and

20
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,680
the purple team

21
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,840
and another different courses right so i

22
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,399
am hacking is not a crime advocate it's

23
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:55,199
a awesome awesome awesome project and

24
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:56,320
the

25
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,800
the idea in this project and to

26
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,800
you know to try explain more about this

27
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,479
kind of concept and this culture because

28
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:06,960
hacking is is not a crime exactly

29
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,600
hacking it's a mindset hacking in uh you

30
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,799
know it's a lifestyle and it's about

31
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:16,400
creative mind right so that's our idea

32
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,400
about this project and i'm a part of the

33
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,720
staff team of the deaf group in sao

34
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,759
paulo and as you can see i love to be

35
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:26,400
part of the many different communities

36
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,880
because i believe this it's very very

37
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,640
very important to be part of this

38
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,799
community because you can share

39
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:35,360
the knowledgement you can share you know

40
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,759
the different subjects and topics you

41
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:40,720
can give the uh the knowledge you can

42
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:41,920
receive

43
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,880
as well so uh and i'm i've been served

44
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,280
as a professor in some universities here

45
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,119
in brazil and

46
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:51,680
some colleges like afiyapi and mackenzie

47
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,840
and

48
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,360
um this kind this name of this

49
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,200
university and

50
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,759
i am founder and instructor of the the

51
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,159
principal the main course in in hacker

52
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:04,159
sake then i need smaller analysis

53
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:06,719
fundamentals right so here my contact is

54
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:07,759
in

55
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:09,919
and telegram and this is my email if

56
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:12,160
you'd like to send me a message to talk

57
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,920
with me you know to share

58
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,040
acknowledgement i i really appreciate

59
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,560
and it's the project that i am

60
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,480
participating it is my homepage in my

61
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,040
webpage you know i

62
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,720
i want to

63
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,640
use uh powerpoint here in this

64
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,360
presentations right so here's some open

65
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,400
source project projects that i like and

66
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,239
i will explain more about the orosec

67
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:37,599
project in this day and here i am i've

68
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:39,200
been working you know in another

69
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,959
different projects like rich his opinion

70
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:43,760
source to allows you to create and store

71
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,800
and share

72
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,360
how to make securely and some

73
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,360
formulas right

74
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,040
and another project's pickle it's

75
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,360
another open source platform it's a

76
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,319
frame you work based on server driven ui

77
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:58,480
that's allowed teams to make a change to

78
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,800
native mobile or web application it's

79
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,800
very very interesting in another one

80
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,120
it's a charles it's another open source

81
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,280
too that it deployed quickly continually

82
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,879
and securely all the teams

83
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:10,640
simultaneously validate different

84
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,239
hypotheses

85
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:15,200
with a specific groups of users right so

86
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,920
here we can find another presentations

87
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:21,519
or talks that i did in some events and

88
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:24,080
another in here some articles that i

89
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,480
have been published if you'd like to see

90
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,920
right so today i would like to before to

91
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,920
explain or to do the demo i would like

92
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,480
to uh explain about the some differences

93
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,879
between this kind of topic right because

94
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:38,480
i would like to explain more about the

95
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,440
difference between assessed dust and ast

96
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,720
difference as you can see here right so

97
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,239
but i would like to share this picture

98
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:47,680
because this picture i think it's

99
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,120
explain

100
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,159
better the differences between and dust

101
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:55,040
and sass right so i i pick up this

102
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,599
information of the synopsis

103
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:59,680
website it's very interesting because

104
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,239
you can see the differences here in this

105
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:04,400
picture right so here you can find the

106
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,120
white box security that's uh assassed

107
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,599
right so it's the pin of course the test

108
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:12,319
access the two underlying framework

109
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:14,879
designing and implementations and on the

110
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,399
other hand you have the black box

111
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:17,918
security testing

112
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:20,079
usually the application is tested from

113
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,720
the outside right so this is the

114
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,280
different this type this type of testing

115
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,240
represents the hacker approach right and

116
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,080
when you try to explore something to try

117
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,320
this application it's vulnerable right

118
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:38,400
so but how i said outside in right so

119
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,160
another difference it's when you talk

120
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,520
about the sas requires the cersei code

121
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,360
right so the sas doesn't require a

122
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,160
deployed application you understand so

123
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,880
it's analyze the search code or binary

124
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,880
without execution of the application we

125
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,080
can analyze before to deploy the

126
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,000
application right so on the other hand

127
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,400
in the dust uh

128
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,639
tools we need to require the running the

129
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,400
application right so that doesn't

130
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,880
require the search code just to analyze

131
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,080
by executing the application another

132
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,160
part here it's finding vulnerabilities

133
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:16,880
early in stlc the the this um it's the

134
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,280
process right so the security the

135
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,280
developer life cycle of the when you

136
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,600
need to uh you have the you know the

137
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,520
software development life cycle you have

138
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,720
the line to develop some software right

139
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,120
so the scan can be executed as soon as

140
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,840
code and demon feature complete

141
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,919
when you talk about the dust find

142
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:38,960
vulnerability vulnerabilities tower the

143
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,520
end of the cycle right in the end of

144
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,560
this sdlc that's a good point here

145
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,919
another is less expense to fix

146
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:49,039
take a look at this it's a very

147
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:51,199
important thing because since the gonna

148
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:54,479
beats are found early in the sdlc it's

149
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:57,280
easier right and faster to remediate

150
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,160
them

151
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,919
but you only underhand when you talk

152
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:02,560
about the dust it's more expensive to

153
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,039
fix because you have the application

154
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:07,199
right so the critical nervous may be

155
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:11,120
fixed as an emergency release right

156
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,880
and another is can discovery

157
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,280
oops let me

158
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:21,120
put my hand here again another is scans

159
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,720
discovery runtime and environment

160
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,960
related issues right so

161
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,800
and uh since the tools scan statistical

162
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,120
it's can't discover runtime

163
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,240
vulnerabilities right but in dust you

164
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,560
can discover in run time you take a l if

165
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,800
you compare both of them you can see

166
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,240
what the difference between us in

167
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,880
between and and the dust and size right

168
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,440
and typically support all kind of

169
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,600
software when you talk about the sas

170
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,680
and the assistive communities can

171
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,840
typically scan only apps

172
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,479
like web applications and web services

173
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:56,319
some is different right so this is

174
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:58,400
important thing important concepts that

175
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,880
you need to understand before to start

176
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,919
the demo right so here we have three two

177
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:06,720
three another uh approach not three

178
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,639
actually we have the same approach

179
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:10,400
because here you can understand about

180
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,240
the sas the statistic application

181
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,919
security testing

182
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:16,240
right because you can test or usually

183
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,520
perform before the season in production

184
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,240
on and only in the source code

185
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,759
and by the way i will explain more about

186
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:26,240
this open source project or stock is

187
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,199
currently labeling assessed right and on

188
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,039
the hand you have the dots i i already

189
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:33,759
explained about this and another is he

190
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:35,919
asked interactive application security

191
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:38,560
test is that another another different

192
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,880
test right so eos is a combination of

193
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,280
the statistic and dynamic testing model

194
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,879
right uh

195
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:48,400
basically you can you know uh

196
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,560
putting both of them together and you

197
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,199
can realize both of them right together

198
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:56,000
and another interesting approach and

199
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,639
talk to explain the concept it's about

200
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:02,240
the vulnerabilities right so this uh

201
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,280
project this platform uh use the

202
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,039
vulnerabilities like at three different

203
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:09,199
security branches right the different

204
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:11,919
six types of different security ranks

205
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:13,840
right the first is

206
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,960
totally critical it's more high and

207
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:20,319
another it's high before it's medium low

208
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:23,039
and info it's you know it means

209
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:26,080
to give some information about this

210
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,080
this kind of vulnerability and another

211
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,000
it's unknown probably you don't

212
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,080
understand more about this how this

213
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,159
means because probably all of us we

214
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:37,440
don't know what it is and or another

215
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,279
different

216
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:41,519
you know organization sabi

217
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:44,080
knows what it is right so in another

218
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,000
explanation it's about the false

219
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,160
positive because sometimes you have in

220
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,640
your company something it's maybe it's a

221
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,040
false positive like this you know and

222
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,640
the post degree and some information

223
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,440
about this database and you can set this

224
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,519
information uh

225
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:01,920
has a false positive right another

226
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:05,120
difference you can set it is accept risk

227
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,160
because

228
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,000
for example that some vulnerabilities

229
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,959
some flows you can set this like a

230
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:13,680
receptive risk it's not a exactly of a

231
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,760
vulnerability but you can accept this

232
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,080
risk right so it's important thing so

233
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,399
this is all this explanation it's about

234
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,480
the same concepts that i

235
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,839
would like to share with you okay so

236
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:28,480
so now we explain more about the or sec

237
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,600
right so philippe what is autosec it's

238
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,040
very interesting for exactly it's an

239
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,360
open source framework that

240
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,880
enhancing the identification of the

241
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:40,080
vulnerabilities in your project

242
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,360
with just one or few comments right so

243
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,519
basically autosac it's open source a

244
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:47,760
tool that performs a statistical

245
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,560
analysis to identify secret flows during

246
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,680
the development process this is very

247
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:57,040
important here because the idea here is

248
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,399
to give

249
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:01,360
the power of the developer in the hand

250
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,959
of the developer to give some uh

251
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:07,760
knowledgement of the security during the

252
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,000
development process of the code right

253
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,399
and here we have some you know languages

254
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:15,440
and tools supported by orozeki and i

255
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,079
will explain more about this uh another

256
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:20,480
thing so you can you you you know you

257
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,519
can click here in documentation right so

258
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:25,120
if you click here you

259
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,920
send to the overview what it is warsack

260
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,760
so again it's all being searched tool

261
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,399
that orchestrate other security to it's

262
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,640
here it's very interesting guys it's

263
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,040
very very interesting so our sec shows

264
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,680
the languages and tools to use to be

265
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,640
used in the project according the

266
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,360
available stack so check out check all

267
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,800
the support language here it's very

268
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,360
interesting i will open here and i will

269
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,000
take a look at this how many programming

270
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,760
languages is supported and tools

271
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,240
supported by autosec again it's an open

272
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,360
source

273
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,399
platform you can you know contribute

274
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:03,440
you can suggest something it's of course

275
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,560
is

276
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,519
uh

277
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:07,519
it's supported by zoop innovation my

278
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:09,519
company but it's totally totally open

279
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:11,600
sourcing right so here you can see some

280
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,640
language like python uh like a ruby

281
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,440
javascript typescript and golang another

282
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,640
is c sharp

283
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:22,800
java coupling kubernetes terraform leaks

284
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,959
here you can find another different

285
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:26,800
leaks what do you what is this means

286
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,680
phillip in this case leaks because you

287
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,839
you are talking about the the code not

288
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:33,920
alex you are about the flows in the code

289
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,640
and analytics here another interesting

290
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:39,519
point when you talk about the photosec

291
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:41,200
right so

292
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,480
where can you use rsec you can use in a

293
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,720
cli an intuitive cli

294
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,519
you can use here in a ci cd pipeline i

295
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:51,680
will demonstrate you do the demo in the

296
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,680
end of this presentation and you can use

297
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,639
any idex station eight station you know

298
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:59,600
integrated development environment and

299
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,200
you can set some comments that will

300
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,440
explain more this but here

301
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,800
it's the resume of the important thing

302
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,959
the three mains uh

303
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:09,920
you know

304
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,880
steps of the um

305
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,560
information that we will receive when

306
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,360
you execute the autosec right so here or

307
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,240
sec analyzes types performing three

308
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,600
different types the principle the main

309
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,079
different three analysis right so the

310
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:27,920
first is the assess that i am explaining

311
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,440
to you here

312
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,600
it means it's it's a static is called

313
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,279
analysis right so statistic application

314
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:34,720
security testing

315
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,839
another it's very very interesting elix

316
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:40,320
it means the leaks checks the search

317
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:44,800
code your source code for possible leaks

318
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:49,120
of credentials private keys or hard

319
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,839
coded password

320
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:54,480
what do you mean philip in this case

321
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,480
it's very very interesting because

322
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,560
sometimes when you are

323
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,399
a developer you are developing your

324
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:02,720
software you are code your project and

325
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,120
sometimes you set some comments in your

326
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,360
code because it's a a best practice you

327
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,000
come your all those your com your code

328
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,440
that you are doing and uh but sometimes

329
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,639
you put some

330
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:17,120
sensitive sensitive information inside

331
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,079
of your code or some keys of the aws or

332
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:22,880
azure or another cloud provider for

333
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,839
example and when do you when when

334
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:28,320
sometimes when you

335
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,120
suffering some attacks the first step of

336
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,720
the enumeration is tapping the

337
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,480
penetration test or the or the the

338
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,800
attacker can be

339
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,760
used to explore your code the first step

340
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,760
is to try and find

341
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:44,720
any

342
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,240
leaks or any

343
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,440
uh credentials in your code because it's

344
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,079
in unfortunately it's very common right

345
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:52,880
so

346
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,360
autosec can check

347
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,519
your code if you have some leaks

348
00:13:57,519 --> 00:13:59,199
information inside your goods it's very

349
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:01,199
interesting another point is dependence

350
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:02,399
audit

351
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:05,199
you analyze project dependence to check

352
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:07,839
for vulnerabilities in the third party

353
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:10,639
libraries in third party

354
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:12,639
libraries so sometimes you need to put

355
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:13,360
some

356
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,240
you know

357
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,320
different libraries in your code to call

358
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,120
something and maybe this kind of library

359
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,279
is vulnerable so it's very

360
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:25,040
interesting here point right so let me

361
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,560
explain more oh how can apply this so

362
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,600
the first of all i would like to install

363
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,160
their sec in my machine you have you

364
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,760
know everywhere they could this so it's

365
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,959
very very simple i have here let me

366
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:42,959
check oops let me check here

367
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:46,399
um yes i have here my folder um it's

368
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:48,959
very it's it's interesting here if you'd

369
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:50,000
like to

370
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,760
during this presentation or not after

371
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,000
this presentation you can uh

372
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
using the same the same code here you

373
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,839
can find in my github here

374
00:14:58,839 --> 00:15:01,680
philippe86 slash or

375
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,040
dash

376
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,800
demo you can find here all those

377
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,800
informations you can you know copy you

378
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,560
can you know

379
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,480
clone it as information here in your

380
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,480
environment you can do this the same

381
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,839
test here so first of all i will install

382
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:18,880
the horosek here in my machine it's very

383
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,959
simple to install or sex client on mac

384
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:23,279
os for linux you have to run the comment

385
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:26,160
below it's very simple you copy this and

386
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,600
i will pass here take a look this and

387
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,360
click on enter and i will set the

388
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,399
password because my user don't have

389
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:37,120
privilege to sound things and here as

390
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,759
you can see actual actual version is

391
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:42,240
stalled right so if i said here called

392
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:46,320
set step version i think version

393
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,920
as you can see here

394
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,519
and then it's this

395
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:52,000
new version right so it's very simple i

396
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,480
have here many projects means actually

397
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,279
directories or folders whatever right so

398
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:59,120
it's very simple to use the horoscope

399
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,279
here i will set or sec

400
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,399
i will

401
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:04,880
you know i can put the help command here

402
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,959
and you can see all those explanations

403
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:10,000
in in the in the cli right so our sex

404
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,639
cli prepares a package to be analyzed by

405
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:15,199
the or psych analysis api as you can see

406
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:17,199
here so we need to set the auto sec the

407
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:19,360
flags or commands and something like

408
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,079
that here the first example you can

409
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:23,600
saturday start

410
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,880
as you can see and you can set dash p

411
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:30,720
equal and here if you see is exactly

412
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,680
path

413
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,399
of the your project right so it's very

414
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:37,120
very simple so let's

415
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,279
put here the other sec again and i will

416
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:42,720
put start and i can set for example

417
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,040
dash dash help one more time here

418
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,279
because i like to pause it if i don't

419
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:48,560
know what the

420
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:52,000
commodity to do what they could hear as

421
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,759
you can see it's very

422
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:56,480
interesting cli and with many

423
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,440
explanation of some comments here about

424
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,399
the

425
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:01,360
dash

426
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,160
a

427
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,920
and you can set the authorization tokey

428
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,720
to for the autosec api i will explain

429
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,039
after and another

430
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:11,039
point maybe you can ask me if you can

431
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:12,319
think about it

432
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:14,880
so philip i have done sonar cube

433
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,480
and i have what the difference between

434
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,119
our second and sonar cube so that qb is

435
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:21,199
related itself it's a very interesting

436
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:24,160
framework or tool focusing on quality of

437
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,640
the your code but for a sec it's focused

438
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,400
on justin only

439
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,120
in security right and vulnerabilities

440
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:34,640
flows and uh and keys like you know a

441
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,160
leaks of the keys

442
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,520
and

443
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,799
um

444
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:40,160
it means

445
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,799
you when you if you use for example a

446
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:45,679
sonar cube you can set here

447
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:47,360
dash

448
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,160
o

449
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,440
and you can

450
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,640
set the format for output to be show one

451
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,559
option our text

452
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:58,160
st alt or json or sonar cue with the

453
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,960
full text head as you can see you can

454
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,679
you know integrate both of these disk uh

455
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:06,559
tools right you can using sonarqube to

456
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:09,120
to be if your code is you have a good

457
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,520
quality and you you can use this is

458
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,200
another open source tool but it's open

459
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,240
source two or sec to be if your code is

460
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,320
safe right so

461
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,880
here if you have this question i answer

462
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,120
for you right so

463
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,679
let me explain here let me use a good

464
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:29,200
disk okay i always

465
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,400
get this

466
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,919
i don't know why but i you know um okay

467
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:36,080
so let me set here the autosec the

468
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,400
commodore sec and start and if i don't

469
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,440
put any

470
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:42,080
path here i click just in start as you

471
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,440
can see

472
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,600
i will appear appears this information

473
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,919
for me oh the folder selected is

474
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:49,919
take a look this this is the my folder

475
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:51,440
that i am here

476
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:55,520
right so proceed yes oh no i said yes

477
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:59,120
okay and wow it's running now or when

478
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,440
you start the analysis we escape the

479
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,320
total of the 60 files that are not

480
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,480
considered to be analyzed to see more

481
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,520
details you can use the flag log 11

482
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:12,880
debug if you'd like to see why right so

483
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,200
i will set here i am not analyzing here

484
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,919
my code this many uh

485
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:20,400
folders that i have inside of my uh

486
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,559
machine here in this case right so this

487
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:24,960
is my project or sec demo i have here

488
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,440
some codes vulnerable and another it's

489
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:30,240
not vulnerable right so let me here

490
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:33,200
explain the result of this scanning

491
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,960
right so here uh aurasek ended the

492
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,960
analysis the anal analysis with the

493
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,360
status of award right so if with the

494
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,240
following results analysis started at

495
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,640
here in of course and i am recording

496
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:49,760
when i'm talking this uh

497
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,080
doing this presentation right so analyze

498
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,880
it finish it here so

499
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,440
uh i mean is about one minute right so

500
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,600
here take a look this in

501
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,080
incredible logs and information here

502
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,000
first of all the identification of the

503
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,400
language it's the javascript right

504
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,799
so the severity it's high do you

505
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:11,679
remember critical high median and low so

506
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:13,520
here the identification take a look at

507
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,120
this the line

508
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,000
2

509
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:16,880
column

510
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,159
13

511
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:21,039
and here take a look at the security

512
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:25,679
tools or sec nodejs it means here

513
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:27,520
the engine responsible to find this

514
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:31,200
winner reach is provided by oroz sec or

515
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,400
sec node.js is an is an engine right of

516
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,960
the detection the confidence is slow

517
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,679
take a look at this the exactly file

518
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:43,280
that you can find the vulnerability

519
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,440
because you have many folders many files

520
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,600
inside the folders so this can it will

521
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,159
be realized inside of performance inside

522
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:52,799
of all those projects that you set right

523
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:56,320
so the code flip code it should and the

524
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,600
score process to a doc exec so here as

525
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:03,760
you can see the exactly code vulnerable

526
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:04,640
right

527
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,039
but philip i am a developer i don't

528
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:08,559
understand more about the security and i

529
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:10,240
would like to understand more about

530
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:13,600
security so here we can find the details

531
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,000
right so we're using a show interpreter

532
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,200
when executing executing eo

533
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,799
os commands

534
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:22,720
arbitrary os commons injection

535
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:26,240
vulnerabilities are more likely when a

536
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:29,919
shell is exponent greater than a new

537
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:33,840
process right he did indeed the shell

538
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,799
matchers can be used when parameters are

539
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:39,760
user controlled for instance all those

540
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,799
explanation about this vulnerability and

541
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:45,679
here you can find more information

542
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:49,760
information check out this c v e

543
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,840
c w e

544
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:56,080
78 and here the reference that you can

545
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,640
read after and you can find more

546
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:01,520
information it's not about the philip

547
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,240
says to you or you know or success it's

548
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,120
a

549
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,679
common weakness enumeration uh

550
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:10,880
explaining all those details about this

551
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,760
floor it's very very interesting here

552
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,000
the type is vulnerability and here we

553
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,080
have the reference hash for example if

554
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,520
you do like to

555
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,520
remediate of this vulnerability of

556
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,480
course you can set you can use this hash

557
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,039
reference right so let me explain

558
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:29,600
another two difference between here you

559
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,919
can see the language again in java and

560
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:33,919
here the security tools it's another

561
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:36,720
it's a aurus sec java if you see here

562
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,600
below

563
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,320
um above actually you can see the or

564
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:43,679
second node.js is two different engines

565
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:46,640
right but here if you see

566
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,360
another it's called

567
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,760
it's another language right perfectly

568
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:54,240
the severity is median but security

569
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,640
tools in this case it's a goldsack as

570
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,039
you can see it's another engine

571
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:01,440
which means you have different

572
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,600
engines inside this project this

573
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,720
platform

574
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,640
you know the the

575
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,320
the gun it's not a guarantee but you

576
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,880
know you can improve more your security

577
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:14,080
code you your code it's can be uh is can

578
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,880
be more safe when you developer you can

579
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,960
you have different engines inside the

580
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:22,000
same platform right so you can integrate

581
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,480
another different ages here another in

582
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:27,520
the same case languages go severity is

583
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:30,400
median in security tools you can use the

584
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,039
some graph the same graph

585
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:36,559
energies you see it's very very

586
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:39,840
very interesting here but

587
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,760
let's suppose if you have for example if

588
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:42,720
you use

589
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,640
the vs code

590
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,919
ide for example right so you just you

591
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:51,520
have here my code again one more time

592
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:54,400
right take it you have the java

593
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:59,120
the kotlin node.js see and uh php and go

594
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:02,159
laying you one more time i just set here

595
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:05,360
my extension i just click and set here

596
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,919
autosac take a look this

597
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:08,960
ah

598
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,600
saki and

599
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:14,720
you can install these open source tools

600
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,320
to improve the notifications whenever

601
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:20,240
it's inside your ide after that you just

602
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,679
need to click

603
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:23,440
let's let's be close here just need to

604
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,760
click in start analyze

605
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,679
and as you can see here

606
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:30,000
hold on water started the analysis you

607
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,279
are cold right and here i think it's is

608
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:35,919
small but you can see ours or sec

609
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:39,520
security analysis running right so

610
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,880
it's running

611
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:43,600
the same analysis that you as it could

612
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:47,360
in your cli now here you are executing

613
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:51,679
in your vs code ide

614
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:54,640
you can manage both of them right if you

615
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,960
are developing you just using the cli

616
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:00,240
you can run your cli but if you're using

617
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,840
the

618
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,400
a different for example if you use

619
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,919
um

620
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:08,480
or idea like you know

621
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:12,720
vs code you can execute inside of your

622
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:16,000
vs code so here take a look javascript

623
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,799
all those folders and here you find in

624
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:20,080
this code

625
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:22,000
take a look at this if i put the mouse

626
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:22,960
in

627
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,480
above the in

628
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,520
on the

629
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:28,000
on the code vulnerable you can find here

630
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,480
the all those explanation you know as

631
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:33,679
you can see here the correct a path in

632
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:37,039
the file in ap doc java right so high

633
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:40,880
insecure randall number generator right

634
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:43,039
so the app's using is insecure random

635
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:44,720
number generate for more information

636
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,200
check out the

637
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,120
cwe

638
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:51,520
330 another reference and here guys take

639
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:54,320
a look this the reference code

640
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,640
vulnerable in your

641
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:59,679
project right here another

642
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:02,320
like you know using a shell interactive

643
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:06,080
it's high as i mentioned as i showed and

644
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:09,120
i show it before

645
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,760
by cli right in the same case the

646
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,080
explanation about entails about the

647
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,400
vulnerability and the end of this you

648
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:20,080
can find the cv the cwe and here you can

649
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:23,120
see another uh interesting point here

650
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:26,000
because take a look at this it's uh

651
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,320
it's it's just information in this case

652
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:31,279
take a look at this node.js doc j

653
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:35,520
node uh slashing injection.js

654
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:38,320
info do you remember a critical and

655
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,400
median and low

656
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,919
and info

657
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:43,360
and uh

658
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:45,840
and unknown do you remember info in this

659
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,760
case is info no log sensitive

660
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:50,640
information in console right so the apps

661
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,400
logs information since sensitive

662
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,880
information should be never should never

663
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,279
be logged right for more information

664
00:26:57,279 --> 00:27:00,880
check out the cwe 532

665
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,480
because it means

666
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,080
the code

667
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,400
can be received this kind of sense

668
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,559
information in this case don't have but

669
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:11,760
exactly citation it's a warning right so

670
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,760
here you can find anothers and then

671
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:17,200
others and uh and it's it's an uh a worm

672
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:20,640
here and another and another it's very

673
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,480
very interesting but

674

676
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,440
interesting but if i would like to if i

677
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,200
had

678
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,799
um you know

679
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:35,520
uh web platform to manage it it should

680
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:38,080
be very interesting and you have and i

681
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:40,640
have here the web application right and

682
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:43,039
you're just getting installing click

683
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:46,080
here install with docker compose because

684
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,399
this is the requirements by

685
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:49,919
basically that you need to to have in

686
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:52,880
your environment docker compose docker

687
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:55,840
and linux however you

688
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,480
basically this just copy this cool git

689
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,840
cloning here and i will

690
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,480
return

691
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,279
in my demo here yes

692
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:08,960
demo i will pass here git cloning and

693
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:12,799
you clone here it's very very simple

694
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:14,880
take a look this all those informations

695
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,080
you can find in your in our

696
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:18,720
documentation you can

set you can follow them to the other sec

698
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,279
folder right so if you see here all

699
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:26,159
those

700
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:28,720
information that i cloning in from the

701
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:31,760
github right and here if you see i have

702
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,240
another examples of the vulnerable codes

703
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:37,120
to you know to try and i you click and i

704
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,679
will set actually make install

705
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:42,960
and after that

706
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:46,000
i am install the web application to

707
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,880
manage all those vulnerabilities that i

708
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,640
will that i will

709
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,399
that i am finding

710
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:54,240
in my

711
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:58,960
environment in my project right so again

712
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:01,520
it's very simple to install as you can

713
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:04,000
see and i'm doing the demonstration

714
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,360
again i finished the demonstration and i

715
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,240
just

716
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,960
i just but i just the next step is to

717
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,960
see here take a look at this

718
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,520
uh enter the folder yes i did

719
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:18,320
run the command make style yes i did and

720
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,399
access the rsx services this is the

721
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:22,320
localhost it just said just for demo

722
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,480
right so when you pop the password again

723
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,399
one more time is just for demo

724
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:28,240
when you set your environment you need

725
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,559
to change this the full password please

726
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:32,880
you need to change so they pay attention

727
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:36,080
this right so i will put here another

728
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,559
manage workspace this is a preference of

729
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:41,760
an about another demos and other events

730
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,080
that i did i will

731
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:47,360
add this workspace you know i will

732
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:50,399
call by demo

733
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:53,360
very creative

734
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,919
this is a my workspace i will set the

735
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:59,200
token i will add the token i will call

736
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,880
by demo

737
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:03,679
awesome and when you copy this why i am

738
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:07,440
doing this because all those let me go

739
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:10,480
to the examples here i have many

740
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:13,120
different examples and go to the

741
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,520
javascript javascript

742
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:19,200
that's good okay just

743
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,399
folder

744
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:22,720
i have one example i will as i could

745
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,640
hear the auto set

746
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:29,120
start and you set here the

747
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,799
dash p

748
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:33,520
okay i will put docker slash because i

749
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:36,880
will using this folder okay

750
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,880
and i will set here

751
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,000
in this case

752
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,200
mino uh

753
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,480
dash a

754
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,880
because this is a talking authentication

755
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,720
right so i will

756
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:47,679
pass

757
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:49,120
my talking

758

manager right because all those

763
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:04,399
informations i will have

764
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:07,440
inside this manager right so

765
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,559
in this

766
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:10,000
uh

767
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,279
web application to manage all those

768
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:15,279
informations here so take a look this i

769
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:17,200
just found one vulnerability

770
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,440
right in in java because it's just one

771
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:22,240
example so let me hit turn here and i

772
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,080
close

773
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:26,080
up box in this case it's i got it i

774
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:28,000
close here and i will go in the

775
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,320
dashboard in the workspace

776
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,440
and i need to

777
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,679
go in my

778
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:37,760
workspace is a demo workspace demo click

779
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:38,559
here

780
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:41,279
it's one developer i am a developer

781
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:43,039
phone vulnerability it's just a one it's

782
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:46,480
high as you can see okay it's one

783
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:49,919
it's java perfect in this case it's high

784
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:52,480
as you see in the cli

785
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,880
you've seen the cli yes you see let's

786
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,559
check here java

787
00:31:56,559 --> 00:31:57,360
hi

788
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,679
about a second java engine this is the

789
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:01,840
file vulnerable right

790
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:06,480
and the total one vulnerability as you

791
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,720
can compare here it's the same if you

792
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,640
put in your mouse here you can find the

793
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:13,679
information and secure rambo random

794
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:16,880
number generator the apps used in the a

795
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:19,360
security render right so take a look at

796
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:21,600
this all those informations you can find

797
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,679
here so let me as i could one more time

798
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:26,480
but in the different folder here

799
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:30,240
let me go to the home and start demo

800
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:33,440
demo yes in the or second slash demo do

801
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:34,960
you remember

802
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:38,640
here okay so let me set one more time

803
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:41,600
the same or sec starts dash p

804
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:44,320
okay because i was including this folder

805
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,480
because i have more than one here you

806
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:49,279
remember and the same token to receive

807
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:52,000
all those information and i think here

808
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,080
do you remember how many celebrities do

809
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:56,880
we have here i think it's 15 or 13 i

810
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,960
don't remember the exactly number but i

811
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:01,919
will receive the the code here

812
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:03,039
let's see

813
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:04,559
and

814
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:06,399
because i said here the talking

815
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:08,399
authentications all those informations i

816
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:11,279
will send it to the manager take a look

817
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:16,640
this very very very interesting here

818
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,960
right

819
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:19,760
so

820
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:22,559
it's finished here and you that's not 15

821
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:24,080
it's in this case it's seven possible

822
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:26,559
whenever it's in this case it's too high

823
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:28,880
and uh four medium and one low if you

824
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,960
return in my web application take a look

825
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,640
at this i will just

826
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:35,679
uh update here it's just the one of

827
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:37,440
course i am a developer because i am

828
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:40,559
doing you know my uh you know

829
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:42,480
registry here in this

830
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,880
in this dashboard and as you can see

831
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:45,760
here

832
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,679
more than one

833
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:50,559
different vulnerabilities here

834
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:53,200
oh okay so

835
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,600

check

843
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:19,280
um before is it good here okay of course

844
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:21,440
i need to click the demo it's not air or

845
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:24,560
tv in demo here and now it's okay

846
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,320
here as you can see it's seven do you

847
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,199
remember

848
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:30,239
as you can see here seven and another

849
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:32,320
we haven't because when i execute the

850
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,399
first one i just received one more bit

851
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:37,119
and after that i executed again and i

852
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:38,320
had

853
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,879
seven so seven more one you know it's

854
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:43,839
it's eight in this case and uh we have

855
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:46,560
here all those on our bits and go

856
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,800
and you have the java script and java

857
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:49,918
here

858
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:51,760
and take a look this all those

859
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:54,320
vulnerabilities explained in this

860
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,480
dashboard and here take a look if you

861
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,640
click here and vulnerabilities take a

862
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,800
look this this is the rash reference

863
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:03,119
that you can find right

864
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:07,040
and here is the status the states of the

865
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:09,119
vulnerability because you can you know

866
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:11,200
manage it in your environment you can

867
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:14,160
set the risk accept and a false quality

868
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,000
positive you can correct this

869
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,320
vulnerability right in

870
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,480
for example if you set here the correct

871
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:23,440
because you manage your code you'll put

872
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,359
in the correct ads and correct it in

873
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:26,160
your

874
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,960
corrected in your environment

875
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,960
because you uh

876
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:33,440
fix this vulnerability right so it's

877
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:36,640
very very interesting but it to go to

878
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,480
the end of the our presentation you

879
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:39,680
maybe you are

880
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:43,280
asking about the uh using in a pipeline

881
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:46,720
in your ci cd you have here another

882
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,880
possibilities right so here you can

883
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,320
install

884
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:53,119
via pipeline you have i have here in the

885
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:55,839
kitchen club actions right so you

886
00:35:55,839 --> 00:35:58,400
basically you can cop this

887
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:02,480
you you set your job right you will run

888
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,480
the installation of the binary and after

889
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:08,480
that you set the or sec start dash b

890
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:11,760
right the same case and minus a n

891
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,680
it's uh

892
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:16,160
you set true because you receive the the

893
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,320
error in this case one in this case if

894
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,160
you receive the error you can broke your

895
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:22,240
code right you can broke your pipeline

896
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:24,560
right so after that of course if you

897
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:25,920
would like to send all of those

898
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,920
information to your manager you need to

899
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:30,800
set here the api of the manager and the

900
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:33,200
token authentication after so it's very

901
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:35,440
very simple and here you can use in for

902
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:38,240
example aws codes bill you can use in a

903
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:41,680
circle ci you can use in a jenkins you

904
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:44,160
can use in azure devops pipeline and

905
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:47,119
each lab city all those

906
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:50,240
pipelines all those sg

907
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:53,760
you know it was tested by rsac so here

908
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:56,480
i finish my presentation i hope that you

909
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:59,040
like it and in if you have any questions
