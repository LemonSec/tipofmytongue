1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:04,400
so welcome everybody to our presentation

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,799
on the use of threat intelligence in the

3
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:08,559
automotive security

4
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:11,759
um thank you very much for joining our

5
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:13,200
little talk

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,160
uh

7
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,200
today

8
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,119
and we're going to talk a little bit

9
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:20,160
about the automotive threat landscape

10
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,439
the use of threat intelligence um how to

11
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:25,519
make intelligence actionable through

12
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:29,519
threat modeling in the automotive world

13
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:31,359
then

14
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:33,040
janos is going to talk a little bit

15
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,200
about product incident management

16
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,399
awareness

17
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:39,280
and then he's going to

18
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,600
give you a short demo on projects uh

19
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,200

00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,600
advanced security teams

26
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,438
um in the ey cyber practice in london

27
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:08,479
and um i'll let

28
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:12,720
bianos my co-presenter introduce himself

29
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,479
greetings everyone my name is janos

30
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:16,560
kovac and i am cyber security manager at

31
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,680
decent group

32
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,040
steering

33
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,759
and we are currently working uh really

34
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:24,240
hard to be compliant with

35
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,680
the forming iso 21434 standard as well

36
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:32,000
as the unec regulation 155

37
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,920
to create a secure automotive word

38
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,840
thanks janos

39
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,600
let's uh let's jump into the

40
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,720
presentation directly and

41
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,640
as mentioned in the agenda the first

42
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,159
topic is uh the automotive threat

43
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:51,600
landscape or you know what happens if

44
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,799
the car becomes basically a computer on

45
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:57,040
four wheels um

46
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,399
what are the main elements of the threat

47
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:03,280
landscape and the ecosystem

48
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,399
today

49
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:08,000
so on a very high level we see that um

50
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,560
you know now with with a modern

51
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,360
digital connected

52
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,360
car

53
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,879
automotive security has become a rather

54
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:21,760
complex topic you need to

55
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,080
of course protect the products and

56
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,920
services

57
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,160
as well as the production and operation

58
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,680
of

59
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,400
automotive components

60
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,280
but you need to also pay attention in

61
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,680
protecting employees

62
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,440
and consumers

63
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,239
from malicious actors

64
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:45,519
as well as protection of businesses and

65
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:49,840
branding we've all known um previous um

66
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:54,640
attacks against car makers as well as

67
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,159
automotive suppliers um that have

68
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:01,440
unfortunately led to serious incidences

69
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,480
but even those that do not lead

70
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,720
to any incidences

71
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,319
you know very

72
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:09,840
costly

73
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,360
recalls and fixes in

74
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,040
automotive products

75
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,239
can lead to damaging of the business of

76
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:19,599
the brands

77
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:22,239
of the suppliers as well

78
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:26,239
um and we really see this um over a

79
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:28,159
myriads of

80
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:29,840
you know

81
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,640
various vectors you know from electric

82
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,519
vehicles where um

83
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:38,879
the battery health status and management

84
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:40,879
and over-the-air configurations and

85
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:42,959
software updates are

86
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:45,680
becoming increasingly common please

87
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,239
commonplace these days in intelligence

88
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:51,200
vehicles to you know safety and security

89
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,599
features um

90
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:57,360
that are built into modern cars too

91
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,879
um simple

92
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:01,040
you know constant updates on the

93
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,720
infotainment

94
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:06,159
systems uh that can be arrived over the

95
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:06,959
air

96
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:09,760
um but if we go a little bit deeper into

97
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:14,480
it and and we take uh our focus onto

98
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:18,000
connected vehicles um we do see that you

99
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,079
know um modern uh digital and digitally

100
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,120
interconnected vehicles um have very

101
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,639
complicated

102
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:29,600
inter-vehicle systems

103
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:35,360
and run a complex control area network

104
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,600
that includes the ecu's as well as a

105
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,120
number of

106
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,880
sensors

107
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,720
physical you know as well as wireless um

108
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,919
and

109
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:48,000
as the complexity of these systems

110
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,720
increases um so does of course um

111
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,720
the need to uh to defend them um be

112
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,400
honest this is your you know uh absolute

113
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,199
uh

114
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:02,560
subject matter

115
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,600
uh expertise and you've been uh

116
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,080
working on this for you know quite quite

117
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,240
a few years now is there anything that

118
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,320
you would want to add

119
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,720
here as well

120
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,039
yes thank you

121
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:19,599
currently

122
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:22,240
the big picture is presented

123
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,560
i guess really well by the unec

124
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,880
regulation 155

125
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,039
which is the key success factor

126
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:31,919
of basically remaining on the market uh

127
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:34,240
as an automotive participant in the

128
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,520
close future

129
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,479
and

130
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:39,600
the unec regulation 155 represent a

131
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,800
holistic view of weak cyber security

132
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,600
which causes the back end infrastructure

133
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,680
of the oems and the suppliers as well as

134
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,960
the physical products uh manifested by

135
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,120
the weakers

136
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,479
so so yes that i really like this uh

137
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:57,440
figure

138
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,880
because it

139
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:02,719
contains everything we will need

140
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,400
thanks a lot yeah we've tried we've

141
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,720
tried to put everything together in one

142
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,840
picture which is as you mentioned uh if

143
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,520
if you're going from a

144
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,520
uh quite

145
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,080
thorough and lengthy uh legislation it

146
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,319
can be a bit of a challenge

147
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:20,880
but what does it mean in in real life

148
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,000
what are some of the examples of uh of

149
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,160
attack vectors that we're seeing and

150
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,199
generally what of course uh we've seen

151
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:34,479
vodunk vote out in the wild um are uh

152
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:38,479
remote attack vectors um that have been

153
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:41,840
uh thankfully at this point largely uh

154
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,600
realized uh

155
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,400
through laboratory conditions but it is

156
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,919
possible um you know for uh for a remote

157
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:54,160
attacker to use um a connected device

158
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,599
such as a passenger phone um

159
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:00,639
um to send malicious files it can be a

160
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:04,080
song it can be you know any other um

161
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,639
file that's uh that is accessed uh

162
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:08,960
through the phone os system

163
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,160
and uh you know that's that's that phone

164
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:16,240
is then connected um to the ivi system

165
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,560
of the car itself and um it is possible

166
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,120
to execute certain attacks to again

167
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,880
certain um types of vehicles uh and we

168
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,599
will talk about this a little bit

169
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:33,680
later as well as um the more i would say

170
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,919
common attack vector that does require

171
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:37,680
physical access to

172
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,720
um

173
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:44,080
the actual uh port debug port of the car

174
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,319
by an attacker now this

175
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:50,479
this physical access of course can be um

176
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:52,479
replicated through a physical device

177
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:54,879
that is then internet connected but

178
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,120
definitely you know it's it's not

179
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,960
something which uh

180
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:03,199
you can execute by by simply um you know

181
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:04,960
just from the distance you need physical

182
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,919
access to the to the car to the debug

183
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:11,199
port of the car um

184
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,720
where

185
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:17,039
you are able to plug in a malicious code

186
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:20,720
directly via the debug car debug port

187
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,000
and thus take control over the vehicle

188
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,479
so this is i would say the

189
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:29,120
main point of the current

190
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,320
um threat landscape in in automotive

191
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,760
security um which we're going to be

192
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:39,679
referring to throughout our presentation

193
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,279
now for the next section of our

194
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:42,880
presentation let's talk a little bit

195
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:46,080
about cyber threat intelligence as um

196
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:46,880
you know

197
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,600
uh the title of our presentation does

198
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,720
talk about you know the application of

199
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,200
cti in an automotive

200
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,320
context

201
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,600
so um in order to set the scene a little

202
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,279
bit let's talk about

203
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:04,160
what is cyber threat intelligence

204
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:08,720
so cti is um

205
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,160
a topic that concerns itself um

206
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,519
information intelligence about threats

207
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:18,080
the specific nature of intelligence is

208
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,640
of course driven by the requirements how

209
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,959
we use this intelligence

210
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:25,680
that it has been designed to answer and

211
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:30,480
as well as the nature of the audience

212
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:35,200
to which uh to whom we're presenting

213
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,360
and this intelligence

214
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,240
um

215
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,959
cti is um

216
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:43,360
you know actionable answers it can be

217
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,480
used as

218
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:50,080
um a decision support uh to

219
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,839
make certain um certain choices uh let

220
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:56,240
them be the choices of using in our

221
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,440
various technologies or in order to

222
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,279
support a

223
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:02,959
risk-based decision

224
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:07,279
um cti is of course based on facts and

225
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:09,519
corroborated observations

226
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:10,880
and

227
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,560
you know on a higher level it does

228
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,279
include a holistic approach

229
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:20,000
cti in and of itself is um not applied

230
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,160
knowledge it is not

231
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,680
a covert action or an evidential chain

232
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:29,040
you don't need to be a double 07 to be

233
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,959
able to

234
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:32,959
take your aston martin to get cyber

235
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:37,680
threat intelligence uh but really most

236
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,480
basic form you could understand cyber

237
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,839
threat intelligence as the answer to the

238
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:47,680
questions what are my top security risks

239
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,399
what are the threat actors

240
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:51,839
targeting

241
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:55,440
me my products my

242
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,920
my consumers my customers and what are

243
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,920
their objective what do they want to do

244
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:07,040
do they want to you know ransom and and

245
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,040
their objective is financial gain and

246
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,360
that's what they want to do um or do

247
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:15,440
they want to create uh fear uncertainty

248
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,240
and doubt uh in the capabilities of

249
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,959
connected cars and of course the third

250
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:26,320
answer is um applying um cti's the

251
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,120
you know this is when you get actionable

252
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,480
um is how do i use this knowledge of

253
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,200
threat actors and their objectives to

254
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,160
defend my products defend my uh my

255
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,160
customers defend my

256
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,720
uh my company

257
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,040
there are four

258
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:50,480
main types of of cti which we are um

259
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,639
differentiating between the time

260
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:55,279
horizons and the level of

261
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:56,480
context

262
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,920
so of course if we are talking about

263
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,000
immediate

264
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,040
threats in in a low level context this

265
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,000
is

266
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,639
technical

267
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,440
intelligence uh this is something that

268
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,480
is of course contains uh specific

269
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,880
malware or vulnerability exposure or

270
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,200
information how that

271
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,160
that

272
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,320
vulnerability

273
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,360
can be

274
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,880
exploited

275
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:29,760
um then if we're moving uh to a higher

276
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:30,639
level

277
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:34,560
into in the context area then um

278
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,240
we're talking about operational

279
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,399
intelligence this is of course

280
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:41,680
um details about

281
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:45,279
certain attack vectors information about

282
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:48,959
targeting and of course this is

283
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:51,360
information that can support uh

284
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,120
structured decision on the lower

285
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,880
management level you know how do you um

286
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,480
support

287
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,160
designing you know defending the

288
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,959
enterprise as well as um defending

289
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:04,800
certain products that are in the product

290
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,040
in the security team

291
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,440
if we are thinking around more in the

292
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,399
low level of contacts but uh on the long

293
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:16,800
term time horizon um then we arrive to

294
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,399
uh

295
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:21,440
tactical um intelligence that supports

296
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,600
middle management and semi-structured

297
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,279
decisions you know this is when we're

298
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:28,160
talking about the techniques tactics and

299
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:32,399
procedures and ttps of um of attackers

300
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:34,880
and understanding you know what how does

301
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,480
how do those change um over time

302
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,440
and and if you are talking about high

303
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,880
level of contacts and of course

304
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,760
long-term time horizons that would be um

305
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,560
strategic intelligence that is

306
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,959
a really

307
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:54,000
dare to support unstructured decision

308
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,199
making you know this is horizon scanning

309
00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:00,399
into the future

310
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,240
now if we have our own threat

311
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,920
intelligence um how can we apply that

312
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,720
and as i mentioned uh intelligence isn't

313
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,920
in and of itself is just um data it's

314
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:15,279
information um how can we go from threat

315
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:18,000
intelligence to threat modeling

316
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,079
of course we can

317
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:21,519
create

318
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:24,480
specific threat profiles

319
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,920
specific

320
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,040
cons

321
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,120
concepts

322
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,240
uh

323
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,279
from

324
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:32,880
our knowledge of the products our

325
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,920
knowledge of the enterprise um as well

326
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,639
as pro our knowledge of the threat

327
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:42,480
landscape and we can develop uh you know

328
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,120
complex use cases based on these various

329
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,240
threats we can feed these into

330
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,079
for example a

331
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:52,800
product development life cycle

332
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,839
to you know look for specific violations

333
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:58,720
suspicious events uh even you know

334
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,880
malicious behavior because

335
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,519
you know we mentioned in the in in the

336
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:05,519
earlier part of the presentation you

337
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:07,839
know you might have absolutely valid

338
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:10,480
reasons to access the debugging port of

339
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,560
a car for example when it is brought in

340
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,040
for maintenance um

341
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,320
and

342
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,519
you could also have malicious reasons to

343
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:20,800
inject

344
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:24,160
you know codes into the vehicle system

345
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,240
that would enable an attacker to then

346
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,560
take control over the car and this of

347
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,120
course is a cycle that keeps feeding on

348
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,920
uh in and of itself and we can also take

349
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:37,040
into account you know various additional

350
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:40,480
um context around controls that exist in

351
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,120
our products the risk

352
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,360
that these certain vulnerabilities

353
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,920
expose as of course as well as the

354
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:51,120
threats so i mean if the threat is

355
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,720
um

356
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:56,079
something really serious that would uh

357
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:58,560
you know affect the the handling or the

358
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,959
safety features of a vehicle then of

359
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:05,440
course um that uh raises the risk level

360
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,880
of um

361
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,440
of that uh particular issue

362
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,199
but if the

363
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:12,079
uh

364
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:15,920
exploit is uh were much theoretical and

365
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:19,199
would require a level of um access as

366
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:21,199
well as specialized hardware to the car

367
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:24,720
that of course decreases um the risk

368
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,040
contracts as well as you know there are

369
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,040
additional controls that you can apply

370
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:32,320
to say okay in theory this particular

371
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,759
vulnerability

372
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:37,199
can be exposed but we've already um put

373
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:39,600
in you know various compensating

374
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,519
controls other measures to

375
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,839
to combat this threat

376
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:47,759
and

377
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:50,399
for the second part of the presentation

378
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:53,519
i will hand over

379
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:55,440
the ball to

380
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,839
janos to talk about the organizational

381
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:01,360
benefits of cti

382
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:06,319
thank you bense

383
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,439
so what are the organizational benefits

384
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:12,240
of uh cti

385
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,559
first

386
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:16,559
the most obvious

387
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:19,679
way you created for an organization

388
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:22,640
leveraging this type of service is that

389
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,679
cti can be an important trigger of the

390
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:29,200
product incident management because

391
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,440
the situation for the automotive

392
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,799
products are

393
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:36,320
really specific and really unique in the

394
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:40,400
world of uh the cyberspace because uh

395
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,080
you know the automotive products are

396
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,039
left

397
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:45,440
basically at the digital widerness

398
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,840
because

399
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,160
this is really problematic to collecting

400
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,320
the product cyber security data from the

401
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,520
field because

402
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,640
especially as a tier one supplier we do

403
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,039
not have directly access

404
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,559
direct access

405
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:03,200
to our products on the field

406
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,160
we can

407
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,360
of course leverage data collected by the

408
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,520
fleet management systems

409
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,760
however this is not like

410
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,000
operating uh

411
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,240
security operation center

412
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,679
connecting directly to the

413
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:19,280
infrastructure you

414
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,360
operate

415
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,080
but

416
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,600
rather

417
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,480
leaving our products basically in the

418
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,600
wide

419
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,320
and also the hackers and

420
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,880
malicious attackers uh are able to

421
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,440
examine and attack the products without

422
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,840
basically be being bothered

423
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:38,960
we do not

424
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,200
know uh

425
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:45,200
the eve about the events uh of uh these

426
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:49,200
kind of attacks because you can just uh

427
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,160
disassemble a vehicle and start

428
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:55,440
disassembling and examining uh the

429
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,400
embedded products and

430
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,520
nobody will detect you doing so

431
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,400
because this is a part

432
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,280
removed from the vehicle without

433
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,600
the power supply and the data bus

434
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,559
connection of the vehicle

435
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:14,720
furthermore

436
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,640
it is very important consider that the

437
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,640
more time is passed between the zero

438
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,559
data exploit and the discovery of the

439
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:22,480
system compromise

440
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:25,440
the more harm can be done it is a new

441
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,200
universal truth

442
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,320
and

443
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,559
this

444
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:33,679
makes this interval or

445
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:35,360
rather shortening this interval a key

446
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,280
success factor

447
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:40,400
for keeping our product secure and this

448
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,600
is because

449
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,919
because

450
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:45,440
using

451
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,280
such service

452
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,720
you may can

453
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,480
make the difference

454
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,960
between a secure product and basically

455
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:56,160
an insecure product so the involvement

456
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:59,440
of an experienced third party can be

457
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:02,640
a major step for gaining these benefits

458
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,400
and

459
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,960
getting to this achievement

460
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,200
uh

461
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,000
what can be uh

462
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,280
this data useful for uh furthermore uh

463
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,600
benz i mentioned uh

464
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,559
that making the threat models uh more

465
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:23,679
accurate is also a valuable benefit from

466
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:27,600
this service and i'm so i strongly uh

467
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,600
agree with him

468
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,159
because uh threat analysis and risk

469
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:33,280
assessment

470
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,840
is the basis of product cyber security

471
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,280
concepts

472
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:40,480
creating a threat model and

473
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,159
placing

474
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:45,039
our product in the cyberspace

475
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:46,720
within

476
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,640
its context and understanding its

477
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,080
context

478
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,360
and

479
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,320
these threat models accuracy

480
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:57,440
is the key also a key success factor uh

481
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:02,840
for keeping a product secure so

482
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:05,600
it is also important to collect this

483
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,000
data because we have minimal amount of

484
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,159
uh exact historical data about the

485
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:12,640
impacts of a vehicle product security

486
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,760
breach

487
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,679
and

488
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:18,000
be the from because of this

489
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,120
we cannot uh really uh

490
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:25,280
estimate uh precisely the impact of a

491
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,720
security breach

492
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:30,320
and because of that the importance of

493
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,559
isa mining the transportation industrial

494
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:35,200
landscape is more important than ever

495
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,480
and

496
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,880
the cti data can be a basis of these

497
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,320
interpolations

498
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,320
and

499
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,799
it would make the company able to access

500
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:46,400
the products related cyber security

501
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,640
risks in a more accurate way and there

502
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,880
is also one thing that the

503
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,280
fragment information of

504
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:56,799
the cti service can

505
00:21:56,799 --> 00:22:00,960
keep the threat model up to date and

506
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,919
it would make us able to react

507
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:06,799
faster and swifter

508
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:09,760
and there is also one thing that

509
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,720
cti information can be a

510
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,559
valuable asset

511
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:16,720
in keeping up the awareness the cyber

512
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,799
security awareness and the

513
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:21,679
more precisely the product cyber

514
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:24,000
security awareness we can leverage

515
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,039
lessons learned and i should say that

516
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:30,000
lessons learned is a one thing that we

517
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,320
can turn

518
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,120
our

519
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,120
previous failures

520
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,039
future opportunities

521
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:38,000
and

522
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,320
i shall say that even the exploits of

523
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,640
other products can be useful if we can

524
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,280
find the analogy between

525
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,440
those exploits and

526
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,440
our products uh

527
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,520
way of working and

528
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,360
even architecture

529
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,960
and

530
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,280
the company educational programs shall

531
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,320
include

532
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,559
these vulnerabilities

533
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:01,840
and

534
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,720
these vulnerabilities and the education

535
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,799
of these vulnerabilities can direct the

536
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:08,320
focus of the development and the

537
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,159
vigilance of assurance

538
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:11,840
towards fixing

539
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,159
these future vulnerabilities and you

540
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:15,600
know

541
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,400
the

542
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,600
fixing of vulnerabilities which never

543
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,600
placed inside the product is the

544
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,840
cheapest way

545
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:24,640
for

546
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:27,919
fixing vulnerabilities and

547
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:28,880
these

548
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,200
informations can also be the basis of

549
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,559
future test scenarios

550
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,360
and it happened that

551
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,400
i had

552
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,120
some free time in the past and

553
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,320
i

554
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,679
thought that

555
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:45,600
what could be the

556
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,799
uh

557
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:48,840
the more valuable

558
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:52,400
application of this

559
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,559
threat informations

560
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:56,000
on

561
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,840
the awareness

562
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:58,880
and

563
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,039
in the awareness program

564
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:03,360
and i happened to create the dimitri

565
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,559
project

566
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:06,720
this dimitri project is an open source

567
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,679
project which is basically

568
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:11,679
a story based

569
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:12,960
classic

570
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,320
role-playing

571
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,520
game but

572
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:20,080
focusing on typical embedded

573
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:22,400
vulnerabilities

574
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,600
and i should say public information

575
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,360
getting from public

576
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,679
vulnerability databases

577
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:33,440
and i strongly believe that

578
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:36,960
this project can be

579
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:40,480
important example uh or a useful example

580
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,159
shall i say

581
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:42,960
for

582
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,320
any other

583
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,159
professionals in the cyber security

584
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:47,520
industry

585
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,679
implementing a security awareness

586
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:50,799
program

587
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:52,559
because

588
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:54,400
it means

589
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:57,679
gamification and learning via

590
00:24:57,679 --> 00:24:59,679
gamification

591
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:00,640
if

592
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,840
we see

593
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,720
there are important vulnerabilities

594
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,480
in the market

595
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,520
then

596
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,520
we shall prepare

597
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:12,960
not to place these vulnerabilities

598
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,000
inside our products so

599
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,600
in dimitri project

600
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,240
there is two parts one is the story

601
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,880
which is uh placed in a cyan berpunk

602
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,640
inspired eastern european city

603
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,559
chernograd and

604
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:29,039
there is an oppressive regime so it's a

605
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:31,520
basically a quite generic cyber

606
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:34,720
bank story and you are

607
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,120
quite amateur vehicle electrician called

608
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,919
dimitri who stands up against this

609
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:41,679
oppressive regime

610
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:45,679
firstly to get the wider resources for

611
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:50,559
him and his friends and after that even

612
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:54,159
how can i say defeating the

613
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:56,400
this oppressive regime

614
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,760
so this is basically basically uh on the

615
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:04,080
classic fighting fantasy books uh you

616
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,440
are

617
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:08,720
probably familiar with from the 90s

618
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:09,520
and

619
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,440
the another part the technical part is

620
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,640
if we

621
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:15,200
visualize the environment simulating a

622
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,760
connection between a diagnostic tool and

623
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,600
an automotive issue no automatic

624
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:22,080
embedded ecu

625
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,640
and you have means for communicating

626
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,159
with the ecu

627
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:28,640
and using diagnostic protocols

628
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:29,520
and

629
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:32,080
there are common vulnerabilities placed

630
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:34,240
inside those easy models

631
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,200
and

632
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,960
the

633
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,960
how can i say this kind of capture the

634
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:42,400
flag game is closely connected and uh

635
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,080
and uh

636
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:47,600
proxies with the story itself

637
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,400
uh

638
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,679
here you can see

639
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:52,640
the dimitri uh part two this is

640
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:55,360
basically the stage two uh many thanks

641
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,919
for paul rybar for sharing me this uh

642
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:02,080
image of uh these gopnik guy

643
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,480
and letting me use this

644
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:07,600
resource in my project

645
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,120
and

646
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,720
here

647
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,360
the story is that uh dimitri and his

648
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,039
friends made the

649
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:16,799
set up uh

650
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:18,080
ambush

651
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,640
on an autonomous uh

652
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:23,760
transportation truck uh carrying uh

653
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:28,480
foods and other supplies uh to the

654
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,520
uh

655
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:32,640
how can i say the

656
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:35,520
rich people loyal to the opera slip

657
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,640
regime

658
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,600
and

659
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,679
they do not have these kind of resources

660
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:40,559
but

661
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:42,960
these are vital for them of course

662
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:46,240
like i mean dimitri and his friends

663
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,480
needs these resources so they made this

664
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,919
ambush to

665
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:52,240
rob this

666
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:57,120
vehicle and get these foods and supplies

667
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,600
dimitri tried before during the

668
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:02,880
basically the tutorial mission

669
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:03,679
to

670
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:07,279
cause a denial of service on the ccu and

671
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:09,679
he found a way for doing that

672
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:10,640
and

673
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:13,600
he is basically

674
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,799
ready for carrying out this attack

675
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:19,600
this model does not focus

676
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,600
on the

677
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:24,640
getting connected to this car but this

678
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,159
connection is made

679
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:28,840
according to story

680
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:29,840
by uh

681
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:30,960
connecting

682
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,720
uh

683
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:35,360
connector a remote dongle

684
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,760
to the car

685
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,480
by leveraging insider

686
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,559
threats like

687
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:45,440
dimitri has a friend working in the

688
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:48,159
transportation company

689
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:51,520
okay and uh here is the first uh

690
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:52,480
help

691
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,360
that

692
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:55,360
we should execute

693
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,600
the run stage 2

694
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,360
bash file

695
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,360
ok

696
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,960
can you

697
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:07,840
i hope you can see my screen even now

698
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,520
we executed

699
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:10,720
the

700
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,559
best script and

701
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:14,240
here we see that

702
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,159
we just started up

703
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:19,279
on our computer the diagnostic tool here

704
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:21,520
we see the basic commands

705
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,760
and

706
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:26,480
we start to cause this denial of service

707
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,799
if this denial of service on the engine

708
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:31,200
control unit is successful

709
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,399
then

710
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:36,159
the car will stop and we will able to

711
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:39,120
get what we need from the cargo

712
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,960
okay here we see that

713
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:43,279
we shall use tester cone to connect the

714
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:46,399
tester to the weaker

715
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:50,159
we connected it is successful and

716
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:52,559
dimitri happens to

717
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:53,440
know

718
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,679
the

719
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:57,120
correct

720
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,520
command for causing this denial of

721
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,120
service

722
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:03,679
because he tried it at his home

723
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:04,880
laboratory

724
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,240
so

725
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,120
the

726
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:09,919
it's a little bit spoiler but uh

727
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:12,799
he shall use the ecu reset

728
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:16,320
to cause this denial of service

729
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,720
because when you

730
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:21,679
send the reset then the ecu will

731
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:23,919
stop working and the engine will stop

732
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:26,159
working but hey

733
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:29,039
it is a really big problem because

734
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:31,600
we got a negative response permission

735
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,520
denied

736
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:36,080
authentication is needed for this

737
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,279
service because

738
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:38,559
maybe

739
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:41,919
it happens the secur that

740
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:43,360
the oem

741
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,120
which is the syndicate automotive

742
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,080
company

743
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:49,120
fictional company of course

744
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:51,279
made a security patch for fixing the

745
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:54,080
vulnerability dimitri exploited in the

746
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,279
last stage

747
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:58,480
so uh dimitri uh

748
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,840
might be

749
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:04,399
in a bit of trouble something is wrong

750
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:06,159
and

751
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:08,720
and dimitri need to fix this problem on

752
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:09,840
the field

753
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:12,240
and try to find

754
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,440
another

755
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,279
vulnerability

756
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:17,760
here we have some

757
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,760
hints some helps

758
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,120
and

759
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,440
we can get them by

760
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,640
coloring

761
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,799
the

762
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:32,559
the fonts and coloring the text

763
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:34,240
which is hidden

764
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:37,279
we shall sing leveraging service another

765
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:38,880
than the diagnostics because this is

766
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:41,360
because the diagnostic is

767
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,840
basically

768
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:47,600
hardened and we cannot exploit this one

769
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,279
so uh

770
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:51,600
what can we do

771
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:54,720
do we have the standard diagnostics and

772
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:57,600
we also have the universal measurement

773
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:00,960
and calibration protocol called xcp

774
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:04,320
we shall go by that

775
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:07,760
we connect it to xcp

776
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:08,960
and

777
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:12,960
we shall read the memory map

778
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:15,760
okay here we see

779
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:19,279
the values the variables mapped to the

780
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:21,760
uh atl file

781
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:24,320
and here we see that there is a

782
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:28,600
privilege level uh

783
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,760
if i

784
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:34,159
uh read it out it's a

785
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:35,840
one

786
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,039
which

787
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:39,760
might mean in our case that this is a

788
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,200
default

789
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,039
value we are

790
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:45,039
you know the default field mode

791
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:46,720
basically

792
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,640
okay

793
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,600
let's

794
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,519
move further

795
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:53,679
what can i do

796
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:56,399
i could try to

797
00:32:56,399 --> 00:32:58,640
overwrite

798
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,399
this value

799
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:03,200
maybe for a 2.

800
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,679
i executed this job let's see what

801
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:06,640
happened

802
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,640
it's still the same

803
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:11,440
we might have no permission from writing

804
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:14,399
uh this value uh even with the xcp

805
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:18,880
protocol okay let's uh use another hint

806
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:21,760
uh this is another hint is that

807
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:24,559
we should get familiar with the

808
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:25,919
cv

809
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:28,880
top 25

810
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:31,360
let's see

811
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:33,840
what can we see here

812
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,120
i try to

813
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:37,039
make it a little bit more quick because

814
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:40,000
i see we are running out of time

815
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,760
what can we see here

816
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,440
that

817
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:46,720
the second one is out of bronze uh right

818
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:49,039
and out of bonds read and what we see

819
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:52,480
here uh we have memory addresses

820
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,679
let's try

821
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:56,480
what we can do

822
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,679
xcp

823
00:33:57,679 --> 00:34:01,039
read address

824
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:03,200
if we try

825
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,480
for example

826
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,799
the consecutive failed attempts

827
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:09,518
this is a

828
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,560
not

829
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,399
ready

830
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:16,560
something went wrong but the privilege

831
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:17,679
level

832
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:22,639
is able to read out and it is a one

833
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:25,599
but how about trying

834
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:29,760
an entire enormously large number

835
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:33,359
it happened to work

836
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:36,000
the the ecu is reset

837
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,119
and

838
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:39,760
the car stops

839
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:42,239
if we move further then

840
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:43,599
we can see that

841
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:46,879
denitry and his guys get the resources

842
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:49,839
what they need and everybody is happy

843
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:51,760
even the neighborhood

844
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,599
have his stomach filled

845
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:55,280
and

846
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,480
after that

847
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,720
i think this is also really important

848
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:01,760
that there is a takeaway box

849
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:02,720
which

850
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,000
is a

851
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,880
for educational purposes and

852
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:07,920
and

853
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:08,640
the

854
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:11,040
key takeaway informations are listed

855
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:11,839
here

856
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:12,640
that

857
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:15,440
the developers and the participants of

858
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,680
the product lifecycle

859
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:21,280
might be able to use in their uh further

860
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,760
career

861
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,960
okay thank you for your attention and

862
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:29,680
we are glad to answer your questions

863
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:32,879
in the remaining time left

864
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:35,119
thank you very much everybody and thank

865
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:37,520
you very much janos for the very

866
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:40,320
exciting story and presentation that

867
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:44,800
you've um that you've given us and yes i

868
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:49,440
believe now it's time for q a
