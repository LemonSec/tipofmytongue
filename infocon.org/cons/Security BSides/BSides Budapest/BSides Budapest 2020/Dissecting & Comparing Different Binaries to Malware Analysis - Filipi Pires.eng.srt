1
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:09,360
hi everyone

2
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,400
i'm so glad to be here so my name is

3
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,440
philippe peers i think

4
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:19,680
many people maybe know me another

5
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,920
thing another people maybe don't know me

6
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,199
but no worries

7
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:26,640
so today we are talking about

8
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,519
the this topic that i like a lot the

9
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:30,720
more analysis

10
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,719
so we talked about this specifically

11
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:34,320
about the second comparing different

12
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,559
binaries to more analysis

13
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:39,120
so but the first of all are you talking

14
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,399
about who am i

15
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:42,719
i think you know many people using this

16
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:44,000
kind of comment

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,680
but usually i i like to put this kind of

18
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:48,399
because you know

19
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:51,520
it doesn't matter who i am or who am i

20
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,079
so you can in the end of this this

21
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:55,920
presentation or you put my

22
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,640
linkedin contacts and my emails so you

23
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,079
would like to know me

24
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:04,720
you can follow me linkedin or another

25
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:08,240
social media pro but uh the first of all

26
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,040
the one thing

27
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,720
more important to me is my family so

28
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,520
i am talking from poland now because i

29
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,240
am living here in poland in krakow

30
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,920
but uh maybe in june i will return to

31
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,040

32
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,920
so this is my big family so this is the

33
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:26,880
first

34
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,360
uh for my life you know this is the the

35
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,720
most important for me

36
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,400
i have a four children as you can see in

37
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,079
this picture so

38
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:37,439
yes it's a big big big family but

39
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:40,159
this as i mentioned before that's uh

40
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:41,759
most important to me

41
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:44,320
about my work so today i work as a

42
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,320

43
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,799
security this is company in brazil but i

44

i work basically

45
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,920
like uh research with this this company

46
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,560
and

47
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,200
i am starting a new uh challenge a new

48
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:57,759
job

49
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:00,719
in brazil this company zoop innovation

50
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:01,439
um

51
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,200
i am work have been working in this

52
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,360
company like um

53
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,840
security and research manager so this

54
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,199
team this

55
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:13,760
company's development company

56
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,200
to build a new software new

57
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,480
project it's the focus basically in open

58
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,520
source code

59
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,319
so you can follow this component so many

60
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:24,879
different

61
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:27,920
uh approach and codes you can use

62
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,519
okay so uh and the most important for me

63
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:33,680
as i mentioned it's my family okay

64
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,480
so today we are talking about the the

65
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,640
the some steps that we can use

66
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,239
when you talk about the mrna so the

67
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:42,319
first of all you need to understand

68
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:45,360
uh what this kind of sample because you

69
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:45,840
know

70
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,560
i don't know if he's malicious or not

71
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,239
but i need to understand we need to

72
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:53,440
identify this artifact you know so

73
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,959
first of all we need to understand it's

74
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:56,879
a maor or maldoc it's the name it's

75
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:57,680
obviously

76
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,360
so malware it's malicious software and

77
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,680
maldox and document malicious

78
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,200
so when i identify this this

79
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,239
sample i can pass to the next step

80
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:11,200
is to chose what the strategy i can use

81
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,879
to analyze the sample

82
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:15,280
or i can use for example a statistic

83
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,519
analyst or maybe dynamic analysis this

84
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:18,800
is the two forms

85
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,319
or two ways that i can use in my

86
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:25,680
in my approach usually that many

87
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,720
many different uh more analysts using

88
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:32,159
okay so before it i can create

89
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:34,159
or i can prepare the report you know

90
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:36,560
this the many times the the coordinator

91
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,920
or manager like this

92
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,159
or tech lead like like this report

93
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:41,120
because you know

94
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,760
when you made different studies or you

95
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:44,720
made

96
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,400
or you proposed uh to prepare

97
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,959
some analysis you can you need to to to

98
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:52,080
write this in in

99
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,040
some report and present this your your

100
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,120
you know you know your pause your

101
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,080
coordinator after that you can improving

102
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,080
your defenses mechanism because you know

103
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,480
if you're working in any companies like

104
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,560
a security team you can prepare you can

105
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,920
improve yours

106
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:11,360
um your tools that that can be used for

107
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,159
example

108
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:14,879
so you can use in different uh you

109
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,120
change different settings in your

110
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,759
tools and your environment you change

111
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:20,639
different

112
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,720
uh like a configurations or maybe

113
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,720
settings in the

114
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,479
you know it's using the different

115
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:28,720
business practices okay after that you

116
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,360
can create this a beautiful name that

117
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,199
many times the mother like his name you

118
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:35,440
know thread intelligence

119
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,000
i am joking with this topic because it's

120
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,600
very important i know

121
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,919
but uh it's a big challenge to to build

122
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:43,919
a disney in many different companies

123
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:44,720
because you know

124
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,800
when you talk about the cyber cyber

125
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,800
threads it's um

126
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:53,120
a beautiful name but when you talk about

127
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,280
the apt advanced persister and that it's

128
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,520
so different it's so difficult to

129
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,240
understand how this works for example so

130
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:00,960
this is uh

131
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,960
important when you talk about the more

132
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,240
analysis and you understand

133
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,639
what the behavior of this this different

134
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:07,759
sample for example

135
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:11,520
and you can't create you can create this

136
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,080
intelligence you know so you you need to

137
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,240
have for example many different

138
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,840
uh approach different steps or different

139
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,080
uh maybe server or you can create a

140
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:22,960
honeypot

141
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,919
or create or create for example misp uh

142
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:26,560
some

143
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:31,759
our inspection or or

144
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,880
anyway you can create the repository you

145
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:35,840
know to the

146
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,639
the many different samples to to create

147
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,160
basically the threat intelligence

148
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,759
and after that you can uh using this

149
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:46,160
this kind of word it's it's it's very

150
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,000
interesting resilience because you know

151
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,199
the threads are changing yes so

152
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:53,680
when you talk about now with you with

153
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,880
amar analysis

154
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,600
we have many other guys creating new

155
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,319
mowers

156
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:01,680
or new different strategies to exploit

157
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,160
different

158
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,880
customers or people you know people you

159
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:05,360
know

160
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,880
so this is the the the the picture that

161
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,600
we can use in the more analysis so the

162
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,560
first step is

163
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,840
as static analysis usually uh this is

164
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,280
the exploration

165
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,000
using for the many many more analysts

166
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,039
this is the first step

167
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:24,160
usually often the the analyst using

168
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,560
because you know uh will you talk about

169
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,520
the the

170
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,000
describe this this statistical analysis

171
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,319
describe the process of analyzing

172
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:35,759
describing how the code works or

173
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:39,039
or how is uh the structure

174
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:41,919
of the the function if you in found for

175
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:42,639
example

176
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:45,840
is uh different dll or libs

177
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:50,479
in the file and how is the function that

178
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:54,000
this dll uh maybe can call

179
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,120
for example so this is the first step so

180
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,120
usually when you talk about this this

181
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,440
analysis analysis this kind of analysis

182
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,840
like a static analysis the program

183
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,560
itself

184
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,000
doesn't run you know i put here

185
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,840
depending of course of the program

186
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,680
because you know usually this process

187
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,000
it's

188
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,360
maybe more safe because

189
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,520
usually you you don't using the as a

190
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,479
coating

191
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:21,759
in run time your simple you because

192
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:24,639
this approach when you run this or you

193
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:26,160
perform on this sample

194
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,639
you can using the environmental control

195
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:30,319
environment or like a sandbox

196
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:32,960
this is another uh analysis but the

197
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,479
static analysis usually

198
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:36,400
you can use the many different commons

199
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,319
to understand of this

200
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:41,199
behavior okay so the second step is

201
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:42,319
dynamic analysis

202
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:44,479
as you mentioned it's based solely on

203
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:45,599
behavior

204
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:49,199
uh that is you can basically you can

205
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:52,400
execute the the sample in a

206
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,560
in it's a lab in the lab on the bed

207
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,440
labatory

208
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,080
you can use it in the runtime analysis

209
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:58,639
you can

210
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:02,000
using this this concept call it sandbox

211
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,120
you can prepare the

212
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,160
the on virtual machine

213
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,639
you can run this sample inside this

214
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,639
virtual machine and understand what the

215
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:11,840
behavior

216
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:15,120
that he eats this sample have

217
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,120
okay so this is the different approach

218
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,120
so when you talk about the statistical

219
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,639
analysis you can use in many different

220
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:21,360
comments

221
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,599
because you know you understand of the

222
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:25,280
inside of the code

223
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,960
and you talk about the dynamic analysis

224
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,560
you can run the sample

225
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,640
in the you know in the in the own

226
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,599
environment in our virtual machine okay

227
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:36,080
so

228
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,679
so this is the first step i would like

229
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:40,640
to show you but uh i prepared the video

230
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,080
but i would like to

231
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,919
use in the demo lucky for you i will

232
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:47,279
present in my machine okay

233
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,720
so okay so here we have this my virtual

234
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,279
machine

235
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:56,320
you know i prepare here for you um

236
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,680
one one thing very interesting okay

237
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,760
because you know the first comma that i

238
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,519
could or i can use

239
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:06,320
i like to use to identify the sample for

240
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,120
example

241
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,560
have you let me check here i use some

242
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,600
simple mowers and suspicious okay this

243
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,200
is the first

244
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:19,279
machine when you see this kind of

245
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:22,399
folders or folders of

246
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:25,200
samples sorry when you can see different

247
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,560
samples

248
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:30,560
how the simple it's show you or you can

249
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,519
see it's

250
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:36,000
maybe suspicious for you

251
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,720
so uh first of all when you use this for

252
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,480
me for me for my side when you talk

253
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,760
about in brazilian guys

254
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,640
usually using this this this concept

255
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,279
this term

256
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:48,399
171 is usually it's like a joking

257
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:50,480
the when you talk about the person the

258
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,519
people in brazil

259
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:54,240
uh this this this person it's like a one

260
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,399
seven one section it's like the people

261
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:57,920
don't pay your bills or something like

262
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:58,560
that so

263
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,360
in brazil and using this kind of file

264
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,000
you know

265
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,240
this kind of is like a suspicious it's

266
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,360
like a joke you know

267
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,519
so but if i use for example file command

268
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:09,760
to understand what

269
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,560
this means for example this 171 we can

270
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,680
see here it's not

271
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,079
executable file we can here we can see

272
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:17,120
here this is the

273
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,320
171 it's a text file it's totally

274
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,200
different it's not

275
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,000
not not exactly because you know the

276
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
file command is it's very interesting

277
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,279
i i will explain about more this this

278
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:31,040
this file because for me it's very

279
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,120
interesting to understand these bases

280
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,600
you know so for example another five

281
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,720
that i can see it's

282
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,160
mower dll it's another file that i can

283
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:43,200
read for example when when you see mower

284
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,640
dock dll here oh my god it's a not

285
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,640
executable file it's the same case it's

286
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,680
a text fail

287
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,880
oh my god so if you if you have the text

288
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,800
today we can read for example the first

289
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,480
the first file here you can read 171

290
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,600
when you when you hit when you read here

291
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,800
you you can read you lose oh my god when

292
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:05,680
you can

293
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,800
read another file for example

294
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:13,680
let me check here mower dll.com

295
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:17,279
www never believe in extinction.com

296
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:20,640
yes i know that is a joking this is the

297
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:24,079
purpose of this because the first of all

298
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:25,600
we need to understand

299
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,480
when you talk about the malware you need

300
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,440
to see

301
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,640
we need to understand what what this

302
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,920
uh command maybe or this file maybe

303
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,800
is for example here we can read for

304
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,160
example it's uh

305
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:43,279
it's an image document file okay so

306
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:44,160
another

307
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:48,160
file one seven here you can read

308
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,120
it's a text file okay so here it's maybe

309
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,399
as a putable file

310
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:56,959
right so 10199

311
00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:00,320
is a putable file so okay here we can

312
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,639
read for example this is executable file

313
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:03,040
p

314
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:06,399
p e yes portable executable file this

315
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:10,079
uh 32 the structure

316
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:12,560
this is the architecture for windows of

317
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,440
course because it's

318
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,920
pe yes portable executable and here we

319
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:16,560
have the

320
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,560
interesting information because here the

321
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,760
samples uh

322
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:23,200
are using it's using up upx

323
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,639
compression that is we have a

324
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:29,519
a a packer using when the attacker

325
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:31,440
compiled this kind of sample

326
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,399
right so and i mean here we have another

327
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:35,279
different

328
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:38,639
uh sample maybe we can analyze both

329
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:40,880
uh i would like to read this file for

330
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,000
example the text

331
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,040
let me check here so cat110

332
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,240
rtf let me read so

333
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,839
very interesting text if you see here

334
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:56,800
we here we can see here the information

335
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,560
of this file can be decrypted

336
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:02,639
using the program dirtydecrypted.xc

337
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:06,000
so maybe you can suppose here

338
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,800
this is the communication from the

339
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,240
attacker to the victim

340
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:14,160
right so press ctrl d to run the krypton

341
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,240
maybe this file it's responsible to

342
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,200
decrypt

343
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,959
the malware right so the crypt is it's

344
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:24,240
is it good it's not open it here we can

345
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,519
read the path

346
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:28,000
it's very interesting here we can read

347
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:28,880
for example

348
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:32,399
c uh user and in an all user of the

349
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:35,120
victim and user for example ap

350
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,880
ap data ramming dirty so

351
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,920
when you look in the all files here

352
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:45,360
you can look at this another it's maybe

353
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,519
we talk about this file right dirty

354
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:50,399
decrypted it's the similar name

355
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:54,000
if you use for example file for this uh

356
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,399
com this file fragment using file

357
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:59,360
command for this file

358
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,760
the sample for example when you execute

359
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,720
you can read here

360
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,600
it's pe executable but not compress it

361
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,240
you know not

362
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,760
this file don't use it for example upx

363
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:16,079
so maybe you can access this information

364
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:19,760
basically or maybe this file can be

365
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:23,279
using to decrypt these this encryption

366
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:24,800
that can

367
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,279
attack it or whitman can suffering in

368
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:28,240
the environment

369
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,480
right so this is very very very

370
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,360
interesting

371
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,720
simple um to analyze but

372
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,040
the important thing to understand guys

373
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:37,760
is here

374
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,800
is it for example five common it's it's

375
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:41,839
very useful

376
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:44,560
common you know i know it's a simple a

377
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,360
simple comment

378
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,240
it's for me it's totally clear but you

379
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,160
know you need to understand this basis

380
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:50,959
because

381
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:53,920
uh many people i can i can see in

382
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,519
different conference when i talk about

383
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:56,079
this

384
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:58,720
this topic is mainly uh the people don't

385
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,279
understand

386
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:02,079
how this works this why what i can use

387
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:02,880
this file

388
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:06,000
what can i use this common file why this

389
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:06,959
is important

390
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:10,079
if you read the man because you know i i

391
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,040
understand it's

392
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,839
very very very the people don't like to

393
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:14,560
read

394
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:18,000
a lot information it's i know but

395
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,440
here we have uh the gold

396
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,079
the gold point right right for example

397
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:26,959
here we can read what this

398
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:29,759
comment works for example here this

399
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:31,680
explanation the magic tests are

400
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,320
using the check for files with data in

401
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,600
particular fixed

402
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,880
format right so uh

403
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,680
when you talk about the file command let

404
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:42,240
me check

405
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,600
here these files have a magic

406
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:49,839
number so that's that is this is the key

407
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:53,199
because all files has the magic

408
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:56,240
number to identify this fire right

409
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,639
so the magical number number is stored

410
00:15:58,639 --> 00:15:59,680
in a particular place

411
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,160
near the beginning of this file that

412
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,639
tells the unix operation systems

413
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:07,839
right so here we have many information

414
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:09,199
another point here

415
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:12,160
the the canonical example of this is

416
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,839
binary executable

417
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:16,399
compiled for program as i mentioned

418
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:17,759
whose format is defined

419
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:21,519
in elf doc h

420
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:24,000
so here the another information is very

421
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,120
interesting because we

422
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,120
when you talk about the instructor of

423
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,399
the the alpha

424
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:32,320
from the unix format you can read here

425
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,680
the exactly format in the

426
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,959
linux file so i i

427
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:42,480
i propose here to i i download

428
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:47,199
the the the file code

429
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:50,720
the the file code here from the debian

430
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,519
for example

431
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:53,839
i would like to to understand how this

432
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:54,560
database

433
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,639
works because my proposal now is

434
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:58,880
understand of this code how this works

435
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,480
because you know you need to understand

436
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,920
this

437
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,199
this all days you know so let me check

438
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:06,319
here cd

439
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:10,480
file okay let's see the

440
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,599
magicking and magic machine magner

441
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:17,839
okay so here guys we have the database

442
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:18,480
of the

443
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,439
all all magic numbers that we have in

444
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:22,640
the linux machine

445
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,959
for example when you see here in

446
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:25,919
javascript

447
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,559
okay let me check here in the cat and

448
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:30,720
javascript

449
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,440
you have script here you can read the

450
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,440
information of the

451
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,480
the magic number that we that that

452
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,840
usually the the commands

453
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,000
read in the beginning of the file in the

454
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,280
magic number five

455
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,039
for example if the beginning of the file

456
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:48,880
we have this information

457
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,160
maybe this command will be identified

458
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,120
like a node.js scripted test executable

459
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:55,840
you know

460
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,520
of course when you talk about the the

461
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,200
portable executable the e

462
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,720
or the else we have a different approach

463
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:06,400
or we have a different regex that can be

464
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,400
used to identify this kind of file

465
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:12,840
right so for example if um let me open

466
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,760
another another terminal here

467
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:19,520
so i use terminator it's no problem here

468
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:23,370
so let me i'd like to works like that

469
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:25,760
[Music]

470
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:29,280
okay that's what works okay now

471
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:32,320
so cd

472
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,760
mars and paul maurer

473
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:40,160
malware not simple it's um

474
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:44,080
okay let me check it here in suspicious

475
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:48,160
suspicious cgr and ptf i like to

476
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,880
not suspicious

477
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:59,200
okay so i think it's here it's okay

478
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,160
yes perfect here we have a difference uh

479
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,039
let me

480
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:07,440
open better this okay to read more

481
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:11,840
to read better i think

482
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:15,679
so if i can create here i will use nano

483
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:20,240
okay you can you can uh

484
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,000
yeah i think you can don't like nano you

485
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,200
can use vi no worries so

486
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,799
i'm using here besides okay

487
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:31,919
so here i used to

488
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:34,160
the any tests here i can create here

489
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,440
malware

490
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,799
is uh

491
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:41,280
dangerous

492
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,799
okay so i will save here okay if i

493
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:49,600
if i using the file command game besides

494
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,840
is a text

495
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:54,400
right okay so now it's very interesting

496
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:57,679
so for example here let me change here

497
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:01,280
to compare the both of this

498
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:06,640
approach with you okay here the same

499
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,600
case

500
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:11,039
perfect so we have

501
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:15,360
here when you let me

502
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,200
the job script for example that i

503
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,880
mentioned to you at the beginning of the

504
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:19,520
file

505
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,559
the regex speeds

506
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:26,799
it's been dash node so i

507
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:30,080
will change this file for example i will

508
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,360
put here

509
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:34,640
and i save if i use file

510
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:38,720
you're talking about oops

511
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:42,559
oh my god it's not just text but here we

512
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:43,120
have

513
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:46,240
a node.js script and executable file

514
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,679
you know that's very interesting when

515
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:49,440
you manipulating

516
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,760
in the magic number of the file i will

517
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:52,640
change again

518
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,840
another different no no i will

519
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:58,720
take this i will put for example percent

520
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,840
pdf

521
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:04,400
1.9 and x is safe

522
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,960
so we can use file besides when you talk

523
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,080
about oops

524
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:17,840
not um

525
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:31,840
here

526
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:36,880
yes right so you can see here

527
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,039
i manipulate again the same file it's

528
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:40,320
pdf document

529
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,240
but you know document fights basically

530
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,679
it's a

531
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:47,600
a text file but i using the file command

532
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,880
to identify this um magic number you

533
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:51,280
know

534
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:54,000
i changed different approach three times

535
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,520
the first i created the text

536
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:58,320
file the simple text after that i change

537
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,360
it to nano

538
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:02,480
js script executable but not executable

539
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,159
right so because of this i need to

540
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:06,000
understand how this command works you

541
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:06,640
know because

542
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,640
i know it's simple comment but you need

543
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,840
understand

544
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,000
what this command works you know this is

545
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:12,960
the database

546
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,280
i can't change again for example i can

547
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,320
look another

548
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,360
different approach here maybe i don't

549
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:19,760
know

550
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:22,559
let me check here another you can using

551
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:23,520
another regex

552
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:27,280
it's maybe it's pdf that i can use

553
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:31,760
i can use another for example uh

554
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,720
let me check here yara what's this the

555
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,960
beginning regrets

556
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:40,159
uh it's it's

557
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:43,120
it's maybe difficult to put here now

558
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,159
different

559
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:46,559
but anyway now it's important thing here

560
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:47,520
you understand it

561
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,679
can be it's you need to understand what

562
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:50,799
this works

563
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:53,120
very well okay so let's change to let's

564
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:56,479
come back to the presentation

565
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,039
so this kind of part it's very

566
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:02,400
interesting i talk about the

567
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,640
the structure of the elf as i mentioned

568
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,640
before in the file command you know

569
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,640
i talk about the structure it's

570
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,640
basically it's it's the same for example

571
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,080
when you talk about elf

572
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:15,039
you can read for example we have the elf

573
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:15,600
header

574
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:18,159
you have the program header table you

575
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:20,080
have the session in the text the doc

576
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,440
taxi and and

577
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,919
really only data and you have a session

578
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:25,360
tables and another part

579
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,200
in the same case when you talk about the

580
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,480
pf the pe

581
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,640
portable is equitable we have the same

582
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:31,760
or

583
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:34,640
not same almost structured because you

584
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,600
have the dos

585
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:39,360
mg header it's you usually the

586
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:42,480
the analyst uh run the different command

587
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,679
you can identify

588
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:47,120
for example the mzx structure right

589
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:51,520
so and you have the the same of course

590
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:54,640
we have we need to have for example

591
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,880
another talk to explain about the p

592
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,640
because it's very very very

593
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:01,120
compressive or or complicated to talk

594
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,080
about the

595
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:05,200
pe because i know you have different

596
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,120
uh optional header p header there's a

597
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,279
need for it to to to the file you have

598
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:10,400
the session table

599
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,279
you have you can read the code uh you

600
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:14,880
here we have different sessions

601
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,640
oh i think it's in front of the session

602
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,320
but okay anyway you

603
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:21,039
have a different structure it's very uh

604
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:21,760
compressive

605
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,400
but okay uh i will return the the my

606
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:24,880
machine

607
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,360
to show you the some information very

608
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,240
interesting

609
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:33,520
for you so here let me exit here

610
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:36,000
okay i was determinated because i think

611
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,320
it's better to manipulate the file

612
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,880
here i are you talking i will show you

613
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,400
before i show before so

614
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:45,039
about the structure right when you when

615
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:46,000
you read

616
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,440
uh the file command we

617
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,799
we read here about the elf structure

618
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:55,520
right so here we have the information

619
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,799
about the structure of that

620
00:24:56,799 --> 00:25:00,080
i would like to cop and i will check

621
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:03,279
here um

622
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:07,120
locate here okay

623
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,279
here it's the sample i would like to

624
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:12,240
read i would like to nano

625
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,720
here yes very interesting so user

626
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,000
include elf doc

627
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,039
hg this is we talk about the structure

628
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:19,919
of the alph

629
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:23,440
right so here let me

630
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,360
change here i would like to compare this

631
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,120
both of this

632
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,840
for you

633
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:36,000
no no here no

634
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:43,840
no sorry

635
00:25:46,610 --> 00:25:49,760
[Music]

636
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:52,880
oh yes okay so here

637
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:57,520
um let me check here cd

638
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:02,320
mars sample uh and linux

639
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:06,159
mauler and linux okay

640
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:09,360
we have different linux here okay

641
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:12,960
so here when let me clarify some

642
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,720
information here we have the instructor

643
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,159
of the elf for example

644
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:18,320
here they are file header this is

645
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:19,520
appears at the

646
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,640
start of the every elf file

647
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,799
we have the first uh step that we

648
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:27,200
identify define the l file we

649
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,799
find for example the i identity this is

650
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:31,840
the first

651
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:35,360
uh 16 bytes that you can

652
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,960
look and you can found the magical

653
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,200
number and others information

654
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,000
if you use for example let me check here

655
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:42,960
we have different

656
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,840
binaries we have for example airbus one

657
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:48,000
this is a

658
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,360
a ransomware malware for linux let me

659
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,159
confirm

660
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:55,919
erebus yes airbus this is

661
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:59,840
this is here it's our l fires to uh

662
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:03,360
64 bits this is equitable this is the

663
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:03,919
version

664
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:07,360
it's dynamic linked and that is okay let

665
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,799
me check another

666
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:12,720
i think it's here linux anki

667
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:16,320
it's the same 64.

668
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:20,000
it's like to another file linux

669
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:25,440
i think it's check here

670
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:32,240
yes right so i've used this thing

671
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,640
in two areas because i will i will

672
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,880
compare this both of the samples

673
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:40,240
elf and and 32 bits and here

674
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:43,520
and 64 bits right so when you even come

675
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,279
back the structure of the elf

676
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:47,600
when you you can read in 60 bytes in the

677
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,399
beginning

678
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:49,760
we have the information of the magical

679
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,679
number in the orders information

680
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:54,240
so let's let's to explain it to

681
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,240
understand this kind of steps you know

682
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:56,480
the

683
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:59,600
structure so fields in the i didn't

684
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,120
array because you know do you have the

685
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,120
array of the 60

686
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:06,240
16 bits here so

687
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:09,440
the first you have in the first position

688
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,600
we have the zero in the second position

689
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:12,720
we have the e

690
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,640
the third position we have the l in the

691
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,480
three position you have the f

692
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:19,760
if you use for example x damp

693
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:24,158
you can use x t c

694
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:27,679
minor 32 bytes and you

695
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:31,600
check the the the first linux

696
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:35,600
mali you can read here

697
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:39,279
the first the four position that you are

698
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:41,600
that i mentioned in in the elf file you

699
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,200
know this is the first position the

700
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,000
fourth position

701
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,480
right the first is zero the second is e

702
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,679
the third position is

703
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:51,039
l the fourth position is f you can read

704
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:51,760
here

705
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:54,480
so it's the same case here you can read

706
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:54,960
so

707
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:58,559
let me compare this for areas file a

708
00:28:58,559 --> 00:28:59,919
reverse file

709
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:04,399
let me check here it's the same case yes

710
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:08,320
that is we have the structure in the

711
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:11,840
file structure here in the

712
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:14,000
file that's very important to understand

713
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:14,960
because you know

714
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:17,279
when you talk many people talk about the

715
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:18,480
malware analysis

716
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:21,120
reversal engineer it's very very

717
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:21,840
interesting

718
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:24,399
but guys we need to understand these

719
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:26,240
first steps you know this is my

720
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:29,360
idea here with you in this presentation

721
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,120
because you need to understand this

722
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:33,039
basis for example the next steps

723
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:35,520
when do you look in the for example this

724
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,440
five position this is the five position

725
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:40,480
right one two three four five position

726
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,120
here

727
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:44,080
zero one what explained this extractor

728
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,039
of the elf

729
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:48,640
the position of class 32 0 1

730
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:52,000
means it means 32-bit object when you

731
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,520
zero one you can read here it's zero one

732
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:58,559
it's because the linux moly is

733
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:02,240
32 bits but another file the error was

734
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,279
it's not 32

735
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:06,080
it's 64 that you can read here so in

736
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,000
this case it's not zero one

737
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,120
you can see what here zero two and of

738
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,399
course it's here

739
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:15,360
zero two it's perfect another uh

740
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,799
position is position six

741
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:18,399
let's talk about the little engine in

742
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:19,919
the indian if you

743
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:22,480
read here it's zero one or zero two it's

744
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,240
the same case they both are files it's

745
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,200
zero one

746
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,399
it's that means it's just it's little

747
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:28,880
wings

748
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:32,080
you can read and and um not

749
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,640
in front of but you know it's different

750
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:37,039
the another position that i like to

751
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:40,399
show for example it's a let me check

752
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:42,159
here

753
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:44,720
it's about the structure for example uh

754
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:45,279
of the

755
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:47,679
machine you can read here alpha it's

756
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:48,960
creating for example the

757
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:52,480
using alliance or unix systems or hp

758
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:55,840
or net views and e-ibm or another

759
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,919
structure if you can see here the eighth

760
00:30:57,919 --> 00:30:59,120
position so

761
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:02,320
one two three four five six seven eight

762
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,159
position is zero zero

763
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:07,279
here you talk about the unix systems or

764
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:09,519
zero three you talk about the object you

765
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:11,039
know alpha station

766
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:14,159
right so maybe you can read here the

767
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:14,799
both of

768
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:18,559
its uh exactly of the explanation

769
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:20,320
after that you can read more more and

770
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,240
more and more so another thing it's very

771
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,640
interesting is the next step

772
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:27,760
it's i type the object file when you

773
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,600
talk about the 16

774
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:32,640
array you know the 16 bits in the first

775
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,440
array

776
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:37,120
the name of identity identity

777
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:40,240
the first array is i type it's the

778
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,799
second it's the 17 position right

779
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:45,919
so here we have a 16 position and here

780
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:47,840
we have the 17 position

781
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:50,799
one it's what this means here when you

782
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:52,559
read the another position let me check

783
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:52,960
here

784
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:56,159
legal values for e i t object file types

785
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:57,120
here

786
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,840
and we read the information for example

787
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,120
with if this file

788
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:04,640
is executable it's locatable or shared

789
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:08,399
object file right so here we have the

790
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:12,000
two both files executable let me confirm

791
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:12,840
here with

792
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:15,840
another binary enough it's

793
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:19,360
um user

794
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:23,360
user bean i think ls

795
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:28,080
no yes and that's here

796
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:30,159
so here we have different format i will

797
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:31,200
can show you

798
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:34,880
here ls it's a it's this command right

799
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:38,080
so this is a binary so using file

800
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:41,519
user binary ls this is a

801
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:45,039
l5 right so here in the 17 position we

802
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:45,919
can look

803
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:48,559
what we can look at the share object you

804
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:49,440
know because this is

805
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:52,240
created in in language c program right

806
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:52,720
so

807
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:55,120
here we can read this information it's

808
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,000
the same case because

809
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,159
it's not executable yes it's equitable

810
00:32:58,159 --> 00:32:59,600
because you know we have different

811
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:00,880
buildings different in

812
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:04,000
structuring the linux or unix

813
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,559
system operation but it's another talk

814
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:07,120
right

815
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:09,120
so here we can read the different here

816
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,559
the shared object

817
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:12,480
not different when you talk about the

818
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:13,840
first uh

819
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:16,880
files it's executable you know so this

820
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:17,279
is

821
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:19,519
it's very important to understand the

822
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:20,480
structure

823
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:24,320
right so i i can talk about the the

824
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,320
the portable executable but my focus

825
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,159
here is to show

826
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:30,720
what the important understand the basis

827
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:31,519
of the

828
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:33,440
the structure right so let's come back

829
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:38,399
to the presentation

830
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:40,480
so here we talk about now some physical

831
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,880
and logical structure of the files pdf

832
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:43,760
files okay

833
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:46,480
because we understand the first about

834
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:47,519
the

835
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:50,240
the structure of the how one strategy

836
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,279
can use for

837
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:53,440
example in a static analysis or dynamic

838
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:54,720
analysis and if

839
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,640
after that we read about the file

840
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,559
command how this works of how this

841
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:00,480
database this file command have

842
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:03,039
and understand more about the structure

843
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:04,480
the pa files

844
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:07,600
the sorry the l files right so now i

845
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:10,639
i look in to the pdf files right so

846
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:11,119
basically

847
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:13,839
general pdf documents has four main

848
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:14,719
parts

849
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:17,440
the first part is the header the second

850
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,359
part is the bar it's very common

851
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:21,119
the third part is cross reference table

852
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:22,399
or x table

853
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:24,560
and the trailer it's basically the end

854
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:25,599
of the document

855
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:27,679
right so basically this divide is this

856
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:30,000
form header body cross reference table

857
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,040
and trailer

858
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,040
so here i would like to show the very

859
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,079
interesting information

860
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:35,599
the header we can read the version

861
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:38,000
number do you remember when i created

862
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,639
uh the text file and then manipulated

863
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:42,399
the magic number and we

864
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:45,199
look in the pdf file do you remember it

865
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:47,440
to change it to the pdf file yes you can

866
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,119
read this information here it's very

867
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:50,000
important

868
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,480
so inside the body we have the pages

869
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:53,040
objects

870
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,679
image and font in book making and many

871
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:57,040
different

872
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:59,200
things in cross reference table that

873
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,720
here it's very interesting because we

874
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,000
have the locations

875
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,280
of the object inked into the file so

876
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,920
basic all this this the parts of the

877
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:08,480
structure

878
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:11,599
it's linkable into the body in the cross

879
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:12,640
reference table

880
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:15,520
to reference and many parts i will show

881
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:16,160
you for you

882
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:18,079
and the trailer is the same case your

883
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:19,520
location of the certain

884
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,119
basic unique presentation i am in front

885
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:22,640
of the presentation but that's

886
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:25,119
it's not a problem i will show you in my

887
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:26,240
videos okay

888
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:28,400
so i will use basically the pdf i did

889
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,280
it's a very

890
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:32,720
interesting comment using in uh

891
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:35,119
in the unix platform you can use it in

892
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:36,560
the windows platform it's

893
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:40,000
of part of the tools created by dj

894
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,359
stevens it's a

895
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:44,800
very known guy to talk to to create

896
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:47,280
to build many different tools so i

897
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:49,680
recommend by the way

898
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,920
to read more about this information the

899
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,680
point here guys it's

900
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:56,320
not talk about the tools but to

901
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,400
understand how these tools work do you

902
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,560
remember before we talk about the file

903
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:01,280
commands

904
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:03,599
the office structure that's the pointing

905
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:05,359
very very important you know

906
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:08,320
so pdf id will scan a pdf document to

907
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,520
give a string list

908
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,920
you remember we talk about strings and

909
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,040
this is very interesting

910
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,640
i can show you for you if we come back

911
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,480
to the strings

912
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:19,359
ah okay philip i know how these strings

913
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:21,599
works ah you know blah blah blah okay so

914
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:24,079
i will show one thing very interesting

915
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:26,400
maybe you know but maybe you don't know

916
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,320
so the same case i would like to show

917
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,839
you here so

918
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:32,880
let me change your windows page windows

919
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:35,280
files we have different files here

920
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:38,800
uh jigaso mamba patcha wannacry

921
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,640
server it's many different brands of

922
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:42,640
ours so here we have a string

923
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,960
common so the first of all we need to

924
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:47,440
understand how this

925
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:48,960
are you talking about the but

926
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:51,280
not it's not not correct but okay

927
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:53,119
i will talk about the how this strings

928
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:55,760
works what the command

929
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:58,560
works so strings basically it's a

930
00:36:58,560 --> 00:36:59,119
command

931
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:01,760
to to understand to compare what

932
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:04,079
displanation of the strings

933
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:08,160
let me check here man is strings

934
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:10,720
yes many streaks strings prints the

935
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:11,440
sequence

936
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:14,960
of printable characters and files right

937
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:18,079
so i can understand basically

938
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:21,200
if the strings is print of the sequence

939
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:21,680
of the

940
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:24,880
printable characters so here we have a

941
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:27,760
an accredited right so if i use for

942
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:28,880
example strings

943
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:32,640
to uh not right okay like less

944
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:34,240
because you know i am in the terminator

945
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:36,960
i can change i i don't change the buffer

946
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:39,839
of this but when they use here it's

947
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:40,720
appears for

948
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:43,280
us just that this document cannot be run

949
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:43,920
in the

950
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:46,720
in the dos model reaching the docs test

951
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:47,839
is the first session

952
00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:49,920
the second session another session in

953
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,839
another session

954
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:54,480
so i have a question for you it's very

955
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,599
interesting so

956
00:37:55,599 --> 00:38:00,000
let me okay

957
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:03,760
here uh i would like to check another

958
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:07,040
another file for example a

959
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:09,200
patcher it's another ram server it's the

960
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,920
same case this program cannot be run

961
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:15,359
we have here you look in here the text

962
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:19,520
or data data and section or esrc

963
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:22,640
okay so very interesting

964
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:25,119
so i will come back i will go to the

965
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:26,640
linux

966
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:29,920
okay so let me check here

967
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:33,119
strings erebus my friend

968
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:36,720
less the leaves so

969
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:39,760
they we have

970
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:42,240
interesting questions for you for

971
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:43,119
everyone that

972
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:46,480
can listen this presentation why

973
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:50,320
doesn't show for example the mz

974
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,560
in the case of the windows what don't

975
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,160
show the elf instructor

976
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:57,680
as you can see before when i when i

977
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:00,240
using the extent command right not

978
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,839
appears for us

979
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:05,359
it's the simple answer but

980
00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:07,839
maybe you know but maybe you don't know

981
00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:08,720
why don't appear

982
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:10,480
but basically here we have the

983
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:13,200
explanation for each file given

984
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,040
the new strings prints the printable

985
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,960
characteristic sequences that are

986
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:20,800
at least four characters long

987
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:23,760
because of this don't show you the mz

988
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:24,720
you know because

989
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:28,880
if you come back here to the windows

990
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:32,640
x damp extent minnows

991
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:37,759
32 bits for wannacry

992
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:42,160
next

993
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:54,160
right you know here this is the stream

994
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:56,320
it's these strings

995
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,400
should be appears in the comments

996
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:59,440
strings right

997
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:02,640
but that's doesn't uh

998
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:05,680
appears because of this explanation just

999
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:08,839
it started to show that the four

1000
00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:10,480
characteristics you know

1001
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:13,599
so that's point it's very important to

1002
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:15,359
understand how this command works it's

1003
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:16,720
not as a tool you know

1004
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:19,280
it's i think i know i think i know that

1005
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,480
is a tool

1006
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,000
but you need to understand how this

1007
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,920
tools works you know because you need to

1008
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:24,960
understand how this

1009
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:28,319
tools works how this uh tool are

1010
00:40:28,319 --> 00:40:31,839
works for example you i don't know if

1011
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:33,359
you read for example if you

1012
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:37,680
know this kind of um tools

1013
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:42,000
okay now yeah it's really great

1014
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:48,640
cry less right

1015
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,720
so here we can read for example the

1016
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:52,640
simple structure of the

1017
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:55,839
the the pi structure you know so we have

1018
00:40:55,839 --> 00:40:58,640
here you read we read the magic number

1019
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:00,319
you can read the

1020
00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:02,319
the paragraphs you can read the machine

1021
00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:04,240
the structure of the machine you know

1022
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:07,920
it's x86 you can read another

1023
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,680
different uh you know here you can read

1024
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:11,280
the optional header

1025
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:14,400
the the signing of the pa structure

1026
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,480
you can read many information here we

1027
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:17,680
can read the all

1028
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:19,119
interesting information for example

1029
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:21,599
kanye 32dll

1030
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:24,960
they all functions that these dll

1031
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,079
defendings

1032
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:29,200
of the get directory create files they

1033
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,800
let critical sessions

1034
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:33,200
you you receive many information you

1035
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:34,480
know i don't know if you

1036
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:36,880
if you look if you know this this tools

1037
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:37,920
it's a

1038
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:40,960
part of the the pavi project you know

1039
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:41,920
created by

1040
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,680
uh friendly mercedes it's a brazilian

1041
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,599
guy to create and another guy's running

1042
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:46,240
road

1043
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:48,800
to today's it's part of the debian i

1044
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,440
think

1045
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:52,240
uh association but it's this tools is

1046
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:52,960
created

1047
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:55,839
based in these another tools that maybe

1048
00:41:55,839 --> 00:41:56,560
you can

1049
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:59,599
you you you know they read

1050
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:04,960
else for example it's the same

1051
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:10,240
oops

1052
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:17,680
okay setting

1053
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:20,078
yes

1054
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:23,599
here it's the same you know so but this

1055
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:24,640
tools it's for elf

1056
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:28,079
not be that's that's the the important

1057
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:28,480
point

1058
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:31,839
you know because this is the first two

1059
00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:35,280
uh are be created was be created

1060
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:38,720
um but the another tool in

1061
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:42,240
the the project they read pa it's the

1062
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:42,800
same

1063
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:46,560
it's them that they almost too created

1064
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:49,119
inspired you know in these tools but

1065
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:51,359
when the guy created these tools

1066
00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:53,680
this guy need to understand how this

1067
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:54,560
tools works

1068
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:57,440
that's the my you know my objective here

1069
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:58,079
in this talk

1070
00:42:58,079 --> 00:42:59,200
you know so let's come back to

1071
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:01,359
presentation

1072
00:43:01,359 --> 00:43:04,640
so pdf id have many structure

1073
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:06,720
here the first of the structure you talk

1074
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,560
about the we talking

1075
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:10,400
which explain about the object end of

1076
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:13,040
the object streaming and of streaming

1077
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:16,079
that is open the object

1078
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:19,040
close the object and cross reference

1079
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:20,000
table cross ref

1080
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,480
and trailer and start the ref here we

1081
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:24,560
have the slash pages live encrypt

1082
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,480
we have the many slashes in front of the

1083
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:27,760
word so

1084
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:30,800
basically this latch is it means uh

1085
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:34,480
all these slashes are information inside

1086
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:36,640
it is the melee

1087
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:40,079
structure right so again we have

1088
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:42,400
the we have the structure there is a

1089
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:43,359
structure

1090
00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:46,079
and here there are many slashes but all

1091
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:46,480
these

1092
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:50,160
lessons are inside into this object this

1093
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:52,560
principle information right so here i

1094
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:54,800
explain i will show you a video

1095
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:58,160
uh explain about the pdf structure

1096
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:01,760
so you can read this video i i prepare

1097
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:05,200
i can i could use but basically i will

1098
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:07,440
looking first the sample here we can

1099
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:08,480
read for example

1100
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:11,680
this object this file has a 15

1101
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:14,000
object that you can read here and we

1102
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,920
have a very interesting information we

1103
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:17,920
have a two extremes

1104
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:20,720
so if you have extreme maybe maybe you

1105
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:21,119
can

1106
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:24,720
you can have here you can have here the

1107
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:28,079
the obscated because you know

1108
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:30,560
inside this pdf we have a five

1109
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:31,359
javascript

1110
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:34,640
you know we have a java two javascripts

1111
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:37,599
so now i will use another tools pdf

1112
00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:39,200
parses and other

1113
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:42,560
tools uh inside this uh

1114
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:45,760
this package from dj stevens i executed

1115
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:47,280
this file this comment

1116
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:50,720
inside this this this structure here we

1117
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:52,800
can read for example the pdf

1118
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:56,240
version the object one in inside object

1119
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:56,560
one

1120
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:58,880
is referring another let me pulse here

1121
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:00,240
the video to explain

1122
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:03,440
more better yes so here we have

1123
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:05,760
object one and this object one

1124
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:07,040
referencing

1125
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:10,160
object two object three four five six

1126
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:12,240
and seven you know so do you remember

1127
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:14,400
when i showed this video we have a 15

1128
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:14,960
object

1129
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:18,000
inside the pdf inside this pdf we have a

1130
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:18,800
two extremes

1131
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:22,079
and five javascript right so uh

1132
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:25,760
let me look in this uh file so

1133
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:27,599
he here we have the object one and

1134
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:29,280
reference another object

1135
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:32,480
so following the file you have here the

1136
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:34,160
object inside

1137
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:36,160
and you reference in here you have

1138
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:38,240
another open action what's the means of

1139
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:39,040
an action

1140
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:42,319
open action mean it means when the user

1141
00:45:42,319 --> 00:45:43,200
click

1142
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:47,520
basically the pdf this action execute

1143
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:51,359
basically they script inside the pdf

1144
00:45:51,359 --> 00:45:52,160
file right

1145
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:55,200
so basically you can understand here if

1146
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:56,160
the user click

1147
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:59,599
the opening action he started the we we

1148
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:02,079
started the job script you know so

1149
00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:03,760
basically when you're looking here the

1150
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:05,839
sample pdf you can understand it's a

1151
00:46:05,839 --> 00:46:06,960
suspicious right

1152
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:10,000
because when do you have a pdf

1153
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,040
with javascript it's a red it's a red

1154
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:15,920
picture and after that you can look the

1155
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:16,480
option

1156
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:18,720
action you have the action of the

1157
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:19,680
automatically

1158
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:22,400
run descriptive it's totally suspicious

1159
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:23,040
right

1160
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:26,000
so let's come back to the file here

1161
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:26,720
objects

1162
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:29,839
3 four and five six

1163
00:46:29,839 --> 00:46:33,119
so here let me pause another let me

1164
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:34,480
pause again the video

1165
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:36,240
here we have another information

1166
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:38,319
interesting object four here

1167
00:46:38,319 --> 00:46:41,280
you know we have a referencing in eight

1168
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:41,839
file

1169
00:46:41,839 --> 00:46:44,319
in in eight object and nine so here we

1170
00:46:44,319 --> 00:46:46,720
have another object nine object

1171
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:49,599
so let me explain another here and

1172
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:51,119
object seven

1173
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:54,240
you the file referencing another object

1174
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:57,680
object 10 inside the object 10 we have a

1175
00:46:57,680 --> 00:46:58,640
javascript

1176
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:01,839
reference you know so you note this

1177
00:47:01,839 --> 00:47:04,319
you can note this very interesting

1178
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:05,760
information because we have the object

1179
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:06,400
one

1180
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:08,640
reference two for example and six and

1181
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:09,440
seven

1182
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:12,160
you you can read you can see many

1183
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:12,960
different

1184
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:17,920
uh references in this file right so here

1185
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:21,359
you have another amazing information

1186
00:47:21,359 --> 00:47:23,839
object nine referencing the four when we

1187
00:47:23,839 --> 00:47:25,200
can

1188
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:28,000
see before but here we have another

1189
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:28,480
object

1190
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:31,599
the object 11 right so

1191
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:34,400
let's continue and object 10 reference

1192
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:35,280
11

1193
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:38,400
object and here in object 11

1194
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:41,760
11 sorry uh yes 11. you can read

1195
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:44,079
it's contain is streaming this is the

1196
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:45,359
first of

1197
00:47:45,359 --> 00:47:48,240
information interesting we have a stream

1198
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:49,359
inside

1199
00:47:49,359 --> 00:47:53,040
the object 11 but here we have the light

1200
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:55,119
it's the sizing of the file it's not a

1201
00:47:55,119 --> 00:47:56,720
big it's a small

1202
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:59,920
but when you read the object

1203
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:03,760
12 reference the 13 object we have

1204
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:06,400
another javascript and another

1205
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:07,440
javascript

1206
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:12,319
we have a streaming in the 13 object

1207
00:48:12,319 --> 00:48:15,440
and here the size it's more

1208
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:18,880
than bigger than first you know so

1209
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:22,319
here we can stop and you can

1210
00:48:22,319 --> 00:48:25,760
uh looking be looking this file because

1211
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:26,400
here

1212
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:29,920
contain some important information for

1213
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:30,559
us

1214
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:33,440
for for our analysis right so here we

1215
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:34,480
can looking

1216
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:37,200
inside this object into works basically

1217
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:38,079
this

1218
00:48:38,079 --> 00:48:40,720
so here another information but not

1219
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:41,920
important information

1220
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:44,400
for our analysis so here i will use

1221
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:46,160
another

1222
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:48,480
tool of course as i mentioned to you i

1223
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:50,319
need to understand how these tools work

1224
00:48:50,319 --> 00:48:51,599
so pdf tikka

1225
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:54,880
to sample the file i will use output to

1226
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:56,960
put output information in this

1227
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:59,119
in this text but i will request the

1228
00:48:59,119 --> 00:49:00,160
uncompressed

1229
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:04,079
because the information that i can find

1230
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:06,720
in the stream i need to uncompress this

1231
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:08,640
information right so i will read

1232
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:11,520
this information and wow what the

1233
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:12,559
information can read

1234
00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:15,520
here this is the information i can read

1235
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:16,640
inside it is

1236
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:18,640
streaming looking is very very

1237
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:19,920
interesting here

1238
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:21,440
because you know here we have a

1239
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:23,200
javascript do you remember

1240
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:26,400
is javascript 13 13

1241
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:28,480
javascript so here we have a javascript

1242
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:30,640
but we have a technique that attacker

1243
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:31,760
can be used

1244
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:34,960
not can we use it you can see this

1245
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:38,000
uh off skated javascript

1246
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:41,119
right so now i need to obfuscate this

1247
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:44,160
uh this string basically so

1248
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:46,400
have you copied this information have

1249
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:48,480
you used

1250
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:50,880
the my friend nano i know you you don't

1251
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:52,400
like nano but i like

1252
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:54,880
but anyway you can use another text

1253
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:55,680
editor

1254
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:58,800
so what i can i what i do will do here

1255
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:01,359
i will change the sense parameters

1256
00:50:01,359 --> 00:50:02,559
because i can

1257
00:50:02,559 --> 00:50:04,559
read this information i generate the

1258
00:50:04,559 --> 00:50:06,000
payload dot

1259
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:09,599
h tml because i would like to open this

1260
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:10,319
information

1261
00:50:10,319 --> 00:50:12,800
in the web browser right so i will

1262
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:13,680
change here

1263
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:16,559
and i will change the evo because i i i

1264
00:50:16,559 --> 00:50:17,440
see

1265
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:20,559
i saw the evo parameter

1266
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:22,800
if you works with javas you can

1267
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:24,559
understand very well this information

1268
00:50:24,559 --> 00:50:25,599
but if you don't

1269
00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:28,079
understand i know because in the past i

1270
00:50:28,079 --> 00:50:29,359
don't understand but now

1271
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:32,480
i understand the same but i'm studying

1272
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:32,800
it's

1273
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:34,880
very important you know so here i am

1274
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:36,000
open the information

1275
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:39,520
and i will save and i would like to open

1276
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:40,000
in the web

1277
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:44,000
browser to try see what the information

1278
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:47,839
are inside this in this obscure code

1279
00:50:47,839 --> 00:50:50,319
so i am putting the privilege access to

1280
00:50:50,319 --> 00:50:50,960
this

1281
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:55,040
file right so now it's okay so i will

1282
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:57,599
open this information in a web browser

1283
00:50:57,599 --> 00:50:59,119
so i will scrum

1284
00:50:59,119 --> 00:51:01,599
basic so you know it's the same machine

1285
00:51:01,599 --> 00:51:02,800
that i will use for you and

1286
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:05,520
bow what's the information perfect that

1287
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:06,559
we can read

1288
00:51:06,559 --> 00:51:09,280
it's payload guys we have a payload do

1289
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:10,640
you know what's the payload when you

1290
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:11,920
talk about the mower

1291
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:14,400
the payload is the packaging responsible

1292
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:14,960
to

1293
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:17,280
put in the vitamin machine and this

1294
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:18,160
payload

1295
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:21,599
with uh it's the callback for me uh

1296
00:51:21,599 --> 00:51:24,240
it's it's if i will be the attacker you

1297
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:25,839
know but basically this is

1298
00:51:25,839 --> 00:51:29,520
uh payload is responsible to recall to

1299
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:33,040
to the information or to open the ways

1300
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:36,880
in the attacker individuals right so

1301
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:39,440
after that another video explaining

1302
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:40,240
about this

1303
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:42,400
analysis so we have the payload so we

1304
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:44,000
need to understand more i need to find

1305
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,280
more information here

1306
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:47,280
i can if i would like to stop my

1307
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:48,319
analysis i can

1308
00:51:48,319 --> 00:51:50,319
i have the payload right so this is

1309
00:51:50,319 --> 00:51:52,160
malicious fire we have a

1310
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:55,280
pdf files we have a malicious file so i

1311
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:55,920
would rely

1312
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:58,880
when my under i made this analyze i i

1313
00:51:58,880 --> 00:51:59,839
tried to looking

1314
00:51:59,839 --> 00:52:02,640
another informations right so here i'll

1315
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:02,960
be

1316
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:06,640
using i i will try to to make it

1317
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:08,240
at the coldest information because i

1318
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:10,960
read here another

1319
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:14,160
encode so we have the of skate code and

1320
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:17,280
after that i read i read i saw

1321
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:20,319
the encode information because

1322
00:52:20,319 --> 00:52:23,920
this file using in in use c2

1323
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:27,680
encode like a a unicode format

1324
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:30,880
so i will try to looking inside this

1325
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:32,640
information what is information it's

1326
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:35,599
it's it's i can read for example because

1327
00:52:35,599 --> 00:52:37,119
this payload

1328
00:52:37,119 --> 00:52:40,480
is responsible to attack the vitamin but

1329
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:43,520
this callback for you know so so this is

1330
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:46,800
the callback the vitamin to attacker

1331
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:50,000
maybe you can you can go to to

1332
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,599
see ac you know a commanding controller

1333
00:52:53,599 --> 00:52:56,880
to the attacker so that's my that i will

1334
00:52:56,880 --> 00:53:00,240
i was thinking you know so i will try

1335
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:03,200
so what let me check here okay so here

1336
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:03,760
we we

1337
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:07,280
will see this uh let me

1338
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:09,599
come back here the video to explain so

1339
00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:12,800
here that i use this command

1340
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:16,319
here to set to to take the many

1341
00:53:16,319 --> 00:53:16,960
different

1342
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:20,720
uh uh uh ascent to have the only code

1343
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:23,599
the the run unicode information right so

1344
00:53:23,599 --> 00:53:24,480
i use here

1345
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:26,319
in the in the linux machine and here are

1346
00:53:26,319 --> 00:53:28,480
using the the mozilla

1347
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:32,160
in the windows machine so after that

1348
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:35,040
i i found the unicode information i

1349
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:35,839
generate

1350
00:53:35,839 --> 00:53:39,599
in this tools module the x file binary

1351
00:53:39,599 --> 00:53:42,160
why why you do this because when i

1352
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:44,240
generation this x file i use

1353
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:47,760
another tool from dj steven

1354
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:51,040
search search to find in this file

1355
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:54,079
if i found any http

1356
00:53:54,079 --> 00:53:57,440
uh or any uh url because

1357
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:00,800
my my idea here is to find

1358
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:03,200
the cec and the commanding controller

1359
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:04,480
from the attacker

1360
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:08,400
and when i use this this uh this tools

1361
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:12,800
looking what i found http

1362
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:15,359
or ip from the attacker when you're

1363
00:54:15,359 --> 00:54:15,839
looking

1364
00:54:15,839 --> 00:54:18,240
inside this information of obviously

1365
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:19,200
this attacker

1366
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:21,920
can be used the tour but the the last

1367
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:22,400
hope

1368
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:25,520
is in the estonia europe and i

1369
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:28,880
found the ip from the commanding

1370
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:30,240
controller look at

1371
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:32,079
it's very interesting when you start

1372
00:54:32,079 --> 00:54:34,319
this analysis in the pdf file you look

1373
00:54:34,319 --> 00:54:34,880
in the

1374
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:37,520
of skate code you the code the

1375
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:38,400
information

1376
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:40,640
after that you look in the uh the

1377
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:42,079
payload files

1378
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:44,319
the payload code inside this payload we

1379
00:54:44,319 --> 00:54:45,599
have another information

1380
00:54:45,599 --> 00:54:48,319
like uh uh i encode information in

1381
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:49,440
unicode

1382
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:53,440
uh characters i by generating

1383
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:56,799
extra binary and after this uh extra

1384
00:54:56,799 --> 00:54:57,520
binary

1385
00:54:57,520 --> 00:55:00,720
i found the uh ip

1386
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:03,920
from the attacker in this time i end

1387
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:07,280
i finally i end my analysis right

1388
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:10,720
so questions i if you have many

1389
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:11,280
