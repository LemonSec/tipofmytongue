1
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,639
hello my wonderful audience

2
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:16,160
hope you're great safe and ready

3
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,359
uh today i intend to talk about

4
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:22,320
something new in uh field of telecom

5
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,320
hacking

6
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,000
um it's really really hard for

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,279
security experts telecom engineers

8
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:34,160
and mobile operators to deal with

9
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,680
signaling and telecom

10
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,800
attacks so

11
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,640
why it's hard the answer is because

12
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,480
telco networks are complex and includes

13
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,559
many segments like radio signaling

14
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:56,160
ip backbones i.t packet data etc

15
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,960
so in this talk i don't want to talk

16
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,920
about basic and traditional tags

17
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,360
uh i just want to illustrate how we can

18
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,479
break

19
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:09,680
into a hardened telco infrastructure

20
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:14,479
while they are using security devices

21
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,280
first of all i want to introduce myself

22
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,000
i am ali a cyber security searcher

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,360
focusing on

24
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:26,400
all aspects of offensive more than

25
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,400
eight years um other books articles as

26
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:30,960
well

27
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,479
also i'm regular speaker and trainer at

28
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:37,920
in international conferences holding

29
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,000
massive computer science and many

30
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,799
international certificates and i'm

31
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:46,399
working as a bug hunter

32
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:54,000
so according to the news as you

33
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,200
can see in this slide many fraud

34
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,320
and other types of cyber incidents have

35
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,360
occurred

36
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:05,280
in um past several years while they are

37
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,439
they are using telecom and mobile

38
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,840
infrastructure

39
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:15,440
in top left corner you can see that

40
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:19,280
malfactors exploit ss7 network to inject

41
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,720
a malware

42
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,360
to attack on financial companies and

43
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,280
banks

44
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,560
and in other news on the left side

45
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,080
you can see that uh hackers targeted uk

46
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:36,879
metro bank through ss7 and on the right

47
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:37,599
side

48
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:40,360
there is a news regarding to

49
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,519
vulnerabilities

50
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:46,319
in mobile networks in united states

51
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,640
in this slide i divided all possible

52
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,519
attacks and vulnerabilities in

53
00:02:54,519 --> 00:02:56,640
telecommunication

54
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,239
first is a subscriber profile data

55
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:01,280
leakage

56
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,319
the second one is network and nodes

57
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:07,840
data leakage third one is tracking

58
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,879
mobile subscribers and breaking their

59
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:12,159
privacy

60
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:15,360
next one is sniffing spoofing

61
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,599
fraud like um transferring money using

62
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:23,760
ussd operations or making free call

63
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:28,560
or cheap calls as well

64
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:33,120
okay uh for those who has no enough

65
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,159
background of

66
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:36,959
mobile network here's the architecture

67
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:39,200
of a mobile operator

68
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,480
each mno or mobile network operator has

69
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,440
three main segments include radio access

70
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,159
network

71
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:49,200
ran which responsible for all

72
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,400
audio and basement communications like

73
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,400
your connectivity from your

74
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,720
handset or mobile phone to the tower

75
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,239
circuit search network cs network

76
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:05,680
handles your voice and sms

77
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,120
and packet network is responsible to

78
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:09,680
bring

79
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:15,840
your internet connections and data

80
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:21,759
security in radio access networks

81
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:26,320
okay uh mostly there are three types

82
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,800
of security mechanism in radio access

83
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,400
network

84
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,199
first is phone registration or any kind

85
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:34,800
of policies

86
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:39,280
for your hardware and imei

87
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,479
second is enabling ciphering algorithms

88
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:44,479
to fight against interception

89
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:47,680
and men in the middle third item is

90
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,240
using

91
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,320
only lte and lte advanced infrastructure

92
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,160
instead of traditional mobile core

93
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,520
networks in 2g

94
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,080
and 3d

95
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,479
so now we want to review the high level

96
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:04,160
architecture of ran

97
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,759
or ride your net access network in

98
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:11,280
radio access networks we have cell tower

99
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:16,720
bts in 2g node b in 3g and e node b

100
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:20,240
or evolved node b in 4g lte

101
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,520
you can see that e nodes b passing your

102
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,160
traffic

103
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,280
to ps and cs network packet

104
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,520
switch and circuit switch networks based

105
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,479
on the traffic type

106
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:35,680
if you want internet your traffic will

107
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,400
go through

108
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,720
ps network and if you want to make a

109
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,520
call or

110
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,960
send a sms the traffic will go through

111
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,919
cs network

112
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:52,560
and uh why using imei policy

113
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,400
to fight against phone smuggling lawful

114
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,919
and security monitoring tracking stolen

115
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:00,720
devices

116
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,520
and criminals

117
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,400
um okay now

118
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:12,319
with the help of motorola c uh

119
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:16,639
150 and uh 118 and osmocom bb

120
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:20,080
software we can set an invalid or

121
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,360
fake or even duplicate imei

122
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,000
and set up a call to test network

123
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,560
reactions

124
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,680
you can see that i set my i said

125
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,600
my imei to

126
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,759
all zero so that's an invalid imei

127
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:42,240
and now

128
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,160
so according to the

129
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,440
screenshot here uh network sends

130
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,919
identity request to my phone and the

131
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:54,560
type of identity was

132
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:59,840
imei you can see here

133
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,919
and and i replied to it using

134
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:08,560
an invalid imei set to all zero

135
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,479
so the network is wonderful so the

136
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:15,759
network accepted my invalid imei because

137
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:19,840
ciphering procedures completed

138
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,000
and this is the imei policy bypass

139
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,840
here because net mobile radio network

140
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:31,199
and the whole operator network accepted

141
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:34,479
uh my phone with

142
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:37,199
me as a subscribers mobile subscriber

143
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:38,479
with an invalid

144
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:43,440
imei okay

145
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:47,680
so uh there are some types of

146
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,360
ciphering keys like kc srs

147
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,160
and rand or random number in radio

148
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,599
access networks

149
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:59,039
which harden the radio network to avoid

150
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:02,400
active sniffing and they always store

151
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,440
in hlr or hss in

152
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,240
core network

153
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:15,039
so hss or hlr as a subscriber database

154
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:18,319
has a component called auc

155
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:21,919
or authentication center which um

156
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:24,319
responsible for ciphering and

157
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:27,840
authentication procedures

158
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,120
to bypass and get these information we

159
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,719
are going to

160
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:36,080
uh targeting aoc or authentication uh

161
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,599
center in hlr hss by abusing

162
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,958
ss7 and signaling access

163
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:46,319
as a roaming partner

164
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,920
and as you can see i

165
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,360
sent a malicious ss7 map

166
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,399
or mobile application part s-a-i or

167
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:01,279
send authentication info to targeted

168
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:02,320
core network

169
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,839
from ss7 network to retrieve ciphering

170
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:06,959
info

171
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:10,399
and the network respond me

172
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:14,640
via rand stress and kc values

173
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,680
in clear text

174
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,880
that's amazing so

175
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:24,160
another security mechanism is using

176
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:28,080
uh lte and lte advanced uh to bring

177
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,519
uh highest quality and performance uh

178
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:34,959
having more security and privacy in core

179
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:38,000
and radio segments

180
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,360
and other factors like voice over lt or

181
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,080
volte

182
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:46,640
or flexibility etc

183
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:51,440
okay guys let's review bypassing method

184
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,320
here

185
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,080
totally uh there is a

186
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,360
general way here downgrading subscribers

187
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,839
to try additional technologies like

188
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:04,880
3g and 2d which uh which are

189
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,920
vulnerable to many attacks

190
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,440
like men in the middle to perform

191
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,320
downgrading

192
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:18,480
we need to use a signal jammer

193
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,760
security in circuit switch network or cs

194
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,560
core network

195
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,160
using sms home routing is the first

196
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:32,480
uh item and the second one is signaling

197
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,120
fireballs

198
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:39,200
so uh home routing

199
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,320
act as a proxy and the definition of a

200
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,600
home router is hot

201
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,959
to hiding uh subscriber

202
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:49,440
mc number which is very valuable

203
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,959
information

204
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:54,240
um to perform hacking scenarios from

205
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:58,839
um from a hacker or malfactor

206
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:00,480
perspective

207
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,000
as you can see a hacker requested

208
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,200
to receive emc from hlr

209
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,040
or hss and the hlr hss respond

210
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,399
with a real value however

211
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:18,800
home router change the value with a fake

212
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,040
one

213
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,000
so how we can detect if home routing is

214
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,079
enabled or not

215
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:33,600
uh just need to send two or more

216
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,800
malicious ss7 message like

217
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:40,720
send writing info for sm or sre for sm

218
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,279
that's easy if we received different

219
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:44,320
responses

220
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,440
it means that sms home routine is

221
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,480
in place in our targeting

222
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:57,279
uh in our targeted operator

223
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:01,120
uh i'm writing bypass uh

224
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,839
in telecom networks we have uh three

225
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:04,959
types of duties

226
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:08,639
or global title which act as ip address

227
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:12,560
ms istn or your phone number

228
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:16,000
consists of mcc or mobile country code

229
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,040
ndc and sn

230
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:23,120
mc number consists of mcc mnc

231
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,240
mobile network code and msin and

232
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,920
mgt consists of mcc ndc

233
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:33,279
and msin so

234
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:36,160
as you can see hacker can abuse mgt

235
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,800
number and a valid random mc number

236
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,760
to request other information regarding

237
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,360
to targeted mobile

238
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,360
number and it's real easy

239
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:54,880
uh signaling fireball

240
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:58,560
okay uh mobile operators

241
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,839
use uh signaling firewalls

242
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:04,079
uh to protect their signaling

243
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:05,200
infrastructure

244
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,880
signal packet inspection filtering

245
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:12,399
white and blacklisting

246
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:19,519
signaling firewall bypass

247
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:22,320
to bypass these kind of variables we

248
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,440
need

249
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:27,279
uh just to playing with tcap

250
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:30,639
so what is tcap tcap is

251
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:34,079
a ss7 sub protocol and it's like

252
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:38,240
tcp you can see

253
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:42,959
a wire shark

254
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,079
a screenshot from my wireshark here that

255
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:46,839
this is

256
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:50,320
um transaction capabilities application

257
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:54,399
part or tcap

258
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:59,040
tcap begin message and tcap and message

259
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:02,240
so

260
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,920
um okay

261
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:10,240
to uh to perform bypassing we need

262
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,360
to remove application context name from

263
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,880
tcap

264
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:18,399
or sending double operation message

265
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:22,800
let's get into it uh

266
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,440
removing app contact's name from tcap

267
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,560
message

268
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:30,240
uh okay to start the procedure we need

269
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:30,880
to

270
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:34,160
remove dialog request section from our

271
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,880
malicious ss7 message

272
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:40,160
then there will not app context

273
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:43,440
name to point to malicious ss7

274
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:48,160
map message you can see here

275
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:55,279
so sending

276
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:58,800
double operation message

277
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,120
most of signaling firewall block or

278
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,800
accept a message

279
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:06,560
based on message type so each signaling

280
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:07,199
message

281
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:10,480
has its own op code or operation code

282
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:14,240
and it's a vital number

283
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:20,399
in this screenshot you can see sr4sm

284
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:23,519
and it's related up code

285
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:27,839
here so

286
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:31,920
um cord

287
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:37,199
according to the picture hacker is

288
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:40,399
trying to put a legitimate ss7

289
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:44,320
message to opcode in the first step

290
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:49,680
and then put a malicious ss7 message

291
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,480
so signaling firewall will check just

292
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,120
the first

293
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,399
operation code which is pointing to a

294
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:59,199
legitimate operation

295
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:03,360
and you can see here that the

296
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:07,279
cs code nodes and functions

297
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,920
uh respond with the real number and

298
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,120
signaling firewall

299
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:14,560
uh will check checked the

300
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:17,920
first operation so and signaling

301
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:18,959
fireball thinks that

302
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:22,720
it seems legitimate s7 message

303
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,959
so the hacker bypass signal fire roll

304
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:31,599
and will retrieve the real number

305
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,000
or any information that's a hacker wants

306
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,000
to receive from the core network

307
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,160
like here so here that's

308
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:49,279
that's it that the subscribermc

309
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:52,560
or a network information received by

310
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:57,599
hacker here okay so

311
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,079
uh

312
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:04,400
solutions uh first and important thing

313
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:08,640
is uh hardening the devices protocols

314
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,760
and communications based on industrial

315
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:12,959
standards like

316
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:16,400
3gpp etsy etc

317
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,880
using firewall or if you are using

318
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,280
signaling firewall already you can

319
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:25,439
um fine-tune and optimize it

320
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:28,880
a t-suck or telecom uh

321
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,840
security operation center is highly

322
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,840
recommended

323
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,960
periodic assessments and audits are

324
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,520
necessary and training and security

325
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,559
awareness

326
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:43,600
are very useful

327
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,840
thank you folks for your attention and

328
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,320
you can stay in touch with me

329
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,400
uh sharing knowledge and experience

330
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,440
together and

331
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:58,039
finding more friends stay safe and

332
00:17:58,039 --> 00:18:01,039
healthy
