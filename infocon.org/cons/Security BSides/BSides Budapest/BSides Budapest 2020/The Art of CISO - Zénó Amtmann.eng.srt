1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,240
hello and welcome everyone

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:07,680
my name is zaina antoine and in the next

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,880
good half an hour or so i'd like to make

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:11,920
a call

5
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,639
to think together the title of this

6
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:15,599
presentation

7
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:19,359
is the art of ceso and by the end of

8
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:20,640
this session

9
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,800
even though there will not be any demo

10
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,400
here i hope that

11
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28,480
by mixing art logic technology

12
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,679
and the people behind all of these can

13
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:35,840
assist us in enhancing cyber security

14
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,879
a little bit of my background i was

15
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:40,719
lucky that i could have

16
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:43,760
hands-on experience of a great variety

17
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:44,079
of

18
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:47,200
aspects of i.t including cabling

19
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,039
building up new branch offices

20
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:50,879
supporting client and server side

21
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:52,879
computers and firewalls

22
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:56,840
during the outsourcing era in the early

23
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,760
2000s i was privileged that i could

24
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,359
be a member of corporate ito the team

25
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:06,000
of a multinational corporation traveling

26
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:06,960
the world

27
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,080
to audit the i.t services provided to

28
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,080
the customers of this company

29
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,040
and the id security posture that was

30
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,000
delivered to them

31
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,360
during the early 2010s

32
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,400
later in the late 2010s i could lead a

33
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,280
program

34
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,080
that aimed to harmonize regulatory

35
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,119
requirements

36
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:30,400
globally and translate those to id

37
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,759
controls

38
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:34,240
and in the last one and a half year or

39
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,200
so

40
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,400
i act as a cso

41
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,040
for a number of subsidies of one of the

42
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,360
largest banks in hungary

43
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,799
so with that introduction let me

44
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:51,759
start to frustrate you on the next

45
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,799
slide

46
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:58,000
is there anything in common with these

47
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,560
two pictures

48
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,159
well what possibly could be in common

49
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:07,360
in leonardo da vinci and the i.t

50
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,399
guys of the 1990s the

51
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:13,920
caesar of our modern corporate world

52
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,720
and the art that we have in the title of

53
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,879
this presentation

54
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:20,800
by the end of this session we will

55
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,480
establish a link

56
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,599
and see that these seemingly distant

57
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:26,400
things

58
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,280
are not that far from each other and the

59
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,000
title

60
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,160
hopefully will make some sense as well

61
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,680
but for that

62
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,400
we have to start a little bit further we

63
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,000
need to understand a little bit of

64
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,040
history

65
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,480
where we came from the common thing

66
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,519
behind both of these pictures

67
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:48,239
is the concept and that concept is

68
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:50,400
already dead

69
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,519
wow some might say that's gross

70
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:56,800
how can something be said even

71
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,599
or some might say well hell yeah it's

72
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:00,000
dead

73
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,400
of course so well the

74
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,760
common thing the concept behind leonardo

75
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,519
da vinci's famous picture

76
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:12,959
and a computer that i used to learn

77
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:17,760
i.t in high school is

78
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,959
lying within the concept that

79
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:24,480
they are representing

80
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,640
leonardo was a polyhistor

81
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,920
or as literature often refer to him a

82
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,760
renaissance man the worst polyhistor

83
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,319
originated from the latin and ancient

84
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:41,280
greek

85
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,040
meaning greatly learned

86
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,159
they are men who use both

87
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:50,959
left brain and right brain type of

88
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:51,920
thinking

89
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,200
and as a result these are the

90
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,120
characteristics of them

91
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,439
curious risk taker creative

92
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:04,799
has perseverance self-discipline

93
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:07,439
has a thirst for knowledge and new

94
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:08,959
experiences

95
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:11,360
excellence in physical intellectual

96
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,159
artistic

97
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:15,280
and social fields and

98
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,959
including deep experience in at least

99
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:19,358
one

100
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:22,560
of the field and is

101
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,600
exceptional in some other fields

102
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,360
and most importantly they are always

103
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,720
learning in the early stages of the

104
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,160
computing era

105
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:38,080
when someone knew how to use a computer

106
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:41,120
and how to fix it they knew the

107
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,240
computers

108
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,000
period at that time the iit guy

109
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,440
of the 1990s was some kind of

110
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:53,199
polyhistor as they knew the machine

111
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:55,440
they could write code they could fix

112
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,120
hardware issues

113
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,800
and do all kinds of magical stuff

114
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,520
however like beginning from the

115
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,800
renaissance age

116
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,600
the aviable knowledge started to grow

117
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,479
within this

118
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:11,759
industry as well well it became

119
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:15,440
an industry after all and

120
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,800
became first harder and then later

121
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,840
impossible for someone to became a real

122
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,840
polyhistory

123
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,240
similarly in our modern age

124
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,479
things getting more and more connected

125
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:36,960
and the available knowledge within the

126
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,160
iit industry

127
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,120
grew well it became an industry for

128
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,320
starters

129
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,440
people start to get specialized

130
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,840
corporations became more and more

131
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,720
complex

132
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,360
entities with numerous business units

133
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,759
and organizations within them

134
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:56,880
of which more often than not have

135
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:00,319
at least competing interests segregation

136
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:01,440
of duties

137
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,840
and the specialized and standardized

138
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,960
tasks within a workforce process

139
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,160
resulted in isolation and that

140
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,520
high level leaders are less able to

141
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,319
oversight the cooperation as a whole

142
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,120
compared to

143
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,400
their ability to do so a decade ago

144
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,199
technology became an integral part of

145
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:24,720
the business

146
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,479
in most cases without senior executives

147
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:32,000
and the board's consciousness thus

148
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,440
today we live in an era of

149
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:39,759
monoliths or specialists

150
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,280
well sure you can say

151
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,479
okay so what's the problem with that

152
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:51,759
well almost 30 years ago

153
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:55,039
two academic writers highlighted

154
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:58,960
that business and marketing strategies

155
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,919
should be viewed as interlocking rather

156
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:04,000
than separate

157
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,120
back then they stated this for

158
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,240
businesses

159
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,199
and marketing strategies and it was

160
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:12,160
quite

161
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:17,840
a thinking

162
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,759
today i.t strategies

163
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:24,160
can neither be overlooked nor handled

164
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,919
separately

165
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:29,039
what else is a problem

166
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,400
well that humans don't

167
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,599
change as fast as technology did while

168
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:37,120
culture itself

169
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:41,440
changed as well edgar shane

170
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,479
defined organizational culture

171
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:47,520
as a pattern of shared

172
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:51,360
basic assumptions that the group learned

173
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,680
as it solved its problems of external

174
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,960
adaptation

175
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,319
and internal integration that has worked

176
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,039
well enough to be considered valid

177
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:03,680
and therefore to be taught to new

178
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,720
members

179
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,759
as the correct way to perceive

180
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:11,360
think and feel in relation to those

181
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,039
problems

182
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:16,639
have you ever heard this we do

183
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:20,240
things this way around here this is the

184
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,280
way we always did it

185
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,879
so what's the problem with specialists

186
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:30,400
the problem is that people stuck

187
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,799
with one way of thinking they have

188
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,159
blinders on

189
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:36,159
and they cannot see the big picture

190
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,240
including the relationship

191
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,159
and similarities between different

192
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,360
things

193
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,159
as i said it seems that the concept of

194
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,440
the renaissance man

195
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,480
is dead but what the heck

196
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,600
does it have to do anything with the

197
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:56,480
ceso and the title of this presentation

198
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,839
well like in any good sandwich and i do

199
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:04,240
apologize for the vegetarians and vegans

200
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,120
here

201
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,160
the meat is in the middle and in the

202
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,440
case of the word

203
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,480
siso the letters i

204
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,760
and s are in the middle meaning

205
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,800
information and security

206
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,440
and in the media another word is often

207
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,399
used

208
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:25,760
between these two which is cyber

209
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,000
security

210
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,440
we do believe that we

211
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,600
know what they mean but do we really

212
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,800
know

213
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,000
so let's open up a little bit

214
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,720
information what is information

215
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,000
there are a number of different

216
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,560
definitions according to the

217
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:50,640
oxford dictionary in general it means

218
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,440
facts provided or learned about

219
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,519
something or someone

220
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:59,360
in computer terms it defines

221
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,839
this word as data that is

222
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:06,240
processed stored or transmitted by a

223
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,760
computer

224
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:11,040
however we can use a different approach

225
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:15,200
like legal boxes if you like the little

226
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,800
building boxes data

227
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,000
information knowledge

228
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,640
wisdom let's say for example that

229
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:30,079
someone gets data from my computer's

230
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:33,600
browsing history and since that

231
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,640
i was looking for information about the

232
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,920
security requirements of the

233
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:43,839
hungarian nuclear power plant

234
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:46,240
from the browsing history they can see

235
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,000
that later i was

236
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,800
listening to some german punk metal

237
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,600
music

238
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,360
and i was looking up to concerts of that

239
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,240
band in

240
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:00,320
berlin germany again later

241
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:03,200
they can see that i was looking for

242
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:03,839
flights

243
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:06,880
from berlin to budapest

244
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:10,000
so this is data once

245
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,680
whoever got these individual data parts

246
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,600
of my browsing history

247
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,120
can say that she or he

248
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,560
has a piece of information about me and

249
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,040
can make a deduction from these pieces

250
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,959
of information

251
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:31,279
and try to get knowledge from it

252
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:34,480
using all these previous uh

253
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,000
examples uh that whoever

254
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,720
got this information um maybe got from

255
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,399
my browsing history

256
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:45,760
combined it with my family name antman

257
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:49,360
which which is a german name

258
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:53,440
someone might deduct that

259
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,800
german cyberpunk wants to blow up pakish

260
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,760
the hungarian nuclear power plant

261
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,040
deduction

262
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:04,160
yes knowledge and wisdom

263
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:08,160
not quite see putting it like this

264
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,440
it obviously feels bogus

265
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,560
but in reality leaders

266
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,360
are making decisions based on data that

267
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:17,760
were

268
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,959
organized into information by incorrect

269
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:22,240
deductions

270
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,440
and they believe that they are acting on

271
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,639
knowledge

272
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:29,200
based on information and wisdom while in

273
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,560
fact

274
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:33,199
they have not

275
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,720
the second letter in the middle of the

276
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,079
word is

277
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:43,200
security this word is

278
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,720
defined as the state of being

279
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,560
free from danger or threat

280
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:54,000
well this definition

281
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,120
opens up a question

282
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,800
the question that how could we

283
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:04,320
know whether we are free from threat

284
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,680
especially today when every source of

285
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,480
news is

286
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,600
full of reports of crimes data leakage

287
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,760
attacking our personal and private

288
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:14,880
information

289
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:18,000
and so on the

290
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,279
committee of sponsoring organizations of

291
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:24,720
the trade way commission or koso

292
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,320
developed the model and although it was

293
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:32,560
updated in 2013

294
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,920
and it's a cube now i

295
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:39,199
believe that for this purpose their

296
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,720
original model

297
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,040
could illustrate the concept i'd like to

298
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:46,000
convey here better

299
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,120
so control environment

300
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,399
this is the basis and foundation of

301
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:55,680
everything only when we knew

302
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:59,440
with real knowledge

303
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,560
can we assess the potential risks that

304
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:02,880
can

305
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:06,079
affect it once we know the risks

306
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:10,000
that are applicable to whatever we have

307
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,120
we can develop controls to address these

308
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,079
risks

309
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:17,600
mitigate accept transfer

310
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,839
once we put appropriate controls in

311
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:20,880
place

312
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:24,560
we just have to monitor any changes

313
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,920
change any changes in these elements

314
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,959
and adjust as needed

315
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:34,399
for which information and communication

316
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:38,000
are a key and we come

317
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,199
back to the communication part in just a

318
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:42,839
little bit

319
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:46,320
consequently there is another word

320
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,920
that is commonly used amongst the

321
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,680
previous two which

322
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:54,639
i mentioned which is cyber security

323
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:57,760
so let's have a little

324
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:01,360
bit under the hood of the

325
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:05,519
cyber part of this world

326
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:12,399
cyber according to media

327
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:15,440
is derived from

328
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,560
cybernetic which

329
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:22,399
comes and originates from the greek word

330
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:26,240
i don't even try to pronounce that

331
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,519
but it means skilled in

332
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:32,720
steering or governing

333
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,079
cybernetics has been defined in numerous

334
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:36,880
ways

335
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:40,480
such as the art of steermanship

336
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,920
the art of securing efficient operation

337
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:47,040
the art of effective organization the

338
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:47,759
art of

339
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:52,000
interaction in dynamic networks or

340
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,199
a science that is connected with the

341
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:58,000
study of systems of any nature

342
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,000
which are capable of receiving storing

343
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,440
and processing information so as to use

344
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,079
it

345
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:09,839
for control

346
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:14,959
okay so now that we

347
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:18,320
know what is information what is

348
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,839
security

349
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:22,720
let's have a look of an element that

350
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,680
plays

351
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,800
an important part in the equation

352
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,320
namely human beings the individuals

353
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,240
working within a company

354
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:36,480
and their personality and my apologies

355
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,680
again let's pause here for a second

356
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,959
and let's look under the hood the word

357
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:46,880
personality this word is originated from

358
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,000
the latin word

359
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,839
persona which was a mask

360
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:54,959
that an actor wore during a play

361
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:57,440
which signified his character by

362
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,480
displaying

363
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,680
it in an overamplified way

364
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,559
according to the american psychological

365
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:06,240
association

366
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,919
personality refers to individuals

367
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:13,520
differences in characteristic patterns

368
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:13,839
of

369
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:17,599
thinking feeling and behaving

370
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:21,039
this different behavior can

371
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:24,319
play a part in two dimensions

372
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:28,640
firstly in a person's interactions with

373
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,720
others and secondly an individual's

374
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,919
reactions

375
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:37,360
provided to stimulus from the external

376
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,240
verb

377
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:41,360
in other words in the first case

378
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,400
some folks are talkative in a party some

379
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,039
others

380
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:48,160
are there to eat drink and to be left

381
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,440
alone

382
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,559
in this second case someone might crack

383
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:54,000
under pressure

384
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,600
while some others get strength from it

385
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,360
one of the most well known

386
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,799
categorization of the

387
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:04,240
second case is the myers-briggs

388
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:08,320
type indicator or mbti which

389
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:11,840
categorizes people from four different

390
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:15,200
aspects and assessing people

391
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:19,520
out of the 16 potential types

392
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:24,000
for example extroverts and introverts

393
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,120
for the first case minsberg's

394
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,000
categorization is the most well known as

395
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,799
he differentiated between ten roles

396
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:36,640
and three categories without going

397
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:40,000
too deeply into the topic i just like to

398
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,760
highlight three which could contribute

399
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:47,280
the best for a cso

400
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,240
one of the most important roles lies

401
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:50,960
within the

402
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,919
information category namely the

403
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:56,320
disseminator role

404
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:59,679
in the information age one of the most

405
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:02,880
crucial key element is the ability

406
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:06,000
to understand assimilate

407
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,039
and appropriately rely information

408
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:12,559
remember information and knowledge

409
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:14,960
in the interpersonal category the two

410
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,000
key roles

411
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,360
for a ciso would be the leader and the

412
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:23,200
liaison as motivation internally

413
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,320
and representing unity externally is

414
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,840
vital

415
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:31,440
lastly the category related to the

416
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,320
ability of decision making has two key

417
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,440
roles

418
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,919
which are the entrepreneur and the

419
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:39,440
negotiator

420
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:42,480
as the prior one needs to realize the

421
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,600
opportunities

422
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:47,440
both external and internal and negotiate

423
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:47,760
it

424
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:51,039
and bring it through senior management

425
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:54,880
and the board as needed okay

426
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,919
but why the heck are am i

427
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:00,640
talking about this what do we want to

428
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,520
achieve

429
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:05,760
what's the end game well the end game is

430
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:09,919
to secure information

431
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:15,039
secure information

432
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:18,559
a data breach is an incident

433
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:21,760
in which sensitive protected or

434
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,280
confidential data has

435
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:26,799
potentially been viewed stolen

436
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:29,840
or used by an individual unauthorized to

437
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,520
do so

438
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:34,559
ibm defined the data breach as an

439
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:37,679
event in which an individual's name

440
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:41,039
and medical record and or a financial

441
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:41,919
record

442
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:45,600
or by an debit card

443
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,559
is potentially put at risk either in

444
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:49,600
electronic

445
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,799
or paper format the distinction

446
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:57,760
of paper format is important

447
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:03,039
these numbers are actually

448
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:06,720
scary cyber attack

449
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:10,480
occurs every 39

450
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:14,240
seconds the average time

451
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:17,360
to identify and contain a breach

452
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:20,400
across all industries

453
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:24,240
is 279

454
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:29,120
days it's more than nine months

455
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:33,679
nine months and we can see the cost

456
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:36,880
of the data breach which has

457
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:40,080
consistently risen over the past year

458
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:43,919
and the cost to recover from a

459
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:44,960
ransomware

460
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:49,039
skyrocketed as well an interesting twist

461
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:53,120
that ransomware attacks nowadays

462
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:59,760
are actually threatening their victims

463
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,960
to release data rather than

464
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:06,400
asking money to unlock a computer than

465
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,760
they started off with

466
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,840
the number of data breaches increased by

467
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,200
54

468
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:19,760
in the half or first half of 2019

469
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:24,159
uh and in total more than 4.1 billion

470
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:25,360
records have been

471
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:28,640
exposed in the year

472
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:34,400
2019 so last year on december 4

473
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:38,840
2019 a security researcher discovered

474
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:41,840
2.7 billion email addresses

475
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:45,440
and plain text passwords for

476
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:48,480
more than one billion of them in an

477
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:52,640
unsecured online database

478
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:57,840
verizon's 2019 insider threat report

479
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,960
estimates that insider threat

480
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:04,400
caused more than third of all data

481
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,600
breaches

482
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:09,200
as far as root causes the 2019 ibm study

483
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:09,760
found

484
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:13,520
that 51 percent was due to malicious

485
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,960
attacks

486
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:19,120
and 24 due to human error

487
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:22,720
only 25 percent caused

488
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:26,640
by system glitches according to a fourth

489
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,360
article

490
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:30,960
published in uh april uh this year

491
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:34,640
70 of all data breaches are originated

492
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,039
from

493
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:38,960
end points like laptop computers

494
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:43,360
phones mobile devices

495
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,918
pcs

496
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:49,600
further due to the skyrocketed home

497
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,080
office

498
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,720
introductions across the globe due to

499
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:53,440
this

500
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:57,679
coveted 19 pandemic a may 2020

501
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:01,039
fourth article predicts that the biggest

502
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:04,320
cyber attack in history will happen

503
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:08,240
in the next six months

504
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:11,360
well how is it possible

505
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,679
that we have this many breaches how is

506
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:14,880
it possible that

507
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:17,440
with all of the increased spending and

508
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,080
focus on information security

509
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:23,520
still 70 percent of

510
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:26,559
all the breaches are originating from

511
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:29,360
the endpoints

512
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,960
well at the end of 2019

513
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:38,159
people are still using the passwords

514
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:42,080
that you can see on the left

515
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:45,840
in addition more than 44 million

516
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,760
microsoft accounts

517
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,240
were using passwords that had already

518
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,559
been compromised elsewhere

519
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:55,120
so the question seems obvious real

520
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:55,600
people

521
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:59,360
ever learn but

522
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:02,559
the answer is not that obvious

523
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:04,640
the world economic forum provides an

524
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,000
annual platform

525
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,480
and an opportunity for leaders and

526
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:11,039
multi-stakeholders

527
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:14,240
to engage with each other participants

528
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:14,720
of

529
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,570
this forum were asked to

530
00:25:16,570 --> 00:25:17,760
[Music]

531
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:21,279
conduct and participate in the

532
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:24,400
global risk perception survey

533
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:27,679
which is published each year

534
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:31,200
according to this year's report

535
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,480
although more than 50 percent

536
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:38,240
of the world's population is online

537
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:41,360
i let it think a little bit more than

538
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:46,000
50 percent of all the population

539
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,240
in the world are online

540
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:53,840
still approximately 1 million

541
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:57,039
people go online

542
00:25:57,039 --> 00:26:00,320
for their first time each

543
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:04,000
day let

544
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,520
it fit this a little bit as well

545
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:10,799
1 million people go online

546
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:13,919
for their first time every

547
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:17,520
day therefore

548
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:20,640
what might be repetitious and obvious

549
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,760
for

550
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:25,200
us in this conference room and

551
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,880
whoever is listening to this there are 1

552
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:29,600
million

553
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:34,000
individuals each day who have no clue

554
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,320
in addition these new users are mostly

555
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,080
from developing countries

556
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:43,520
and in the world economic forum survey

557
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,919
they concluded that today's emerging

558
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:46,960
economies

559
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:50,559
are expected to comprise six of the

560
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:54,960
world's seven largest economies by 2050.

561
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,679
respondents of the survey also rated

562
00:26:57,679 --> 00:26:58,559
information

563
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:02,159
infrastructure breakdown as the sixth

564
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:05,360
most impactful risk in the years

565
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:09,120
until 2030 and cyber attacks on critical

566
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,559
infrastructure very

567
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:15,760
very rated as the fifth top risk in 2020

568
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:19,120
and this is not just some irrational

569
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,159
fear

570
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:23,120
such attacks have already affected

571
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,559
entire cities

572
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:27,760
and multiple states

573
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:32,720
for example in december 2019

574
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:35,279
new orleans had to declare a state of

575
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:36,480
emergency

576
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,200
due to a ransomware attack shortly

577
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,799
before that

578
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:43,840
the governor of louisiana had to do the

579
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,039
same

580
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:49,600
earlier in 2017 attacker could take down

581
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:52,960
the emergency services number 911

582
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:56,880
in 12 states imagine the situation

583
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:00,880
you want to ask for help

584
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:05,200
from 9-1-1 or from

585
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:08,559
1-1-2 call the police

586
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:12,158
and the service is down

587
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,720
could be shocking especially if you are

588
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,399
in that situation

589
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:19,840
when you would desperately need a help

590
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:24,959
an interesting fact is that only

591
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:28,320
5.9 percent of the emergency

592
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:32,080
centers had any program or plan to

593
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:35,120
address events like that so public and

594
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,640
private sectors

595
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:42,080
are like at risk of being compromised

596
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:45,520
and or held as a hostage

597
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,520
organized cyber crime entities are

598
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,200
joining forces

599
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,640
and the likelihood of detection

600
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:55,520
such an organization and the prosecution

601
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:56,880
is estimated to be

602
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:01,919
as low as 0.05

603
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:04,960
percent in the u.s

604
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:07,520
we all heard about the software as a

605
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:08,480
service and

606
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:12,320
platform as a service model well

607
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:15,200
there is a cyber crime as a service

608
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:18,159
which is also a growing muslims model

609
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:20,159
as the increasing sophistication of

610
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:22,240
tools on the darknet

611
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:25,279
makes malicious services more affordable

612
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:28,320
and easily accessible for anyone some

experts

614
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,679
stated after the new orleans state of

615
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:33,200
emergency that

616
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:37,360
cisos focus on technological defenses

617
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,760
when they should also be patching their

618
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:40,480
colleagues

619
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:43,120
with regular stimulated attacks and

620

security awareness trainings

621
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,440
besides all of these threats the amount

622
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,120
of data that we generate

623
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:54,640
both structured and unstructured is

624
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:58,080
exponentially and we almost could say

625
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:02,320
concerningly growing in addition

626
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:05,039
the fourth industrial revolution

627
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:07,120
technologies will dramatically

628
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:10,399
reshape economies and societies

629

who makes money and how has already

630
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,320

industrial revolution the world has

developed

673
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:10,960
a complex supply chain

674
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,440
from designers manufacturers to

and retailers it is

678
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:24,320
what allowed billions of products to be

679
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,039
made

680
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:28,159
shipped both and enjoyed in all

681
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:31,360
corners of the world however in recent

682
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:32,240
times

683
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:35,200
the power of the internet especially the

684
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,399
mobile phone

685
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:39,200
has unleashed a movement that's rapidly

686
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,880
destroying these layers

687
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:44,159
and moving power to new places

688
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:47,039
so it's clear that demographics have

689
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:47,760
changed

690
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:50,960

695
00:32:58,640 --> 00:32:59,039
that

696
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:02,559
approximately 50 percent of companies

697
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:03,519
worldwide

698
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:06,159
predict that automation will trim their

699
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:09,840
current full-time workforce by 2022.

700
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:12,960
and by that same year researchers

701
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:17,679
expect at least 55

702
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:21,760
percent 54

703
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:24,960
of employees will need re-skilling

704
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:28,080
and upskilling to complete their jobs

705
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,399
folks this is just two years from today

706
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:31,200
not in some

707
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:34,720
distant future and in this economy

708
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:37,440
where data is the new oil the question

709
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,200
arises

710
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:42,640
who owns and who controls the data

711
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,320
and who is protecting all these

712
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:46,960
information

713
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:53,120
ok so we know all this

714
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:56,399
see this but there is another hidden

715
00:33:56,399 --> 00:33:57,200
challenge

716
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:00,000
besides the obvious ever increasing rate

717
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,279
and sophistication of

718
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:04,799
attack vectors which is unfortunately

719
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:08,000
senior management and the corporate

720
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,320
culture

721
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:14,320
that's harsh i know i know

722
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:18,079
still it is our reality

723
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:21,359
more often than not well we know that

724
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:25,359
there is no such thing as 100 percent

725
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:28,960
secure environment security

726
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:32,960
costs money and when appropriate funding

727
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,079
is requested

728
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:36,480
from the board who might not have a

729
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,879
clear understanding of the full depth of

730
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:39,359
the

731
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:43,199
i.t security as we discussed earlier

732
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:45,520
the change happened without their

733
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,199
consciousness

734
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:50,560
they might ask okay so

735
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:53,280
we are spending this money now on this

736
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,359
fancy new firewall

737
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:58,079
i understand but what's on the income

738
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:00,400
side

739
00:35:00,839 --> 00:35:03,599
well this mindset

740
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:06,560
unfortunately seems to be validated by a

741
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:07,359
survey

742
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:10,480
conducted amongst the csos that

743
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:13,599
found that almost a quarter

744
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:17,599
of interviewed cesos said that boards

745
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:20,640
didn't accept or understand that

746
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:21,440
breaches

747
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:24,480
are inevitable and said that

748
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:27,280
they hold them personally accountable

749
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:27,760
for

750
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:31,520
any incidents

751
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:34,079
so it would seem that culture and

752
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:35,040
corporate and

753
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,520
organizational culture plays a vital

754
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:38,400
role

755
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,960
here remember we talked about the

756
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,079
importance of the

757
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:45,119
foundation of everything earlier when we

758
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:48,160
had a look at the corso triangle

759
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,760
i mentioned that we'll discuss the

760
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,760
information and communication part a

761
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:52,960
little bit more

762
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:56,720
later well this is later

763
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:59,040
as it was mentioned there if senior

764
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,000
management

765
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,200
acts based on an understanding that

766
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:06,480
it is not funded on knowledge they

767
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,200
cannot

768
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:10,320
act even with their best

769
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:13,760
interest in place appropriately

770
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:16,320
i have seen far too many times that

771
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,680
middle management

772
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:20,880
simply does not report yellow or red

773
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,079
kpis or

774
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:25,440
slas to senior management because of

775
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:28,720
various reasons it has to be green they

776
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:29,920
said

777
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:33,440
well in september 2015 electronics

778
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,240
conglomerate

779
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:37,839
toshiba admitted that it had overstated

780
00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:38,800
its earnings

781
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:42,800
by nearly 2 billion over 7 years

782
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,800
independent investigators found that

783
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:47,440
toshiba had a corporate culture

784
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:50,079
in which management decisions could not

785
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:51,200
be challenged

786
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,520
and employees were pressured into

787
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:54,720
inappropriate

788
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:58,320
accounting by postponing loss reports

789
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:01,680
or move moving center certain loss

790
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:05,040
and costs into later years

791
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:07,359
another example probably one of the most

792
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:08,960
well known to date

793
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:12,400
and of course we can thank the birth of

794
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:15,440
stocks and many regulations since then

795
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:18,079
is the enron scandal the company

796
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:20,960
reportedly has had a go-go culture

797
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:23,680
in which senior officials cast aside

798
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:26,079
traditional business controls

799
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:28,880
it is possible that all of these

800
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:31,119
previously mentioned facts

801
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:35,359
were part of the reason why 86

802
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:38,640
of the participants of the 2014 world

803
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,480
economic forum survey

804
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:43,359
identified a crisis in leadership as the

805
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:45,200
world's most pressing issue

806
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:48,320
issue and 51

807
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:51,280
of the respondents of the 2018 world

808
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:53,040
economic forum survey

809
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:56,880
expected that the risk of authoritarian

810
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,480
leadership would increase

811
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:01,520
in 2019 william

812
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:04,560
h white an american organizational

813
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:07,359
analyst said that the single biggest

814
00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:08,160
problem

815
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:11,760
in communication is the illusion

816
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:16,000
that it has taken place

817
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:20,400
one of my first mentors said to me that

818
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:24,000
thinking is hard word that is why so few

819
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,760
people do it

820
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:29,040
char sparrow a famous sociologist

821
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,920
described today's world as a complex and

822
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,599
tight coupled system

823
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:36,640
in which even a small issue can cause

824
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:38,640
cascading effects

825
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:41,200
that is why it is so important to start

826
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,400
thinking again

827
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:45,680
and see the big picture vincent van gogh

828
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:46,640
said

829
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:49,760
that great things are done by a series

830
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:50,079
of

831
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:53,280
small things brought together vince

832
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,880
lombardi

833
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:57,359
a famous american football coach said

834
00:38:57,359 --> 00:38:58,240
that

835
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:00,880
the achievements of an organization are

836
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,800
the results of the combined

837
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:06,160
effort of each individual

838
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:09,359
you can say that these sentences

839
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:13,520
feel obvious or cliche but the fact is

840
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:17,440
that in our world and day-to-day work

841
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:20,720
we are doing the trim down blind sign

842
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:22,160
the downwork

843
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:25,760
of a whole we might not even oversee

844
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:28,320
even more and in many cases we don't

845
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,599
even realize this

846
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:32,880
but we should because in the i.t work

847
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:36,640
the renaissance was only 30 years ago

848
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:39,920
so why do i believe that it is an

849
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:43,280
art to be a cso because they

850
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,920
have to see the big picture understand

851
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,359
the engine room

852
00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:50,240
understand the fly deck and the

853
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:50,960
environment

854
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:54,000
the playing field as well speak their

855
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,400
respective languages and have the

856
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:59,359
ability to relay between these layers

857
00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:02,400
however security is

858
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,599
not even one-man show we are in this

859
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:06,720
both together

860
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:09,359
we are all responsible for the security

861
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:10,560
of tomorrow

862
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:13,440
the developer cannot say that i code

863
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,760
this because i always did that

864
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:18,960
in this way or because they didn't

865
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:19,599
specify

866
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:21,520
any security requirements why should i

867
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:24,400
care everyone should work together

868
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:27,680
do their part because a series of small

869
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:28,720
acts

870
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:31,520
from different divisions and laws can

871
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:32,319
produce

872
00:40:32,319 --> 00:40:34,720
a great deal and enhance security

873
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:36,960
overall

874
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:40,079
so it is not just the ceso who

875
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:43,119
has to do the art it is us

876
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:47,920
everyone who is listening to this

877
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:51,440
recording uh everyone who is

878
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:54,319
within this industry it is our shared

879
00:40:54,319 --> 00:40:56,160
responsibility towards

880
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:59,359
ourselves and towards each other as well

881
00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:01,680
like in the way we are responsible for

882
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:02,640
children

883
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:05,520
we are responsible for those one million

884
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:06,640
new children

885
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:09,440
those individuals who go online for

886
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:10,720
their first time

887
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:13,839
every day it is our responsibility to

888
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:14,560
develop

889
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:17,440
applications in a safe way secure by

890
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:18,160
design

891
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:20,800
and not just because of the regulatory

892
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,079
expectation

893
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:25,520
but because we understand that it is

894
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:29,200
in our best own interest as well

895
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:32,400
so if we'd like to see a better nicer

896
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,720
picture of security of tomorrow

897
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:37,119
we everyone who is listening to this

898
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:38,160
presentation

899
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:41,200
have the power we have the brushes in

900
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,760
our hands so let's start painting it

901
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:44,640
today

902
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:47,759
thank you very much
