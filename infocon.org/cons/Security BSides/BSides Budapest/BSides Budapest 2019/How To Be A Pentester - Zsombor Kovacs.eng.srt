1
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:09,920
so how do you become a seasoned IT

2
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:12,739
security professional this is one of the

3
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:16,610
questions I get asked many times when

4
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:18,890
people ask me what my job is when I'm

5
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:20,810
asked I usually respond something along

6
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:25,970
lines hey man I hack banks for a living

7
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:30,169
that's kinda cool and the next step

8
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:32,870
usually is oh man but how do you get

9
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:35,739
started so what are the first steps on

10
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:38,659
the way of the samurai so how the

11
00:00:35,739 --> 00:00:42,260
Stardust okay I have a general

12
00:00:38,659 --> 00:00:45,579
background on IT so how to start

13
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:50,260
pursuing a carry carrier in IT security

14
00:00:45,579 --> 00:00:53,839
so in this next 40 minutes I will try to

15
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:56,960
talk about the challenges presented in

16
00:00:53,839 --> 00:01:00,440
this regard and I will tell you a whole

17
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:03,440
bunch of things but these things are

18
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:06,380
basically my opinion so please feel free

19
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:09,590
to agree or disagree with me more than

20
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:14,270
happy to discuss my views with anyone

21
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:17,180
else who comes to me and the first thing

22
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:19,100
here the first lesson is that one a

23
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:21,470
master said once that don't believe

24
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:26,030
anyone anything so it it also applies to

25
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:28,370
these thoughts so please apply a grain

26
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:32,320
of salt to whatever I say and whatever

27
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:35,810
you'll be hearing or thinking okay so

28
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:43,039
let me tell you a little story first we

29
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:44,540
are in 1834 in France which is the most

30
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:48,260
develop one of the most developed

31
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:50,230
countries at the time and they have a

32
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:55,040
whole bunch of big cities they have

33
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:58,880
lively commercial life and the capital

34
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:00,740
is Paris as we know it and this the

35
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:03,320
other store the other place where the

36
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:07,179
story takes place is the picturesque

37
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:10,399
town of portal near the Atlantic Ocean

38
00:02:07,179 --> 00:02:13,160
Bordeaux is a huge commercial crossroads

39
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:15,770
at a time so there are many ships coming

40
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:18,740
annoying and there is a stock exchange

41
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:20,690
change which is used to transfer and

42
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:24,440
sell and buy goods which comes with

43
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:28,220
those shapes in order to communicate

44
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:32,329
with the military also post Umberto

45
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:35,060
there is certain communication network

46
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:38,300
between Paris and the major cities of

47
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:43,000
France as in Bordeaux

48
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:46,010
so this communication network was the

49
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,800
was like cutting-edge technology at the

50
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:52,160
time so we are talking about the early

51
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:54,860
19th century and the way this

52
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:58,490
communication network worked is what

53
00:02:54,860 --> 00:03:01,850
they call optical telegraph poles so as

54
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:07,430
you can see those are those things on

55
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:13,160
the top of this tower in the early 18th

56
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:14,990
century this was the the most this was

57
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:17,990
the top of this technology in France

58
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:21,470
they started to deploy these devices all

59
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:25,310
over France in the beginning of the 18th

60
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:28,250
century the 19th century saw him and

61
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:33,200
they had like 1500 of these all over

62
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:34,760
France how did these work so if you look

63
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:37,310
at the picture you see that there are

64
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:39,590
these rods on the top of this building

65
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:43,070
and these what could be turned into

66
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:47,060
various positions depending on the

67
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:49,519
signal they want to transmit and the way

68
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:52,850
this this was like a one single old post

69
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:56,690
and that was like network of these the

70
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:59,840
way the word imagine that someone from

71
00:03:56,690 --> 00:04:03,440
Paris tries to trust with the signal to

72
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:06,380
Bordeaux they had the first old post

73
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:08,840
near Paris they set up the control rods

74
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:10,880
according to the signal and the

75
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:13,370
neighboring station which was in

76
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:16,760
eyesight of the previous one they just

77
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:22,010
used a good pair of binoculars and the

78
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:25,520
next station manager just adjusts the

79
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:29,030
rod on their old post just like they saw

80
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:29,889
on the previous one so this one time all

81
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:34,169
the way to bore

82
00:04:29,889 --> 00:04:38,919
and this was quite cool at the time

83
00:04:34,169 --> 00:04:41,258
according to transcript in good

84
00:04:38,919 --> 00:04:44,438
conditions like when there was like good

85
00:04:41,259 --> 00:04:47,439
visibility signal could reach 500

86
00:04:44,439 --> 00:04:51,789
kilometres an hour from Paris to

87
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:53,860
Bordeaux this is like this means that it

88
00:04:51,789 --> 00:04:56,560
was possible to get a signal from one

89
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:58,719
end of the country to the other in just

90
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:03,009
one hour which is kind of cool we are

91
00:04:58,719 --> 00:05:06,279
talking about 18th 19th century so the

92
00:05:03,009 --> 00:05:08,379
most widespread way of transporting

93
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:10,840
information was using careers and

94
00:05:08,379 --> 00:05:16,000
messengers at the time this was quite

95
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:19,810
cool how did the protocol work so in

96
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:22,539
order to introduce some kind of error

97
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:27,099
protection in the protocol implemented

98
00:05:22,539 --> 00:05:30,669
by these optical telegraph poles there

99
00:05:27,099 --> 00:05:33,219
was a station in the town of talk some

100
00:05:30,669 --> 00:05:37,508
way between it's around halfway between

101
00:05:33,219 --> 00:05:41,319
Paris and Bordeaux and there was there

102
00:05:37,509 --> 00:05:44,500
was a guy in that control tower who had

103
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:48,039
a code book which allowed him to

104
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:50,349
actually decipher the message the signal

105
00:05:48,039 --> 00:05:53,169
that was being transferred this was like

106
00:05:50,349 --> 00:05:55,659
a privileged thing as normal

107
00:05:53,169 --> 00:05:57,789
telegraph operators did not have a clue

108
00:05:55,659 --> 00:06:00,159
about what kind of signals they are

109
00:05:57,789 --> 00:06:01,810
transmitting so it was possible to

110
00:06:00,159 --> 00:06:04,479
introduce some kind of error protection

111
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:08,229
there so this man that the station

112
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:10,560
manager into checked whether the signal

113
00:06:08,229 --> 00:06:14,020
made sense and if it did he just

114
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:15,849
continued the transmission to the other

115
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:18,430
end of the country otherwise he sent a

116
00:06:15,849 --> 00:06:20,199
message back the line saying that please

117
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:21,089
repeat the signal because this makes no

118
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:24,520
sense

119
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:26,409
this was this was kind of cool and this

120
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:29,378
was as I said cutting-edge technology at

121
00:06:26,409 --> 00:06:33,279
the time this was used a similar system

122
00:06:29,379 --> 00:06:36,189
was used in also in Britain and also in

123
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:40,599
the Russian Empire which which was kind

124
00:06:36,189 --> 00:06:43,260
of interesting alright so the signal

125
00:06:40,599 --> 00:06:46,380
chain used two kinds of signals

126
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:49,020
one signal was for like normal

127
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:52,920
information transform thing so this

128
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:56,460
meant that the control roads were

129
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:59,370
adjusted to positions and what that

130
00:06:56,460 --> 00:07:02,010
signal meant was known according was

131
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:04,800
deciphered based on a code book which

132
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:07,620
was in Paris and also in the old posts

133
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:10,050
in Bordeaux and as I said the station

134
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:12,570
manager the to station also had that

135
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:14,690
code book with him but non no one else

136
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:17,219
did it

137
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:20,240
besides these normal signals

138
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:23,310
there were also control signal control

139
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:26,640
signals which was like meta characters

140
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:30,600
in this protocol this month that should

141
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:33,210
be an error in the transmission should

142
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:38,760
there will should there be an operator

143
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:40,770
error in the transmitted message the the

144
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:43,349
control signals were used to signal that

145
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:45,030
please repeat the transmission or do

146
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:46,220
something else according to what the

147
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:50,070
problem was

148
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:53,190
this was as we see the nuclear weapon of

149
00:07:50,070 --> 00:08:00,390
the telecommunications at the time but

150
00:07:53,190 --> 00:08:04,350
as we see an operation of 1800 telegraph

151
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:07,200
poles with officials and shifts and that

152
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:09,960
kind of stuff was quite expensive as a

153
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:11,840
result these telecommunication systems

154
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:14,599
was reserved for government use and

155
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:17,700
government use and military is only so

156
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:20,100
civilians were not able not allowed to

157
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:23,450
actually use this network so they were

158
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:27,570
still relying on messengers and careers

159
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:29,070
all right so we have this communication

160
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:31,310
telecommunications network we see the

161
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:34,260
protocol we see the infrastructure and

162
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:38,789
this was the infrastructure which was

163
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:42,059
affected by the first recorded attempt

164
00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:43,469
on cyberattack and as we call as I think

165
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:46,170
we would call it the signal chain

166
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:50,100
piggybacking kind of thing but to see

167
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:53,250
how this worked later on so we have two

168
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:56,880
people two brothers in the picturesque

169
00:08:53,250 --> 00:09:02,360
town of Bordeaux they were called in

170
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:06,000
for my lovely French Francois and maybe

171
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:09,930
Yusuf blonde they were too stock clerks

172
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:12,660
man the Board of Stock Exchange and they

173
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:14,750
wanted to make money and they actually

174
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:18,500
came up with a brilliant idea how to

175
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:22,410
abuse this optical telegraph systems for

176
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:25,110
their purpose so what they plan was that

177
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:29,280
they had a colleague in the Paris Stock

178
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:31,200
Exchange which was the center of all the

179
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:33,480
stock exchanges all over France so

180
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,820
whatever happened in the Paris Stock

181
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:39,660
Exchange had a significant effect on

182
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:43,650
everywhere else so this meant that the

183
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:45,540
brothers ask this person to communicate

184
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:48,630
the movements of the Paris Stock

185
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:52,380
Exchange to a bribed a telegraph

186
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:55,860
operator of the tool so this month that

187
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:59,640
the colleague sent messengers to this

188
00:09:55,860 --> 00:10:01,680
store telegram operators literally after

189
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:04,500
every significant move of the stock

190
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:07,020
exchange and this bright telegraph

191
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:11,150
operator introduced a false signal in

192
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:11,150
the signal flow this meant that he

193
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:18,599
included a custom signal which had no

194
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:22,820
meaning in its original context but had

195
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:26,160
meaning for the brothers in Bordeaux and

196
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:28,590
subsequently of course this signal broke

197
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:31,880
the official the original communication

198
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:35,430
flow and in order to correct his mistake

199
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:37,350
he introduced a oops sorry I screwed up

200
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:40,050
operator error please ignore the lost

201
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:42,570
signal signal after the introduced one

202
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:48,719
and these two signals went all the lines

203
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:51,960
to Bordeaux and since the fixed signals

204
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:54,360
were only recorded this entire attack

205
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:59,000
went out of the books so no one really

206
00:10:54,360 --> 00:11:02,700
understood what was going on but the

207
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:05,910
inserted signal actually made sense to

208
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:10,350
the people in Bordeaux who were who had

209
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:12,500
keen eyes on for signals so what does

210
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:12,500
this

211
00:11:12,509 --> 00:11:20,480
we have the distance of Paris to

212
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:23,639
Bordeaux around 600 kilometers and the

213
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:27,779
distance between Paris in to 230

214
00:11:23,639 --> 00:11:30,029
kilometres this meant that a good 400

215
00:11:27,779 --> 00:11:34,019
kilometers was shortcut

216
00:11:30,029 --> 00:11:36,149
using this method this meant that the

217
00:11:34,019 --> 00:11:39,740
Telegraph Oh due to this telegraph

218
00:11:36,149 --> 00:11:42,329
operator hack the brothers were able to

219
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:44,879
get notified about the Paris Stock

220
00:11:42,329 --> 00:11:48,748
Exchange movements days before everyone

221
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:51,300
else which is kind of cool and they make

222
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:53,550
they made a whole bunch of money using

223
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:55,618
this thing the plan worked and they've

224
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:59,699
been reusing the Telegraph network for

225
00:11:55,619 --> 00:12:03,449
almost two years in the 1830s using this

226
00:11:59,699 --> 00:12:04,790
method so they were quite successful of

227
00:12:03,449 --> 00:12:08,128
course in the end they were caught

228
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:11,219
because they bribed the telegraph

229
00:12:08,129 --> 00:12:14,509
operator was sick called in sick and he

230
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:19,709
tried to notify the other guy who

231
00:12:14,509 --> 00:12:21,959
substitute him about this in incorrect

232
00:12:19,709 --> 00:12:24,599
use of the signalling protocol and that

233
00:12:21,959 --> 00:12:28,170
other of that other person reported them

234
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:30,240
so the brothers were caught but

235
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:34,979
interestingly they were put on a trial

236
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:38,999
and lost in France at the time did not

237
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:42,660
make custom proprietary use of the

238
00:12:38,999 --> 00:12:45,120
optical Telegraph network in legal so as

239
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:47,579
it turned out they were condemned but

240
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,389
since having no laws against this kind

241
00:12:47,579 --> 00:12:51,959
of activity

242
00:12:48,389 --> 00:12:54,649
they were only asked to pay the cost of

243
00:12:51,959 --> 00:12:58,199
the trial so they want home scot-free

244
00:12:54,649 --> 00:13:01,290
and also they were the first hackers in

245
00:12:58,199 --> 00:13:03,089
human recorded history who abused a

246
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:04,860
common telecommunications network for

247
00:13:03,089 --> 00:13:10,529
their own purposes which is kind of cool

248
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:14,459
I think so I love this story because it

249
00:13:10,529 --> 00:13:16,399
illustrates a very important point with

250
00:13:14,459 --> 00:13:21,209
hackers and hacker mentality and that's

251
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:23,279
that's what the point of this talk is of

252
00:13:21,209 --> 00:13:24,510
course I'm trying to ignore ethical

253
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:26,490
concerns here

254
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:28,950
for a moment and focus only on the

255
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:32,279
mechanism and the underlying philosophy

256
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:35,880
what they followed so firstly we are

257
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:38,070
talking about two dudes who had a

258
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:41,040
general understanding how the optical

259
00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:43,890
Telegraph networks work and they also

260
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:46,680
knew about this signalling protocol they

261
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:49,470
realized how they can use the human

262
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:53,339
element to abuse this protocol for their

263
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:55,500
own good and they they did they actually

264
00:13:53,339 --> 00:13:59,160
did it quite well and the second thing

265
00:13:55,500 --> 00:14:01,770
which I find really appealing in this in

266
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:04,829
a cyber attack let's call it that is

267
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:10,500
that the whole thing went unnoticed

268
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:12,870
because the the log protocol ignored

269
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:15,660
wrong signals so that's that's cool

270
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:17,940
because log entries were free of their

271
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:20,939
interval introduced signals and that's

272
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:25,230
that's kind of cool so any backspace

273
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:28,770
message was absent from the locks so

274
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:32,160
let's talk about mentality here being a

275
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:34,500
hacker I think in my opinion it means a

276
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:38,219
certain type of mental approach it's a

277
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:42,480
unique point of view to me hackers are

278
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:45,240
the most curious species of the world

279
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:48,240
they try to understand how things do

280
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:51,630
things work and how they can use things

281
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:54,350
for something that the inventor of those

282
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:56,490
things would have never dreamed about

283
00:14:54,350 --> 00:15:01,050
they try to understand everything they

284
00:14:56,490 --> 00:15:02,700
can as as I think everyone shares this

285
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:06,150
everyone wants to understand the world

286
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:08,089
around them this this might sound quite

287
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:12,689
philosophical but it will get very

288
00:15:08,089 --> 00:15:15,810
practical how many of you have tried to

289
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:19,910
use desktop Linux at one point or

290
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:23,310
another just raise hand show hands who

291
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:27,630
all I think almost half of the audience

292
00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:29,750
has try that so I've been using desktop

293
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:34,320
lublin tools in one form or another or

294
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:36,930
for almost five years and this meant

295
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:38,090
that I had a whole bunch of problems all

296
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:41,060
along the way

297
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:43,640
like unprecedented challenges anytime

298
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:48,979
anywhere there's no guarantee that

299
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:51,260
anything will work at any point which it

300
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:53,240
is really hard to explain to anyone why

301
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:55,100
this actually makes any sense because

302
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:57,590
what they see that you are struggling

303
00:15:55,100 --> 00:16:00,410
with the computer all the time and that

304
00:15:57,590 --> 00:16:02,540
damn thing doesn't work and when it

305
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:06,980
breaks down it breaks down at the worst

306
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:09,760
possible time so I really enjoyed those

307
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:13,490
times because I at some point I

308
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:16,100
understood how the thing worked and I

309
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:19,370
could fix it whenever it went wrong and

310
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:22,250
there's one thing I never had in

311
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:24,500
associate in in association with my

312
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:27,320
computer that is fear I was never afraid

313
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:27,890
that what the hell will go wrong with

314
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:31,010
that thing

315
00:16:27,890 --> 00:16:36,140
because if it went wrong I knew how to

316
00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:38,920
fix it if it went really well you know

317
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:42,020
you had that feeling when use trying to

318
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:44,569
install some new features new kernel

319
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:46,010
maybe and you will sit at the end of the

320
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:48,200
day in a couple of hours you will sit in

321
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:50,900
front of a blinking grub risk you shell

322
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:54,130
in front of your computer trying to make

323
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:56,300
the thing work again and I'm pretty sure

324
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:59,060
anyone who has tried to use desktop

325
00:16:56,300 --> 00:17:02,870
Linux has that experience and knows how

326
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:05,899
to kill his machine or how to reinstall

327
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:08,210
for that matter really quickly so and

328
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:11,690
that's it's really cool because it takes

329
00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:15,470
a critical element into the picture that

330
00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:18,410
is understanding so if if I understand

331
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:20,960
how the computer works I will stop being

332
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:23,810
American Sumer of that computer and

333
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:26,450
merkins humor of IT so this is this what

334
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:29,690
this means is that I understand how the

335
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:31,910
things work and I know how to fix them

336
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:34,610
when they go wrong and I think this was

337
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:37,100
the the ancient meaning of the word

338
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:40,340
hacker before the whole cyber security

339
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:43,909
kevin Mitnick thing came around so these

340
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:46,340
are the dudes who take whatever they

341
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:50,240
have in their garden sheds and be at

342
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:51,770
something of those things that's that's

343
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:54,920
really nice

344
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:57,940
looking at the word having having a

345
00:17:54,920 --> 00:18:01,100
whole bunch of opportunities around us

346
00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:03,590
alright and the next next question which

347
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:07,219
comes to mind how to have to become one

348
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:10,040
how to become the one how to start this

349
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:14,110
whole thing so first and foremost I

350
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:17,570
think to me being being a hacker is

351
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:19,879
having a unique point of view unique

352
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:23,870
perspective of the world so it's really

353
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:26,210
interesting to talk and walk around in

354
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:28,850
the city for instance with with a couple

355
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:32,059
of penetration tester dudes I did it

356
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:36,139
many times and we made fun of ourselves

357
00:18:32,059 --> 00:18:38,928
by talking about what we look 1 what we

358
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:43,160
see when we look around for instance in

359
00:18:38,929 --> 00:18:45,710
in one case we want to to have lunch

360
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:47,900
with a client and as we were walking

361
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:50,570
from the office to the place where we

362
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:53,740
had lunch it was in in Zurich it was in

363
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:56,780
Switzerland and the place was near the

364
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:58,400
near the main train station and there

365
00:18:56,780 --> 00:19:01,990
were literally thousands of bicycles

366
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:06,080
attached to this bicycle storage areas

367
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:09,110
near that station and as we all were

368
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:10,610
like keen bicyclists we were looking at

369
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:12,740
the bikes and it's often and that's

370
00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:16,370
that's very cool it's really cool and as

371
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:18,500
it turned out that guy the client was

372
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:20,659
looking at the bikes themselves and the

373
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:23,030
pentesting team was looking at how those

374
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:25,190
bikes were locked so we're looking at

375
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:26,600
locks not the bikes themselves which is

376
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:28,520
really funny because we're looking the

377
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:32,389
same thing but we were focusing on

378
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:35,480
completely different aspects so this

379
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:38,150
basically is the kind of curiousness

380
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:40,550
about the world around me and it's

381
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:45,260
really really interesting to see the

382
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:49,010
world this way so one of the first

383
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:50,990
lessons I learned when when trying to

384
00:19:49,010 --> 00:19:53,210
work as a penetration tester and walking

385
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:57,920
around in different areas and different

386
00:19:53,210 --> 00:20:01,130
companies was that many times hackers

387
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:05,160
don't have to do anything with IT so

388
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:07,919
this means that even though

389
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:10,590
even though most of the hacking type

390
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:13,380
activities is associated with the IT

391
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:15,480
security and probably by financial gain

392
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:16,679
and defacing websites and all this kind

393
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:19,770
of stuff

394
00:20:16,679 --> 00:20:22,380
many of these hackers are not working in

395
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:24,929
IT security they just work somewhere

396
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:28,200
else for instance when I was working in

397
00:20:24,929 --> 00:20:30,210
London I met a girl and she was an

398
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:35,120
investigative journalist from Denmark

399
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:38,610
and as it turned out her this is was to

400
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:41,699
arrange a face-to-face interview with

401
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:45,149
Denmark's most wanted drug lords at the

402
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:46,470
time and he was on the run it was being

403
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:49,500
on the run from the police

404
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:51,179
when she arranged that interview with

405
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:54,330
the guy and there's a very interesting

406
00:20:51,179 --> 00:20:57,570
because as she told me how she get there

407
00:20:54,330 --> 00:21:00,530
how she get that person t4 referring to

408
00:20:57,570 --> 00:21:03,780
you it turned out that she was pursuing

409
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:06,450
the driven by the same motives as I was

410
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:11,190
even though she was not she had nothing

411
00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:13,890
to do with IT security and she had this

412
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:15,960
tendency of talking her way out of

413
00:21:13,890 --> 00:21:19,940
everything every every tight situation

414
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:23,909
of his tight corner it was funny because

415
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:27,720
after we met she actually applied for a

416
00:21:23,909 --> 00:21:30,210
pen tester company and she became the

417
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:34,830
social engineer expert so this kind of

418
00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:40,289
cool and as I heard she happens to be

419
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:44,939
one of the best alright so the next step

420
00:21:40,289 --> 00:21:49,710
in the next lesson is is how to learn

421
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:52,740
this kind of approach to the world so IT

422
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:54,179
security and hacking is as huge as the

423
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:56,400
world as the rest of the world as

424
00:21:54,179 --> 00:21:59,549
everything can be hacked at some point

425
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:02,760
or will be at some point therefore it is

426
00:21:59,549 --> 00:22:04,889
impossible to say that anyone is an

427
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:08,129
expert on anything I talk to a lot of

428
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:11,130
guys who were really cool in one field

429
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:14,780
or another but there is but none of them

430
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:17,370
called themselves an expert even though

431
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:17,700
even though they were really good in

432
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:19,649
those

433
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:25,440
things but Jesus didn't call themselves

434
00:22:19,649 --> 00:22:27,600
an expert so in order to get started I

435
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:32,549
think there is a couple of fields which

436
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:35,519
need to be learned when trying to pursue

437
00:22:32,549 --> 00:22:37,889
a career in 96

438
00:22:35,519 --> 00:22:41,100
I will talk about those with more on

439
00:22:37,889 --> 00:22:44,070
that later and the gimmick is that many

440
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:46,070
more often or not by the end of the day

441
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:50,600
we will have a better understanding of

442
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:53,490
the technology or that particular system

443
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:57,570
than those guys who actually built that

444
00:22:53,490 --> 00:22:59,940
system and that especially is true for

445
00:22:57,570 --> 00:23:02,760
penetration testing and system testing

446
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:06,720
assignments where developers operator

447
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:09,360
just SLC guys they have huge blind spots

448
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:13,139
so there are areas which they don't know

449
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:15,418
about what we do because we go and we

450
00:23:13,139 --> 00:23:17,789
went there and tested the whole thing so

451
00:23:15,419 --> 00:23:19,500
this means that by the end of the day we

452
00:23:17,789 --> 00:23:22,320
will have a clearer picture about what

453
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:25,100
they see then actually they do and this

454
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:29,399
this might lead to you really funny

455
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:32,699
situations for instance in one occasion

456
00:23:29,399 --> 00:23:36,199
I had a job when I had to test an iOS

457
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:38,789
application and well it was it was a

458
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:42,240
pile of crap from a crypto point of view

459
00:23:38,789 --> 00:23:44,580
and we sent the whole thing back to the

460
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:48,620
developer guys and they did a quick fix

461
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:52,080
on the problems but it was bugging and

462
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:54,209
it was us who helped them debug their

463
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:56,490
code even though we didn't have their

464
00:23:54,210 --> 00:23:59,100
code but we could have them because we

465
00:23:56,490 --> 00:24:04,049
had the entire thing going on in either

466
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:08,340
Pro and so what's going on okay and I

467
00:24:04,049 --> 00:24:12,330
think and an idea of a note on learning

468
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:16,260
which is this cost me quite a bit of a

469
00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:19,678
headache one when I got started so this

470
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:22,289
means that learning is not a theory

471
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:23,760
thing so you have to do it in practice

472
00:24:22,289 --> 00:24:26,129
whatever you learn try to do it in

473
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:28,830
practice so there is a difference

474
00:24:26,129 --> 00:24:31,439
between theoretically having knowledge

475
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:33,480
about something and struggling

476
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:35,580
your way through that particular attack

477
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:40,710
or beginning of that particular

478
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:43,769
environment so this means that in order

479
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:46,080
to replicate any kind of attack you have

480
00:24:43,769 --> 00:24:48,330
to fight your way through the whole

481
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:50,519
thing like you have to build up the

482
00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:53,580
environment learn how that thing work

483
00:24:50,519 --> 00:24:55,769
how to configure those things more often

484
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:59,879
than not you will have to take in

485
00:24:55,769 --> 00:25:03,149
manuals and anything that allows you to

486
00:24:59,879 --> 00:25:07,320
build that environment which the attack

487
00:25:03,149 --> 00:25:09,768
will live in and this this will result

488
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:12,539
in a quite deep knowledge about that

489
00:25:09,769 --> 00:25:15,899
particular area this this can be even a

490
00:25:12,539 --> 00:25:19,370
piece of architecture a piece of

491
00:25:15,899 --> 00:25:22,350
infrastructure an operating system

492
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:25,439
database manager or whatever that

493
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:27,990
doesn't really matter what it is

494
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:30,539
there are a couple of things which which

495
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:33,149
which are essential for instance how

496
00:25:30,539 --> 00:25:36,330
networks work and how networking works

497
00:25:33,149 --> 00:25:38,699
that that's one of the key areas which

498
00:25:36,330 --> 00:25:40,649
need which no matter what you do and no

499
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:43,940
matter what your field of interest is

500
00:25:40,649 --> 00:25:47,070
you have to know how networks work also

501
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:48,299
there's a really need there's a really

502
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:50,730
deep need for understanding how

503
00:25:48,299 --> 00:25:52,830
operating systems work and this is the

504
00:25:50,730 --> 00:25:56,789
point where having a desktop linux

505
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:59,009
around gives a really significant

506
00:25:56,789 --> 00:26:01,980
advantage on anyone who has struggled

507
00:25:59,009 --> 00:26:08,929
their way through trying to live with

508
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:11,970
the desktop Linux also this is there's a

509
00:26:08,929 --> 00:26:15,480
question that pops to mind where are

510
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:19,409
where is this all learn thought which

511
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:22,409
school should I take I think that's not

512
00:26:19,409 --> 00:26:24,690
the question of which school to take I

513
00:26:22,409 --> 00:26:27,320
think it's the question of how to

514
00:26:24,690 --> 00:26:30,840
approach IT and IT security in general

515
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:31,710
so there are places where you can

516
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:34,139
actually learn stuff

517
00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:37,590
Andy so these are like certificates

518
00:26:34,139 --> 00:26:40,559
certifications which which can be handy

519
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:42,959
sometimes so in my opinion there are two

520
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:48,020
kinds of certs the one

521
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:51,990
gets you through hey char and that's it

522
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:53,760
they are really they come with really

523
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:57,390
thick books you have to learn those

524
00:26:53,760 --> 00:27:01,379
books tick some boxes on an exam and if

525
00:26:57,390 --> 00:27:04,640
you have it your H your CV will be put

526
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:08,460
on the top of the pile by HR people

527
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:11,000
other certs however they actually give

528
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:13,740
you the opportunity to struggle which

529
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:15,750
which is another way of saying they give

530
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:17,010
you knowledge but I prefer the saying

531
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:21,620
that you have to struggle your way

532
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:25,549
through the through the exam and through

533
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:29,120
the syllabus all the time

534
00:27:25,549 --> 00:27:32,370
there is a common misconception about

535
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:34,620
certifications like many many of my

536
00:27:32,370 --> 00:27:38,250
friends say that all men do is all dude

537
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:42,029
these are really expensive things and my

538
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:43,740
employer won't pay for them well I think

539
00:27:42,029 --> 00:27:46,860
if you are interested in you want to

540
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:49,919
perceive your career you probably should

541
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:54,330
purchase those search for yourself pay

542
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:57,240
for yourself eye for mind visually I

543
00:27:54,330 --> 00:28:02,129
think all my certificates were paid by

544
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:05,480
myself so when I was between jobs I said

545
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:08,760
okay I will spare month or two before my

546
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:11,190
certification and spend most of my time

547
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:13,649
trying to learn and fight my way through

548
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:15,659
the exam and that was kind of cool I

549
00:28:13,649 --> 00:28:18,979
think this this kind of works because I

550
00:28:15,659 --> 00:28:21,600
had to I had time to digest the

551
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:26,159
materials and to learn how to actually

552
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:30,480
fight my way through the exam but this

553
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:32,730
that's not a necessity something that is

554
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:36,480
for free but it only costs some time is

555
00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:39,120
watching conference talks when I was at

556
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:42,929
my first workplace I spent literally

557
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:44,760
hours every week watch just watching

558
00:28:42,929 --> 00:28:49,409
security conferences and watching talks

559
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:51,809
of much smarter people than me and that

560
00:28:49,409 --> 00:28:55,110
also that gave me a whole bunch of ideas

561
00:28:51,809 --> 00:28:56,820
for instance I learned many things many

562
00:28:55,110 --> 00:29:00,360
fields that I never knew that

563
00:28:56,820 --> 00:29:02,730
even existed and I had the keywords to

564
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:05,969
google them and the tools to start

565
00:29:02,730 --> 00:29:09,210
playing around late but the other day

566
00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:12,149
what this gave to me was a general

567
00:29:09,210 --> 00:29:14,309
understanding what is interesting for me

568
00:29:12,149 --> 00:29:17,178
so I was really interested in everything

569
00:29:14,309 --> 00:29:20,610
that is invisible so I was interested in

570
00:29:17,179 --> 00:29:23,070
hacking radio networks playing around

571
00:29:20,610 --> 00:29:27,600
with Wi-Fi Bluetooth that kind of stuff

572
00:29:23,070 --> 00:29:29,370
and I was I'm really grateful to those

573
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:32,389
guys who did the hard work and the

574
00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:39,539
research for me and they only needed to

575
00:29:32,389 --> 00:29:42,449
to stand on the shoulders okay but this

576
00:29:39,539 --> 00:29:47,399
is all still theory in order to get

577
00:29:42,450 --> 00:29:49,529
things into practice as CTF games this

578
00:29:47,399 --> 00:29:51,389
capture-the-flag competitions which are

579
00:29:49,529 --> 00:29:53,730
one of the easiest and most popular way

580
00:29:51,389 --> 00:29:56,330
of trying your claws on actual

581
00:29:53,730 --> 00:29:59,940
infrastructure and actual applications

582
00:29:56,330 --> 00:30:02,549
these city of games provide you with the

583
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:06,450
safe environment to try that's that's

584
00:30:02,549 --> 00:30:09,840
kind of cool many of these CTF games are

585
00:30:06,450 --> 00:30:12,419
associated with different security

586
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:15,928
conferences but many of these are

587
00:30:12,419 --> 00:30:18,179
available all year long like there's an

588
00:30:15,929 --> 00:30:20,730
aggregator sites for these like I think

589
00:30:18,179 --> 00:30:22,019
it's a child that Matt that's the just a

590
00:30:20,730 --> 00:30:24,330
name of the site but there's a whole

591
00:30:22,019 --> 00:30:27,779
bunch of those just google them many of

592
00:30:24,330 --> 00:30:30,990
these give you a VPN connection if you I

593
00:30:27,779 --> 00:30:32,399
want to try to hack windows boxes the

594
00:30:30,990 --> 00:30:35,129
news boxes they have always bunch of

595
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:38,209
those lying around and you can try your

596
00:30:35,129 --> 00:30:40,559
favorite tools on them also

597
00:30:38,210 --> 00:30:42,809
alternatively you can go and create your

598
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:46,700
own test labs which will be a necessity

599
00:30:42,809 --> 00:30:48,750
at some point or another but thankfully

600
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:51,059
VMware virtual box and all these

601
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:54,059
virtualization software is for free so

602
00:30:51,059 --> 00:30:59,610
there is no problem investing in some

603
00:30:54,059 --> 00:31:02,090
boxes and popping them should you be

604
00:30:59,610 --> 00:31:06,120
interested in mobile application hacking

605
00:31:02,090 --> 00:31:10,620
and hacking Android or iOS applications

606
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:12,989
in general there is a way of is

607
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:15,239
following a custom rom on your phone we

608
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:18,809
feel heaven I enjoyed if you're an

609
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:21,510
Android user this will also introduce

610
00:31:18,809 --> 00:31:23,520
you to a whole new level of challenges

611
00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:24,840
when it comes to struggling with your

612
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:28,290
infrastructure sir

613
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:33,750
I already call that I was running

614
00:31:28,290 --> 00:31:36,600
CyanogenMod on my galaxy and I think we

615
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:38,190
had some some vacation in in in the

616
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:42,389
Canary Islands and we were cycling

617
00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:46,530
around a lot and as I recall I try I was

618
00:31:42,390 --> 00:31:49,650
trying a new kernel on my galaxy but as

619
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:52,920
it turned out it started overheating the

620
00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:56,850
phone so when I was like making pictures

621
00:31:52,920 --> 00:32:00,720
and cycling around in Gran Canaria I had

622
00:31:56,850 --> 00:32:03,360
I had to touch my phone every 30 35

623
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:06,179
seconds to say is it hot is it hot no no

624
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:07,860
no no and what as it turned out that yes

625
00:32:06,179 --> 00:32:11,190
this is the overheating problem with the

626
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:13,889
kernel I had to do an Android backup

627
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:15,929
restore while I was still cycling I

628
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:18,890
don't recommend anyone to do that

629
00:32:15,929 --> 00:32:21,510
because that's obviously cut your

630
00:32:18,890 --> 00:32:24,059
potential to use your phone but it's a

631
00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:27,150
great way to learn how Android works and

632
00:32:24,059 --> 00:32:30,178
it's a great way to learn how to fix

633
00:32:27,150 --> 00:32:33,510
Android when it breaks what's that's

634
00:32:30,179 --> 00:32:36,870
kind of cool and there's this thing

635
00:32:33,510 --> 00:32:39,510
called it's not my term pretty sure many

636
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:43,139
of you have heard it it's called try

637
00:32:39,510 --> 00:32:45,629
harder and this means this is this an

638
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:49,350
approach the willingness to struggle to

639
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:52,230
try harder I think there's a there's a

640
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:57,120
there's a brilliant Hungarian word for

641
00:32:52,230 --> 00:32:59,880
for this it is called C bash I asked a

642
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:02,129
couple of native English speakers say

643
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:04,280
that what what how do you translate this

644
00:33:02,130 --> 00:33:07,770
into English and as it turned out

645
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:09,450
there's hardly and an equivalent for

646
00:33:07,770 --> 00:33:12,450
this word in English the closest thing

647
00:33:09,450 --> 00:33:17,940
you can get is struggling for which

648
00:33:12,450 --> 00:33:20,070
expresses the the minuscule scale of

649
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:23,270
results compared to the efforts you have

650
00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:28,399
to put in so

651
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:31,580
a little story for this one when I was

652
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:34,250
tasked to gear up and train a mobile

653
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:36,710
penetration testing team for one of the

654
00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:40,370
plan test companies here in Hungary I

655
00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:43,910
was like super excited and I made and I

656
00:33:40,370 --> 00:33:45,409
said that I will make a whole bunch of

657
00:33:43,910 --> 00:33:49,480
really hard challenges for those guys

658
00:33:45,410 --> 00:33:55,429
and I made a couple of dozen

659
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:59,540
applications which were of variety culty

660
00:33:55,429 --> 00:34:02,480
but the point was to hack them and as it

661
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:04,850
turned out I gave them to you guys and

662
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:07,190
as it turned out that they had problems

663
00:34:04,850 --> 00:34:08,899
of course they have problems because

664
00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:12,320
they knew they didn't know anything so I

665
00:34:08,899 --> 00:34:15,080
give them books they still came back to

666
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:19,369
me that I'll hey we can't do this it's

667
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:21,500
too hard I started to give them more

668
00:34:19,369 --> 00:34:23,450
books more talks I showed them how to

669
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:27,770
fix those how to hack those applications

670
00:34:23,449 --> 00:34:29,779
and and if they it took time it took a

671
00:34:27,770 --> 00:34:34,480
lot of time and effort but eventually

672
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:38,000
they get got a hang of it so they they

673
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:41,570
started to be better and better and I

674
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:45,859
think by the end of the training process

675
00:34:41,570 --> 00:34:49,639
they were really good and and I thought

676
00:34:45,859 --> 00:34:52,190
well well I could maybe I could do a

677
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:56,480
little shortcut on this process so I

678
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:59,180
started writing tutorials for those for

679
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:01,880
the most crucial steps and I thought

680
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:03,830
that okay these tutorials will make

681
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:06,830
things much easier and much quicker to

682
00:35:03,830 --> 00:35:11,029
learn but as it turned out it didn't

683
00:35:06,830 --> 00:35:14,240
because the guys the new rookies who

684
00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:19,130
were the juniors at the time they were

685
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:21,770
following my tutorials but they were not

686
00:35:19,130 --> 00:35:23,570
able to replicate those steps in real

687
00:35:21,770 --> 00:35:25,910
applications when they had to tweak

688
00:35:23,570 --> 00:35:29,720
things around a bit so as it turned out

689
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:32,210
I came to the conclusion that the

690
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:36,919
struggling bit is inevitable so the more

691
00:35:32,210 --> 00:35:39,020
you struggle the more it

692
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:41,299
possible for you to learn whatever it

693
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:43,700
takes to hack an application and this

694
00:35:41,299 --> 00:35:47,299
bit I think unfortunately it's

695
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:50,328
inevitable but I'm happy to discuss the

696
00:35:47,299 --> 00:35:54,170
question from from a tutorial point of

697
00:35:50,329 --> 00:35:58,309
view so the conclusion is that you have

698
00:35:54,170 --> 00:36:01,940
to have to try harder so when asked what

699
00:35:58,309 --> 00:36:03,650
the most important question my most

700
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:06,950
important skill of a pen tester or

701
00:36:03,650 --> 00:36:09,619
wannabe penetration tester is is this

702
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:12,078
thing the willingness to try harder and

703
00:36:09,619 --> 00:36:20,240
to struggle their way through the

704
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:23,539
process okay so as I said what kind of

705
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:26,390
IT degree or degree for that matter you

706
00:36:23,539 --> 00:36:29,599
make it's kind of irrelevant so the

707
00:36:26,390 --> 00:36:32,868
whole thing is that you have to be just

708
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:36,470
simply interested in what you want to do

709
00:36:32,869 --> 00:36:39,289
and have this mindset to the willing to

710
00:36:36,470 --> 00:36:42,109
struggle and that's what's the most

711
00:36:39,289 --> 00:36:45,680
important thing is not the school where

712
00:36:42,109 --> 00:36:50,960
you really blow minds from also it's

713
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:54,259
it's also a team afford so hackers are

714
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:57,230
famous for for the community approach so

715
00:36:54,260 --> 00:37:01,069
it's not a single player game virtually

716
00:36:57,230 --> 00:37:04,010
every pen testing team I work for had a

717
00:37:01,069 --> 00:37:07,730
vertical test our team and we built a

718
00:37:04,010 --> 00:37:11,510
nice environment around us and this made

719
00:37:07,730 --> 00:37:13,900
a pleasant and liveable working

720
00:37:11,510 --> 00:37:18,589
condition but it's it all boils down to

721
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:22,160
to being in a team also a couple of

722
00:37:18,589 --> 00:37:24,770
quick advices it's completely ok to firm

723
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:27,710
the willingness to struggle also means

724
00:37:24,770 --> 00:37:30,470
that you will fail a lot many many times

725
00:37:27,710 --> 00:37:34,849
you had to start over and over again and

726
00:37:30,470 --> 00:37:39,049
when when I interviewed people who

727
00:37:34,849 --> 00:37:42,980
wanted to be on my team the the question

728
00:37:39,049 --> 00:37:46,910
I usually ask those guys was that ok so

729
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:48,920
how do you take struggling so what was

730
00:37:46,910 --> 00:37:49,759
the most difficult thing you tried and

731
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:51,890
failed

732
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:54,620
and depending on how they answer nobody

733
00:37:51,890 --> 00:37:58,100
answered I can together get them get the

734
00:37:54,620 --> 00:38:02,420
general view of how that person tackles

735
00:37:58,100 --> 00:38:04,330
struggling with problems and how to use

736
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:08,300
those skills on the team

737
00:38:04,330 --> 00:38:12,259
well we're nearing the end and it's

738
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:15,740
necessary to talk about the topic that

739
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:19,190
largely concerns ethical hacking in our

740
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:22,450
case being ethical basically boils down

741
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:28,130
to this statement don't be an idiot

742
00:38:22,450 --> 00:38:30,919
so in many cases when someone tries to

743
00:38:28,130 --> 00:38:36,980
pursue an IT security career and Trust

744
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:39,050
learn to hack we see a pattern said okay

745
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:42,200
you know how to use SQL map you know how

746
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:43,940
to use burp you know how to the web

747
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:46,609
application assessment on whatever

748
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:48,490
application you want and you start

749
00:38:46,610 --> 00:38:51,470
looking around on the internet because

750
00:38:48,490 --> 00:38:57,109
it's so huge and so full of

751
00:38:51,470 --> 00:38:59,839
applications so the thing the main

752
00:38:57,110 --> 00:39:03,110
advice here is don't don't do this

753
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:04,610
because it's more often than not you

754
00:39:03,110 --> 00:39:06,590
will get caught and eventually you will

755
00:39:04,610 --> 00:39:09,170
get caught and you will face serious

756
00:39:06,590 --> 00:39:13,010
problems as we are in Hungary now I

757
00:39:09,170 --> 00:39:15,350
think I don't have to remind you of a

758
00:39:13,010 --> 00:39:20,530
recent couple of recent stories about

759
00:39:15,350 --> 00:39:25,250
wannabe hackers who wanted to get jobs

760
00:39:20,530 --> 00:39:27,770
with major IT a major internet provider

761
00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:32,180
in Hungary but they did it did it in a

762
00:39:27,770 --> 00:39:33,890
really really stupid way so don't this

763
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:37,160
is what I called like a hoppy freedom

764
00:39:33,890 --> 00:39:40,069
fighter type thing so this means that

765
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:42,560
you're looking for vulnerable it is you

766
00:39:40,070 --> 00:39:43,970
try to you believe that you're trying to

767
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:47,000
make the world a better place

768
00:39:43,970 --> 00:39:50,629
even if you do you find something you

769
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:54,230
report those problems to the owners of

770
00:39:50,630 --> 00:39:56,750
the website and no one gives a you

771
00:39:54,230 --> 00:39:59,810
get frustrated you get angry you send

772
00:39:56,750 --> 00:40:01,490
the vulnerability disclosure letter

773
00:39:59,810 --> 00:40:03,589
again to different email addresses

774
00:40:01,490 --> 00:40:05,839
addresses even if they were

775
00:40:03,589 --> 00:40:09,558
spawns they write about that they don't

776
00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:11,058
care you get frustrated and you go say

777
00:40:09,559 --> 00:40:13,940
I'll you guys I'll go full

778
00:40:11,059 --> 00:40:17,299
disclosure and you post your finding on

779
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:21,259
some blog post or wherever you want

780
00:40:17,299 --> 00:40:25,038
well this is the single easiest way to

781
00:40:21,259 --> 00:40:27,079
go to jail and I advise I highly advise

782
00:40:25,039 --> 00:40:31,190
anyone against doing this type of things

783
00:40:27,079 --> 00:40:35,900
if you want to try or class go go and do

784
00:40:31,190 --> 00:40:39,229
CTF games and and that's that gives you

785
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:43,089
safe environments where you can try your

786
00:40:39,229 --> 00:40:46,460
luck and try or skills and improve them

787
00:40:43,089 --> 00:40:50,930
thank you very much and that is all so

788
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:55,190
any questions or do we have some more

789
00:40:50,930 --> 00:40:57,589
time we have since we still have time

790
00:40:55,190 --> 00:41:02,390
for a couple of questions or arguments

791
00:40:57,589 --> 00:41:14,869
or anything that comes to your mind does

792
00:41:02,390 --> 00:41:16,779
anybody have a question for jumbo hi my

793
00:41:14,869 --> 00:41:21,319
name is Peter Andre and I am an

794
00:41:16,779 --> 00:41:25,999
pentester Network and I would like to

795
00:41:21,319 --> 00:41:29,989
ask you if you think or can you agree

796
00:41:25,999 --> 00:41:33,709
with better translation and the

797
00:41:29,989 --> 00:41:38,089
philosophy between the try harder it may

798
00:41:33,710 --> 00:41:41,349
be in Hungarian not fail so it's very

799
00:41:38,089 --> 00:41:46,910
important not to give up after the first

800
00:41:41,349 --> 00:41:52,519
view or or or or more hours of hours of

801
00:41:46,910 --> 00:41:55,160
you know sivash yeah I totally agree so

802
00:41:52,519 --> 00:41:59,140
the thing is that this not families

803
00:41:55,160 --> 00:42:02,930
don't give up so you know everyone has

804
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:03,670
who has faced challenges at one point or

805
00:42:02,930 --> 00:42:06,259
another

806
00:42:03,670 --> 00:42:08,210
get to the point I'll screw you guys I'm

807
00:42:06,259 --> 00:42:12,769
going home I live this I don't care

808
00:42:08,210 --> 00:42:14,869
but but many of us will eventually come

809
00:42:12,769 --> 00:42:16,848
back when we don't give up

810
00:42:14,869 --> 00:42:17,339
so that's yeah I agree that's a good

811
00:42:16,849 --> 00:42:24,390
good

812
00:42:17,339 --> 00:42:27,390
solution anybody else then in that case

813
00:42:24,390 --> 00:42:28,589
please say thank you to jumbo for that

814
00:42:27,390 --> 00:42:30,080
presentation thank you
