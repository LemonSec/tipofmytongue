1
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:12,660
good morning when I started preparing

2
00:00:08,879 --> 00:00:15,930
these I didn't realize it's gonna be at

3
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:19,680
8:30 a.m. so brace yourselves this is

4
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:21,960
gonna be tight okay quickly my name is

5
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,040
Hakeem I teach computer programming I

6
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,990
live in Finland

7
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:26,880
that's my vlog and Twitter this is the

8
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:29,009
company I work now at the moment it just

9
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,830
started not much there called expansive

10
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:33,989
calm the plan we want to talk about

11
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:36,690
quantum computing and how it applies to

12
00:00:33,989 --> 00:00:39,510
cryptography but to do it we have to

13
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:41,250
build the base a bit so we're gonna

14
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:43,379
start with the computer and how to build

15
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:46,710
a computer and then move to cryptography

16
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:49,050
using regular modern computers and then

17
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:51,090
learn a bit about quantum mechanics so

18
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:53,489
that we are able to understand something

19
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:55,170
about quantum cryptography and the ways

20
00:00:53,489 --> 00:00:59,129
quantum computers break modern

21
00:00:55,170 --> 00:01:03,210
cryptography so computer made of bits

22
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:05,700
and all that could be 0 1 it's not a

23
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:08,639
physical thing it's just an idea I can

24
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:11,039
be a bit so I can say this is me 0 this

25
00:01:08,639 --> 00:01:13,499
is me 1 and now I can encode something

26
00:01:11,039 --> 00:01:17,009
as long as we all accept this language a

27
00:01:13,499 --> 00:01:19,469
light bulb can be a bit a electricity

28
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:22,259
could be a bit like low voltage high

29
00:01:19,469 --> 00:01:24,899
voltage that's how your processors you

30
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:29,159
actually use bits it could be physical

31
00:01:24,899 --> 00:01:31,549
like in a laser Compact Disc you see

32
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:34,829
these nice colorful things they are

33
00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:38,579
there because the surface of the disk is

34
00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:42,719
not actually flat it's flat and has so

35
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:44,908
little bits and they don't directly

36
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:48,149
correspond correspond to zeros and ones

37
00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:51,539
but they are technically like bits so

38
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:54,029
you can use something to encode

39
00:01:51,539 --> 00:01:56,909
something into bits as long as you'll

40
00:01:54,029 --> 00:02:01,439
accept the rules now when you have bits

41
00:01:56,909 --> 00:02:05,039
and then you combine them into logic

42
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:07,589
gates any programmer knows logic

43
00:02:05,039 --> 00:02:13,830
operators like and or again this is just

44
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:16,230
an idea and if you have again I can be a

45
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:19,590
and gate like give me two bits I'll give

46
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:21,420
the answer you can implement them or an

47
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:23,580
or gate you can implement them using

48
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:26,309
something physical you can probably

49
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:28,909
train a dog to be a logic operator

50
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:31,769
because it's not not much there to learn

51
00:02:28,909 --> 00:02:34,739
here's an n-bit implemented with

52
00:02:31,769 --> 00:02:36,720
Domino's this so this guy pushes two

53
00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:39,450
things which means one one and the

54
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:41,819
answer is also one falling down means

55
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:44,129
one but if he pushed only one left one

56
00:02:41,819 --> 00:02:51,890
or the right one the answer would be 0

57
00:02:44,129 --> 00:02:55,200
because 0 + 1 is 0 the way logic gates

58
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:57,358
are implemented in modern computing is

59
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:00,209
with transistors those on the Left

60
00:02:57,359 --> 00:03:02,579
they're built about coin-sized big from

61
00:03:00,209 --> 00:03:05,069
about 50 years ago and then you see they

62
00:03:02,579 --> 00:03:08,250
go smaller and smaller and that's

63
00:03:05,069 --> 00:03:10,970
basically an electric switch and your

64
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:15,209
modern CPU has like billions of those

65
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:17,940
why well if you combine them in somewhat

66
00:03:15,209 --> 00:03:20,160
complex ways like here you can make math

67
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:23,220
because if you combine gates like this

68
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:26,069
and you put some input bits you get the

69
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:30,569
sum of those bits and that's the full

70
00:03:26,069 --> 00:03:33,089
adder that's how it works in action as

71
00:03:30,569 --> 00:03:34,980
long as you keep adding stuff you can

72
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:36,840
get more and more complex math because

73
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:39,119
if you have addition you have

74
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:42,489
multiplication and if you have

75
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:44,319
multiplication then

76
00:03:42,489 --> 00:03:46,000
you can have everything because

77
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:49,328
multiplication is the key to everything

78
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,909
and here's by the way a nice sci-fi book

79
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:54,790
I read recently highly recommended

80
00:03:51,909 --> 00:03:58,290
there are multiple cool IDs in this book

81
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:58,290
one of the ideas is there's this

82
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:03,849
civilization they don't have computers

83
00:04:00,849 --> 00:04:07,780
or electronics but they do have a notion

84
00:04:03,849 --> 00:04:10,480
of computing so they use soldiers to

85
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:12,730
implement logic gates thousands and

86
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:15,220
thousands of soldiers and they have this

87
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:17,228
rule that flag down means zero flag up

88
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:19,209
means one and then they arrange soldiers

89
00:04:17,228 --> 00:04:22,780
and they try to compute some hard

90
00:04:19,209 --> 00:04:25,180
mathematical problems so if you have

91
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:28,000
bits and you have logic gates you have a

92
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:31,240
computer now this part is of course the

93
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,280
most difficult and I'm skipping it

94
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:36,490
because we only have so much time and

95
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:38,138
this is similar to this it's like you do

96
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:40,030
something and then magically you have

97
00:04:38,139 --> 00:04:42,220
the answer but if you're interested in

98
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:44,619
those hard bits if how do you go from

99
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:46,479
beats to modern computers then I also

100
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:50,650
highly recommend those two books by the

101
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:53,320
same author one of them on the left goes

102
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:54,940
from light bulbs to modern computers and

103
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:57,550
the second one talks about the

104
00:04:54,940 --> 00:05:00,729
scientific paper by Alan Turing that

105
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:02,470
started this whole thing alright so we

106
00:05:00,729 --> 00:05:04,570
assume we know how computers work that's

107
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:06,250
how they basically work you are here we

108
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:08,590
are now ready to talk about cryptography

109
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:11,830
as you know cryptography is a way to

110
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:13,508
make information secret to hide

111
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:16,990
something so that only specific people

112
00:05:13,509 --> 00:05:19,169
can read your messages so one of the

113
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:21,820
simplest and most obvious ways to

114
00:05:19,169 --> 00:05:24,880
encrypt a message is to just shift it

115
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:27,880
within the alphabet we done it as kids

116
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:30,699
probably and Romans did it thousands of

117
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:33,070
years ago and if you just take some say

118
00:05:30,699 --> 00:05:37,030
English text and shift it by some number

119
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:38,530
like three you get this and if you're

120
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:42,609
not from Hungary this is not Hungarian

121
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:45,159
although sorry I had to do it

122
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:47,409
so Romans use it about 2,000 years ago

123
00:05:45,159 --> 00:05:49,150
and I guess it worked for them because

124
00:05:47,409 --> 00:05:52,389
they looked like that and their enemies

125
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:55,179
looked like that so not much to hide

126
00:05:52,389 --> 00:05:56,260
there but today that won't work it's so

127
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:58,570
easy to crack it you

128
00:05:56,260 --> 00:06:00,340
can just guess you can look at and the

129
00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:02,950
worst case scenario you just try all the

130
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:06,130
combinations and in English there are 25

131
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:08,860
different options so this is the idea

132
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:12,790
behind the simplest symmetric encryption

133
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:16,450
and up to about the 70s that's all we

134
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:19,060
had this is the top of the symmetric

135
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:20,490
encryption machines the Nazi used in the

136
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:23,140
World War two

137
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:26,140
it's much more complex than the simple

138
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:28,300
simple shift because for single letter

139
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:29,890
they used different combinations every

140
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:31,720
time and they changed every day and then

141
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:34,300
every month but it's still something

142
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:37,210
that first year computer science student

143
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:41,080
can crack in about 50 lines of code

144
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:42,880
today that's symmetric encryption where

145
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:45,729
you use the same key to encrypt and

146
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:48,550
decrypt and now your problem lays in

147
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:50,890
this communication of the key because as

148
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:53,020
long as someone has the key they can

149
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:56,289
encrypt your message so this is not

150
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:58,750
perfect this is why from about 70s we

151
00:06:56,290 --> 00:07:00,850
have a much better idea of asymmetric

152
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:02,920
encryption and the idea there is let's

153
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:05,530
say this on the left is me on the right

154
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:09,970
is that's my sister as you can see we

155
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:12,250
are related I don't have a key she has

156
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:15,970
both the key and the lock and the lock

157
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:17,980
is public she gives it to everybody when

158
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:21,280
I want to send her a private message I

159
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:24,510
take her lock and I include my message

160
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:28,539
with her lock and give it to her

161
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:30,420
only she can unlock it because only she

162
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:33,910
has the key she never shares the key

163
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:36,190
that's the basic idea so it could be

164
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:38,320
done with locks but we only have

165
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:40,840
computers that can only do math nothing

166
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:42,700
else so how do we do it with math well

167
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:46,659
we need something that is mathematically

168
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:49,090
easy to kind of lock one way but hard to

169
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:50,920
unlock if you don't have the key and one

170
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:52,179
of the things that works in math like

171
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:54,430
that and it's called a one-way function

172
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:56,170
in math he is multiplying large prime

173
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:58,510
numbers if you just pick two prime

174
00:07:56,170 --> 00:08:00,610
numbers you multiply them it's easy you

175
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:03,640
can do it on your computer even if the

176
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:06,490
numbers are really really big but if you

177
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:09,400
have that number n it's really hard to

178
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:10,310
find what prime numbers were used to

179
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:13,770
produce

180
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:16,080
so how to apply this idea to encrypt

181
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:19,139
messages oversimplification again but

182
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:21,180
this is how the RSA works basically you

183
00:08:19,139 --> 00:08:23,069
pick two prime numbers let's peek really

184
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:26,340
small ones two and seven you multiply

185
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:28,470
them you then find a special value

186
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:30,299
called 5n there's a whole bunch of

187
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:33,060
number theory in it we won't cover it

188
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:35,700
but trust the system this is the formula

189
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:38,699
you use and you get six and now the fun

190
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:40,909
part you pick a number E which is your

191
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:43,200
encryption key and again you have some

192
00:08:40,909 --> 00:08:45,930
constraints you don't see it but there's

193
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:48,620
math not number theory and math there

194
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:51,060
but you have few choices when you have

195
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:53,130
large prime numbers so I pick five

196
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:56,130
within those constraints and then I also

197
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:58,350
pick D which will be my decryption key

198
00:08:56,130 --> 00:09:00,089
the secret key again I have some rules

199
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:03,510
to pick it but I have some choices and I

200
00:09:00,089 --> 00:09:05,820
choose 11 now we have the kit we have

201
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:09,740
the public keys and we have the private

202
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:12,209
key so my sister generated all that I

203
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:17,089
want to send her private message so I

204
00:09:12,209 --> 00:09:19,439
take her public stuff the 5 and 14 and

205
00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:23,010
now let's say I want to send her a

206
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:25,350
simple message c letter c i convert it

207
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:27,930
to a number anywhere i want maybe UTF

208
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:29,880
like a unicode or whatever i convert it

209
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:30,930
to number 3 because c is the third

210
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:34,649
letter of the alphabet

211
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:39,479
and then i take 3 raise it to the power

212
00:09:34,649 --> 00:09:42,600
of that e5 and see the result mod 14 and

213
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:46,050
mod 14 is the remainder after integer

214
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:49,850
division so we have 243 we divided both

215
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:53,250
by 14 we get the remainder 3 oh sorry 5

216
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:56,610
5 is the secret message this is the

217
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:59,670
thing that I'm gonna send her and she

218
00:09:56,610 --> 00:10:02,160
can see now she has the private key and

219
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:03,599
she has the encrypted message she does

220
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:07,260
the same thing but with the private key

221
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:10,200
so she raises it to 11 she does mod 14

222
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:12,689
she gets 3 and that's how it works

223
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:14,940
basically there are more layers to this

224
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:17,790
but that's the idea behind much of

225
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:20,670
modern cryptography so you see the

226
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:23,790
problem here is it is hard to guess

227
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:26,760
those numbers and it is hard to find

228
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:28,709
with large enough prime numbers it will

229
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:31,080
take billions of billions of years on a

230
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:33,780
regular computer to just find those

231
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:36,650
prime factors because the basically the

232
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:40,260
only way you have is to try all of them

233
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:42,689
alright we have the idea behind

234
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:46,439
computers and we have some ideas about

235
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:48,450
cryptography now to talk about quantum

236
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:50,820
computers and quantum cryptography we

237
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:55,110
need to have just a bit into quantum

238
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:57,450
mechanics so remember in chemistry

239
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:59,940
classes in in high school we talked

240
00:10:57,450 --> 00:11:04,730
about those covalent bonds like you have

241
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:07,890
a ch2 which is two hydrogen nucleus

242
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:09,720
connected like sharing an electron and I

243
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:13,069
could never understand like sharing an

244
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:15,950
electron is it like going around two

245
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:18,390
nucleus at the same time is it like

246
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:21,210
running around because I have this idea

247
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:24,000
and many of us do this is the atom right

248
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:26,390
it has the Nicholas and it has electrons

249
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:29,820
like planets running around them and

250
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:31,939
that picture is nice it's easy to

251
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:35,160
understand but it's wrong because

252
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:38,460
electrons actually are not those balls

253
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:40,650
that could be anywhere the idea of

254
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:43,680
asking where is this electron at the

255
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:45,449
moment does not make sense because if

256
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:48,329
you don't ask that question if you don't

257
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:50,910
look at the atom it's not anywhere it's

258
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:52,800
not in any particular place so it's not

259
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:55,949
like that electron is running around the

260
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:57,930
nucleus it's a probability around that

261
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:59,940
nucleus and it has some probability of

262
00:11:57,930 --> 00:12:03,420
being here and being here so it's a

263
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:08,430
cloud of somethingness and when they say

264
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:10,770
two hydrogen nucleus nuclei sharing an

265
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:13,349
electron that means the electron is at

266
00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:16,199
both places at the same time it's with

267
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:18,240
that new clay nucleus and with that at

268
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:20,700
the same time it doesn't make sense it

269
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:23,250
shouldn't because quantum physics is

270
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:25,560
like that it's counterintuitive we hate

271
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:29,160
it because it it doesn't fit the way we

272
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:31,079
think about the world naturally so for

273
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:33,089
the longest time scientists scientists

274
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:35,430
were asking a question what is light you

275
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:37,390
know this probably from from physics in

276
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:38,530
high school is it a wave is it apart

277
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:41,740
chuckle and the problem with that

278
00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:44,650
question is if you are into waves you

279
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:46,870
can produce experiments that will prove

280
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:48,550
it's a wave if you are into particles

281
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:52,120
you can produce experiments to prove

282
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:54,550
it's a particle so it's hard to guess

283
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:56,890
it's hard to find out and one of the

284
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:59,140
ways to think about it is well if it's a

285
00:12:56,890 --> 00:13:01,810
wave then it should behave like a wave

286
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:05,439
so if you have like a wave of water and

287
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:07,420
you put two slits in front of the waves

288
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:10,510
then on the other side you should see

289
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:12,699
this interference pattern like here's

290
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:15,580
the screenshot from a video on YouTube

291
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:18,580
where a guy pushes two balls onto the

292
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:20,890
flat pond of water and produces two

293
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:23,560
sources of waves and those waves collide

294
00:13:20,890 --> 00:13:28,900
into one another and they produce these

295
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:31,510
flat pieces where waves like high point

296
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:33,220
of wave with a low point and they cancel

297
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:36,430
each other and at some points they

298
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:39,310
amplify each other this way you have the

299
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:41,859
interference pattern but if particles

300
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:44,709
are shot through the same double slits

301
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:47,020
then you should see just two lines right

302
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:57,370
they go through left one or through the

303
00:13:47,020 --> 00:14:01,150
right one like it I'll switch it to this

304
00:13:57,370 --> 00:14:04,240
one okay so the problem with this is if

305
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:08,199
you look at particles like photons or

306
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:10,360
electrons like that then you do an

307
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:12,220
experiment and you should you should

308
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:14,140
electrons or photons through double

309
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:17,050
slits you still get an interference

310
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:20,199
pattern as if it's a wave and okay well

311
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:22,390
that proves it it's a wave then but they

312
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:24,220
think okay maybe it's not a wave but

313
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:26,439
there's still like little balls of

314
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:28,240
things that collide with each other and

315
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:30,700
produce this interference pattern so

316
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:33,430
let's shoot them one by one just one at

317
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:35,710
a time and if you do it you still get

318
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:38,020
the interference pattern like one thing

319
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:41,020
it goes through something like the left

320
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:44,740
or the right slit and then it lands on

321
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:47,530
that side as if it was part of a wave it

322
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:51,040
doesn't make sense and the only good

323
00:14:47,530 --> 00:14:52,720
explanation to that is it's doing

324
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:55,630
it's going through both slits at the

325
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:57,370
same time you should one-electron it

326
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:58,839
goes through both things at the same

327
00:14:57,370 --> 00:15:00,279
time with some probability and then

328
00:14:58,839 --> 00:15:02,560
collides with each other on the other

329
00:15:00,279 --> 00:15:05,380
side and produces the interference

330
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:07,239
pattern but if you put detectors on the

331
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:08,709
slit and you want to see is it going

332
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:10,449
through the left one or is it going

333
00:15:08,709 --> 00:15:12,758
through the right one you'll see the

334
00:15:10,449 --> 00:15:14,979
answer like this one went through the

335
00:15:12,759 --> 00:15:17,110
left one but you won't see the

336
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:19,180
interference pattern anymore on the

337
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:19,870
other side you'll see two lines as if

338
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:24,388
doors

339
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:27,730
those were particles so the fact of

340
00:15:24,389 --> 00:15:29,589
observing the answer collapses the

341
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:31,899
answer to one thing and it's not like

342
00:15:29,589 --> 00:15:34,360
our minds controlling the universe by

343
00:15:31,899 --> 00:15:36,850
observing it it's because at this point

344
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:39,339
observing means interacting you cannot

345
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:42,310
observe a photon without touching it

346
00:15:39,339 --> 00:15:44,019
like kicking it and by doing it you

347
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:50,170
collapse it to one possible scenario

348
00:15:44,019 --> 00:15:52,380
which is left or right so things on this

349
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:56,649
scale like photons electrons even small

350
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:59,139
atoms behave like that and they could be

351
00:15:56,649 --> 00:16:00,550
in for example two states at the same

352
00:15:59,139 --> 00:16:03,880
time they could be at two states at

353
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:08,250
separate times so with things like

354
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:10,899
photons on the right side there is a

355
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:13,449
property called spin which is a bit

356
00:16:10,899 --> 00:16:15,399
harder to get at this point but we can

357
00:16:13,449 --> 00:16:18,699
just think of it as a photon looking up

358
00:16:15,399 --> 00:16:20,709
or looking down so it could be in one of

359
00:16:18,699 --> 00:16:23,439
those states and you can apply some

360
00:16:20,709 --> 00:16:25,239
energy and move it from one state to

361
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:27,069
another state which means you can use

362
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:32,440
them to create bits just like you use

363
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:34,689
light bulbs or electricity and at this

364
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:36,220
point this is no better than any regular

365
00:16:34,689 --> 00:16:39,000
computer you still have bits you'll have

366
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:43,870
two states distinct this discrete states

367
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:45,760
but those quantum objects as I said they

368
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:48,550
can also be in both states at the same

369
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:52,000
time with some probability so we could

370
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:55,209
have an electron that looks right sorry

371
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:58,120
left so it's kind of somewhere between 0

372
00:16:55,209 --> 00:17:00,880
& 1 with 50% probability and that's what

373
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:03,160
they call a qubit it could also be like

374
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:04,480
this way and technically you can have

375
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:07,480
many many more possible

376
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:10,360
and technically infinite number of

377
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:11,980
different states between zero and one so

378
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:14,260
if you have computers with bits and

379
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:17,110
logic gates then quantum computers are

380
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:19,449
quantum bits with quantum gates the

381
00:17:17,109 --> 00:17:22,629
gates that operate on those qubits and

382
00:17:19,449 --> 00:17:25,750
again this is the long part which is the

383
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:27,850
most difficult now if you google about

384
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:30,160
quantum computing and look at popular

385
00:17:27,849 --> 00:17:33,340
articles or lectures or stuff like that

386
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:35,260
there are a few levels of the way they

387
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:38,678
describe it and one of the first levels

388
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:41,890
is some journalists might say well

389
00:17:38,679 --> 00:17:44,200
quantum computers have more than once

390
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:47,290
and zeros our regular boring computers

391
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:50,049
only have 2 bits 0 & 1 and these

392
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:51,129
powerful quantum computers have more

393
00:17:50,049 --> 00:17:54,250
than 0 & 1

394
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:58,090
that makes them really really fast which

395
00:17:54,250 --> 00:18:00,400
is again not really true we could have

396
00:17:58,090 --> 00:18:02,320
more bits than 0 and one is there's not

397
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:04,870
like a physical limitation to that and

398
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:08,860
there are actual computers with trinary

399
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:11,709
systems where they have 0 1 & 3 or 0 1 &

400
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:14,729
2 & it's not that that gives us power 2

401
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:17,590
bits is enough for all the power we need

402
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:22,059
another level they might describe it is

403
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:25,090
well the bits can be 0 & 1 at the same

404
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:27,700
time this means this computer is

405
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:29,678
infinitely parallel like this quantum

406
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:32,559
computer does something that a classical

407
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:36,850
computer does but it does it in infinite

408
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:39,970
many states at the same time so it's

409
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:43,678
like a super parallel computer which is

410
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:46,780
technically true but effectively isn't

411
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:48,730
because if you look at this and you

412
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:50,740
think a quantum computer is just a bunch

413
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:52,960
of classical computers working at the

414
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:56,500
same time it sounds really good

415
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:58,570
but the problem is they do but at some

416
00:18:56,500 --> 00:19:02,020
point you want to get the answer out of

417
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:04,689
those you only get one one at random so

418
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:06,190
it's not really it's it's not helpful to

419
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:09,549
think about quantum computers as

420
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:12,460
computers classical computers that work

421
00:19:09,549 --> 00:19:17,430
in parallel it's like a superposition of

422
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:19,530
multiple classical computers just like

423
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:21,900
a photon on an electron could be in

424
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:24,180
superposition of different states so if

425
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:28,230
you are looking for factors of n like

426
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:30,420
those prime numbers then your machine is

427
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:32,400
in different states of looking at

428
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:34,980
different numbers at the same time but

429
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:36,960
then you want to see the answer and it

430
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:39,060
gives you the answer like it says this

431
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:41,010
number is not a factor well that's not

432
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:42,960
helpful I could have done that with a

433
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:44,490
classical computer at random just pick

434
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,920
random numbers and see if there are

435
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:50,820
factors or not so it's kind of similar

436
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:53,430
to this to a gaming die when it's in the

437
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:55,320
air it's in like superposition of

438
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:57,270
different states but it's not helpful

439
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:59,550
because you want to see the answer and

440
00:19:57,270 --> 00:20:02,580
you put it on the table and you only

441
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:04,710
have one answer it collapses to that one

442
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:06,570
answer so you keep going and you say

443
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:08,310
okay this is also not a factor and if

444
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:10,860
you likee then at some point you get

445
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:12,149
okay this is a factor again you could

446
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:16,729
have done it with a classical computer

447
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:20,460
at the same speed so this particular

448
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:22,290
property of quantum computers that's not

449
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:26,030
enough to solve that particular problem

450
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:28,889
of finding prime factors but they do

451
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:31,139
find trying factors by changing the

452
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:34,140
problem by taking advantage of these

453
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:36,420
weird quantum properties because if you

454
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:39,900
switch from the idea of finding prime

455
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:42,620
factors to a problem of finding a period

456
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:45,900
of a function which is again provable by

457
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:48,479
means of number theory that you can kind

458
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:50,700
of rearrange the problem into finding a

459
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:54,980
period of some function and then at some

460
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:58,500
point get the prime factors then your

461
00:20:54,980 --> 00:21:00,360
answers are still random but then less

462
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:03,960
random than that they are less random

463
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:07,379
than a perfect die they are more likely

464
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:09,930
to land on a particular value which is

465
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:12,030
the correct answer so you might repeat

466
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:15,270
the same thing multiple times and then

467
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:16,680
you see the answer is X is more likely

468
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:19,500
to be there it's statistically more

469
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:23,310
likely and it's like gaming die which is

470
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:26,400
crooked like it it's not fair maybe it's

471
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:28,139
heavier on one point if you do if you

472
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:30,450
throw it multiple times it's more likely

473
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:32,130
to land on one side

474
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:35,190
and this is the idea behind many

475
00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:37,110
algorithms in quantum computer quantum

476
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:39,930
computing this particular one is called

477
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:42,570
Shor's algorithm and the idea with other

478
00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:46,110
algorithms as well is that you make the

479
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:49,080
problem so that you play with it so that

480
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:51,959
it's more likely to not give you a

481
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:54,060
completely random answer but more likely

482
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:57,030
to give you a correct answer and with

483
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:59,250
with repetition with enough tries you

484
00:21:57,030 --> 00:22:01,350
just look at the statistics and this top

485
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:04,950
answer is probably the correct one this

486
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:08,750
lower one is probably the wrong one so

487
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:12,030
this is how roughly you get about

488
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:16,110
solving problems in cryptography with a

489
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:18,660
quantum computer now the idea there is

490
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:21,360
you have a problem designed for a

491
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:24,420
classical computer and the problem of

492
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:26,340
finding friend factors is really really

493
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:28,650
hard on a classical computer it could be

494
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:30,510
somewhat easy on a quantum computer

495
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:33,030
we're not there yet

496
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:36,450
well the problem with quantum computers

497
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:39,210
is you need something to have those bits

498
00:22:36,450 --> 00:22:40,740
you need those atoms or electrons or

499
00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:42,270
photons and it's really hard to control

500
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:45,540
them because if you put them in some

501
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:47,750
states then basically any fart can

502
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:50,490
change them anything like a smallest

503
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:52,650
smallest interaction with a particle

504
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:54,840
flat or temperature can change them so

505
00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:57,900
it's really hard to make this computer a

506
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:59,820
stable computer this is why those fancy

507
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:03,540
quantum computers are so big most of

508
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:06,179
that space is it's basically a fridge

509
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:09,149
that you want your quantum computer to

510
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:13,620
be at about absolute zero so that no

511
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:15,590
jiggling no temperature affects it but

512
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:18,379
at some point we will get there probably

513
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:22,169
the Shor's algorithm was implemented

514
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:23,700
before was like written before quantum

515
00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:25,170
computers existed and then it was

516
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:28,200
implemented with one of the first

517
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:32,520
quantum computers and it produces the

518
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:34,440
answer that 7 is a factor of 21 which

519
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:36,389
which is good we're getting there but we

520
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:38,659
need now to scale it to like billions

521
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:43,080
and billions

522
00:23:38,659 --> 00:23:45,210
but this could be a race with no end

523
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:47,129
like we could create new algorithms that

524
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:48,690
are harder and harder to solve and then

525
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:51,049
maybe come up with more quantum

526
00:23:48,690 --> 00:23:56,070
algorithms to actually solve them so

527
00:23:51,049 --> 00:23:57,900
what can we do to guarantee that we can

528
00:23:56,070 --> 00:24:00,090
create some cryptography that is

529
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:02,669
unbreakable by even a quantum computer

530
00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:05,129
and this is the area of quantum

531
00:24:02,669 --> 00:24:07,740
cryptography actually using these weird

532
00:24:05,130 --> 00:24:09,809
quantum properties to create new

533
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:14,280
algorithms based on quantum properties

534
00:24:09,809 --> 00:24:16,770
to encode messages and we're gonna jump

535
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:20,668
right into it again this is an

536
00:24:16,770 --> 00:24:23,129
algorithms algorithm called BB 24 and we

537
00:24:20,669 --> 00:24:25,500
are back to the end of symmetric keys so

538
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:27,120
the idea is we want to share the same

539
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:29,700
key and use it for encryption and

540
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:35,639
decryption but now we're going to use it

541
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:39,090
quantum way so those balls again are

542
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:41,549
let's say photons and it can look up it

543
00:24:39,090 --> 00:24:44,129
can look down it can be in one of those

544
00:24:41,549 --> 00:24:46,918
positions and then left and right and

545
00:24:44,130 --> 00:24:50,429
you have detectors to detect what

546
00:24:46,919 --> 00:24:52,710
position is it in if you use the correct

547
00:24:50,429 --> 00:24:55,350
detector like if you have up or down

548
00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:57,870
photon and you use the vertical detector

549
00:24:55,350 --> 00:25:02,010
you get the correct answer you get 0 up

550
00:24:57,870 --> 00:25:04,469
1 down but you also have a horizontal

551
00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:06,929
detector and if you use the horizontal

552
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:10,350
delayed detector on the vertical photon

553
00:25:06,929 --> 00:25:12,500
you get a random answer 0 or 1 so you

554
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:15,418
basically have like the correct

555
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:20,400
detectors for a photon and the incorrect

556
00:25:15,419 --> 00:25:23,880
detector for photo so my sister

557
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:25,679
generates a series of random bits should

558
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:28,130
be big enough but in this example it's

559
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:31,740
is small just at random

560
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:35,730
she then picks random detectors for each

561
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:39,210
bit again completely random and based on

562
00:25:35,730 --> 00:25:43,020
those she produces qubits she produces

563
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:47,490
photons of the correct orientation so

564
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:49,470
that if I were to know the detectors if

565
00:25:47,490 --> 00:25:51,300
he gave me the photons I could produce

566
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:53,480
the same bits

567
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:56,460
but she doesn't tell me the

568
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:58,650
configuration of the detectors she only

569
00:25:56,460 --> 00:26:01,920
gives me the qubits so I get those

570
00:25:58,650 --> 00:26:04,770
photons in some configuration and that's

571
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:06,630
it this is our first point of

572
00:26:04,770 --> 00:26:08,670
communication and this communication is

573
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:12,510
done on a quantum Channel on a channel

574
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:14,700
that is capable of sending qubits in

575
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:16,530
this example we are using photons so we

576
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:19,200
could use something like a fiber-optic

577
00:26:16,530 --> 00:26:21,030
cable that is capable of basically

578
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,890
moving a photon from one point to

579
00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:26,790
another without changing its orientation

580
00:26:22,890 --> 00:26:28,620
its state so this is still communication

581
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:30,480
and this is still like some cable lying

582
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:33,120
around someone could listen to it right

583
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:36,030
so let's say some evil person listens to

584
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:39,350
the to the communication that's my go-to

585
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:42,300
evil person all the presentations I use

586
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:44,730
the problem there is it's a quantum

587
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:48,120
communication with quantum bits and if

588
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:50,760
Hitler listens and tries to see what

589
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:53,550
qubits are there he needs to use

590
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:55,290
detectors but he doesn't know what

591
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:58,530
detector to use if he uses the wrong

592
00:26:55,290 --> 00:27:02,850
detector for a qubit it will flip to

593
00:26:58,530 --> 00:27:05,910
either 0 or 1 at random by doing it he

594
00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:07,500
might change the qubit so when I

595
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:10,830
received the message after listening

596
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:12,750
after Hitler listens to it I might get a

597
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:15,179
different message and with the long big

598
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:17,520
long enough messages I got I am

599
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:19,350
guaranteed to get the incorrect message

600
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:22,530
and you'll see how this works in our

601
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:26,280
favor so let's say I get the message I

602
00:27:22,530 --> 00:27:27,389
then also pick detectors at random

603
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:29,730
because I don't know the correct

604
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:31,620
configuration of detectors so I just

605
00:27:29,730 --> 00:27:35,520
pick them at random and I produce some

606
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:37,379
bits by applying them to the photons if

607
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:40,440
you think about it you can see that

608
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:44,970
statistically I will get 75% right

609
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:47,520
because 50% of the detectors I will

610
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:49,350
choose correctly and out of those 50

611
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:53,220
incorrect choosers

612
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:56,639
I will get 50% at random correctly so

613
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:58,620
I'll get 75% of bits correctly then I

614
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:01,680
just call my sister on a regular

615
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:04,080
unsecured line like a phone and we just

616
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:05,130
compare detectors we don't talk about

617
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:08,970
bits we don't talk about

618
00:28:05,130 --> 00:28:11,370
photons I say for the first position I

619
00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:14,640
chose that detector and she says me too

620
00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:17,189
so I see okay then my beat should be

621
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:19,530
correct on the second I chose this

622
00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:22,440
detector and she says no I chose that

623
00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:24,030
detector and I say okay this bit is

624
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:26,910
incorrect then I chose the wrong

625
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:30,840
detector so I just discard the wrong

626
00:28:26,910 --> 00:28:32,190
bits comparing them and again at this

627
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:34,500
point Hitler might be listening to

628
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:38,010
because it's now just a regular phone

629
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:39,930
line so he listens and he says okay he

630
00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:43,410
now knows the configuration of detectors

631
00:28:39,930 --> 00:28:45,840
that we used but he doesn't have the

632
00:28:43,410 --> 00:28:48,930
photons in the same state because if he

633
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:54,929
had then I would have gotten the wrong

634
00:28:48,930 --> 00:28:57,330
message so after doing this we just

635
00:28:54,930 --> 00:28:59,400
discard the wrong bits and now we have

636
00:28:57,330 --> 00:29:02,399
the share key and it's all about

637
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:04,290
statistics because with message small

638
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:07,410
enough like this Hitler could be lucky

639
00:29:04,290 --> 00:29:10,860
but we need to produce big messages and

640
00:29:07,410 --> 00:29:12,990
then we are guaranteed statistically to

641
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:16,199
be safe and there are also ways to

642
00:29:12,990 --> 00:29:18,780
detect if the message was listened to

643
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:24,630
because we can also detect changes in

644
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:28,050
the state of the qubits this was really

645
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:29,850
fast I'm not sure if this is enough it's

646
00:29:28,050 --> 00:29:33,030
a really quick overview there are

647
00:29:29,850 --> 00:29:36,750
resources that you can get into to learn

648
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:39,420
about this is fascinating and this was

649
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:41,430
the theory for a few years and then they

650
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:43,200
actually implement it and all over the

651
00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:45,750
world in multiple places they could

652
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:48,240
create a secure Channel by doing this

653
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:50,130
quantum encryption and actually if you

654
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:53,220
drive from here for about two and a half

655
00:29:50,130 --> 00:29:56,040
hours to the east they did one of the

656
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:58,400
first demos in Vienna where they created

657
00:29:56,040 --> 00:30:02,520
a secure channel of multiple links and

658
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:05,510
it works it's amazing so even though

659
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:08,790
quantum physics is this weird

660
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:10,620
unpredictable randomness which doesn't

661
00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:12,570
make sense to us because we want things

662
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:14,070
to be not random I want things to make

663
00:30:12,570 --> 00:30:16,050
perfect sense we want to predict

664
00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:18,240
outcomes

665
00:30:16,050 --> 00:30:21,330
it turns out we can use this in our

666
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:24,240
advantage so this fundamental property

667
00:30:21,330 --> 00:30:27,960
of the universe of not being sure about

668
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:30,720
itself can be used for example in secure

669
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:32,280
communication so if you want to learn

670
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:33,900
more about this there are a few

671
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:35,910
resources that I recommend there is an

672
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:39,809
interactive essay and there's this blog

673
00:30:35,910 --> 00:30:41,910
by quantum scientists and he also wrote

674
00:30:39,809 --> 00:30:44,580
a book called quantum computing since

675
00:30:41,910 --> 00:30:46,470
Democritus and there are a few channels

676
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:48,689
on YouTube I particularly recommend this

677
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:52,440
frame of essence channel which describes

678
00:30:48,690 --> 00:30:55,170
both quantum computers qubits and

679
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:57,059
quantum cryptography using this

680
00:30:55,170 --> 00:31:00,240
algorithm that I described and some

681
00:30:57,059 --> 00:31:03,330
other algorithms those links will be on

682
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:05,730
my website at this address feel free to

683
00:31:03,330 --> 00:31:07,770
ask me questions or anything I'm not a

684
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:10,160
specialist in this area at all I'm just

685
00:31:07,770 --> 00:31:14,980
really curious about it I think it's

686
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:17,240
quite amazing and thank you

687
