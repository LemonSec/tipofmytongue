1
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:10,949
so since for addiction I'm Tomas and so

2
00:00:08,879 --> 00:00:15,270
today I will talk about Android based on

3
00:00:10,949 --> 00:00:18,090
the prototype project and system based

4
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:22,770
on a lot of back emptying and amputee

5
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:24,720
and so you may have seen me in the past

6
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:27,600
years already talking about Android

7
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:32,780
security technically speaking like Viet

8
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:35,250
realization energy structure hooking and

9
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:40,220
so today we will still talk about

10
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:43,019
Android but contrary to previous talks

11
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:44,700
which for many technical with systems

12
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:47,460
that by basically not doing any

13
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:49,440
technical things we can still do a lot

14
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:52,680
of great things regarding Android

15
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:54,420
security and the objective of this talk

16
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:56,250
today is to review data management and

17
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:58,170
Android so when I say data

18
00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:02,519
I mean user data and not application

19
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:05,640
data that we could assets and basically

20
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:08,689
is to review a lot of bad practices that

21
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:11,549
we still see nowaday and data management

22
00:01:08,689 --> 00:01:14,130
by application developers and to

23
00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:19,439
introduce how we can how they should

24
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:20,759
feel that or so how can we use the fact

25
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:22,139
that they don't use bad practices that

26
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:27,270
they don't do good practices to

27
00:01:22,139 --> 00:01:29,850
basically hack application data and also

28
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:33,499
I will make us a society apart a about

29
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:36,149
like baboon tree hunting and Android and

30
00:01:33,499 --> 00:01:38,630
well what was the experience for couple

31
00:01:36,149 --> 00:01:41,759
of minutes about this kind of activity

32
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:44,520
if once a what that expose were getting

33
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:46,950
under is not a brand new topic I would

34
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:48,658
say that yeah when we focus about data

35
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:51,419
leaks and Android will mainly focus on

36
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:53,369
like the system leaks like basic core

37
00:01:51,419 --> 00:01:55,079
application leagues such as before we

38
00:01:53,369 --> 00:01:57,840
had how we can vertically retrieve the

39
00:01:55,079 --> 00:02:01,649
user identity based on the stock app

40
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:03,049
miss configuration today the talk would

41
00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:07,020
be much more like about like any

42
00:02:03,049 --> 00:02:09,899
developed app with huge user base but

43
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:13,049
practices and how basically by and

44
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:15,330
studies is happily call or personal data

45
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:17,940
confidential data and whatever

46
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:19,380
and we will not talk about unsecure

47
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:21,630
share the Tala Dean's which have

48
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:25,410
basically a sidecar loading we will

49
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:27,840
really focus on user data because for

50
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:29,220
example like we don't really care that

51
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,040
we leak the fact that we download the

52
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:34,680
map of Hungary but we really care that

53
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:37,250
anybody on your device can know where we

54
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:40,230
live where we work with our were

55
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:44,190
preference location it would appear for

56
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:47,609
example okay so just before talking like

57
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:49,230
really inside the topic I will just make

58
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:51,840
small guess and if someone who answers

59
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:54,030
the question that we cool so the

60
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,980
environment you just try to to have kind

61
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:57,360
of general setups you have an app that

62
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:59,100
is installed on the device with only

63
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,170
Network permissions so that basically it

64
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:02,910
can just send out data it's like a

65
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:05,579
genuine I have no rootkit and whatever

66
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:07,170
and basically your device is not fruity

67
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:10,680
so like nobody should have a very good

68
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:12,450
security and one bad stuff is that you

69
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:14,700
have device has a lot of apps like

70
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:16,890
really a lot and first of all you have

71
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:18,750
video streaming amps remote control and

72
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:21,299
remote storage hub or like basically

73
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:24,239
remote data storage hub which I dunno

74
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:25,709
draw balls or whatever I mean one thing

75
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:27,450
is that I say that we not disclose the

76
00:03:25,709 --> 00:03:32,370
name of the venerable application

77
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:35,250
because of India that were Sund so the

78
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:37,590
question is in general or in worst case

79
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:41,430
among this kind of question I mean

80
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:43,140
option sorry what can be done can we do

81
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:45,150
like but basically asking not something

82
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:47,570
we do file listing user identity

83
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:51,690
disclosure user financial disclosure

84
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:53,579
remote stored fight disclosure or remote

85
00:03:51,690 --> 00:04:00,300
control so the someone wants to may have

86
00:03:53,580 --> 00:04:02,370
a guess here so I would guess myself why

87
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:04,530
basically we can do a lot of stuff we

88
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:07,950
cannot really do remote control we can

89
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:12,690
just hack the user into giving us remote

90
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:15,119
control but apart from this slice a part

91
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:17,579
a we can do nearly all the other stuff I

92
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,350
mean file listing is nearly an after P

93
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:21,089
that we're not going to test but we

94
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:22,890
can't hand this thing but we can

95
00:04:21,089 --> 00:04:24,419
definitely have user identity describes

96
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:25,990
your result cleanest or disclosure and

97
00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:31,659
any file

98
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:33,669
user fine you can disclose so the talk

99
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:35,470
will be divided in four main topic which

100
00:04:33,669 --> 00:04:37,419
is basically the first one is explaining

101
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:40,810
how that has to raise woo technically in

102
00:04:37,419 --> 00:04:43,780
security speaking and then well how can

103
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:49,660
we use that all can we use bad practices

104
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:52,299
to get leaked data and then obviously as

105
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:55,000
I said before what was the reaction of

106
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:58,630
the vendors reckoning as a managed or

107
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,970
like private abilities so that has to

108
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:04,719
rage first a documentation because

109
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:06,940
always good to read the documentation so

110
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:09,190
I don't have put some bad words well

111
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:12,909
just put Aram bits like read the

112
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:16,020
manual so when we talk about external

113
00:05:12,909 --> 00:05:20,050
storage and Android we have nice goals

114
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:22,150
given to us by the android framework and

115
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:25,000
rigged system with a nice documentation

116
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:27,580
such as you want to store you file on

117
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,199
the external storage well you can use

118
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:32,080
this function called get external files

119
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:34,419
deer's which basically is described as

120
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:36,090
follow is an absolute pass who

121
00:05:34,419 --> 00:05:38,710
application specific directories

122
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:42,159
internal to the hub not typically

123
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:43,448
visible to user as major it so storage

124
00:05:42,159 --> 00:05:45,009
it is not always available well

125
00:05:43,449 --> 00:05:46,719
obviously external storage and no

126
00:05:45,009 --> 00:05:48,490
security is enforced with this file I

127
00:05:46,719 --> 00:05:50,500
mean like here when you're not a

128
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:52,659
security expert you can see that here

129
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:55,210
you have already two-sentence that seems

130
00:05:52,659 --> 00:05:58,569
conflicting like not typically visible

131
00:05:55,210 --> 00:06:00,099
to the user as made young and not sick

132
00:05:58,569 --> 00:06:01,539
no security is enforced I mean like

133
00:06:00,099 --> 00:06:02,800
unless you pay attention to the search

134
00:06:01,539 --> 00:06:04,960
fries would believe that that it could

135
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:07,780
is not the zipper to the user while

136
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:09,219
minute is and then if you look at the

137
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:11,169
cat external storage

138
00:06:09,219 --> 00:06:13,180
directory which is another way to access

139
00:06:11,169 --> 00:06:15,490
the external storage well you will see

140
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:17,319
that storage can use the definition

141
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:20,469
descriptions or in the documentation is

142
00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:23,259
like it can hold a relatively moment of

143
00:06:20,469 --> 00:06:27,490
data and each user has their own

144
00:06:23,259 --> 00:06:30,759
isolated shared storage well I mean here

145
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:32,530
again when you say user is not an

146
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:35,500
application because normally in Android

147
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:38,020
every application is his user ID no when

148
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:39,280
you say user here is user meaning the

149
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:42,609
only guarantee you

150
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:45,159
is that each user an Android like if you

151
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:49,590
log in on the Android is as easily it is

152
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:51,850
shared storage but not each application

153
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:53,349
so that was one way to look at the

154
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:55,150
documentation and then if you look

155
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:57,430
another web documentation I mean I put

156
00:06:55,150 --> 00:07:01,000
through the reference below which is

157
00:06:57,430 --> 00:07:02,530
kind of the training describe little

158
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,780
better what's the distinction between

159
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:06,940
internal storage which is basically the

160
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:09,159
files have here are only accessible by

161
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:12,130
the app itself that's what because the

162
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:13,630
private data folder and when you have an

163
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:16,180
instant were basically all of that is

164
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:19,180
moved when you have an external storage

165
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:20,590
is a word readable so here nobody back

166
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:23,740
and like it's kind of obvious it is for

167
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:25,539
readable is written however you have two

168
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:30,220
nice features I will go back on this

169
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:32,770
definition of features after is that it

170
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:34,630
seems to behave like the internal fat

171
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:39,130
because when you remove the app well the

172
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:41,020
data is removed and the other very

173
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:43,719
interesting stuff is that if you want to

174
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:46,330
share your files with other application

175
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:49,330
is written that it's the best place to

176
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:51,430
use however you should do before that is

177
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:54,150
the best place if you don't require any

178
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:56,050
access restriction and you want to share

179
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:57,669
well I mean like you know like you have

180
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:58,870
to repair the documentation because if

181
00:07:57,669 --> 00:08:02,979
you don't and you will have some kind of

182
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:04,300
of misbelief okay so if we are developer

183
00:08:02,979 --> 00:08:05,919
not a security expert but we have a

184
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:09,130
developer so now after we read the

185
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:12,820
documentation well naturally some very

186
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:15,310
general reading we seems to see that

187
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:17,740
developers have a correct vision of what

188
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:21,790
internal storage is because basically

189
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:24,880
they will put on this folder core

190
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:27,280
application data such as databases any

191
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:29,560
private data and low volume data because

192
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:32,260
basically if you want to load into store

193
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:33,640
a lot a huge amount of data you will

194
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:36,939
lose the external storage at that

195
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:41,429
documentation so as I said you will

196
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:46,060
first open to cache databases and core

197
00:08:41,429 --> 00:08:48,310
files to do that to you

198
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:50,050
therapist uses ton of code so like

199
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:51,069
everything seems to be okay when we talk

200
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:52,930
about the internal behavior and

201
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:54,640
application

202
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:56,890
however when you start to considered

203
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:58,750
what is the vision of the purpose

204
00:08:56,890 --> 00:09:01,449
regarding non internal storage so the

205
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:04,210
external storage which is you're gonna

206
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:07,029
will go on the definition was we could

207
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:09,940
buy external well the objective start to

208
00:09:07,029 --> 00:09:12,730
like it not be so much much of what we

209
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:14,230
should expect from because basically

210
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:17,140
this was a we stock data

211
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:19,209
yeah when the booster share data okay

212
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:21,490
that's here against the definition then

213
00:09:19,209 --> 00:09:23,619
we started to store non core data

214
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:25,839
meaning like any data that they

215
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:27,520
processed I mean like you know like any

216
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:29,410
data the new process some of the data

217
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:32,770
are like internet - yeah because like is

218
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:34,810
very sensitive and another stuff is as

219
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:37,990
they will put their files that they want

220
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:39,430
to share with author application because

221
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:41,320
when you miss write the documentation

222
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:43,420
you believe that this is the best or not

223
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:44,920
to say the only way to share data is

224
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:46,180
basically not to store on private

225
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:50,199
because if it's private well it's

226
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:52,739
private in cannot be shared so it's

227
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:57,400
taught on what we could be / as decade

228
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:59,890
folder however here we start well really

229
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:01,839
I mean like even on Google or Android

230
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:05,529
agree that it was kind of a very bad

231
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:07,480
name because SD card why it's not SD

232
00:10:05,529 --> 00:10:09,790
card and like it can be an SD card if

233
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:11,830
you put an SD card but mainly NAND

234
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:14,110
nowadays with the device that have a lot

235
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:16,089
of storage embedded where is basically a

236
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:18,790
storage inside the phone itself so it's

237
00:10:16,089 --> 00:10:21,220
not an external storage and if you look

238
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:24,310
also as well photo renamed you have

239
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:27,010
really similar structure as internal

240
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:29,380
storage we strongly give the impression

241
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:31,750
when you are a simple app dev a person

242
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:33,939
without mainly security knowledge that

243
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:36,279
you have the same practices at the same

244
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:40,060
security because you stole you file and

245
00:10:36,279 --> 00:10:41,709
your own app folder in the SD card so

246
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:46,000
it's really the same so sure as the

247
00:10:41,709 --> 00:10:48,369
private photo and as I said also the

248
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:52,899
documentation triggers won't expect it

249
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:55,350
if you don't read it carefully so before

250
00:10:52,899 --> 00:10:57,370
about talking about the security

251
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:59,200
implementation and why we should care

252
00:10:57,370 --> 00:11:01,839
about internal versus external let's

253
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,820
talk about what we when I used to have

254
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:04,650
an answer as kind of a feature of the

255
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:06,480
external storage

256
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:08,340
so the first one is that when he reads

257
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,740
documentation you see that if you use

258
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:12,840
some function call while we start fine

259
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:16,590
on the device it is not removed after

260
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:18,360
you earnest at the app so some people

261
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:21,870
see that as a nice feature for returning

262
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:24,270
users meaning if you put files there the

263
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:27,740
user Anastasi app and restart the app

264
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:30,780
was data still here and walking

265
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:34,980
obviously well is true which means that

266
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:39,060
it's accessible and the second answer is

267
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:40,800
that well we don't report SDK like I was

268
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:42,540
talking with Windows that says look have

269
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:45,060
an issue because you stole all you find

270
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:46,920
on such as DeKalb where the answer was

271
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:48,569
yes we know but we don't support

272
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:52,229
external sdcard so that's not a problem

273
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:53,990
for us well I mean now I mean like FD

274
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:56,700
CAD is an Internet photos I said before

275
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:58,080
however as I will so I also talked at

276
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:59,790
the end of this talk is that

277
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:01,950
even if these arguments are so obvious

278
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:03,750
to do so that they are wrong don't try

279
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:05,910
to use that in baboon tease because like

280
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:07,010
I said at hand they will never agree

281
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:10,560
with that

282
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:12,180
ok so now let's talk about security here

283
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:15,660
again boss from a system point of view

284
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:17,449
no an adaptive view so as I said

285
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:21,060
probably data is private it means that

286
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:22,950
all is he have can access to the files

287
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:26,189
inside the private directories is

288
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:28,860
protected by two levels by the Linux

289
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:30,900
permission system and if we start to

290
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:32,370
talk about no get by what we called an

291
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:34,949
exception if you try to access files

292
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:39,330
from an app that is not the app owning

293
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:42,630
the private directory when we talk about

294
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:45,600
the external data so the SD count folder

295
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:48,840
and if we stick to the Android function

296
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:52,080
course we have permission required to

297
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:53,850
access this folder so like before K

298
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:56,430
before KitKat it was required this

299
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:58,980
permission for any action and since a

300
00:12:56,430 --> 00:13:00,870
kid card we only require read

301
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:05,970
external storage to access any folders

302
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:09,420
that is not on external shared folder

303
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:11,790
and if we access directly is not with

304
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:15,380
the standard function called Android is

305
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:15,380
still the same

306
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:19,930
if we talk very quickly about how it

307
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:21,550
works in terms of implementation so we

308
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:23,680
have pure words that when we create a

309
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:25,930
directory we are what we called a demon

310
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:28,329
that is handling all the security on her

311
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:31,420
behalf and when we want to access files

312
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:34,690
it is on the external storage we have

313
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:37,089
what we call a control bay by the rapper

314
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:39,190
as you see as a file system level so we

315
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:42,010
had before fuse which is file system in

316
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:44,830
user space and now we start to have

317
00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:46,450
sdcard FS which here again is misleading

318
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:48,160
wall because it's not the file system of

319
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:51,400
the sdcard but as the file system of the

320
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:55,900
slash as the current folder which is not

321
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:57,280
external and until Q that will believe

322
00:13:55,900 --> 00:14:00,730
that we start already up to the

323
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:03,480
developer releases everything is owned

324
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:05,860
by SD count so we don't have fine grade

325
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:09,040
ownership on the SD card

326
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:13,510
I mean that we change with Q and a lot

327
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:15,280
of promises on them ok the other stuff

328
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:16,689
is that content provider because that's

329
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:20,620
nice promote to talk when we want to

330
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:22,240
talk about data we have a definition

331
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:24,310
that these private data sheet option

332
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:26,440
that will be a short story never be

333
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:31,270
altered which means that normally that

334
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:33,100
cannot be accessed however they can be

335
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:35,350
made readable and editable by what we

336
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:39,940
call a content provider we should be

337
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:41,890
mandatory starting queue here again that

338
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:44,380
is a question person for some people

339
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:46,660
want to answer maybe like this general

340
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:55,060
question who knows about content

341
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:57,189
provider on Android yes very few I

342
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:59,199
should have said concept inability an

343
00:14:57,190 --> 00:15:01,360
analyst to like this money you have a

344
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:03,960
workshop about like using Rosa for

345
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:06,270
example which is a way to analyze

346
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:08,980
insecurity in content provider

347
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:11,710
ok so content provider is first a

348
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:13,420
feature to expose data out of the box so

349
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:15,250
basically by just using this framework

350
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:19,079
and doing like this very small line of

351
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:22,660
code you share your private data folders

352
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:25,560
let's say in a secure way but it's also

353
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:28,209
a framework to expose data as you wish

354
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:29,140
magically you not only expose files

355
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:31,180
which weeks

356
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:32,980
can expose database you can expose

357
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:35,410
queries you can expose a lot of things

358
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:39,100
with the frame evasion of the content

359
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:42,040
provider and so it's a very powerful

360
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:44,260
framework however if not fully

361
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:47,019
understood is better to stay away from

362
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:48,880
it as a framework because you start to

363
00:15:47,019 --> 00:15:53,260
expose a lot I mean like you re

364
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:55,930
vulnerable however is not a reason not

365
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:58,269
to use a content provider as a feature

366
00:15:55,930 --> 00:16:00,339
because by using it as in with the basic

367
00:15:58,269 --> 00:16:02,680
definition we were suppose you find in a

368
00:16:00,339 --> 00:16:05,790
secure way I mean like you just have to

369
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:08,949
pay attention to how you name folders

370
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:10,240
sorry like basically here like you just

371
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:13,510
have to pay attention to this line which

372
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:15,279
says which photo you share well I don't

373
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:19,209
see that very complicated to do you want

374
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:20,829
to be secure developer perspective what

375
00:16:19,209 --> 00:16:22,089
documentation is really complex and and

376
00:16:20,829 --> 00:16:23,529
we like you have a lot of documentation

377
00:16:22,089 --> 00:16:25,870
a lot of place to find it so the

378
00:16:23,529 --> 00:16:29,019
learning curve is not is kind of high

379
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:30,370
and obviously we are very know that the

380
00:16:29,019 --> 00:16:32,860
documentation is not the sexiest thing

381
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:34,329
on the planet private photo is a

382
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:36,100
constraint like if you talk with

383
00:16:34,329 --> 00:16:37,660
developers you will see that private

384
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:39,399
folder is bad because like it's hard to

385
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:40,540
debug it's hard to share data I mean

386
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:42,790
like hard to share data when you have

387
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:44,980
content provider here again it's much

388
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:47,980
more that you don't know and you don't

389
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:50,500
read the documentation until the hand

390
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:52,810
external photo is great I mean like from

391
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:54,279
a developer perspective it's easy to

392
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:57,339
debug I mean like you just plug in the

393
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:59,500
USB and have access to the to the SDK

394
00:16:57,339 --> 00:17:02,790
folder you have a lot of storage and

395
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:06,669
persistence is possible and data sharing

396
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:07,928
is believed to be easier here again well

397
00:17:06,669 --> 00:17:10,240
what's the difference between doing like

398
00:17:07,929 --> 00:17:14,260
a open file or sheriff I with content

399
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:18,579
provider like it's really 20 minute

400
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:20,559
different consequences of this belief of

401
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:22,809
developers probably photo is mostly used

402
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:25,030
when strongly suggested I mean I I put

403
00:17:22,809 --> 00:17:28,000
mostly X percent we will see later what

404
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:30,460
this X percent means basically it's me

405
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:33,220
that you have a function call call get

406
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:35,410
data base path well basically everybody

407
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:38,280
every developer we use it so data base

408
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:40,950
our muscles are not exposed

409
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:42,910
however the external private folder is

410
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:46,720
extensively used because

411
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:48,850
as private and we still have some

412
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:51,220
developers that care about security and

413
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:54,159
protecting in code because basically is

414
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:57,580
a care first trick where we put the file

415
00:17:54,160 --> 00:18:00,100
in the slash SD card instead of my data

416
00:17:57,580 --> 00:18:03,520
that way nobody will find it if you try

417
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:05,980
to find my data on my father second

418
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:08,320
trick we make the for the name of the

419
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:10,210
file I'm invisible by prefixing with dot

420
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:12,939
you know like that's wearing Linux to

421
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:18,370
hide files unless you do L but like if

422
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:21,400
you do LS dash ace is their answer trick

423
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:23,290
like if you stole major when best

424
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:26,800
practice is to use what we call a media

425
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:29,170
manager intend to say my data is here

426
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:31,240
well one way to hide your file commit to

427
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:34,360
developer is not to do this intent so

428
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:40,060
nobody we know that files are on the SD

429
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:44,159
card I mean like really I mean like here

430
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:46,690
again that's very bad an old practices

431
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:48,940
ok so now that we see is the developer

432
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:50,500
perspective what does it means when you

433
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:53,830
have an Android phone like why really

434
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:59,770
happen real life with real application

435
00:18:53,830 --> 00:19:02,800
ok so your initial objective was we

436
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:08,020
report any non explicitly shared data

437
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:09,940
that we see I didn't help well because

438
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:12,250
most of times responds well well it's

439
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:15,070
not critical expose data I mean like

440
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:17,740
really you expose user data of corporate

441
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:21,790
database not critical I mean ask you

442
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:23,230
user no better option I mean I Hudgens

443
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:25,149
so that yeah we know we expose the date

444
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:27,550
of the user but we don't have any better

445
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:30,580
option well yes you have content

446
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:32,770
provider or the third answer was yeah we

447
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:36,360
know that pair Deepak is insecure but

448
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:38,680
user can change the storage location I

449
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:40,300
mean like really now you start to blame

450
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:43,330
your own user for bad thirty-foot

451
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:45,790
configuration so that wasn't that good

452
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:47,260
and like after maybe one month two

453
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:49,789
months of sending this kind of report

454
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:53,879
like you start to be very depressing

455
00:19:49,789 --> 00:19:55,320
however you know like I was obvious in

456
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:57,510
picture like I be back so where's the

457
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:59,610
semi put is that we upgraded the

458
00:19:57,510 --> 00:20:04,408
objective to say to people like come on

459
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:06,990
now like you can not say that it's not

460
00:20:04,409 --> 00:20:09,419
important like we show that we

461
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:12,029
specifically target data that is paid

462
00:20:09,419 --> 00:20:14,250
definition not right to share that the

463
00:20:12,029 --> 00:20:16,080
only way to put these people like in

464
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:18,390
front of the issue and they cannot say

465
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:20,480
anything so basically we show that we

466
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:23,309
can expose user and notification

467
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:25,320
application secret user password use a

468
00:20:23,309 --> 00:20:29,820
web activity copyright data and user

469
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:32,370
sensitive data and nan da bollocks

470
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:34,260
but still as we would see even if that's

471
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:36,750
so obvious that this should not be

472
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:39,419
shared it's still very complicated to

473
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:41,340
make vendors agree with the statement so

474
00:20:39,419 --> 00:20:43,260
the candidate was that we don't forget

475
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:45,000
any apps like we wanted to like here

476
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:47,100
again target people that normally know

477
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:51,990
their job and when we dis critical

478
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:55,320
report agree with us so basically we we

479
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:57,779
try to target this kind of issues so as

480
00:20:55,320 --> 00:21:00,990
I said use a PII image User Profile

481
00:20:57,779 --> 00:21:04,429
password bank information authentication

482
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:07,289
token credential protocol a notification

483
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:09,090
browsing I mean all the desktop we try

484
00:21:07,289 --> 00:21:11,309
to see what we can do and this is

485
00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:13,168
interesting is that basically if most of

486
00:21:11,309 --> 00:21:15,899
the major app leaks this kind of data

487
00:21:13,169 --> 00:21:18,630
and when I say most of the major app

488
00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:19,949
like this is number of Donald official

489
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:22,820
in the Play Store like you see that

490
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:26,690
images are disclosed by app with 2,000

491
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:30,870
done load user profiles with 5.4 billion

492
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:33,240
password in 100,000 bank information 6

493
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:34,649
million manic and I mean that like the

494
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:37,190
worthless but basically we had an

495
00:21:34,649 --> 00:21:39,870
expectation to target still a good

496
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:42,419
reasonable size of the user base to to

497
00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:44,370
say like you know like come on like your

498
00:21:42,419 --> 00:21:48,390
handlings data of million of users like

499
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:49,590
you should really care okay so how do we

500
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:51,809
look for bugs

501
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:53,520
so we first try to categorize the issue

502
00:21:51,809 --> 00:21:58,440
we want to target and we list is a

503
00:21:53,520 --> 00:22:00,658
relevant candidate for say target we

504
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:02,880
detected the issue on one of the app so

505
00:22:00,659 --> 00:22:03,580
it's like a manual steps then we try to

506
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:07,170
categorize

507
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:10,149
issue and define a reproduction pattern

508
00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:13,870
when then the idea was to automate this

509
00:22:10,150 --> 00:22:15,850
analysis which obviously has not really

510
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:18,280
possible so basically the only thing was

511
00:22:15,850 --> 00:22:19,959
automated is brain meaning we know how

512
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:21,700
to do poor bug we know which back to

513
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:23,650
look and radically Winstar we look we

514
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:25,960
stop we look so we shall have some part

515
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:28,600
of automation which is the brain pattern

516
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:30,460
and then obviously after we did that we

517
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:35,280
were start at one so it was really this

518
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:39,460
kind of game and that would present now

519
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:44,350
ok so first one how to get user identity

520
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:45,730
from logs logs I mean like everybody

521
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:49,320
knows here log contain a lot of data

522
00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:51,190
really a lot read too much and

523
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:52,540
developers particularly I have these

524
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:54,400
nice stuff that when they put logs they

525
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:57,879
basically want to be if they want to

526
00:22:54,400 --> 00:23:02,140
easily use them basically they put on

527
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:04,420
these logs in data IDs everything that

528
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:06,580
indentifies the user from the kind of

529
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:08,620
view but it's also true for any

530
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:10,800
attackers like if by looking at the log

531
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:13,750
and that developer can know the user

532
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:17,800
well any people works as the log can

533
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:20,260
know the same thing for example here I

534
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:22,360
just put here true to example of log

535
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:25,180
that we see we still the first ones that

536
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:28,360
basically the user ID is disclosed and

537
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:29,800
the email when we try to log in so

538
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:32,260
basically just by looking the log below

539
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:35,879
the user email address without any

540
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:38,200
permission except read external storage

541
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:40,900
another one was that basically we were

542
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:44,200
leaking the account token and silicon

543
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:47,560
token was a way to access user gender

544
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:50,260
user email user first name last name

545
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:54,580
phone number so just by looking as a log

546
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:56,320
we we get very nice information so how

547
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:58,480
we detected that we may discrete it

548
00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:01,780
basically every time we install an app

549
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:05,350
or set of app look for by grab email

550
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:07,000
address or people like Auto token and by

551
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:11,260
only doing that we get like all this

552
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:13,150
information how to avoid that with very

553
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:15,070
easy log you are clean you logs I mean

554
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:16,530
like don't put user pin I on on the log

555
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:19,080
the stupid

556
00:24:16,530 --> 00:24:20,668
and keep them private I mean like saying

557
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:22,399
that we put the log on external storage

558
00:24:20,669 --> 00:24:26,280
because they are too big is kind of

559
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:28,169
nonsense like you can you can zip them

560
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:29,850
you can rotate them I mean like it's

561
00:24:28,169 --> 00:24:31,919
very bad better best practices regarding

562
00:24:29,850 --> 00:24:35,520
locking and like you already have

563
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:38,340
framework to do log in correctly another

564
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:40,559
way to extract user on your identity is

565
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:42,059
based on naming convention which was

566
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:44,190
another funny stuff which is like

567
00:24:42,059 --> 00:24:46,710
basically lot of haves nowadays handle

568
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:49,559
me tea but I can't visit in the app so

569
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:51,840
our social networks data management

570
00:24:49,559 --> 00:24:54,120
application and they did a way to

571
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:55,799
separate data sets meaning like I can't

572
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:59,039
one icon curtain three there are

573
00:24:55,799 --> 00:25:01,500
different photos and the insecure

574
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:03,539
approach that we often see is basically

575
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:07,559
to use the user email address as a

576
00:25:03,539 --> 00:25:11,100
folder name or to use the user ID as a

577
00:25:07,559 --> 00:25:12,658
folder name well I just put here two

578
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:14,399
lines so one is worth like when we do

579
00:25:12,659 --> 00:25:16,500
things you have my email that was

580
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:19,260
discussed every time and when using

581
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:22,320
author app offline cache where the

582
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:24,059
social ID was disclosed and we don't pay

583
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:27,480
intention over like this socialite is a

584
00:25:24,059 --> 00:25:28,830
very weird set of letters so when you

585
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:31,830
look at that you don't understand why it

586
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:33,658
means and luckily for me well I know

587
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:36,030
very well these social IDs when I look

588
00:25:33,659 --> 00:25:38,700
at this photo name I say like it ring

589
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:42,240
the bell and basically it was the rule

590
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:44,970
completes social ID social network ID of

591
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:48,230
the user so by just looking at finance

592
00:25:44,970 --> 00:25:51,480
we know who you are without asking any

593
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:53,370
relevant permission so the detection

594
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:56,130
method is basically instead of grab

595
00:25:53,370 --> 00:25:59,399
while you find I like it's very very

596
00:25:56,130 --> 00:26:01,289
great for one and what's the best

597
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:04,950
practices don't do that I mean like here

598
00:26:01,289 --> 00:26:06,600
again you can hash you can do like an

599
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:08,220
internal mapping and private database

600
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:10,110
that's here again but best practice is

601
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:12,720
like don't put an email address as a

602
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:13,110
folder I mean like this that makes no

603
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:16,789
sense

604
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:19,678
you can hash that means the same Unisa t

605
00:26:16,789 --> 00:26:22,799
so user profiling what's in second issue

606
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:24,330
we're trying to do meaning like let's

607
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:27,980
assume that your identity is protected

608
00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:30,059
can we guess what's your preferences so

609
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:30,390
basically we had the state methods to

610
00:26:30,059 --> 00:26:32,010
the

611
00:26:30,390 --> 00:26:33,870
IP address is not a sufficient SiC is

612
00:26:32,010 --> 00:26:35,730
too easy to get on Android like well

613
00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:37,620
while your protein on the web so we

614
00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:41,840
wanted to know exactly when what and

615
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:44,310
where you are doing so one way to

616
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:47,070
basically do user profiling on social

617
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:49,080
network a social network application is

618
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:51,060
basically to look at the cache because

619
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:54,120
every time you visit a page where you

620
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:55,110
get somehow some cache that is shared on

621
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:57,479
external storage

622
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:59,820
so the first cache was that basically

623
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:02,790
every header of the page you visit on

624
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:05,010
this social app was cache as the header

625
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:07,110
is unique to the page so we know exactly

626
00:27:05,010 --> 00:27:09,960
which page you are visiting when art is

627
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:12,629
for the first time the second way is to

628
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:14,790
get the user identity by looking at the

629
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:17,550
picture cache is the user picture cache

630
00:27:14,790 --> 00:27:19,320
the first picture is your picture so

631
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:21,840
basically here again we're not talking

632
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:23,580
about an application with like 10,000

633
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:26,550
download we're talking with application

634
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:28,379
with billions and yet the file the

635
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:31,139
picture file can be easily Google

636
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:35,640
reversed picture to know who you are in

637
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:37,290
in matter of seconds another very

638
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:41,700
interesting thing is web browsing so if

639
00:27:37,290 --> 00:27:43,379
you lose some web apps they will they

640
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:45,780
will catch the while because the webview

641
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:49,980
is the external storage and by the case

642
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:53,010
the webview cache is a word page so we

643
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:55,530
know everything that you visit which

644
00:27:53,010 --> 00:27:57,510
page and sometimes we even get the

645
00:27:55,530 --> 00:28:01,139
credentials that you use within the page

646
00:27:57,510 --> 00:28:02,730
and here again how to avoid that is

647
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:04,050
basically to assert behavior on the

648
00:28:02,730 --> 00:28:06,480
under link component you are using

649
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:07,500
because most of the times this hub don't

650
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:09,090
even know that that leaking this

651
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:11,460
information because they use some kind

652
00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:13,980
of some a generation of the use here for

653
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:16,890
this case a webview component that is

654
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:19,100
not their own development okay so

655
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:22,560
another one is playing with geolocation

656
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:26,340
and so when dealing with maps and GPS

657
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:27,870
you often have a lot of data and the

658
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:32,010
insecure approach is to consider that

659
00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:35,909
all GPS data or similar meaning you save

660
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:38,160
everything in the same location and when

661
00:28:35,910 --> 00:28:40,380
I says anything is poison pearl

662
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:42,570
well they use a database associated to

663
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:43,049
the GPS map do it alone where you put

664
00:28:42,570 --> 00:28:45,389
them

665
00:28:43,049 --> 00:28:46,739
next to the maps I mean like it's kind

666
00:28:45,389 --> 00:28:48,418
of logically make sense when you're not

667
00:28:46,739 --> 00:28:50,309
the repels you put all the same or the

668
00:28:48,419 --> 00:28:54,299
logically linked data in the same

669
00:28:50,309 --> 00:28:57,379
location well I mean here for example

670
00:28:54,299 --> 00:28:59,820
like it was a map application that

671
00:28:57,379 --> 00:29:02,969
serialized the values of your

672
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:04,769
preferences well means okay you get the

673
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:08,279
SQL database you don't understand what

674
00:29:04,769 --> 00:29:09,450
the format is while you just play some

675
00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:11,070
kind of guess and you see very quickly

676
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:14,519
just serialize and you export everything

677
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:17,039
and the way to detect that was basically

678
00:29:14,519 --> 00:29:18,629
to look at any exposed SQL SQL like

679
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:21,059
database on Android on the external

680
00:29:18,629 --> 00:29:26,399
storage why here again just a basic crap

681
00:29:21,059 --> 00:29:27,989
about SQLite and two things here don't

682
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:30,238
believe that read external storage is

683
00:29:27,989 --> 00:29:31,830
the same as access fine location like I

684
00:29:30,239 --> 00:29:35,669
said the value of the data that you're

685
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:37,259
storing and the other thing is that

686
00:29:35,669 --> 00:29:39,359
don't believe that because you use a

687
00:29:37,259 --> 00:29:40,499
custom format users will not be able to

688
00:29:39,359 --> 00:29:42,178
I mean like attackers would be able to

689
00:29:40,499 --> 00:29:43,739
understand what's this format because

690
00:29:42,179 --> 00:29:46,169
they can just install the app on another

691
00:29:43,739 --> 00:29:50,759
device whose the file and the device

692
00:29:46,169 --> 00:29:52,859
running the app so another way to play

693
00:29:50,759 --> 00:29:56,580
with GPS the location is regarding

694
00:29:52,859 --> 00:29:58,080
integrity here we have some SQLite

695
00:29:56,580 --> 00:30:01,830
database it is not even cellular that

696
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:05,759
whole not encrypted here again same

697
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:09,600
patent of detection and basically we can

698
00:30:05,759 --> 00:30:12,210
insert that information into GPS of the

699
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:14,699
GPS app meaning we can insert fake route

700
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:16,950
we can accept fake preferences towards

701
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:21,169
the preferences and basically just

702
00:30:16,950 --> 00:30:24,269
describe a user experience for example

703
00:30:21,169 --> 00:30:26,489
okay extracting implicit configuration

704
00:30:24,269 --> 00:30:29,970
assets so documentation are often

705
00:30:26,489 --> 00:30:32,609
documents are often seven devices only

706
00:30:29,970 --> 00:30:34,859
for one reason you want to have offline

707
00:30:32,609 --> 00:30:37,049
support meaning like you cooperate and

708
00:30:34,859 --> 00:30:38,369
you have data well you want to save them

709
00:30:37,049 --> 00:30:42,779
on your device because you want to

710
00:30:38,369 --> 00:30:44,340
access them locally and the insecure

711
00:30:42,779 --> 00:30:48,119
approach is to consider the documents

712
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:49,738
when and not sensitive and the second

713
00:30:48,119 --> 00:30:51,389
stuff that this link is that basically

714
00:30:49,739 --> 00:30:53,609
as is not sensitive user don't need to

715
00:30:51,389 --> 00:30:56,248
know where we store them can see here

716
00:30:53,609 --> 00:30:56,610
was one mistake so the example is that

717
00:30:56,249 --> 00:30:59,220
body

718
00:30:56,610 --> 00:31:02,729
we users hard-code the storage location

719
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:04,710
I don't say that to the user the second

720
00:31:02,730 --> 00:31:06,900
thing is that while you hide the

721
00:31:04,710 --> 00:31:11,340
capacity to change the storage directory

722
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:13,830
and basically we only had to detect a

723
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:15,389
file change which is super easy like we

724
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:17,970
have file Observer that you can extend

725
00:31:15,390 --> 00:31:20,040
path file observer on Android and

726
00:31:17,970 --> 00:31:22,790
basically we are aware every time the

727
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:25,920
file is asserted on the external storage

728
00:31:22,790 --> 00:31:27,960
and here again the only mistake is that

729
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:29,490
while I'm if I don't make that static on

730
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:30,990
the external storage because like some

731
00:31:29,490 --> 00:31:32,700
people that use rehab may want to store

732
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:35,549
confidential data and they want to know

733
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:38,490
where is told what is to choose that and

734
00:31:35,549 --> 00:31:40,530
the second option is that I mean let the

735
00:31:38,490 --> 00:31:42,270
user decide what is going to store and

736
00:31:40,530 --> 00:31:45,030
make it by default secure like if the

737
00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:46,530
user want to have a lot of data just

738
00:31:45,030 --> 00:31:48,090
giving the option to put that in the

739
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:50,668
external storage but don't assume by

740
00:31:48,090 --> 00:31:54,720
default that it's an external like it's

741
00:31:50,669 --> 00:31:57,000
not your data if you use the data when

742
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:59,490
we extend about this configuration later

743
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:01,380
we can talk about explicit confidential

744
00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:03,570
data which is like encrypted documents

745
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:06,570
and here again what sometimes you

746
00:32:03,570 --> 00:32:08,178
approach is exactly the same which is we

747
00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:12,299
don't tell you the way we store and

748
00:32:08,179 --> 00:32:14,370
another consideration is that as we are

749
00:32:12,299 --> 00:32:16,260
on Android system we don't give the

750
00:32:14,370 --> 00:32:17,909
encryption key like we keep that on the

751
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:20,429
server like you know is top secret top

752
00:32:17,910 --> 00:32:23,429
important so we don't share that on the

753
00:32:20,429 --> 00:32:27,929
Android system which is here not a bad

754
00:32:23,429 --> 00:32:29,970
vision but the issue is that when you

755
00:32:27,929 --> 00:32:32,370
stop file in the a personal photo and

756
00:32:29,970 --> 00:32:34,860
you want to allow them to view while you

757
00:32:32,370 --> 00:32:37,709
have an issue because you don't have the

758
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:40,168
encryption key so basically we have what

759
00:32:37,710 --> 00:32:41,910
people we just have the do sorry is

760
00:32:40,169 --> 00:32:44,760
basically they will take the sensitive

761
00:32:41,910 --> 00:32:46,950
data encrypted data from the server they

762
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:49,260
will put that on the external storage

763
00:32:46,950 --> 00:32:50,760
and two options first one is that we

764
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:54,980
just put them and encrypted because we

765
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:57,929
don't have the encryption key luckily we

766
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:59,730
decrypt them on the fly and put them on

767
00:32:57,929 --> 00:33:03,710
the external storage which in the end is

768
00:32:59,730 --> 00:33:05,910
the same we have an encrypted

769
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:09,700
confidential material on the external

770
00:33:05,910 --> 00:33:11,409
storage while detection method is

771
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:13,899
really that is the same is like we just

772
00:33:11,409 --> 00:33:15,490
went over file change and like yeah I

773
00:33:13,899 --> 00:33:19,449
mean like just here again pay attention

774
00:33:15,490 --> 00:33:21,220
when you store fight just pay attention

775
00:33:19,450 --> 00:33:22,659
to what you store and how like like when

776
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:24,639
I was talking about explicitly

777
00:33:22,659 --> 00:33:26,980
confidential data it was even a feature

778
00:33:24,639 --> 00:33:31,090
and said AB that said we have we use

779
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:33,820
this kind of vault or like secure vault

780
00:33:31,090 --> 00:33:35,649
or encrypted folder feature this is a

781
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:37,120
paid feature but basically it's just

782
00:33:35,649 --> 00:33:41,918
like a folder on the external storage in

783
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:43,719
x2z and secure folder ok extracting a

784
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:47,740
special confidential data I will just

785
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:49,630
sync the time still absent so when we

786
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:51,399
want to extract impeach confidential

787
00:33:49,630 --> 00:33:54,850
data on the other stuff is that

788
00:33:51,399 --> 00:33:56,949
basically when you SMS no MMS most of

789
00:33:54,850 --> 00:33:57,449
the user would believe that way it's

790
00:33:56,950 --> 00:33:59,860
fine

791
00:33:57,450 --> 00:34:05,440
files can be stole like the files that

792
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:06,639
you have put on the MMS he had so we put

793
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:09,040
that on the shelf to read

794
00:34:06,639 --> 00:34:11,679
I mean like basically you expose any

795
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:14,440
date on send is an MMS to any

796
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:16,450
application installed on the device even

797
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:17,829
if you could then private and even if

798
00:34:16,449 --> 00:34:19,418
it's not an MMS app is just like a

799
00:34:17,829 --> 00:34:22,839
conversation have inside the banking

800
00:34:19,418 --> 00:34:24,270
application with your bank manager some

801
00:34:22,839 --> 00:34:26,259
people at the configuration

802
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:29,889
consideration that as you share with

803
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:31,179
someone while shared with everybody so

804
00:34:29,889 --> 00:34:33,550
the detection method here again was

805
00:34:31,179 --> 00:34:38,020
super easy just like instantly have play

806
00:34:33,550 --> 00:34:40,659
with it and see was disclosed and one

807
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:43,329
way to do that better is just to assert

808
00:34:40,659 --> 00:34:44,710
how data I generated like if you action

809
00:34:43,329 --> 00:34:46,419
an MMS with the fact that is already

810
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:48,550
stolen the SD card yeah it's fine to

811
00:34:46,418 --> 00:34:50,560
catch it on the SD card but if it's

812
00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:52,569
taken from the camera for the PAL you

813
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:56,020
take a nice picture of yourself and you

814
00:34:52,569 --> 00:34:57,490
want to send that to your partner well

815
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:59,259
maybe you don't want that to be

816
00:34:57,490 --> 00:35:04,089
disclosed to any other app installed on

817
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:08,260
the device okay next one injecting

818
00:35:04,089 --> 00:35:10,660
private data I was talking about how can

819
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:13,180
we can access data that is told on the

820
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:14,890
external storage another thing that is

821
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:17,319
very nice is that basically you can do

822
00:35:14,890 --> 00:35:20,049
the same time of alteration basically

823
00:35:17,319 --> 00:35:20,980
every stud on the on the external folder

824
00:35:20,050 --> 00:35:23,680
like a remote

825
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:26,530
like cooperate date on file Leticia

826
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:29,200
stood on the NAM on server well if

827
00:35:26,530 --> 00:35:31,330
you're an app another app I mean you can

828
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:33,310
just overwrite the file locally as the

829
00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:34,660
next end user will open the data man it

830
00:35:33,310 --> 00:35:36,790
will have it will sing back to the

831
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:38,950
server the modification that you made

832
00:35:36,790 --> 00:35:44,279
which is quite cool to upload any data

833
00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:44,279
that you want on the corporate server

834
00:35:44,730 --> 00:35:50,440
one of the see what's possible is that

835
00:35:47,109 --> 00:35:51,730
basically if you want to share file

836
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:55,600
acknowledged you have the share feature

837
00:35:51,730 --> 00:35:57,490
like I want to share to the Bluetooth by

838
00:35:55,600 --> 00:36:00,130
bluetooth to another device I want to

839
00:35:57,490 --> 00:36:02,950
share by email most of these have what

840
00:36:00,130 --> 00:36:04,720
they do is that they wished oh the

841
00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:06,580
temporary file that is the action

842
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:09,339
between sharing to the other half in the

843
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:11,619
external folder and none as I say that

844
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:13,480
is super great is a basically it will

845
00:36:11,619 --> 00:36:15,880
even disclose the fact that they put

846
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:17,950
that in the external folder so as an

847
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:20,730
attacker just have to basically add this

848
00:36:17,950 --> 00:36:24,368
right on out of the data so that G

849
00:36:20,730 --> 00:36:26,470
genuine sender said the malicious file

850
00:36:24,369 --> 00:36:28,840
to the receiver and here again whether I

851
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:31,209
talk about Mac application while

852
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:32,770
magically the bad manager will trust

853
00:36:31,210 --> 00:36:37,630
your input because you believe it's use

854
00:36:32,770 --> 00:36:39,460
input Y it's not okay so I will just I

855
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:40,930
think I'm running long time so this is

856
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:44,440
exactly the same stuff so we'll just

857
00:36:40,930 --> 00:36:47,649
keep that one and I will talk about

858
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:48,760
extracting shared private data you have

859
00:36:47,650 --> 00:36:51,390
to understand that I'm going to disclose

860
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:53,590
the data you don't disclose data no like

861
00:36:51,390 --> 00:36:54,430
when this comes to data you don't

862
00:36:53,590 --> 00:36:56,170
discuss to data

863
00:36:54,430 --> 00:36:59,259
well you disk use to data and the

864
00:36:56,170 --> 00:37:01,330
aggregation of site data and that has to

865
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:03,490
be considered carefully be comfortable

866
00:37:01,330 --> 00:37:05,710
when you disclose action traces or

867
00:37:03,490 --> 00:37:07,930
interaction traces when you disclose the

868
00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:10,450
word price you don't disclose each line

869
00:37:07,930 --> 00:37:12,399
individually which means that attackers

870
00:37:10,450 --> 00:37:14,980
for example here when they see this kind

871
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:17,500
of line repeating note that possible

872
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:20,170
this heidi here is always so it was for

873
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:23,080
remote control application was always

874
00:37:20,170 --> 00:37:24,940
disclose the but the case the controller

875
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:27,310
ID was always this one with that name

876
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:31,270
that one so basically we can start to

877
00:37:27,310 --> 00:37:33,490
know will connect to the device of the

878
00:37:31,270 --> 00:37:34,300
user by this disclosure of internal data

879
00:37:33,490 --> 00:37:38,290
that seems

880
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:41,200
important and what is great with that is

881
00:37:38,290 --> 00:37:43,690
particularly we can as an attacker fake

882
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:45,430
remote connection by using the same I

883
00:37:43,690 --> 00:37:47,320
mean at the same ID badly the same name

884
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:49,540
and the user we get a pop-up that

885
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:51,790
someone with the same name as the one we

886
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:53,980
have that user control device wants to

887
00:37:51,790 --> 00:37:56,410
connect worse and I will not disclose

888
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:59,650
the exact repetition stats but basically

889
00:37:56,410 --> 00:38:01,810
we can just cancel sometime we can even

890
00:37:59,650 --> 00:38:03,430
cancel the genuine request and replace

891
00:38:01,810 --> 00:38:04,779
with Ron and the user would still

892
00:38:03,430 --> 00:38:06,370
believe that is a correct user because

893
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:09,480
the name which is your information

894
00:38:06,370 --> 00:38:13,750
displayed is the same

895
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:16,660
okay so extracting user secrets some

896
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:19,360
date on some in update on are the facto

897
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:22,359
sensitive like it's not equation and

898
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:25,300
it's wrong to secure that every day does

899
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:26,950
at this process within the hub as is

900
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:30,160
processed within the hub or is view

901
00:38:26,950 --> 00:38:32,379
within the hub can be disclosed and here

902
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:35,230
present perm I'm talking about like when

903
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:37,180
you connect with yet app connect to the

904
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:38,620
remote server and there is a failure and

905
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:40,299
you want to log this site failure

906
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:42,100
basically don't hurt him that the

907
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:45,130
failure is caused by the user wrong

908
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:47,230
inputs because when you do that where

909
00:38:45,130 --> 00:38:49,210
basically you put on the log email first

910
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:51,310
name last name and password which

911
00:38:49,210 --> 00:38:54,220
sometimes if it's a server-side mistake

912
00:38:51,310 --> 00:38:55,860
Israel is a password so basically on the

913
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:59,350
lock you put the user email and password

914
00:38:55,860 --> 00:39:02,740
weathers great same thing when someone

915
00:38:59,350 --> 00:39:04,270
is viewing content and rehab I'm like he

916
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:06,669
said because I'm doing that on the app

917
00:39:04,270 --> 00:39:09,190
that you can disclose the bank account

918
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:11,200
some Bank apps when you look at the bank

919
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:13,480
account within do you have just cash

920
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:15,580
that because the PDF they need to be

921
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:16,660
rendered sweetened to bestow luckily but

922
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:20,110
it's temporary

923
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:24,069
so we just put that on on the shared

924
00:39:20,110 --> 00:39:25,900
folder and it's just not right okay so

925
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:29,740
evolution of this 2d I mean I'm so

926
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:31,870
seeking evolution of this of the study

927
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:33,850
so I know this process was a really time

928
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:36,339
consuming stuff right like we spend

929
00:39:33,850 --> 00:39:39,130
months because it was manually installed

930
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:41,589
manually start which app because we had

931
00:39:39,130 --> 00:39:44,200
to sign up most of the time

932
00:39:41,589 --> 00:39:45,970
we had permanent retraction meaning we

933
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:47,799
found Berg we generalize the

934
00:39:45,970 --> 00:39:49,868
generalization is not good so it was

935
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:51,520
like a permanent stuff and the

936
00:39:49,869 --> 00:39:54,910
standardization is very hard because

937
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:56,410
more time the Berg is different is

938
00:39:54,910 --> 00:39:58,210
follow the same logic of incorrect

939
00:39:56,410 --> 00:39:58,990
disclosure by the way discourse is never

940
00:39:58,210 --> 00:40:01,240
the same

941
00:39:58,990 --> 00:40:03,368
so after menses we started to have

942
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:06,848
general pattern which was not a

943
00:40:03,369 --> 00:40:09,460
straightforward stuff and it happened

944
00:40:06,849 --> 00:40:13,089
relied on on on the combo in stand-up

945
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:16,150
find potentially vulnerable fine grab

946
00:40:13,089 --> 00:40:18,940
for disclosure I mean like this really

947
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:21,190
like you have to target the wrap-up

948
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:22,839
category very quickly otherwise thought

949
00:40:21,190 --> 00:40:25,480
to be very emplace and that up to days

950
00:40:22,839 --> 00:40:26,560
of in standing apps you find no bug I

951
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:29,050
mean like when you find the right

952
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:31,089
category all of them are vulnerable but

953
00:40:29,050 --> 00:40:32,580
unless you find that is really like a

954
00:40:31,089 --> 00:40:37,930
not nice

955
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:39,670
so classification of the issues we have

956
00:40:37,930 --> 00:40:42,460
a lot of type of data disclosed we have

957
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:44,740
a private data we have user private data

958
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:48,160
we have device protected assets to

959
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:49,750
charge the location and and the reason

960
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:52,240
for this exposure is really limited

961
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:54,790
means the first one is up most of time

962
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:58,779
at the proprietors failed to read the

963
00:40:54,790 --> 00:41:01,210
documentation they then try to define

964
00:40:58,780 --> 00:41:04,599
like is even even not asserting is

965
00:41:01,210 --> 00:41:05,830
defining the security policy now if you

966
00:41:04,599 --> 00:41:08,080
don't design defined your security

967
00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:10,348
policy and when you consider as public

968
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:12,460
and not public well I mean like is

969
00:41:10,349 --> 00:41:14,080
stupid because like everything is

970
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:16,750
discussing way you don't even control

971
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:18,700
and the third type of failure is like

972
00:41:16,750 --> 00:41:21,430
not to perform any security test because

973
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:23,980
it's very easy when when you are the

974
00:41:21,430 --> 00:41:27,129
other purpose to just check where you'll

975
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:29,170
find as Todd in life scenario most of

976
00:41:27,130 --> 00:41:34,720
the issue were here discovered because

977
00:41:29,170 --> 00:41:38,040
it was no security assertion at all so

978
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:40,950
classification of the vendors so we have

979
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:42,660
food for people we do bad Monty I think

980
00:41:40,950 --> 00:41:45,490
they know that already

981
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:47,348
virus vendor profile so we have the

982
00:41:45,490 --> 00:41:48,520
really responsive vendor like the top

983
00:41:47,349 --> 00:41:51,480
one that

984
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:53,380
respond very quickly a couple of days

985
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:55,560
mostly time is managed by big

986
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:59,710
multi-platforms but not always

987
00:41:55,560 --> 00:42:03,580
diagonally the issues pay or give one

988
00:41:59,710 --> 00:42:06,180
your subscription to the software as you

989
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:08,590
can reap refers you see payment option

990
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:10,690
then you have non-responsive vendors

991
00:42:08,590 --> 00:42:13,570
which people that basically see your

992
00:42:10,690 --> 00:42:14,710
issue let's say I AB is out of stop

993
00:42:13,570 --> 00:42:17,110
because you know like when you do back

994
00:42:14,710 --> 00:42:19,300
when T of scope even if this is bad

995
00:42:17,110 --> 00:42:22,690
where you can still say is out of copy

996
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:25,510
see if it's out of scope also we say

997
00:42:22,690 --> 00:42:27,390
won't fix one piece for maybe two reason

998
00:42:25,510 --> 00:42:29,920
why is because the product is a

999
00:42:27,390 --> 00:42:33,069
end-of-life so what we see a lot with

1000
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:35,590
device manufacturer oh it's too much

1001
00:42:33,070 --> 00:42:38,770
work to fix so it's a question of

1002
00:42:35,590 --> 00:42:40,480
benefits versus cost and then you have a

1003
00:42:38,770 --> 00:42:42,759
third type of vendor which is majority

1004
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:44,590
of them which is a correspondence you

1005
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:47,200
send them image sensor my second email

1006
00:42:44,590 --> 00:42:51,630
says a majority made no reply of the

1007
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:54,580
couple of months but for the third one

1008
00:42:51,630 --> 00:42:56,170
type of vendors I will say that's not

1009
00:42:54,580 --> 00:42:57,850
the right approach because basically

1010
00:42:56,170 --> 00:42:59,170
we're talking with Google but like why

1011
00:42:57,850 --> 00:43:01,000
can we do I mean like when we are

1012
00:42:59,170 --> 00:43:04,270
talking about ATS applause vendors that

1013
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:06,220
disclose million of user assets I mean

1014
00:43:04,270 --> 00:43:08,230
obviously for how the next step that was

1015
00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:13,899
escalated to Google Play team and has

1016
00:43:08,230 --> 00:43:17,950
just woken to progress classification of

1017
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:19,240
the vendors after can apply than the we

1018
00:43:17,950 --> 00:43:21,939
try to understand what the vision of

1019
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:25,089
them and the first issue we had is like

1020
00:43:21,940 --> 00:43:28,570
Korea how to explain the issue to them

1021
00:43:25,090 --> 00:43:30,610
is really complicated we have to explain

1022
00:43:28,570 --> 00:43:33,940
to them was disclosing user email

1023
00:43:30,610 --> 00:43:35,140
address or Israel entity is bad I mean

1024
00:43:33,940 --> 00:43:38,020
like knowledge that their own business

1025
00:43:35,140 --> 00:43:40,000
they should know well that we have to

1026
00:43:38,020 --> 00:43:42,130
disclose also to illustrate how

1027
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,870
sensitive the data is disclosed I mean

1028
00:43:42,130 --> 00:43:46,120
like when you disclose user business

1029
00:43:43,870 --> 00:43:48,250
which has cooperate data encrypted

1030
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:51,000
cooperate data normally we don't have to

1031
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:51,000
explain why it's bad

1032
00:43:51,790 --> 00:43:57,680
for cotton provider that I mentioned

1033
00:43:54,980 --> 00:43:59,330
before we even had something to explain

1034
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:01,310
what does passed on dress up in your

1035
00:43:59,330 --> 00:44:03,799
ability means I mean like it's a very

1036
00:44:01,310 --> 00:44:06,020
well known security issue very bad for

1037
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:08,210
the war operating system but most of the

1038
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:10,520
time vendors just says you have to

1039
00:44:08,210 --> 00:44:12,830
specifically tell me why personal

1040
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:13,880
discipline variability is bad I mean

1041
00:44:12,830 --> 00:44:18,049
like you just have to type these

1042
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:19,580
keywords on Google to find ways bad and

1043
00:44:18,050 --> 00:44:21,590
the reason most of time is because you

1044
00:44:19,580 --> 00:44:24,140
should pay attention you when you talk

1045
00:44:21,590 --> 00:44:25,790
to to vendor you have to business in

1046
00:44:24,140 --> 00:44:28,640
part you have the vendor business

1047
00:44:25,790 --> 00:44:31,130
involved and you have the users of the

1048
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:33,379
vendor application business and when you

1049
00:44:31,130 --> 00:44:37,400
start to go against the vendor objective

1050
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:41,690
to protect the user business sometimes

1051
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:44,120
start to be very conflicting the other

1052
00:44:41,690 --> 00:44:46,040
issue that sometimes master time it

1053
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:50,350
doesn't even watch the effort when you

1054
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:50,350
have no reply when you get a one-year

1055
00:44:50,380 --> 00:44:57,200
subscription or when you get a t-shirt I

1056
00:44:53,630 --> 00:44:59,600
mean like it's cool yeah but when takes

1057
00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:02,450
when text how was to find the bug and

1058
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:04,839
more how was to explain the bug I mean a

1059
00:45:02,450 --> 00:45:07,750
t-shirt is not really enough

1060
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:10,840
and the last part is that even if you

1061
00:45:07,750 --> 00:45:14,320
show everything written the issue even

1062
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:19,480
in that case changing the vision vendor

1063
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:21,850
is very hard okay so conclusion even if

1064
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:23,440
I say it was very complicated and

1065
00:45:21,850 --> 00:45:26,470
time-consuming to do this kind of survey

1066
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:28,180
I mean like it's very interesting to do

1067
00:45:26,470 --> 00:45:30,609
what else we can say like similar to

1068
00:45:28,180 --> 00:45:32,440
dumpster diving on Android because

1069
00:45:30,610 --> 00:45:35,200
basically you're looking for a needle in

1070
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:37,840
a haystack except that you don't even

1071
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:39,910
know what you needle is I'm also Tom you

1072
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:42,850
don't even know where the F stack is so

1073
00:45:39,910 --> 00:45:44,890
it's very challenging generalizes others

1074
00:45:42,850 --> 00:45:47,140
say it was partially automated on the

1075
00:45:44,890 --> 00:45:50,319
pattern side but on the other side most

1076
00:45:47,140 --> 00:45:52,660
of the time manual access it is often

1077
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:54,730
reproducible which is running fun one

1078
00:45:52,660 --> 00:45:56,500
well you can be sure that if one

1079
00:45:54,730 --> 00:46:00,880
developer made this mistake a lot of

1080
00:45:56,500 --> 00:46:03,220
gear and still a lot of work is possible

1081
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:04,510
this kind of study and I hope that some

1082
00:46:03,220 --> 00:46:05,430
people will be interesting to do this

1083
00:46:04,510 --> 00:46:08,530
kind of study too

1084
00:46:05,430 --> 00:46:11,200
we can read a real automate ation too

1085
00:46:08,530 --> 00:46:14,040
many like really like to the founders

1086
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:16,689
conferences the minus sign we can extend

1087
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:18,250
the type of disclosure analysis and the

1088
00:46:16,690 --> 00:46:20,710
candidate because basically as I said

1089
00:46:18,250 --> 00:46:21,940
with target is huge user base which

1090
00:46:20,710 --> 00:46:24,280
normally means that developers are

1091
00:46:21,940 --> 00:46:26,640
already very aware of what they do what

1092
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:29,080
happen when you have an app that had

1093
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:31,870
100,000 download I mean like what no but

1094
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:36,730
already 100,000 users so potential is

1095
00:46:31,870 --> 00:46:38,799
disclosure of 100,000 user data we

1096
00:46:36,730 --> 00:46:40,780
didn't look at this because we just like

1097
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:45,220
at the higher expectation term abuse

1098
00:46:40,780 --> 00:46:48,070
base and another potential walk is

1099
00:46:45,220 --> 00:46:51,819
basically to use this disclosure to get

1100
00:46:48,070 --> 00:46:56,740
even more explosion exposure sorry first

1101
00:46:51,820 --> 00:46:58,840
but when we get talking ID going back to

1102
00:46:56,740 --> 00:47:01,569
like understand how this ID using them

1103
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:04,540
of API as we did for one study can

1104
00:47:01,570 --> 00:47:06,280
discuss even far more data that the one

1105
00:47:04,540 --> 00:47:08,980
that lives on the device because if you

1106
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:11,620
disclose you notification token of an

1107
00:47:08,980 --> 00:47:13,930
API where you can get all the user

1108
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:16,038
profile even if it's not on the user

1109
00:47:13,930 --> 00:47:22,259
device

1110
00:47:16,039 --> 00:47:24,259
however one small stuff here is that we

1111
00:47:22,259 --> 00:47:27,239
will walk of that again

1112
00:47:24,259 --> 00:47:30,539
but two things here pretty much this

1113
00:47:27,239 --> 00:47:32,459
kind of fishes is only depend and the

1114
00:47:30,539 --> 00:47:34,380
vendors like if you again doubt you find

1115
00:47:32,459 --> 00:47:36,899
and don't fix it will never be fixed and

1116
00:47:34,380 --> 00:47:39,239
the cigar stinks is that if they still

1117
00:47:36,899 --> 00:47:40,618
behave the same way as discarding most

1118
00:47:39,239 --> 00:47:43,319
of the time these kind of issues

1119
00:47:40,619 --> 00:47:46,409
well the label wars for security

1120
00:47:43,319 --> 00:47:48,479
researcher to do this kind of fool

1121
00:47:46,409 --> 00:47:51,779
because like it's a lot of time for

1122
00:47:48,479 --> 00:47:55,009
basically nothing okay so thank you for

1123
00:47:51,779 --> 00:47:59,109
your attention you have any question

1124
00:47:55,010 --> 00:47:59,109
[Applause]
