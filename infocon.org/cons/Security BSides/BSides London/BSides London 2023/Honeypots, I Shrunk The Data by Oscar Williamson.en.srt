1
00:00:02,959 --> 00:00:06,240
hi hi everyone so I'm Oscar and today

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,440
I'm just going to be talking a bit about

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,200
using honey pots for threat intelligence

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,840
so just to introduce myself I'm a second

5
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:14,820
year cyber security student at the

6
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:16,740
University of Warwick I'm also the

7
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:18,060
technician for the Warwick cyber

8
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:20,160
security society and that's my Twitter

9
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,100
not that I tweet anything so

10
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,140
so first of all given we're talking

11
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:26,820
about honeypots or threat intelligence

12
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:28,800
it seems to make sense to explain what a

13
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,840
honey pot is so this is a description

14
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,820
from Chris Sanders very good book about

15
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:36,120
intrusion detection so honey pots rely

16
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,880
on Deception to

17
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:40,020
encourage attackers to interacts with

18
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:42,300
them and then generate alerts so that

19
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:45,860
you know you've been connected to but

20
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:48,360
the difference is obviously that book I

21
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:49,440
just talked about is about intrusion

22
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,719
detection usually if you have a

23
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:53,219
connection to a Honeypot a traditional

24
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:54,719
thing to do is panic because that means

25
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:56,820
you've got someone on your network but

26
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,800
with threat intelligence it's exciting

27
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,600
to us if someone connects to it because

28
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,300
you get some valuable data

29
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:05,640
so what you want to do is take these

30
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,080
attacks encourage as many of them as

31
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,580
possible to connect to you and get

32
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:10,560
information such as IP addresses what

33
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,000
credentials are they used to log into

34
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,439
your server and other things like URLs

35
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:18,479
Keys wallet addresses because there's a

36
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:20,880
lot of crypto Etc

37
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,100
so over the summer I worked on an open

38
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:25,259
source project called threat Dash which

39
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:28,680
took the pre-existing um SSH Honeypot

40
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,540
called kauri which some of you might

41
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:32,100
have heard of it basically emulates an

42
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:33,960
SSH session but it doesn't actually run

43
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,360
anything which is a key distinction and

44
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,820
then what I did was I converted the data

45
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:40,799
coming out of that stored it in a

46
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:43,500
mongodb instance including the files

47
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,780
that you see uploaded Etc and then you

48
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:48,000
carry out signature analysis of it with

49
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,280
um Yara signature detection rules

50
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:53,280
foreign

51
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,920
part was hosted on the University of

52
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,439
Warwick public IP address which

53
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:01,140
originally I tried hosting it on AWS but

54
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:02,700
you get a lot less connections when

55
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,140
you're hosting it like that presumably

56
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:06,420
because at University is a targeted

57
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:09,660
institution so this graph here shows the

58
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:11,640
sort of attack volume you saw per day

59
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:14,160
across a period about three months so

60
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,020
the Blue Line you see there is how many

61
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:18,060
connections there were but trying to log

62
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:20,700
into the SSH Honeypot and then the

63
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,680
Orange Line shows how many of those

64
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,780
sessions actually executed commands

65
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:26,640
because you saw a lot of sessions that

66
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,980
were created someone logged in but they

67
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:30,420
didn't actually run any commands so

68
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:32,879
presumably just trying passwords across

69
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,739
the internet

70
00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:36,180
now

71
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:38,940
the question we had to ask before moving

72
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:40,500
any further with this is is it really

73
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:43,080
worth it to put all this effort into it

74
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,819
because you can get a lot of valuable

75
00:02:44,819 --> 00:02:47,220
information just from IEP addresses and

76
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:49,980
commands Etc but you can always get more

77
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:51,660
information by running more detailed

78
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:54,599
analytics on bins or trying to make it a

79
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:56,819
Honeypot more realistic but the further

80
00:02:56,819 --> 00:02:59,580
you go each time it requires more effort

81
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:00,840
and eventually you reach a point where

82
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,700
you can spend weeks on one single thing

83
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:04,980
that doesn't really return anything of

84
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:07,560
much value so there's a trade-off

85
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,120
between you want to maximize what the

86
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,040
output is but you don't really want to

87
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,860
spend too much time on it thank you

88
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,560
so the aim of this project really was to

89
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,440
take a data set of about 28 000

90
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,800
interactions and identify unique attacks

91
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,420
so being able to look at an attack and

92
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:26,519
go oh yes I recognize this from a

93
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:27,900
certain attack

94
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,340
um

95
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:32,099
so first thing we used was my to attack

96
00:03:32,099 --> 00:03:34,800
which allows you to tag it to certain

97
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:38,340
techniques but I'll admit I'm not very

98
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:39,959
familiar with motor attack so trying to

99
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:41,879
write it like that was quite hard I was

100
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:44,819
able to identify about 19 tactics or

101
00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:48,000
techniques actually when about 224 exist

102
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,760
so obviously I most likely missed some

103
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,200
of the techniques that might to attack

104
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:55,140
lists but at the same time it's not an

105
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:57,599
easy thing to work with and

106
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:59,760
trying to look at a set of commands

107
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,040
being run on an assistant sh session and

108
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,900
map it to Mito attack it's not about

109
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,040
easy

110
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,680
so then the way which I try to look for

111
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,480
Unique attacks was look for Unique

112
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,580
combinations of Mito attack techniques

113
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:14,400
and using that I was able to identify 51

114
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,160
different attacks but when you start to

115
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,418
drill down into that because you only

116
00:04:18,418 --> 00:04:20,940
have 19 possible techniques there's a

117
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,979
lot of overlap work you saw attacks that

118
00:04:22,979 --> 00:04:24,300
were clearly very different being

119
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,660
categorized under the same thing

120
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:29,040
so just to give an example of this it

121
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,139
looks at the um system information

122
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:33,060
Discovery technique for micro attack

123
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:34,919
where an attacker tries to get some

124
00:04:34,919 --> 00:04:36,840
information about the system

125
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,100
when

126
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:39,720
an attacker Alabama on the Internet is

127
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,520
connecting to a random IP address they

128
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,860
found that's most attacks most attacks

129
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:45,840
are trying to learn something about what

130
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,900
they've discovered so here I've got a

131
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,400
few examples of things that came under

132
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,020
the system information Discovery

133
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:53,759
technique and as you'll see they're

134
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:56,040
quite different so putting them under

135
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,300
one technique

136
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:00,240
was quite a broad fin really so it sort

137
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,880
of attacks that tried to read um the

138
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,160
binary for echo which is a traditional

139
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,139
tactic used to try and identify if the

140
00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:09,540
system architecture is 32 or 64-bit

141
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:11,940
because you can read the elf header

142
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:14,880
um slash IP Cloud Print if you look that

143
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,040
up you know that they're trying to

144
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:20,040
Target a micro tick routers so okay

145
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,440
that's a command specific to that

146
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:25,560
and the Nvidia SMI command you know that

147
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,699
the attacker is looking for information

148
00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:28,860
about the GPU so most likely trying to

149
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:31,259
do some crypto mining so if you actually

150
00:05:31,259 --> 00:05:33,240
drill down into the specific commands

151
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,160
being run not just in miter attack

152
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,199
techniques you start to realize that you

153
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:41,220
can get more about the context from it

154
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:43,440
so the solution to this was rather than

155
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,180
using miter attack

156
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:47,699
I basically just took the commands and

157
00:05:47,699 --> 00:05:49,979
manually went through them and

158
00:05:49,979 --> 00:05:52,500
categorized them into unique individual

159
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:55,199
fins um I tried experimenting with

160
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:57,000
string similarities or things where

161
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,039
setting a threshold in for strings are

162
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:01,620
60 are similar or something

163
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:02,340
um

164
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:04,320
that didn't really work out so instead I

165
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,419
went to Yara rules and just trying to

166
00:06:06,419 --> 00:06:08,699
write signatures for each um possible

167
00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:09,780
attack

168
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:12,600
because as we saw before

169
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,100
my true attack just tells you what

170
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,180
tactic it's been used but it doesn't

171
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:17,460
give you any context so these are the

172
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,440
rules with notes and fins you're able to

173
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,600
identify what specific OS was being

174
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,919
targeted

175
00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:24,660
what was the aim of that attack what

176
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:26,759
exactly are they trying to do and also

177
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:29,220
because a lot of these are automated you

178
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:30,000
see

179
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,340
um there are unique usages of certain

180
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:35,520
commands for example as you see in the

181
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,139
Yara rule on the slide there's a very

182
00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:39,060
specific usage of you name the u-name

183
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:41,940
command with a several arguments in a

184
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:43,740
very specific order and as it's

185
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:47,280
automated fat attacker always used the

186
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,440
arguments in that order so I have

187
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,060
several rules in the data set which are

188
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:53,400
just looking for you name commands but

189
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,539
with arguments in slightly different

190
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:56,759
orders or different permutations because

191
00:06:56,759 --> 00:06:58,500
that was able to uniquely identify an

192
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,419
attack

193
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:03,360
and the comparison there was I was able

194
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,759
to identify as I said 51 unique attacks

195
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,979
with Mito attack but then when I started

196
00:07:07,979 --> 00:07:09,539
writing these custom signatures I was

197
00:07:09,539 --> 00:07:11,400
able to get that up to a hundred so that

198
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,560
started to reveal the breadth of what

199
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:16,080
was actually in the data set and as I

200
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,660
said Yara signature rules as a defined

201
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:20,280
format you can also write comments add

202
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,080
notes so reviewing it is a lot more

203
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,440
useful

204
00:07:25,139 --> 00:07:27,720
so just to quickly explain what sort of

205
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,160
things we're seeing in this day to say

206
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,800
it turns out when you put a SSH server

207
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,840
which anyone could log into on the

208
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,539
internet basically people are trying to

209
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:40,319
crypto mine uh at least 17 of all

210
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,360
attacks seen and this was attacks with

211
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,720
commands not just uh General connections

212
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,680
explicitly did something relating to

213
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:49,800
crypto that number is a massive um

214
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,419
underestimate because there are a lot of

215
00:07:51,419 --> 00:07:53,039
attacks which I didn't go into in depth

216
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:54,840
but they were downloading shell scripts

217
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,639
and running it and when you start to

218
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:58,199
look at those most of them are also

219
00:07:58,199 --> 00:07:59,580
crypto mining

220
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:01,620
so what would these crypto mining

221
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:04,500
attacks looking for well a big one was

222
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:07,500
looking for Hive OS systems which is a

223
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:10,080
um distribution specifically for crypto

224
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,759
mining you can tell that because it's

225
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:13,759
using a specific command High password

226
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:16,800
or it's looking for VNC passwords.txt

227
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,720
because apparently Hive arrest stores

228
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,360
its VNC passwords in plain text and also

229
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,580
a configuration file

230
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:27,120
also sort of XM rig which is a miner so

231
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,979
you can identify that by spotting the

232
00:08:28,979 --> 00:08:30,539
GitHub download link

233
00:08:30,539 --> 00:08:33,419
and there you've got another interesting

234
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:34,979
indicator that you could use for fret

235
00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:36,360
intelligence because a lot of VM

236
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:39,059
commands were you had the um wallet

237
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:40,979
addresses in them so you could use that

238
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:44,219
and use it to map again later and

239
00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:45,839
there are a lot of other different

240
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:47,760
crypto miners being downloaded or looked

241
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,480
for Etc

242
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:53,880
so the other thing about honeypots is

243
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,200
obviously as I said they rely on

244
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,880
Deception so you have to have an

245
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,519
attacker believe that they're real

246
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:03,779
and if an attacker obviously what we've

247
00:09:03,779 --> 00:09:05,519
seen so far is mostly automated attacks

248
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:07,380
but if you have an attacker who actually

249
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,580
knows what they're looking for is

250
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:10,200
Hands-On keyboard and starting to look

251
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,600
around it suddenly becomes quite easy to

252
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,160
work out if you're in a Honeypot or not

253
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,920
so first things first if you've ever

254
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:19,440
used calorie you'll know it has a

255
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,339
default

256
00:09:20,339 --> 00:09:23,399
um hostname of server 04

257
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:25,380
so any attacker who knows what they're

258
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:27,540
doing would see that hostname and

259
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:29,339
immediately log out because they know

260
00:09:29,339 --> 00:09:31,019
they're in Honeypot so the very first

261
00:09:31,019 --> 00:09:33,120
thing you want to do is change that I

262
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,220
think the instance I have running uses

263
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:37,680
production as a hostname hopefully that

264
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,720
seems appealing to an attacker

265
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,279
well the other thing I mentioned is

266
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:45,060
calorie emulates its command so it only

267
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:47,580
knows what's programmed into it so for

268
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:50,160
example a lot of attacks I saw over the

269
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,959
summer they were looking to read the um

270
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:53,820
uptime file see how long this ever been

271
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:57,060
up for that didn't exist at the time in

272
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:59,500
Calgary so I decided to add that because

273
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,080
[Music]

274
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,540
not even Dynamic I just put a file I had

275
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:05,700
a number in it actually and um hopefully

276
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,440
took some attacker that's going to make

277
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,120
it seem a little bit more realistic

278
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,100
because if you log into a system and you

279
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,440
can't find proc uptime you might start

280
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,140
to have questions about what's going on

281
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:17,760
the other thing that was missing was the

282
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:21,000
lspci command and that

283
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,440
um talks about the PCI cards available

284
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,540
on a machine so

285
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,580
my first instinct for that was just to

286
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:28,740
create a command run that command on my

287
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:30,899
local machine and copy the output but

288
00:10:30,899 --> 00:10:33,720
the important thing as you can see in

289
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,880
this picture here is that because I was

290
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,260
currently doing my work in a virtual

291
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:39,660
machine and that's one of the ways an

292
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:41,600
attacker uses to detect virtualization

293
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,360
so whilst that might not suggest

294
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,279
Honeypot that might suggest to an

295
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:48,720
attacker that they're in some sandboxed

296
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,120
environment potentially hurting him off

297
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,500
giving any information that might be

298
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,720
useful for threat intelligence so I'd be

299
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,180
very careful to look for a um output

300
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:58,740
that didn't indicate any form of

301
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:00,839
virtualization just to make it seem a

302
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:03,000
little more appealing to an attacker

303
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,380
gosh

304
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:06,600
so the question at the end of all this

305
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,880
is it Honeypot are they worth it for

306
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,700
threat intelligence and the answer to

307
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:13,860
that is if you put a box on a random IP

308
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:15,899
address on the internet it probably

309
00:11:15,899 --> 00:11:18,540
won't be that interesting you just see a

310
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:20,820
lot of botnets crypto mining Etc nothing

311
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:22,860
really that new

312
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:24,240
but

313
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,160
as a sort of scene by putting it on a

314
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,380
university IP address if you're some

315
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:30,060
organization that's perhaps of interest

316
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:31,800
to specific

317
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,779
um threat groups

318
00:11:33,779 --> 00:11:36,120
you might start to see something more

319
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,019
unique

320
00:11:37,019 --> 00:11:38,760
so if you're

321
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,620
particularly concerned about your fret

322
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:43,140
model having a honey pot for fat

323
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:46,579
intelligence might be useful

324
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:47,820
um the other thing is you just have to

325
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:50,100
be patient it took a long time days

326
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,800
before anything interesting came through

327
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,440
so just to sit tight and some days

328
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,180
you'll get loads of attacks some days

329
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:58,980
you get nothing

330
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:01,320
and the other thing is mostly attacks

331
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,700
you'll see Vegas

332
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:05,040
have been reported on it's very easy to

333
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,200
take something you see be excited about

334
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,700
him and just look it up and someone's

335
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,320
done a really good write-up of it so

336
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,360
that isn't it not really generating any

337
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,920
new anything new in terms of threat

338
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,300
intelligence but

339
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:16,920
the reason I talked about it today is

340
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,720
because it was just fun in the end like

341
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,060
you don't really discover anything new

342
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:22,740
but at the same time you get to see

343
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:24,180
what's going on on the internet have

344
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:26,100
your own idea of what who's scanning

345
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:27,959
what Etc

346
00:12:27,959 --> 00:12:30,010
yeah so thank you any questions

347
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:33,159
[Music]

348
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:39,660
[Applause]

349
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:41,880
well thank you I wish I'd had one of

350
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,620
those at school

351
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:45,240
um would you have liked to have had the

352
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,100
opportunity to mount any of the address

353
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,920
space not currently that in use at the

354
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,800
University and that would obviously

355
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,220
reduce the probability significantly

356
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:57,899
would you be able to repeat the question

357
00:12:57,899 --> 00:12:58,920
sorry

358
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:02,399
yep so assuming your university has a

359
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:04,680
block of address space

360
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:08,880
would you have liked the opportunity to

361
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,500
have mounted any of the spare address

362
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,959
space with Honeypot servers perhaps

363
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,820
redirecting to your one and then

364
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:17,160
potentially much reduce the probability

365
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,620
and therefore see significantly more

366
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:22,100
activity

367
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:25,500
yeah I mean

368
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,660
I don't I haven't really sort of thought

369
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:29,160
of how in depth about in terms of the

370
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,980
effects of the IP addresses it's um

371
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:33,839
I kind of just used what I was given but

372
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:35,940
I think trying to explore that more in

373
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:36,899
depth would be definitely very

374
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:39,380
interesting

375
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:44,720
any more questions

376
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,830
[Music]

377
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:53,459
if you're putting something on the

378
00:13:53,459 --> 00:13:54,300
Internet

379
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,040
um to be exploited just to kind of see

380
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,260
what they're doing do you kind of worry

381
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:01,260
uh that someone might try and use your

382
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:03,120
resource that's that's hosted and used

383
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:07,380
by you to uh you know let's say stage

384
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:10,139
um you know in decent images or other

385
00:14:10,139 --> 00:14:12,480
things that potentially could come back

386
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,680
to you

387
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,300
oh yeah I mean that's definitely a worry

388
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:17,459
that's kind of why the model behind

389
00:14:17,459 --> 00:14:19,920
kauri as a sort of Honeypot is that

390
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:23,160
it's entirely emulation based because

391
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:27,060
nothing that's run actually I guess I

392
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:28,079
mean

393
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:30,540
saving the files you are saving anything

394
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:33,240
indecent that's uploaded Etc but

395
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:36,240
not publicly so I don't think in terms

396
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,740
of emulating if there's any particular

397
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:40,459
concern there

398
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:51,060
um did your Honeypot get any sort of

399
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:52,440
actionable information that you were

400
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,660
able to share during the three months

401
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:56,459
that you had it running

402
00:14:56,459 --> 00:14:58,519
um you don't not necessarily yeah

403
00:14:58,519 --> 00:15:01,260
I do there is like a list of IP

404
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:03,959
addresses and things I tried to sort of

405
00:15:03,959 --> 00:15:06,959
um exporting all that I mean

406
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:08,699
there is information to be shared but

407
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:10,139
nothing that isn't already out there

408
00:15:10,139 --> 00:15:11,639
like all these IP addresses and things

409
00:15:11,639 --> 00:15:13,740
are being mapped by like bigger threat

410
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:17,160
intelligence um fins anyway

411
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:19,760
foreign

412
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,279
do you have any sort of future research

413
00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:28,320
questions or any other sort of queries

414
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,180
that you think you'd like to answer with

415
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:32,399
a similar kind of set of experiments

416
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:35,180
I think the interesting thing that was

417
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:37,920
considered out this was can we do the

418
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:41,279
same for sort of Windows and RDP but the

419
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:43,079
answer to that was also

420
00:15:43,079 --> 00:15:45,060
Windows is just a lot harder to work

421
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:47,519
with than trying to emulate that it's a

422
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:48,779
challenge so be about looking to

423
00:15:48,779 --> 00:15:52,620
actually sandbox a Windows environment

424
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:55,620
cool

425
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:02,220
thanks uh so I one of the interesting

426
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:03,899
things about about it about thing ahead

427
00:16:03,899 --> 00:16:05,279
because when you first started I was

428
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:06,899
thinking actually what's the use of how

429
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:08,820
could I apply this one of the things

430
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:10,680
probably because my background is more

431
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:13,139
GRC a lot of a lot of things people

432
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:14,579
probably struggle with is understanding

433
00:16:14,579 --> 00:16:17,519
the real the real value of an asset so

434
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:19,320
actually I could see if you were to

435
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,420
deploy a series of Honey pots that might

436
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:23,639
indicate that someone could have access

437
00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:25,740
to a specific asset maybe in terms of

438
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:27,180
University you'd be a research or

439
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:29,100
something that's being done that can

440
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,260
actually allow you to classify or get a

441
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:32,760
real value

442
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:35,160
um sort of generation of actually how

443
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,620
much if this specific asset work what's

444
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:39,360
the likelihood that someone would want

445
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,579
to try and access this and therefore

446
00:16:41,579 --> 00:16:43,259
feed into your risk assessment so that I

447
00:16:43,259 --> 00:16:45,060
think is quite interesting

448
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:47,519
um is that something you thought is that

449
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:49,139
there are a lot of applications along

450
00:16:49,139 --> 00:16:51,000
the line of that along that kind of same

451
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,019
line of thinking or any other

452
00:16:52,019 --> 00:16:54,420
applications you think could also

453
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:56,940
um honeypots can be useful or

454
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:59,639
yeah no definitely I think that's um I

455
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:01,199
think that's the sort of point trying to

456
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:03,480
make about the specific companies it

457
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,400
might provide a specific value that

458
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,140
obviously the context I was doing it was

459
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:09,780
just um general internet facing

460
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:12,780
honeypots but I can imagine it allows

461
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:14,760
you to if you were to try and emulate

462
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,500
something that you were specifically

463
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,480
interested in like trying to emulate the

464
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,459
characteristics of that I could give

465
00:17:20,459 --> 00:17:24,119
interesting information and also

466
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:25,980
um a bit of idea of what's actually

467
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:29,419
targeting your organization

468
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:35,100
yeah definitely so because that's the

469
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:36,299
sort of information you can get you can

470
00:17:36,299 --> 00:17:38,520
start to like tags IP addresses any

471
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,919
other sort of indicators and so you can

472
00:17:40,919 --> 00:17:42,179
really build up your own sort of

473
00:17:42,179 --> 00:17:45,799
internal threat Intelligence on that

474
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:52,380
did you try different output in lspgi so

475
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:54,419
if you included a your high performance

476
00:17:54,419 --> 00:17:57,539
graphics card they you would see them do

477
00:17:57,539 --> 00:18:00,179
further commands versus disconnect

478
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:03,419
please say that again so with lspci you

479
00:18:03,419 --> 00:18:05,580
could include a you know an Nvidia

480
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:09,360
graphics card did you look at if they uh

481
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,100
won further commands after they've found

482
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:12,780
the graphics card versus not finding one

483
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:15,240
and just disconnect yeah so definitely

484
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,100
um with the commands about gpus you were

485
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:19,080
often um seeing grips for certain

486
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,880
patterns um

487
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,860
the interesting thing I did find in

488
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:25,020
terms of a lot of those um grips is that

489
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:26,940
it didn't it never seemed to

490
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,919
particularly affect what the attacker

491
00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:31,679
actually ran afterwards it seems

492
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:33,780
a lot of collect a lot of attackers seem

493
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,340
to collect information to store for

494
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:36,780
themselves but never actually do

495
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:38,640
anything but yeah I definitely um try to

496
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,100
make the lspci look a bit more enticing

497
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:44,240
with Nvidia graphics

498
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:51,299
obviously by putting it on a university

499
00:18:51,299 --> 00:18:53,520
Network do you have any like ethical

500
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,200
concerns had they broken out of your

501
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,419
kind of virtual environment

502
00:18:57,419 --> 00:18:58,559
um

503
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:01,020
not in far as the way it was um set up

504
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:03,419
like I was very lucky to have a very um

505
00:19:03,419 --> 00:19:05,880
skilled of technician who I worked with

506
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:08,460
who made sure it's a sort of very on the

507
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:10,500
public IP address range but it was an

508
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,539
isolated lab environment and it was

509
00:19:12,539 --> 00:19:14,340
properly firewalled et cetera so there

510
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:17,418
wasn't any risk to that

511
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,660
is that all

512
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:24,900
yes yes no any more questions last call

513
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,880

514
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:31,640
