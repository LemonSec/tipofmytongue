therefore yeah I saw thousands of

19
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,800
submission on their platform

25
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:22,680
platforms you can work for Mac Monty

26
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:26,280
hunting and what programs do you need to

27
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:29,299
access or you need to send some

28
00:01:29,299 --> 00:01:33,420
submissions or some vulnerabilities uh

29
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:35,900
yeah some organizations

30
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:39,240
gives ethical hackers to permission to

31
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:42,119
test their systems and their web

32
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:44,280
applications their networks their mobile

33
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,860
applications and

34
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:52,380
yeah researchers and earn rewards by

35
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:54,540
detecting vulnerabilities on the system

36
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:56,399
and

37
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:59,460
during the background hunting if they

38
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:02,939
found some vulnerabilities and they can

39
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:06,560
report this issues to directly

40
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,940
companies program page

41
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,700
okay we can be a researcher what rules

42
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:17,280
you can get as a researcher in bug

43
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,099
bounty hunting Community

44
00:02:19,099 --> 00:02:21,959
anyone anyone can sign up to be a

45
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:25,520
researcher and to become a researcher

46
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,040
uh just you need to create an account on

47
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:33,560
the platform sites who provides mcvante

48
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:37,200
services and work one services for

49
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,340
companies and if you report an

50
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:43,860
unreported fresh bug and you can earn

51
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:47,519
monetary rewards on the platforms from

52
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:50,519
the clients and if you submit a previous

53
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:53,160
report we previously supported

54
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:56,580
vulnerability it will be duplicate just

55
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:00,420
you can only earn platform points or

56
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:04,800
reputations for getting more invoice in

57
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,580
bhagwanti programs

58
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,680
so uh

59
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,540
background programs platforms connect

60
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:18,420
companies with the background Community

61
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:21,360
to provide them with a Smart Security

62
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,760
Solutions

63
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:25,739
there are many bug Bounty platforms for

64
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:28,560
hundreds of companies work with them and

65
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,580
you can reach full list for you can you

66
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:34,860
can reach the full list you can QR code

67
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:39,540
here and just I put here some popular

68
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:42,319
platforms like as hacker one background

69
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:44,640
or signac

70
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,819

and other side you can search and Report

73
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:56,220
vulnerabilities in many companies

74
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:58,560
without the platforms you can directly

75
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,680
access companies backbund page and you

76
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,580
can report uh your vulnerabilities to

77
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:08,159
direct to them and

78
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:10,019
also

79
00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:14,659
you can find other bug Bounty

80
00:04:14,659 --> 00:04:17,579
platform page for companies you can

81
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:20,519

by companies to coordinate the reporting

84
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,060
and charging in some cases wording of

85
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:32,340
security vulnerabilities you can find

86
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:35,100
the bound to pays of many companies by

87
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:38,880
using the Google Docs and when you use

88
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,780
the docs these dogs you can access

89
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:45,540
directly many companies about one page

90

and you can send your reports without

91
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,660
and he

92
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:54,979
background platform

93
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,860
yeah

94
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:00,900
also you can access the unlisted bug

95
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:03,680
Bounty one Legacy disclosure

96
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:08,699
programs with Google Docs and yeah this

97
00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:12,419
background platforms provider uh

98
00:05:12,419 --> 00:05:16,020
provides provider provides a form to

99
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:20,100
sending uh to sending reports to the

100
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:23,160
their clients therefore they Implement

101
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,320
their forms in the

102
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:28,440
client's website you can you can find

103
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:31,320
easily using the Google Docs in the

104
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:34,380
Google you can just use some words and

105
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:36,500
you can find a lot of

106
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:41,300
bug reports page actually

107
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:44,120
so

108
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,840
a public bug Bounty program is one that

109
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,300
is open to anyone who wants to be who

110
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:54,600
wants to be participate and you can list

111
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,560
program

112
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:58,740
when you log in the application

113
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:00,840
then when you log into bug Bounty

114
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:03,199
platform application you can search

115
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:06,600
public programs directly in their

116
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,600
application you can filter the asset

117
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,120
types or program Types on their

118
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:15,720
application and you can directly start

119
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:18,600
to send some vulnerabilities on the

120
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,280
platform

121
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:23,520
a public program is accessible by all

122
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,880
the Searchers on platform and all

123
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,740
background programs outside of the

124
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:32,360
platforms are considered

125
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,620
as a background

126
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:37,160
program

127
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:43,080
yeah I I would like to talk about a

128
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:46,380
little bit project discovery.io and when

129
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:48,780
you started bhagwanti for

130
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:52,199
public programs you can use a course

131
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:55,919
project for accessing uh

132
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:59,520
accessing some sub domain data from

133
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:03,240
their application they they already scan

134
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,539
these public programs

135
00:07:05,539 --> 00:07:09,840
domains and they already add they adding

136
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:13,139
all results day by day in their

137
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:15,979
application you can you can reach all

138
00:07:15,979 --> 00:07:18,419
subdomain results

139
00:07:18,419 --> 00:07:20,520
on their platform before the starting

140
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,199
back 24

141
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:24,660
public programs

142
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:27,060
you can download the subdomain list

143
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:30,180
for background programs and you can

144
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:32,940
start the bug Bounty for

145
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:35,760
many publics programs

146
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,380
[Music]

147
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:38,639
so

148
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,699
um

149
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:44,460
a private bug Bounty program is one of

150
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:46,740
the

151
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:49,500
a private background program is one of

152
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:52,080
the invite on the program for selected

153
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:55,199
researchers when you when you start to

154
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:58,319
work Bounty for public programs you can

155
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,740
collect some points or reputations and

156
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:05,160
then after the platform send you some

157
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,819
private invoice

158
00:08:07,819 --> 00:08:10,860
private programs only selected those

159
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:13,020
those researchers who are skilled in

160
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:15,900
testing and kind of applications

161
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:18,960
never go public at all

162
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,580
and

163
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:23,460
these programs just only provide access

164
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:26,580
to private to selected private

165
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:29,900
researcher therefore this is just a

166
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:32,279
private invite for

167
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:35,299
a researcher

168
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:38,940
so we we have some differences between

169
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:42,659
bhagavati platforms some platforms you

170
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:45,480
can some platforms that you can directly

171
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:49,380
register and start for bug Bounty and

172
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:53,640
some platforms needs needs the complete

173
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,680
some assessment technical assessment

174
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,260
actually and one one of them sign again

175
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:01,620
yogosha before the starting pan back

176
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:03,779
bounty on their platform you need to

177
00:09:03,779 --> 00:09:06,180
complete assessment technical assessment

178
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:08,660
process

179
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:11,279
after applying applying if you need to

prove that you meet some technical

181
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:17,300
requirements for their platforms and

182
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:20,480
nowadays many background platforms use

183
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:25,260
hects for testing your skills and

184
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:29,220
you can prove your technical skills

185
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:30,420
on

186
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:33,300
Hector box platform during the technical

187
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,820
assessment after after after provide

188
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:39,120
your skills you can you can join the

189
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,779
their platform and you can access their

190
00:09:41,779 --> 00:09:45,180
background programs

191
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:47,779
yeah

192
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,680
so and

193
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,899
here is some information about the

194
00:09:51,899 --> 00:09:54,779
bhagbanti versus traditional pen test

195
00:09:54,779 --> 00:09:58,680
and yeah traditional pen test teams

196
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:02,459
small teams and Bug Bounty Community is

197
00:10:02,459 --> 00:10:05,519
a has a big community and also

198
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:08,880
translation of the Panthers just work in

199
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:14,160
time Bond and bug Bounty is continuous

200
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,540
also

201
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:19,019
the companies pay for testing time for

202
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:21,720
traditional pen tests but but for

203
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:26,720
bhagwanti they pay just four results

204
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:32,760
so where to start before the hack

205
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:35,700
something and you should know how it

206
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:39,540
works therefore before the starting bug

207
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:43,740
Bounty or pen testing anything in cyber

208
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:45,980
security you need to learn some

209
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:48,360
fundamentals about web applications

210
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:51,959
mobile applications or Network

211
00:10:51,959 --> 00:10:55,260
the um it is necessary to know the

212
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:58,380
basics of web applications or mobile

213
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:03,720
applications or Network fundamentals

214
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:06,060
after skill development and doing some

215
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:08,339
practice also

216
00:11:08,339 --> 00:11:10,860
you can read some information about the

217
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:14,360
bug bounty on the internet some

218
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:17,220
disclosure reports or

219
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:19,019
uh

220
00:11:19,019 --> 00:11:22,560
anything about the bhagwanti you can be

221
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,640
reached

222
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:27,260
success doing to some

223
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:30,120
on the platforms

224
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,640
[Music]

225
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,899
so

226
00:11:33,899 --> 00:11:37,019
the most common Targets in bhagbanti are

227
00:11:37,019 --> 00:11:39,899
web and mobile applications and networks

228
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:42,300
you need to improve your skills in these

229
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:43,740
fields

230
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:45,660
most of time you look for

231
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:46,980
vulnerabilities

232
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:49,740
by doing Port service Discovery and

233
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:51,959
external network scan

234
00:11:51,959 --> 00:11:55,260
if you if you join the signage you can

235
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:57,660
work by accessing the internal networks

236
00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:01,320
of many customers via VPN connection and

237
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:04,800
you can work and you can work for

238
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,320
internal Network pen test or internal

239
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:10,880
Network back branches

240
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:16,440
so for improving your skills you can you

241
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:19,140
can find some books in the cyber

242
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:22,140
security industry and also you can

243
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:24,480
follow the YouTube content creators and

244
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,420
also you can play for

245
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:29,760
for volume you can play on the

246
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,160
vulnerable machines like as hack the box

247
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,399
or fantastic Labs or you can work on the

248
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:39,860
CTS for improving your skills

249
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:45,540
so reporting one of the important things

250
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:48,779
about reporting is because after you

251
00:12:48,779 --> 00:12:51,540
send a submission your reports directly

252
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:54,380
access to

253
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:57,899
directly sending to bug Bounty platforms

254
00:12:57,899 --> 00:13:01,320
analyst and before descending clients

255
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:04,380
they need to validate your

256
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:07,380
vulnerabilities therefore you need to

257
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:10,260
read brief could breathe carefully and

258
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:12,300
you need to add

259
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:14,820
one vulnerabilities details in the

260
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:16,980
report and you need to add more

261
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:18,620
description about your vulnerability

262
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:22,800
also you need to add some proof for your

263
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,019
vulnerability some screenshots or some

264
00:13:25,019 --> 00:13:28,740
video POC files in the report

265
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:31,079
also you can collaborate

266
00:13:31,079 --> 00:13:34,560
with your friends and also you can share

267
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:38,120
your resource or knowledge or Bounty

268
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:41,160
programs with your friends I added here

269
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:44,339
one of the most popular platforms for

270
00:13:44,339 --> 00:13:46,320
meeting other

271
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,279
Hunters actually

272
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:54,079
some platform teams and before starting

273
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:57,420
bounty on the pla on the program you

274
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,399
need to understand the scope well

275
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:02,040
and also check the out of scope area

276
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:07,440
also you can you can check the VRT for

277
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,980
severity of your of your vulnerabilities

278
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:13,800
before Discerning them also you can

279
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:18,180
check the now issue tabs before starting

280
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:22,380
the bug bounty on this programs

281
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:25,139
last thing is about the

282
00:14:25,139 --> 00:14:28,980
comments area when you when you send a

283
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:32,160
comment your comments will send directly

284
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,220
to internal

285
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:38,700
internal analyst also this area can can

286
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:40,199
accessible by

287
00:14:40,199 --> 00:14:43,860
client therefore be kind and formal in

288
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:46,820

yeah that's all thank you

290
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:02,160
[Music]

291
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:05,240
any questions

292
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:09,420
hi so thank you for that by the way

293
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:11,339
um I guess one of the things you added

294
00:15:11,339 --> 00:15:13,079
one of the screens you had up was kind

295
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:16,139
of Rewards or or kind of incentives for

296
00:15:16,139 --> 00:15:18,000
people to want to go and pursue bug

297
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,420
Bounty um hunting but but what's the uh

298
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:24,120
there are some some websites like 4chan

299
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:26,880
for instance that clearly didn't have

300
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,500
any incentives listed at least on the

301
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:31,980
page so for for them for for people in

302
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:34,320
that kind of field what is the incentive

303
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,899
for them to actually uh partake in in

304
00:15:36,899 --> 00:15:41,279
4chan's public uh bug Bounty uh platform

305
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:44,279
for instance or program

306
00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:47,519
yes this this is a long crazy for me

307
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:50,040
sorry sorry so the question is where

308
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,560
there are some some websites that aren't

309
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,139
offering any visible incentives or at

310
00:15:55,139 --> 00:15:56,699
least we're on the on the list you had

311
00:15:56,699 --> 00:15:59,940
like 4chan what what actual incentives

312
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:01,620
are there for people to partake in our

313
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:03,420
program

314
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:05,540
um

315
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:08,940
yeah I I don't know right now

316
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:12,180
yeah is it is it just for the for the

317
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:13,680
for the sake of it like oh yeah actually

318
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,839
they're quite they just like doing it so

319
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:18,240
therefore it's it's been there sort of

320
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,920
they're interested and potentially

321
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,600
because there's less people going into

322
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,339
it it's a less crowded area so it could

323
00:16:23,339 --> 00:16:25,320
be more vulnerable it's defined like

324
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,699
that maybe that would be possibly

325
00:16:26,699 --> 00:16:28,260
something there

326
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:32,519
for for finding some issues yeah

327
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:34,079
where there's no other physical

328
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:35,820
incentives like all right we're going to

329
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:37,320
get a reward or you're going to get

330
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,360
you're going to get reward or some cash

331
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,279
incentive maybe there's I can imagine

332
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:43,139
there's probably room for people to kind

333
00:16:43,139 --> 00:16:44,759
of test their skills out maybe that's

334
00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:46,019
what I'm just saying I'm just going to

335
00:16:46,019 --> 00:16:47,820
get your opinion on it see what you

336
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:48,540
think

337
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:51,079
just you're actually asking about

338
00:16:51,079 --> 00:16:54,600
motivation some yeah yeah so so what I'm

339
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,560
saying is if you're not going to pay

340
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,060
someone for it and you're not going to

341
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:59,040
give them a gift why should people

342
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,839
partake in your in your bug Bounty

343
00:17:00,839 --> 00:17:02,579
program what what is what incentive is

344
00:17:02,579 --> 00:17:04,260
there why should they do it

345
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:06,599
yeah I think

346
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:09,359
um here's the main reason about some

347
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:12,619
technical skill improves and also some

348
00:17:12,619 --> 00:17:15,839
uh getting some rewards main reason

349
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:18,900
actually also many researchers already

350
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:21,660
Works in pantas or cyber security

351
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:24,599
industry as a security engineer

352
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:27,980
therefore main reason here for improving

353
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:32,059
skills and accessing different kind of

354
00:17:32,059 --> 00:17:35,280
systems or applications developed by

355
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,919
different teams around of the world or

356
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:39,480
different companies or different

357
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:42,059
industry and also

358
00:17:42,059 --> 00:17:46,080
I think main reason here getting earning

359
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,380
some money and

360
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:52,100
improving skills actually

361
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:56,840
we have time for one more question

362
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:02,039
hiya

363
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,299
um so bug Bounty can be fantastic and

364
00:18:06,299 --> 00:18:08,220
fun but also rather so destroying when

365
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:10,679
you get dupes and stuff like that

366
00:18:10,679 --> 00:18:12,360
um what's your advice for new starters

367
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:15,120
who are getting into it to kind of keep

368
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,940
going do you have any advice for them

369
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:21,840
for asking for advice yeah any advice to

370
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,400
keep the new people who are getting into

371
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,620
bug Bounty and going when the times are

372
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:26,340
hard because it's not always

373
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:30,539
straightforward yeah nowadays we we have

374
00:18:30,539 --> 00:18:33,720
