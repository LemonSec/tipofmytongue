1
00:00:02,899 --> 00:00:08,639
hi so hello everyone I'm Patricia and on

2
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:11,880
this privilege 15 minutes of fame that I

3
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:14,580
have here I'm gonna take us through a

4
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:16,500
thought experiment we and I thought

5
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:21,119
experiment is really just a fancy name

6
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:24,480
that that is that I gave to the process

7
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,599
of using that question that I that I put

8
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:30,599
there where do we draw the line uh to

9
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:33,719
make us think a little bit outside of

10
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:36,680
our reality box or security concerns

11
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:40,559
that we have right now in the present

12
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:44,460
so first of all just a tiny bit of a

13
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:46,739
disclaimer

14
00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:49,200
you can see there it's it's mentioning

15
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,719
Schrodinger's cat and the reason I'm

16
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:55,920
mentioning it is because

17
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,280
towards the end it will get it's not

18
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,739
Sinister but it does mention something

19
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:04,199
like a little bit weird and you'll see

20
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:07,200
that it has something to do with rain

21
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,960
computer interfaces as well

22
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:12,180
um but again it's not to be Sinister

23
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:15,060
it's just to unravel New Perspective so

24
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:19,560
to explain or not our minds to new ways

25
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:23,040
of thinking first a problem

26
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,080
having that sad

27
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,720
what's the plan because every

28
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:31,259
how to do presentation sales we should

29
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:32,880
have a plan and we should show the plan

30
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,299
and the first thing that I'm gonna

31
00:01:35,299 --> 00:01:38,579
present to you is how we're gonna set

32
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:42,600
the scene so why use the the question

33
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,720
that I posed where do you draw the line

34
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:49,079
and after that uh we you use we are

35
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:52,680
using that question to challenge our

36
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:56,220
boundaries in terms of security concerns

37
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:59,820
and finally if I completely mess this up

38
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:04,020
and we are all lost we will just have a

39
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:06,719
few key takeaways that I hope at least

40
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:10,380
that that brings some value to to us all

41
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,980
so let's start by

42
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:15,239
understanding why are we using this

43
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:18,120
where do we draw the line expression uh

44
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:22,140
or question so I was having a discussion

45
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:25,260
with a colleague of mine and

46
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:29,160
he had his point I had my points no one

47
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,260
was really winning

48
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:34,800
my colleague was saying okay no no this

49
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:40,440
is fine but this is not fine and the way

50
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:45,060
I was able to make him look at the issue

51
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:47,940
from a different perspective was by

52
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:50,760
saying well you you cannot see the text

53
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:54,239
because it's too clear obviously but we

54
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:56,700
draw the line we drew like everyone

55
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:59,700
draws the line where they stand

56
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,620
so

57
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:04,080
if you draw a line here it's because you

58
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,300
stand here and you agree with that and

59
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:07,980
I'm like okay but if you agree with that

60
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:11,159
someone that agrees with something a

61
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:12,680
little bit above

62
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:16,140
why is that not good for you what makes

63
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:18,300
your perspective better than that

64
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,680
person's perspective

65
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,720
and

66
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:25,080
I I understood that that

67
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:28,680
really fits in a lot of arguments that

68
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,319
you can have with other people about

69
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:34,980
issues and not all of them but many

70
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:36,540
times it's just an opinion it's an

71
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:39,060
opinion based

72
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:41,280
um discussion so you can use that to say

73
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,379
oh to challenge the other person saying

74
00:03:43,379 --> 00:03:44,159
hey

75
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:48,000
why is your line better than my line

76
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,340
now applying that to

77
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:54,599
security and security concerns uh

78
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:57,140
through a timeline uh generation

79
00:03:57,140 --> 00:04:01,319
generational timeline so in the past

80
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:04,799
my grandparents they they would have

81
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:08,220
things like telephones and letters they

82
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:11,340
use nothing like smart anything smart

83
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:13,739
they would write their own letters and

84
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:16,019
they would forward them and their

85
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:18,298
concerns were

86
00:04:18,298 --> 00:04:21,600
mainly oh is my letter reaching the

87
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,060
right person if they're really fancy

88
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:27,620
they will think about uh what about

89
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:31,740
wiretapping is my telephone being wired

90
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:36,419
up so you you could even ask if I ask

91
00:04:36,419 --> 00:04:40,380
them oh what about this business uh

92
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:42,479
business availability because it's

93
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:45,060
relying on a server running in some kind

94
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:47,060
of uh

95
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:51,840
like some cloud service provider well

96
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,479
they're like it's not within their

97
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:56,820
security their security concerns because

98
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:58,740
it's not within there's a reality box

99
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:02,100
the reality box well solely telephones

100
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:04,740
letters pretty much a

101
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:07,860
now if we move a little bit

102
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:12,180
forward to right now I challenge

103
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:14,940
um uh well I dare to say that everyone

104
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:19,199
here has some kind of social network and

105
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:21,479
more than that

106
00:05:21,479 --> 00:05:23,280
it's probably running on some kind of

107
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,100
cloud service so someone else's computer

108
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:30,180
is running that application so and the

109
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:33,300
concerns here are not just the privacy

110
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:36,419
and the data management side making sure

111
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:39,660
that oh who has my data and did they

112
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:42,300
delete it and what they are neglecting

113
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,759
about me it starts also being a

114
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:47,460
business-wise business starts relying a

115
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:48,840
lot on

116
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,780
server servers that

117
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:53,940
are just spread around the world and

118
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:55,139
networks

119
00:05:55,139 --> 00:05:58,199
so availability starts being a concern

120
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:00,860
as well so you can see the the shift

121
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,600
from the past to the present the

122
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,419
concerns are changing and even in the

123
00:06:06,419 --> 00:06:07,800
present itself

124
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:11,340
we can see that a few years ago what

125
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:14,160
I'll I'll be a lot concerned about my

126
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,580
network perimeter and making sure that

127
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:22,020
my network was worth it and the

128
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:23,819
firewalls just blocked anything that

129
00:06:23,819 --> 00:06:26,940
wasn't and now because of work from home

130
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:30,300
and and everyone having their own

131
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:33,780
devices we start

132
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:36,360
shifting that's concern even just in the

133
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,940
present what I what I'm considering the

134
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:41,520
present we start shifting that concern

135
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,160
to Identity so from the network

136
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,620
parameter to Identity so I think it's

137
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:50,400
just interesting to to see how even when

138
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,039
what there is being considered present

139
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:57,860
it it's constantly evolving

140
00:06:58,020 --> 00:06:59,340
and now

141
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:01,800
well not now in the future

142
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,960
what are we looking at we're looking at

143
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,840
right computer interfaces we're looking

144
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:10,139
at a virtual reality uh augmented

145
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:13,340
reality and that brings its own concerns

146
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:17,759
so as it was mentioned just an hour ago

147
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,340
um

148
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:22,560
the brain computer interface is brain

149
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,560
computer interfaces do put a new

150
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,660
security concerns

151
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:30,539
or should make us think about new

152
00:07:30,539 --> 00:07:33,840
security concerns and what I think

153
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,720
happens here is that

154
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,199
I believe it's kind of a mistake

155
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:42,479
we are applying a lot of the present

156
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:46,680
security concerns and security and

157
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:51,720
um present threats to the Future threats

158
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:54,599
the future of the of technology so

159
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:56,940
really what I wanted to explore is

160
00:07:56,940 --> 00:08:00,199
what's even further

161
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:03,900
what's what's the trend there

162
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:07,860
so I was at security besides Dundee up

163
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:10,800
in Scotland and there was this talk

164
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,800
about metaverse and

165
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:18,900
how the even organizations are investing

166
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:23,039
a lot on quite a lot in and not only

167
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,300
having

168
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:28,440
video video conferencing with cameras on

169
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,020
they actually want you to feel in the

170
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:35,520
room so you have virtual uh a VR set and

171
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,440
you look around and you are in a room

172
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,940
and you feel like you are in your room

173
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:44,120
because you have Visual and um hearing

174
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,500
those kind of Sensations

175
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:49,260
and so we can see that the trend

176
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:51,240
seems to be

177
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,880
to make what what what we would

178
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:56,220
traditionally look as a physical thing

179
00:08:56,220 --> 00:09:00,839
but visually so I'm in a room but I'm

180
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:03,600
not actually in a room

181
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,959
but why stop ourselves just in the

182
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:10,560
visual and the hearing Sensations why

183
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:14,040
not you know just like was said

184
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:17,040
previously uh

185
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,160
or Sensations are just

186
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,620
signals to our brain

187
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:26,940
Why not start like mimicking those

188
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:29,880
Sensations to

189
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:34,560
um in in a virtual space so can I can I

190
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:38,399
pretend that I'm fully within

191
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:41,100
um some kind of experience that makes me

192
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:43,440
feel things it makes me feel happy makes

193
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,180
me feel like I'm eating a sandwich when

194
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:47,580
I'm I'm not or making me feel like I'm

195
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:50,220
eating a pizza and

196
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:53,519
here people start responding like oh we

197
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:56,820
need to limit these things because uh

198
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:58,380
you know it starts being a little bit

199
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:00,959
outside of what they can imagine oh wait

200
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:04,080
I I don't want to leave through a

201
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:07,140
virtual thing I want to experience real

202
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:08,339
life

203
00:10:08,339 --> 00:10:09,959
uh

204
00:10:09,959 --> 00:10:13,320
however I don't think this

205
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:16,200
argument holds because I'm a deep

206
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,959
believer in human curiosity and

207
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:21,660
engineering and I believe that those two

208
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:24,360
together with the right technology

209
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:28,140
if it's possible it will be done

210
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:29,820
and that means

211
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:32,220
if it's possible for someone to

212
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:35,399
stimulate uh some kind of feeling in my

213
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:38,580
hands or in my body that will eventually

214
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:43,019
happen from whichever technology takes

215
00:10:43,019 --> 00:10:44,360
me there

216
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,480
[Music]

217
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:48,120
let's assume even Limitless and let's

218
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,940
assume we can fully virtualize our lives

219
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:54,240
and I I'm just I'm not saying this to

220
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,540
sound crazy you know just Why Stop why

221
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:02,519
draw the line at the hearing and visual

222
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:05,519
Sensations who am I to draw that line

223
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:08,640
there I'll say well let's see as long as

224
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:12,060
I get the my nutrients and I can

225
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:15,420
leave from like and connected to some

226
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:18,899
computer I'm I'm no one to say that the

227
00:11:18,899 --> 00:11:21,600
line shouldn't be there

228
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,420
but what concerns does that start

229
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:25,740
bringing us

230
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:27,959
so if you

231
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:31,260
if you think of Sensations and if

232
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:32,160
someone

233
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,660
can

234
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:38,459
simulate some kind of touch in my hands

235
00:11:38,459 --> 00:11:42,000
the only difference between that and

236
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,820
pain and physical pain would be the

237
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:49,019
intensity right so more than just making

238
00:11:49,019 --> 00:11:51,959
sure people cannot read my thoughts and

239
00:11:51,959 --> 00:11:54,680
write my thoughts of privacy and

240
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:57,240
confidentiality and integrity

241
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:01,140
we start having concerns just by Expo by

242
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:04,380
expanding our reality box to the

243
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:08,040
uh the physical sensation we start

244
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:10,500
having to think wait a second what about

245
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,120
physical pain

246
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,260
and

247
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:14,760
that that's

248
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:17,399
something that you not traditional

249
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:20,760
traditionally think of

250
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,440
right

251
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:26,220
so what are the key takeaways this is

252
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:28,920
quite fast but that's what I wanted to

253
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,140
to Really

254
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:31,380
[Music]

255
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:33,540
um make sure I'll

256
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:37,680
pass through yourself and you we need to

257
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,360
be creative enough

258
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:43,800
so that new threat scenarios emerge from

259
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:47,339
things that we were so who here would

260
00:12:47,339 --> 00:12:51,180
think about physical pain just from

261
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:53,220
whatever we have the technology we have

262
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:56,160
now it's not really something that we

263
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,740
think of but by just unlocking that New

264
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:01,260
Perspective we start thinking of it or

265
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:03,480
we should start or maybe it's crazy but

266
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,220
it's just to to make ourselves think

267
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:09,480
okay maybe maybe we think that maybe we

268
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,519
need

269
00:13:10,519 --> 00:13:14,100
we need something a little bit more

270
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:17,399
creative on a

271
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:19,740
another thing that I really really

272
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:24,060
believe in is determine controls so just

273
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:27,779
saying you cannot do it is not something

274
00:13:27,779 --> 00:13:29,579
that holds

275
00:13:29,579 --> 00:13:32,579
look we are humans and what

276
00:13:32,579 --> 00:13:35,820
distinguishes us from other animals is

277
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,920
curiosity

278
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,980
if it's possible it will happen it's not

279
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:43,440
big it's not because we are bad it's

280
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,279
just

281
00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:48,240
it's just engineering it will happen so

282
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:52,079
do not hold on to those policies that

283
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:54,660
you have you know don't rely on them to

284
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:58,019
make sure and I just say I I say and

285
00:13:58,019 --> 00:14:00,720
that's good right because and look what

286
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,779
Curiosity has

287
00:14:02,779 --> 00:14:06,060
minus D in terms of Technology I'm able

288
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:09,600
to have like this thing uh connected to

289
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,560
my laptop and it shows something in a TV

290
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:18,899
or in a a screen it's like that yeah it

291
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:24,180
still amazes me we owe that to curiosity

292
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:26,279
again with creativity

293
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:28,139
you know when you're doing your threat

294
00:14:28,139 --> 00:14:29,540
models

295
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:34,700
just try to do that extra step of going

296
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:38,040
a little bit outside of the reality box

297
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:40,980
that you are right now because your

298
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:45,300
reality box might be just a little bit

299
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:50,100
under what the attacker attackers is so

300
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:53,880
just add that creativity just just think

301
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:57,839
what's your physical pain scenario on

302
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:00,959
whatever your threat modeling

303
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:03,180
and

304
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:04,800
don't limit yourself

305
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,279
to the to the boundaries of your reality

306
00:15:08,279 --> 00:15:11,120
works that's all

307
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,070
[Music]

308
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:15,920
[Applause]

309
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:19,500
thank you

310
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:23,000
anybody have any questions

311
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:32,940
thanks for that Patricia so um I I took

312
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:34,740
you took your point that

313
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:38,100
um you're looking at um uh like like

314
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:40,199
what threats look like now and in the

315
00:15:40,199 --> 00:15:43,199
future but um I I you know I I struggled

316
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:44,519
a bit with with what you said there

317
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:46,139
because I've you know I've been around

318
00:15:46,139 --> 00:15:47,940
in the industry for for many years and

319
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:49,380
you know I was comparing well you know

320
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:51,120
if you look at the past how threats were

321
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,160
in the past if what I've imagined them

322
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,260
now it's the same things that come up

323
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:57,660
over and over again and I was just

324
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:59,820
wondering do you think that will always

325
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:03,120
be true or is is this um you know is

326
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,579
there a fundamental set of things that

327
00:16:05,579 --> 00:16:07,699
um are always going to be security

328
00:16:07,699 --> 00:16:10,079
weaknesses that are fundamental to the

329
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:12,240
human character or do you think that new

330
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,279
technologies will naturally bring new

331
00:16:14,279 --> 00:16:16,199
different ways of attacking

332
00:16:16,199 --> 00:16:20,040
great question so I think there there

333
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:23,880
are certain so the new concerns don't

334
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:27,899
eliminate the common ones so one thing

335
00:16:27,899 --> 00:16:30,300
that that you could see the Privacy is

336
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:33,000
always a concern even in my grandparents

337
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,120
uh time they'll be concerned okay

338
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,639
can anyone read my letters that are

339
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:40,259
supposed to be only to that person so

340
00:16:40,259 --> 00:16:42,959
you can see privacy is always a concern

341
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:44,339
there

342
00:16:44,339 --> 00:16:46,380
it's just that new security

343
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:49,680
considerations are added it's not that

344
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,620
there are uh I I'm not I'm absolutely

345
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:55,259
not saying that the the old ones are

346
00:16:55,259 --> 00:16:58,519
gone some some are even

347
00:16:58,519 --> 00:17:01,620
hiding it like highlighted now so

348
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:04,319
because the previously now and the data

349
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:06,660
it's kind of just a derivation from

350
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:10,020
those like really old ones but the

351
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:11,819
because it's much bigger and we're all

352
00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:14,459
just connected to each other they are

353
00:17:14,459 --> 00:17:16,679
even more important

354
00:17:16,679 --> 00:17:19,439
and if you go to the Future they are

355
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:21,419
still there I still want people to read

356
00:17:21,419 --> 00:17:24,179
my mind if it is no please do not to

357
00:17:24,179 --> 00:17:27,480
read a and not write I would say that

358
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:30,480
right is even worse I'd say

359
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,080
um

360
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:34,620
so I absolutely it's not that

361
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:37,380
there are all always the common ones

362
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:38,640
it's just that

363
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,200
you might

364
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:43,020
encounter other ones that you're not

365
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:45,600
thinking right now but you might have to

366
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,880
think of them in the future

367
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:50,539
thank you

368
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:54,559
any other questions

369
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,480
um I've got one if no one else does

370
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,340
um so I was just wondering in terms of

371
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:01,320
you talking about your

372
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:03,960
um threat modeling

373
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,400
um going back to the title of your site

374
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,500
where do you draw the line in terms of

375
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:11,220
how far how far do you go

376
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:12,900
um to say that this is something that's

377
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,880
beyond the realm or this is something

378
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,860
that we need to build in in the next

379
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:19,020
three to five years do you do it on

380
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:21,419
impact do you do it on time to adoption

381
00:18:21,419 --> 00:18:24,679
how do you draw that line

382
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:28,280
I haven't had that

383
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:33,960
in that I've done a couple and that's

384
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:36,260
something that I I

385
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:38,580
I I struggle with that because I just

386
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:41,840
want to fix everything my line is really

387
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:44,640
well in my acceptance line in terms of

388
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,580
spreads is that I don't accept I am like

389
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:49,140
no no we have to defend against this

390
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:51,600
even if it's such a small thing so I'd

391
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,679
say

392
00:18:52,679 --> 00:18:55,140
because ultimately and this is something

393
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:57,660
that I've learned uh recently ultimately

394
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:01,760
everything is a business so if uh

395
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:06,000
companies that you work for they they're

396
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,240
not looking to be absolutely 100 secure

397
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,500
because everyone knows that's not

398
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:14,700
possible and it's not uh profitable

399
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:18,660
so I'm gonna say this well it's almost

400
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:21,240
like a joke just go as much as you can

401
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:24,600
until like until tilled off by your uh

402
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,580
or Superior saying no you cannot do that

403
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:27,900
because you're spending way too much

404
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:30,539
money and just handling that one threat

405
00:19:30,539 --> 00:19:31,919
scenario

406
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:32,640
um

407
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:36,360
but do consider them because I believe

408
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:39,360
that you're better off at least knowing

409
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,580
the threats are there even if you're not

410
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:43,799
handling them you are aware and you are

411
00:19:43,799 --> 00:19:46,200
conscious that it's something even if

412
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,840
the likelihood is really small

413
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:52,260
it's something that can happen

414
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:54,960
cool thank you here's any other

415
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,160
questions yep

416
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,940
thank you um you know how you said that

417
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:04,380
don't limit yourself to the boundaries

418
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:06,539
of your reality books how would you

419
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:09,360
suggest to somebody like how to achieve

420
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,260
that

421
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:12,780
like how how can one push themselves to

422
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:13,620
think

423
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:17,600
above that reality box

424
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:21,120
excellent uh

425
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,039
oh

426
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:27,120
just you need creative you need to

427
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,320
think that

428
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,820
that's a really good question you just

429
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:35,100
screwed me

430
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:37,740
because I'm not trying to think what

431
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:42,380
made me think of the physical pain one

432
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:51,840
[Music]

433
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:55,020
would it be like exposing yourself to

434
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:58,880
things and just I don't know

435
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,380
experiencing whatever happens and then

436
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:04,500
open mind maybe fair enough I won't take

437
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:08,100
it and open and I was just talking to

438
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,720
people and coming to conferences like

439
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:12,600
this and where you where you because

440
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:16,260
sometimes just one or a shower you know

441
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:18,000
sometimes you're in the shower and you

442
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,240
just find something

443
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:23,400
in your brain like back there you're

444
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,539
like you know what

445
00:21:24,539 --> 00:21:26,880
it makes sense and

446
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,740
you just have to try to fit it then

447
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:31,340
thank you

448
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:35,070
oh we're out of time thank you so much

449
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:39,000
[Applause]
