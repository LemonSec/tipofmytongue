1
00:00:02,959 --> 00:00:05,160
hi everyone thanks for hanging around

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:07,020
till the end of the day uh my name is

3
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:12,018
Phil and this is the office of danger

4
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:16,379
and choose your own adventure story

5
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:18,180
um so just to sort of preface this this

6
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:19,800
is a social engineering engagement

7
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,140
social engineering if no one has done it

8
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:24,539
is super stressful

9
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:26,640
um so to put that into a little bit of

10
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,680
perspective I am relatively nervous

11
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,539
stood up here talking to you my heart

12
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:34,980
rate is around 95. uh this graph shows

13
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:37,140
over the two days anything that is

14
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:39,660
orange means that I was above about a

15
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:42,960
hundred or no above about 75. so two

16
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,239
days of pure stress so when you're

17
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:47,340
making your decisions in your head try

18
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:48,660
to be like

19
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:50,520
 if I do this wrong I might go to

20
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,500
jail or if I do this wrong I might

21
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,320
you know fail my job so like please have

22
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,300
that inbuilt stress if you can that

23
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:01,140
would be great uh yeah my Peak over the

24
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:04,680
two days was 150 I mean I'm a runner my

25
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:07,260
running Peaks at about 160 so I was

26
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:09,780
genuine heart in my chest stuff

27
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:13,320
for two whole dates so the rules this is

28
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,580
what we're doing this is an audience

29
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:16,740
based decision making game each of you

30
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:19,020
should have a blue and yellow card

31
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:20,880
does everybody have one

32
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,839
this has gone well

33
00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:26,520
um so for each decision there'll be two

34
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,799
options and you choose the color that

35
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:31,799
you want hold them up

36
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:32,580
um

37
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:35,159
and for this engage for this job that

38
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:36,780
we're doing it was a two-day engagement

39
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:38,820
so you've got two chances of completing

40
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:40,380
the aims

41
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:43,079
um and because I sort of wrote this ages

42
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:44,280
ago thinking it might go to America

43
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,380
where they do crazy stuff in the middle

44
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:48,299
of the night this must be completed

45
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:49,920
during office hours so that's why we're

46
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,299
not lock picking breaking Windows

47
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:53,100
climbing in at 3am

48
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:55,680
uh also on your person you have a get

49
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,180
out of jail free card

50
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:03,060
so the target where are we going so it's

51
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:05,759
a multi-use office in central London the

52
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,098
client rents out half of the seventh

53
00:02:08,098 --> 00:02:10,020
floor and the entirety of the eighth

54
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:12,360
floor we did some ocean before we went

55
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:15,300
and we found out that there are security

56
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,520
guards on the ground floor

57
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,500
security guards on the first floor in

58
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,080
the reception area security gates to get

59
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,120
to the lifts security doors to gain

60
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,680
access to the offices

61
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,420
and there are other users in the

62
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:29,819
building including like a wework regia

63
00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:31,319
style shared office

64
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:33,540
and we also found out the head of it and

65
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:36,120
the ansemit staff names within Target

66
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,780
organization

67
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:41,459
so the scope this is what you've got to

68
00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:43,920
achieve over the two days is access to

69
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,660
the seventh floor access to the eighth

70
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:48,660
floor a scan of the internal Network and

71
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:50,459
identify any low-hanging fruit on the

72
00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:52,080
internal Network

73
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,900

um

87
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:25,500
right

88
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,920
the setup day one so Ocean discovered a

89
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,300
shared office space within the building

90
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:33,060
do you decide to use this is it in or

91
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:35,459
out of scope

92
00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:37,890
insco

93
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:41,980
[Music]

94
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:46,140
so you've decided that that third party

95
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:48,720
office is in scope do you try and book a

96
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,280
legitimate viewing through their head

97
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,780
office

98
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:53,459
yes or no

99
00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:54,900
yeah you don't need me for this one

100
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:57,659
you're absolutely booking a viewing

101
00:03:57,659 --> 00:04:00,420
perfect you ring up head office while on

102
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:02,099
the train down because you're really not

103
00:04:02,099 --> 00:04:03,840
that organized and they tell you that

104
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,700
someone in the office will be in touch

105
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:08,940
they do not ring back

106
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:10,140
so

107
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:12,299
you get down to London you made your

108
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:14,819
phone call no one rang you back but you

109
00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:16,380
have to press on anyway so it's time to

110
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:18,779
go you bypass the security on the ground

111
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:20,760
floor they were super friendly and just

112
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,979
said receptions up there so you go up

113
00:04:22,979 --> 00:04:23,759
there

114
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:26,220
when you get to reception they ask how

115
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:29,040
can I help so do you pretend to have a

116
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,139
booking with the third party to view the

117
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:33,680
shared offices

118
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:37,680
hey yes yes yep

119
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,139
so reception Rings the reception of the

120
00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:41,280
third party

121
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,320
they do not know who you are because no

122
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,000
one has confirmed your visit

123
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,820
you explain the whole Saga you elaborate

124
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:50,220
it takes quite a few minutes and then

125
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:52,380
after that they present you with a

126
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:54,180
security pass and tell you to head to

127
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:57,979
the fourth floor via the elevators

128
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,180
it works

129
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:02,100
you get past the first security gates

130
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:04,740
this is super exciting where do you go

131
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:06,720
do you go to the third party or do you

132
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,740
go straight up to your client

133
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:16,139
my client deceiving me client all right

134
00:05:16,139 --> 00:05:18,360
which of the client's flaws do you want

135
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,580
to visit the seventh floor or the eighth

136
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:22,580
floor

137
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:25,580
okay

138
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:30,600
45 minutes right yeah we could go out

139
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,360
again about eight please hey

140
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,520
okay

141
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,280
right we head up to the eighth floor

142
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:41,820
so you exit and out of the elevators

143
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:45,000
there is an access controlled door you

144
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,039
try the door and your key card does not

145
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:48,419
work

146
00:05:48,419 --> 00:05:50,580
so no one enters or exits during the 10

147
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:52,259
minutes you stand there looking like a

148
00:05:52,259 --> 00:05:55,860
right bell end do you leave or wait a

149
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:58,340
bit longer

150
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,639
I think they're leaving we're leaving

151
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:05,280
yeah we're leaving

152
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,979
you gave up

153
00:06:06,979 --> 00:06:11,160
you head down and you decide to go to

154
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,320
the pub really you have to work on this

155
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:16,219
because that was not great

156
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,600
um

157
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,380
so

158
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:22,319
this is what I did differently somewhat

159
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:25,020
more successfully no so I uh similar to

160
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:27,419
you I decided that the third party was

161
00:06:27,419 --> 00:06:29,520
definitely in scope uh I did actually

162
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,259
ring up the head office while on the

163
00:06:31,259 --> 00:06:34,380
train and they did not ring me back

164
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:36,960
so I had to Black it at Main reception

165
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,699
which took more convincing than you

166
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:40,080
would have thought they had quite a

167
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,199
strict policy but I got the pass and I

168
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,520
went up

169
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:47,460
to the fourth floor and I did a tour now

170
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:50,100
I did a 40-minute tour with a shared

171
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:52,020
office that I had absolutely no interest

172
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:54,840
in uh it was quite useful they told me

173
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:57,720
some super good stuff like there were

174
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:01,020
cycling racks on the ground floor and

175
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,759
where some of the security guards were

176
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:05,460
but I tried to leave there to go to the

177
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:07,020
stairs so I could then work my way up

178
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:09,479
and they did not let me do that I had to

179
00:07:09,479 --> 00:07:10,979
go back to the lifts

180
00:07:10,979 --> 00:07:14,220
so I went up to the lifts and I thought

181
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:15,840
I'll go to the seventh floor you know

182
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,940
first one on my target list why not

183
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:19,800
didn't really think about that didn't

184
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,539
really think that they would have Aid

185
00:07:21,539 --> 00:07:23,880
their own reception I was hoping to just

186
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,800
get to an access control door

187
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,720
but there was reception so I walked out

188
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,639
they buzzed me through and we're like hi

189
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:32,400
who are you I was like well

190
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,340
um had a chat with them and

191
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:37,139
what we might do is play the rest of

192
00:07:37,139 --> 00:07:38,639
this game we might do some of this again

193
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,919
from further Buck because there's quite

194
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:42,599
a cool bit around reception which lets

195
00:07:42,599 --> 00:07:44,039
you do decisions we've got time for this

196
00:07:44,039 --> 00:07:46,199
you can make this up right bear with me

197
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:48,240
two seconds

198
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,120
uh

199
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,880
right we wrote yeah we do have another

200
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:57,979
day so that's fine right this time

201
00:07:59,819 --> 00:08:03,180
no yeah fine true yeah yeah okay

202
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:04,919
so that so last time I went to the

203
00:08:04,919 --> 00:08:06,599
eighth floor which was a great idea and

204
00:08:06,599 --> 00:08:08,220
actually should have worked but for some

205
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:09,660
reason didn't

206
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:11,520
um but this time if we go to the seventh

207
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,740
floor so you exit the elevator and it

208
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:14,940
Buzz through the door by client

209
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:16,979
reception looking around there's no way

210
00:08:16,979 --> 00:08:18,599
to avoid direct interaction with

211
00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:20,520
receptionists you walk as slowly as

212
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:23,400
possible and try to think of a plan

213
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,520
so you decide to be a pro you pretend to

214
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,319
be as new starter during covid working

215
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:30,060
from home and this is your first time in

216
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:32,159
the office what name do you provide

217
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,500
provides a reception a fake name or your

218
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,919
real name

219
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:42,719
deciding folks in Europe fake name fake

220
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:44,839
name

221
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,600
the receptionist does a really good job

222
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,000
and looks you up on teams they notice

223
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,980
that you're in a call

224
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:55,500
uh you act confused and you know it must

225
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,060
it must be someone else maybe someone's

226
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:59,160
ringing me I don't know what it is and

227
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,720
they continued to stand there while you

228
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,880
continue looking like a plum

229
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,040
uh after a little while the

230
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,240
receptionists

231
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,399
starts to not really believe what you're

232
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,140
saying and asks your line manager's name

233
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:13,019
now you found out the head of it so this

234
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:15,600
is a global insurance firm with the when

235
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,459
I say head of it I'm in the global head

236
00:09:17,459 --> 00:09:18,600
of I.T

237
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,760
do you change the conversation or give

238
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,360
them the name

239
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,560
nice so you give them the name and

240
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,660
they sort of have a look and they're

241
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:32,880
still trying to find you and the

242
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,560
receptionist asks you have you received

243
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,060
your mug yet

244
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:38,580
now out of all the questions in the

245
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:40,440
world I was expecting this was not one

246
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,959
of them uh so you kind of look at them

247
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:45,600
like what are you talking about uh and

248
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,580
then you say no they pass you a branded

249
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:51,000
mug do you take it

250
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,140
100 free free stuff right right free

251
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:56,959
stuff

252
00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:00,660
really to take time yeah uh yeah

253
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:03,120
um so the receptionist continues to look

254
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,380
at you quite strangely they're still

255
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:06,660
looking up your boss uh while you look

256
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:08,519
at your really beautiful branded mug

257
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:11,279
glass little blue band to hold it it was

258
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:13,440
brilliant uh they ask you how you got to

259
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,360
the floor and if you had a key card

260
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,640
do you tell them someone let you up or

261
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,440
do you show them your key card from the

262
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,860
fourth floor

263
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:30,120
so the receptionist takes your card and

264
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,740
states that this is not one of their

265
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:33,240
cards

266
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,760
you go well I don't flip a no it's your

267
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,560
building um it's just what I got given

268
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,480
but they they're really not starting to

269
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,160
believe you at this point you remember I

270
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:43,740
said 150 beats per minute heart rate

271
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:47,940
this was then interacting with reception

272
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:49,260
um so they start to see through your

273
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:51,600
story they can't get through to the

274
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,160
manager and ask for any other contact

275
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,440
details do you provide the name of your

276
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,880
contact or show you'll get out of jail

277
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,360
free card

278
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:03,240
the name of contact nice

279
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,279
so the receptionist rings a client who

280
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:06,899
appears behind you on reception they

281
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:08,459
escort you to a meeting room and you

282
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:10,140
have like a nice little initial debrief

283
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:12,600
heart rate goes down slightly you tell

284
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,060
them what's happened so far and you make

285
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:17,459
a plan do you suggest that you call it a

286
00:11:17,459 --> 00:11:19,380
day or ask for them to take you past

287
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:21,920
reception

288
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:24,660
past reception

289
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:26,519
so your contact agrees to confidently

290
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,440
walk you past reception see if reception

291
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,420
says anything do you request to be left

292
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:33,000
on the 7th or the eighth floor

293
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,920
you're currently on the seventh just for

294
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:37,140
memory

295
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:39,980
eight

296
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:44,940
so your client halfway up the stairs

297
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:47,040
decides that it's not really fair to

298
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,019
give you access to the eighth floor so

299
00:11:49,019 --> 00:11:52,260
they leave you halfway up the stairs so

300
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:54,600
there you are you follow them up and

301
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,579
it's an access control door you go back

302
00:11:56,579 --> 00:11:59,579
down and it's an access control door

303
00:11:59,579 --> 00:12:02,339
but luckily for you the toilets are on

304
00:12:02,339 --> 00:12:04,980
the unsecured side so after five minutes

305
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:07,320
someone goes through to go for a wee so

306
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,579
you grab the door and let yourself in

307
00:12:08,579 --> 00:12:11,100
you're on the eighth floor

308
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:13,380
you sit at a spare desk without being

309
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:15,360
challenged partly thanks to your nice

310
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,940
shiny mug that you took earlier after an

311
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:19,740
hour people start leaving for the day do

312
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:21,720
you stay and scan do some work or do you

313
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:24,500
decide to leave with them

314
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:29,160
and map away you do some you do some

315
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,380
actual real work for the day then once

316
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:32,940
you're done you head back down to the

317
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:35,519
left skater reception now again what you

318
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:38,220
weren't expecting were the security

319
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:40,800
gates on the way out to ask for your

320
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,139
past and your fourth floor pass has been

321
00:12:43,139 --> 00:12:45,600
disabled because reception knew you

322
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,760
weren't meant to be there so you're

323
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,820
stuck between elevators under a speed

324
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:53,100
gate do you wait for help or

325
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:56,300
athletically jump the gate

326
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,579
oh

327
00:12:59,579 --> 00:13:04,040
I want to see Dan Carter John Brigade

328
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:06,899
you start to climb over the gate you've

329
00:13:06,899 --> 00:13:08,700
got your laptop you've got your coat

330
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:11,579
your adrenaline's buggered uh you do not

331
00:13:11,579 --> 00:13:13,740
do this elegantly and security guard

332
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:16,260
sees you and comes over so you have to

333
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:17,940
explain the whole story your past didn't

334
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:19,980
work and they escort you to the meeting

335
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:20,880
room

336
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,980
they're really sketchy and you decide

337
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:25,200
that before anything goes worse you give

338
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,959
them your Jail letter and they escort

339
00:13:27,959 --> 00:13:30,619
you out the building

340
00:13:30,839 --> 00:13:34,200
end of day one take two

341
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,300
um should go for another pint

342
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:37,560
so

343
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:38,760
um thank you for letting me do that but

344
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,380
that's kind of the route that I took so

345
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:41,880
I went up to the seventh floor spoke to

346
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,019
reception

347
00:13:43,019 --> 00:13:44,760
and they gave me this mug which I've got

348
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:47,880
at home which is brilliant well excited

349
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:51,060
when I gave the head of it's name I

350
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:53,220
thought they are never gonna ring the

351
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:55,620
global head of I.T about some guy in

352
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:56,639
reception

353
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:59,220
she did

354
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:03,240
he was on holiday oh I was so lucky so

355
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:07,019
she then still didn't see through my my

356
00:14:07,019 --> 00:14:09,300
whole Gambit so we ended up calling the

357
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:12,480
client now she rang the client

358
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,180
and I hear a mobile phone go off about

359
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:18,060
where that door is behind me my client

360
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:21,180
had been stood in reception watching the

361
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:23,519
entire thing

362
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:25,860
I was horrendous

363
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:26,399
um

364
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:28,380
but yeah we had a little chat and we

365
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:30,000
thought let's walk past reception see

366
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,579
what happens and um he actually

367
00:14:32,579 --> 00:14:34,380
genuinely left me on the stairs as well

368
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:35,519
which

369
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:38,040
what a dick did not did not like that

370
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:41,399
guy so yeah we but managed to tailgate

371
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:43,139
onto the eighths below you set a desk I

372
00:14:43,139 --> 00:14:45,779
stayed did some scams and I genuinely

373
00:14:45,779 --> 00:14:49,019
got stuck between the lifts unlike Diane

374
00:14:49,019 --> 00:14:51,660
I didn't decide to try and Vault them I

375
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:54,120
waited and a very nice lady came down

376
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,160
and was on her way out and I was like oh

377
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,720
my card doesn't work and she beat me

378
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:00,660
through so I then legged it chucking my

379
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:03,060
card sort of near the door and just

380
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:04,980
legged out of the building and had a

381
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:07,019
really good point

382
00:15:07,019 --> 00:15:08,399
ah

383
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:10,680
so

384
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:13,680
you then slept super badly because

385
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:17,699
you're still really nervous so day two

386
00:15:17,699 --> 00:15:20,160
you go back in after having a chat with

387
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:23,279
the client you realize that actually

388
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:26,160
you've got a wework style Renton office

389
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,260
so there's no point trying to bypass

390
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,660
reception again because as an attacker I

391
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:31,920
will just rent the office for a month

392
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,680
get a genuine pass and be allowed in

393
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:35,760
every day

394
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:38,040
so we decide that we'll get a pass from

395
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,959
reception so that I can at least do a

396
00:15:39,959 --> 00:15:41,940
little bit more

397
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:43,500
um however when I ring the client to

398
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,540
kind of sort this out turns out his

399
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:48,000
child was Ill so he was at home so the

400
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,920
one person in this high security office

401
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,959
building in central London he knew I was

402
00:15:51,959 --> 00:15:54,180
there wasn't there

403
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:57,000
so I I then have to try and explain this

404
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,639
to reception now reception are like who

405
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:01,860
the hell are you like what what are you

406
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:03,060
talking about

407
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:04,500
um we end up having to call the client

408
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,839
it goes on I think it was about an hour

409
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:09,420
and a quarter of me just trying to get

410
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:12,240
past reception in a legitimate way it

411
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,920
would have been easier to have blood dip

412
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,260
for a second day in a row

413
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:18,300
um but after I said 20 minutes here it

414
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:20,339
was definitely longer but where do you

415
00:16:20,339 --> 00:16:22,199
head do you head you've been given a

416
00:16:22,199 --> 00:16:24,120
past you go towards the stairs or the

417
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,660
elevators

418
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:35,339
gonna go up the elevator all right so

419
00:16:35,339 --> 00:16:38,399
your past Works you're fine you get to

420
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,199
the elevator waiting area which floor

421
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:42,360
would you go to the seventh floor or the

422
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,779
eighth floor

423
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:49,380
Heights

424
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:52,680
so you sort of hover around I mean an

425
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,600
elevator waiting area is quite a good

426
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:57,300
place to loiter uh and it had a little

427
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:59,040
nice little screen where people push

428
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,380
buttons before they got to the lifts so

429
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:03,060
it came up above the lift Which floor it

430
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:05,339
was going to which was really handy so I

431
00:17:05,339 --> 00:17:07,619
stood there you sorry you're all doing

432
00:17:07,619 --> 00:17:09,299
this you stood there until someone

433
00:17:09,299 --> 00:17:11,339
pressed the eighth floor so you follow

434
00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:13,140
him follow them into the lift and then

435
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:15,059
as the polite person you are when you

436
00:17:15,059 --> 00:17:17,640
get there you let them out

437
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,799
so that they can go and beat their card

438
00:17:19,799 --> 00:17:22,799
and go in however

439
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:25,140
they walk out the left and then they

440
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:28,140
stop and they go

441
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:30,840
and they cannot find their pass they

442
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,120
don't know where it is do you get back

443
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,760
in the lift or do you also wait with

444
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,000
them

445
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:44,099
[Music]

446
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,660
so you wait

447
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:47,700
you have to act along as well where's

448
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:50,580
your pass you take off your backpack you

449
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:53,039
kneel down you pull out your laptop you

450
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:55,740
pull out your your whatever try not to

451
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:57,360
show if you're a hacker no stickers

452
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,620
allowed

453
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:00,960
um and eventually they find their past

454
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,780
and open the door you quickly bundle

455
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:04,980
everything back in your bag and grab

456
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:06,960
grab the door and you follow them in

457
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,080
brilliant we're in the eighth floor back

458
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,400
in the eighth floor should I say after

459
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,559
doing so well on day one so where'd you

460
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:15,059
go do you take a seat

461
00:18:15,059 --> 00:18:17,520
or do you do a lap to kind of get the

462
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,000
layer around

463
00:18:21,539 --> 00:18:24,120
you do a lot

464
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:26,280
you do a laugh at your office no in the

465
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:28,620
view out the window genuine view if you

466
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:30,059
can't see that right at the back that is

467
00:18:30,059 --> 00:18:34,100
Saint Paul's and other London landmarks

468
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:36,780
you crack on

469
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:38,880
okay cool

470
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,860
awkward this is being recorded no it's

471
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:41,820
fine

472
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:42,840
um

473
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:45,900
so you you do an entire lap you stop you

474
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:48,059
take a picture of the view no nobody

475
00:18:48,059 --> 00:18:50,580
really cares that you're there

476
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:52,500
um what'd you do next you head down to

477
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:53,880
the seventh floor or do you take a seat

478
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,480
on this floor

479
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,059
so you find an empty seat you connect to

480
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:04,380
the network

481
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:07,140
uh and no one literally no one notices

482
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:10,080
you after about 10 minutes you're over

483
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,600
here A Team sat next to you discussing a

484
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:15,059
person who got a pass at Main reception

485
00:19:15,059 --> 00:19:17,400
that didn't arrive at the office

486
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,660
reception

487
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:21,240
you you quite quickly realized that this

488
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:23,100
can only be you

489
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:26,220
uh and you hear that the security guards

490
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:28,799
are doing a floor by four floor sweep of

491
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:30,500
the building for someone

492
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:33,720
do you stay where you are or do you find

493
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:36,320
a meeting room to hide him

494
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:39,140
hi Bill

495
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:42,059
so you you kind of do another lap of the

496
00:19:42,059 --> 00:19:43,260
floor you really know your way around

497
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:46,320
and you find an empty meeting room uh

498
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,120
you sit there you unplug the VoIP phone

499
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,679
brilliant new network you can start

500
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:51,900
scanning and you'll see actually in the

501
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,640
picture the little cup that meant that I

502
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,679
was meant to be there

503
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:58,740
um this meeting room actually isn't a

504
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:01,200
meeting room this is an executive's

505
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,600
office

506
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:06,660
they returned from a meeting and go

507
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:08,880
who are you and I'd love to tell you the

508
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,799
exact conversation because he said who

509
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:13,260
who are you and so I looked and went hey

510
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:15,080
who are you

511
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:17,760
and with the door open he genuinely

512
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:21,419
pointed to the name on the door and said

513
00:20:21,419 --> 00:20:25,799
this is me I was like right okay so

514
00:20:25,799 --> 00:20:27,780
you then you kind of politely make

515
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:30,539
conversation and while you're doing that

516
00:20:30,539 --> 00:20:32,280
do you do you try and plug the VoIP

517
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34,320
phone back in or do you just awkwardly

518
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:37,159
pack up and leave

519
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:40,980
yeah

520
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:43,140
so while you're leaving the office you

521
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:45,360
sort of built up a bit of a report

522
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,520
and he informs you that if you're

523
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,140
looking for a nice meeting room to hang

524
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:50,760
out in there are loads on the seventh

525
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:53,520
floor that are empty so you decide this

526
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,220
is probably the best place to go now

527
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:58,559
so you exit the eighth floor and you

528
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:01,980
head down to the seventh now

529
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:03,720
there are two Access Control doors to

530
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:06,360
access this floor because they only own

531
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,620
half the floor

532
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:09,419
so

533
00:21:09,419 --> 00:21:12,059
you after about 15 minutes no one has

534
00:21:12,059 --> 00:21:15,059
gone in or out of the first door so just

535
00:21:15,059 --> 00:21:16,919
to paint the picture it's a door then

536
00:21:16,919 --> 00:21:19,260
it's a corridor with another set of

537
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:21,539
doors so you're trying to just get

538
00:21:21,539 --> 00:21:23,880
through the part the first one so did

539
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:26,220
you head back to the first floor knowing

540
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:27,660
that you've completed your tasks up

541
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:30,500
there or do you wait

542
00:21:30,679 --> 00:21:32,900
right for it

543
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:36,059
after about 10 minutes and in these 10

544
00:21:36,059 --> 00:21:37,679
minutes you sort of awkwardly walk up

545
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:38,820
and down the stairs because you know

546
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:40,679
there's CCTV so you're like if they

547
00:21:40,679 --> 00:21:42,900
glance that someone not just weirdly

548
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:44,700
standing there be on your phone for a

549
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:45,780
while

550
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:48,419
um someone enters the seventh floor you

551
00:21:48,419 --> 00:21:50,220
managed to grab the door and you

552
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:51,780
tailgate them in

553
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:54,600
but as you follow them in they sort of

554
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:57,480
slow down turn around and give you that

555
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:00,240
look that you all know of

556
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,659
I'm about to ask you a question

557
00:22:02,659 --> 00:22:06,000
so do you continue to follow them or do

558
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,860
you go the other way to the other office

559
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:10,280
door

560
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:16,919
so you turn your head towards the other

561
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:18,480
office door

562
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,880
the person as it turns out was going to

563
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,000
the office you wanted to go to so they

564
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,340
go in but you can't you can't catch the

565
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:27,720
door they didn't open it enough they

566
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:30,299
were being pretty security conscious

567
00:22:30,299 --> 00:22:33,240
so now you're stood in a tiny vestibule

568
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,740
you've got three doors two are locked

569
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:36,659
and one takes you back to the stairs

570
00:22:36,659 --> 00:22:38,940
so you stand there you again make a

571
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:40,500
phone call you wait against them or

572
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,419
whatever people do in vestibules but you

573
00:22:42,419 --> 00:22:44,840
wait until a

574
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:47,580
member of the catering staff comes

575
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:48,720
through and heads towards the client

576
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,820
door you managed to grab the door and

577
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:52,919
you let yourself in the executive was

578
00:22:52,919 --> 00:22:54,659
right there are multiple empty offices

579
00:22:54,659 --> 00:22:57,179
you sit in one and for the rest of the

580
00:22:57,179 --> 00:23:00,179
day you do all your scanning and

581
00:23:00,179 --> 00:23:03,240
literally no one notices you're there

582
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:06,000
so you're done you've hit all your

583
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,679
targets you've done your scanning you've

584
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:09,000
hit both floors you've let yourself in

585
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,159
everywhere uh you ring the client you

586
00:23:11,159 --> 00:23:13,080
provide a debrief over your findings

587
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:14,520
throughout the two days

588
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:16,980
uh the client then asks if you can

589
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:21,299
debrief both receptions and just kind of

590
00:23:21,299 --> 00:23:22,980
make sure that everybody is aware and

591
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:25,380
knows what went on

592
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:27,419
this was really interesting because the

593
00:23:27,419 --> 00:23:28,919
person who I dealt with on the reception

594
00:23:28,919 --> 00:23:31,799
on day one had gone on lunch break

595
00:23:31,799 --> 00:23:33,960
so I said oh can I speak to so-and-so

596
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:34,740
and they were like yeah they're on their

597
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:36,299
break they'll be back in like half an

598
00:23:36,299 --> 00:23:37,020
hour

599
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:39,659
I was like right I kind of really need

600
00:23:39,659 --> 00:23:42,059
to speak to them so ended up sitting in

601
00:23:42,059 --> 00:23:44,159
their reception again for half an hour

602
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:46,559
waiting for this person to kind of to

603
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:47,820
come back

604
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:49,740
but you debrief them and there's no

605
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:52,500
issue and you're done success

606
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:55,320
uh you exit the building after you've

607
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:58,080
debriefed every single person and you

608
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,900
head to the pub for what was one of the

609
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:04,280
best points you've had in your life

610
00:24:05,159 --> 00:24:09,179
um so my day two was actually very

611
00:24:09,179 --> 00:24:12,539
similar to yours uh so I managed to get

612
00:24:12,539 --> 00:24:14,220
the pass from reception after a lot of

613
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:16,200
touring and throwing with reception and

614
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,299
the client on the phone

615
00:24:18,299 --> 00:24:20,159
um I actually asked to go to the stairs

616
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:22,559
so that I could then sort of tailgate my

617
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:25,500
way in and they told me that you would

618
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:28,380
need to be escorted by a security guard

619
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:30,059
and I realized that would probably be

620
00:24:30,059 --> 00:24:32,159
really bad news so I ended up being like

621
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:35,159
no no it's fine my my fear of lifts

622
00:24:35,159 --> 00:24:36,720
which is the excuse I gave I wanted to

623
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,760
take the stairs magically fixed itself

624
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:42,179
and I managed to get to the lifts

625
00:24:42,179 --> 00:24:44,400
um again went up to the eighth floor

626
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,380
and the person did genuinely struggle to

627
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:48,240
find their cards so I got my bag down

628
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,400
got everything out it was it was really

629
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,780
awkward

630
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:53,700
um yeah sat down next to the Commercial

631
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,620
Services team and heard them discussing

632
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:58,500
me as it turned out in the end they

633
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:01,559
ended up ringing my client because main

634
00:25:01,559 --> 00:25:03,780
reception remembered that they spoke to

635
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:05,880
them and he was like yeah please don't

636
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:08,220
send security so I was never gonna get

637
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:10,200
rumbled but for a good portion of the

638
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,299
day I did think security were really

639
00:25:12,299 --> 00:25:15,299
doing a sweep of the building

640
00:25:15,299 --> 00:25:17,760
um so instead of sitting there next to

641
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,679
them I did go and get a coffee and have

642
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:22,679
breakfast in their breakout room

643
00:25:22,679 --> 00:25:23,460
um

644
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:25,080
so I went into the meeting room as you

645
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,760
did unplug the phone

646
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,740
the executive I spoke about was the

647
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:31,679
global head of Finance turns out he was

648
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:33,779
really important

649
00:25:33,779 --> 00:25:35,880
um he had literally nothing in his

650
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:38,100
office you know like a circular table

651
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:40,620
four chairs a bit like that

652
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:42,900
and a phone that was it I was like how

653
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:45,600
do you live like this but fine

654
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,700
um I did not plug the phone back in I

655
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:49,260
think I didn't tell anyone I completely

656
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:51,720
forgot so I hope for days he actually

657
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:52,980
got some work done so he didn't get

658
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:55,080
interrupted

659
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:55,740
um

660
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:57,960
again 20 minutes waiting to tailgate

661
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,820
someone into the seventh floor

662
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:01,799
and the same the actual thing happened

663
00:26:01,799 --> 00:26:03,840
if the guy looked at me and I I like

664
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,640
darted to the other door pretending to

665
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:08,580
go in there and it felt forever stood in

666
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:10,919
this vestibule until it was a catering

667
00:26:10,919 --> 00:26:12,600
lady with a trolley so I could be super

668
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:15,120
helpful holding the door for her but

669
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,700
yeah that was really bad

670
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:19,559
um but once I was in there like nobody

671
00:26:19,559 --> 00:26:21,480
cared at all

672
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:24,000
um managed to debrief the client on both

673
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,740
reception teams which went really well

674
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:27,779
and actually the receptionist was quite

675
00:26:27,779 --> 00:26:31,380
receptive pun actually quite intended

676
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:34,080
um about it all because

677
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,179
they were super confused by the

678
00:26:36,179 --> 00:26:37,620
interaction I had with them on the first

679
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:39,240
day they were like I don't understand

680
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:41,520
who you were so this actually and then

681
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,020
they just kept asking they got really

682
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:45,659
fixated and if they passed or failed so

683
00:26:45,659 --> 00:26:46,799
for the rest of the conversation they're

684
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:48,299
like but did we pass

685
00:26:48,299 --> 00:26:50,340
I was like I I don't really

686
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:52,500
I don't pass or fail you it's like but

687
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:54,840
did we passed and in the end I was like

688
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:56,299
yes

689
00:26:56,299 --> 00:26:59,700
why not make him feel better

690
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:00,600
um

691
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:03,299
so that was fine uh but what's really

692
00:27:03,299 --> 00:27:05,039
interesting and I don't know if people

693
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:07,620
do social engineering here but I like to

694
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:09,600
think of social engineering there's

695
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:13,320
three zones there's like a a green zone

696
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:15,179
of of outside the building which is

697
00:27:15,179 --> 00:27:16,620
anybody public

698
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:18,179
like you're never going to be questioned

699
00:27:18,179 --> 00:27:19,919
for stood out for standing outside a

700
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:21,659
building because anyone can stand there

701
00:27:21,659 --> 00:27:23,760
there's then sort of there should be the

702
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,020
other way around actually but there

703
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:26,460
should be like the yellow zone of you're

704
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:28,020
at reception

705
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:31,200
you kind of should be there but is the

706
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,520
place you're most likely to get caught

707
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,980
then once you're past reception you're

708
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:37,320
you're in people expect you to be there

709
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:39,720
they trust naturally that you should

710
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,520
you've got past the barrier so you're

711
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,620
there people holding doors leaving

712
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:45,179
lanyards leaving their computer as

713
00:27:45,179 --> 00:27:47,220
unlocked all because everybody there

714
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:49,740
should be trusted so the further in you

715
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:53,279
get actually the easier it is which is

716
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:55,020
almost the opposite of of what you might

717
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:56,279
think

718
00:27:56,279 --> 00:27:58,020
so in summary we've done all our

719
00:27:58,020 --> 00:27:59,100
questions thank you very much for

720
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:00,659
playing

721
00:28:00,659 --> 00:28:02,700
um social engineering is is terrifying

722
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:05,100
for anyone who does it you do have heart

723
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,200
in your hands you are every decision you

724
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,120
go and then you sort of question them

725
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:12,360
for quite a lot of days later

726
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:13,799
um one of the other big things with it

727
00:28:13,799 --> 00:28:16,559
is I kind of try and I don't want to

728
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:18,779
ruin anyone's day so although I'll try

729
00:28:18,779 --> 00:28:20,640
and trick people to let me do things I

730
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,919
like to do it in a nice way so they feel

731
00:28:22,919 --> 00:28:25,380
better for meeting me because I think if

732
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:27,360
you start manipulating people so that

733
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:30,299
they are detrimental once you trick them

734
00:28:30,299 --> 00:28:32,100
or you trick them in such a way it

735
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:35,279
affects their day you've it's just kind

736
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:36,840
of you have that lingering and you have

737
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,880
that feeling with you afterwards but if

738
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:41,640
you're bored of anything if you do you

739
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:43,080
know I sit at a computer all day I just

740
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:44,640
want to go and do something see if you

741
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,320
can sign up for social engineering it's

742
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,900
great fun you will I think you you'll

743
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:50,820
enjoy it or you'll hate it but either

744
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:52,440
way you get a day out

745
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,659
uh sometimes it works out really well

746
00:28:54,659 --> 00:28:57,240
such as this one that again that was my

747
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:59,820
breakfast in their breakout area nice

748
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:02,640
coffee croissant and uh pull a view of

749
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,240
St Paul's

750
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,940
sometimes it's less nice

751
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:12,240
this is an abandoned Laser Quest outside

752
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:15,480
of Paris France in a shopping center

753
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:18,720
that they asked me to to social engineer

754
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,120
my way into the shopping center so like

755
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,220
vacant shops into the management floors

756
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:26,220
so I ended up trying every door

757
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:29,159
and this door led to many more doors and

758
00:29:29,159 --> 00:29:31,200
then we ended up in a in an abandoned

759
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,539
Laser Quest which I I think was maybe

760
00:29:33,539 --> 00:29:35,340
the most terrifying

761
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:38,940
thing I was either that or when they

762
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:41,340
caught me and escorted me to the control

763
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:44,220
room and my client wasn't there yet and

764
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:45,600
I didn't speak French and they didn't

765
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,220
speak English so I was trying to explain

766
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:49,700
who I was over Google translate

767
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:52,799
and they very almost rang the police

768
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:54,600
that was really bad but yeah sometimes

769
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,840
it's great sometimes maybe not

770
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:59,100
yeah thank you all very much for playing

771
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:00,779
I hope you enjoyed it I hope you kind of

772
00:30:00,779 --> 00:30:03,659
got an Insight of what type of decisions

773
00:30:03,659 --> 00:30:04,980
you get to make when you do social

774
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:07,260
engineering and hopefully someone will

775
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:10,039
give it a go off the back of this

776
00:30:10,039 --> 00:30:12,480
awesome Phil thank you very much that's

777
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,320
great

778
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:14,820
um we've got some time for a couple of

779
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:15,830
questions

780
00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:17,340
[Applause]

781
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:18,779
um if anyone has any questions I'll run

782
00:30:18,779 --> 00:30:21,120
around with the mic if not you can

783
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,159
either you can give your yellow cards

784
00:30:23,159 --> 00:30:24,960
your blue cards to Vanessa on your way

785
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:25,919
out

786
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:28,620
or just leave them on your chair and I

787
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:30,720
will just think bad thoughts about you

788
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:34,140
that's yep uh great talk again

789
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:34,799
um

790
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:37,320
did you have a you get out of jail free

791
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:39,960
letter on you so that you've you know if

792
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:42,000
if it did all go pear-shaped at least

793
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,679
you were going to get arrested and Cat

794
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:46,080
enough to upholstery or whatever yeah so

795
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,539
I actually had two so I had one that was

796
00:30:48,539 --> 00:30:51,539
inside my suit jacket and one that was

797
00:30:51,539 --> 00:30:54,059
in my trouser Pockets solely for if I

798
00:30:54,059 --> 00:30:55,679
took off my suit jacket to hang it up

799
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:58,200
somewhere because you get nervous you

800
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,600
get sweaty you get sometimes you're just

801
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,340
like I just you've you've still got

802
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:04,200
another one on you

803
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,360
um a good friend of mine Chris Pritchard

804
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:07,620
who does a lot of social engineering

805
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:09,779
told me that the worst place to have it

806
00:31:09,779 --> 00:31:12,240
especially if you're doing an airport is

807
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,520
in your jacket pocket because when

808
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:16,799
you've got police with guns and you go

809
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:18,779
in to get your letter it's really bad so

810
00:31:18,779 --> 00:31:20,700
yeah I have at least one I had

811
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:23,520
definitely at least one in your pocket

812
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:26,120
sorry

813
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:30,419
uh I much prefer being able to give an

814
00:31:30,419 --> 00:31:32,039
actual letter and they can then take it

815
00:31:32,039 --> 00:31:33,840
away whereas I don't really want them to

816
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:37,679
go away with my phone so yeah

817
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:39,720
hey thanks for the talk uh in a world

818
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:42,179
where sort of fishing and you know

819
00:31:42,179 --> 00:31:43,620
Network exploits and that sort of thing

820
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:46,500
result in the most ransomwares and sort

821
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:49,919
of data theft what sort of place would

822
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:51,299
you say

823
00:31:51,299 --> 00:31:51,840
um

824
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:54,899
a kindly Englishman breaking into the

825
00:31:54,899 --> 00:31:57,000
finance managers officer fits in a

826
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,919
company's threat model

827
00:31:58,919 --> 00:32:01,260
it's it's a really good question

828
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:03,840
um and it very much depends on who your

829
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:06,659
attacker is so if you're if you're

830
00:32:06,659 --> 00:32:08,220
someone who your attacker is a nation

831
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:09,240
state

832
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:11,460
doing this sort of thing probably isn't

833
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:13,020
that beneficial because if your nation

834
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:15,299
state with time money you're just going

835
00:32:15,299 --> 00:32:17,399
to get someone employed and then they

836
00:32:17,399 --> 00:32:20,460
get a laptop and they get access

837
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:23,340
um so it's much more for sort of maybe

838
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:25,500
smaller people who have sensitive

839
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:27,899
physical documents so maybe like an

840
00:32:27,899 --> 00:32:29,840
engineering firm that have printouts of

841
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:33,299
designs or or that type of or maybe like

842
00:32:33,299 --> 00:32:36,000
you know a bank with money

843
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,740
um that type of places where there is

844
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:39,779
physical assets

845
00:32:39,779 --> 00:32:41,399
as opposed to getting everything

846
00:32:41,399 --> 00:32:43,500
digitally

847
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,360
well

848
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:48,360
hi a great talk really enjoyed it uh

849
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:50,640
have you ever apart from the the lovely

850
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,620
mug have you ever taken anything or

851
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:54,120
stolen anything on one of your

852
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:57,299
engagements so I no I've please admit to

853
00:32:57,299 --> 00:32:59,720
Crime now

854
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:02,820
uh I'm trying to think like I think I

855
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:05,399
got a pen from the French uh shopping

856
00:33:05,399 --> 00:33:07,559
center but that was solely because I

857
00:33:07,559 --> 00:33:10,020
needed it and then put it in my bag just

858
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:12,059
naturally I'm not I'm not really one

859
00:33:12,059 --> 00:33:15,000
I've someone that I did work with he

860
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,100
made sure he does a lot of this and he

861
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:19,860
liked a trophy after everyone he would

862
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:22,200
ask can I please take this home whereas

863
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,960
I got so much to my house I know so

864
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,279
no I've got the mug and that's that's

865
00:33:26,279 --> 00:33:28,860
independent but it's not a thing that

866
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:32,299
I'm bothered about

867
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:35,039
um what recommendation did you give to

868
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:36,960
the this client

869
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:39,539
of the seventh and eight so ah so yeah

870
00:33:39,539 --> 00:33:40,980
really good question

871
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:43,200
um so one of the big things that they

872
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,460
haven't thought about in their threat

873
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:46,620
model was the fact that their office was

874
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:50,220
in a shared unit with a like a shared

875
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:52,440
office that anybody could hire

876
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:53,640
um so

877
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:55,440
that was sort of something they just

878
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,779
hadn't thought about the fact that the

879
00:33:57,779 --> 00:33:59,640
card for that didn't work in their

880
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:02,460
office they were really happy about

881
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:03,899
um they were really happy that reception

882
00:34:03,899 --> 00:34:06,360
stopped me and did their job very

883
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:09,780
diligently they were excellent

884
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:11,760
um but then a lot of the things they

885
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,679
they couldn't really do anything about

886
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:16,379
so the toilets being on the unsecured

887
00:34:16,379 --> 00:34:18,599
side of the door they can't redesign the

888
00:34:18,599 --> 00:34:21,119
office that's just how it is so it was

889
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:24,119
much sort of smaller things of uh

890
00:34:24,119 --> 00:34:26,760
attitude towards it so

891
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:29,339
is the person wearing a pass

892
00:34:29,339 --> 00:34:31,020
shut the door behind you make sure no

893
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:32,460
one follows you through

894
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:33,719
um if there's someone who looks a bit

895
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:36,179
weird make sure you ask them are you

896
00:34:36,179 --> 00:34:38,280
meant to be here so all those sorts of

897
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:41,099
things which might help might not but

898
00:34:41,099 --> 00:34:43,800
the fundamental issues that got me in

899
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:46,440
were kind of unfixable

900
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:48,060
so yeah so it was quite an interesting

901
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:49,320
one

902
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:51,839
um I think we then just sold them some

903
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:53,580
awareness training because that's what

904
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:55,139
we do is upsell

905
00:34:55,139 --> 00:34:56,399
um and I'm sure they were happy with

906
00:34:56,399 --> 00:34:58,160
that

907
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:00,900
how did how did you record um what you

908
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:02,099
were doing did you have like um your

909
00:35:02,099 --> 00:35:03,960
phone recording audio in your pocket or

910
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,580
camera or do you just remember it write

911
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:09,180
it down later so um I phone I took quite

912
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:11,099
quite a lot of photos so where I saw

913
00:35:11,099 --> 00:35:13,140
things like a door that was propped open

914
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:14,400
that should have been shot with an

915
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,900
access card like I'll snap a photo of

916
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:19,320
that and then whenever I sat at a desk

917
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:22,500
or had a little bit of downtime I'd sort

918
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:23,339
of just

919
00:35:23,339 --> 00:35:26,339
memory drop down in a in a like a

920
00:35:26,339 --> 00:35:27,839
notepad

921
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:30,240
um all of all of the things that I'd

922
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:32,820
done and I tried to do it almost this

923
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:35,160
presentation was created through the

924
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:36,660
notes that I had because it was that

925
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:38,460
sort of Step by Step so that I could

926
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:40,079
tell them and then sort of flagging

927
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:44,160
issues I don't know what the legal side

928
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:48,000
of recording all the time would be

929
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,640
um I also wouldn't want that recording

930
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:52,200
because

931
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:53,940
in case not in case I do something wrong

932
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:55,859
but I would I'd feel like I should watch

933
00:35:55,859 --> 00:35:56,880
it back and then it would be really

934
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,020
cringy

935
00:35:58,020 --> 00:36:00,119
um so just not having that would be his

936
00:36:00,119 --> 00:36:02,760
best but yeah just little and often

937
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:05,099
regular note-taking whenever you and

938
00:36:05,099 --> 00:36:07,859
even it um quite often in Social

939
00:36:07,859 --> 00:36:09,359
Engineering if you watch any of the

940
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:11,160
talks they will all mention going to the

941
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:13,560
toilet a lot because of getting your

942
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:14,820
heart rate down trying to calm yourself

943
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:17,280
down so you sit on the toilet you get

944
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,780
your laptop out you write down the last

945
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:20,460
few things that you did

946
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:25,280
uh so it was that kind of note taking

947
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:28,140
one last question and then we can go to

948
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:30,440
the pub

949
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:34,320
yeah what kind of research do you do to

950
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:37,500
try and sit in like there were targets

951
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:41,400
backpacks and have HP laptops to try to

952
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,680
get that kind of so it's a really yeah

953
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,780
that is a really good question so

954
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:48,480
um we try and do quite a lot of basin so

955
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:52,140
um of the building itself so again this

956
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:53,579
um shared office really helped because

957
00:36:53,579 --> 00:36:56,099
that had kind of a floor plan and it had

958
00:36:56,099 --> 00:36:58,680
it listed the security features that

959
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:00,180
they were speed Gates so that was really

960
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:01,560
handy

961
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:04,200
um we then

962
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:05,940
um do are you sitting on like LinkedIn

963
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:07,859
for the company to get names and

964
00:37:07,859 --> 00:37:09,900
pictures and and kind of try to get an

965
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:13,260
idea of dress code from there ideally on

966
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:15,480
the very first day of this engagement I

967
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:17,099
spent about two hours sat over the road

968
00:37:17,099 --> 00:37:19,380
watching people going in and out to see

969
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:20,820
because what I didn't know I knew there

970
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:22,260
was Security on the ground floor but I

971
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:24,900
didn't know what they did so realizing

972
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:26,520
people walked in and just walked past

973
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:28,619
them meant if I could confidently do

974
00:37:28,619 --> 00:37:30,780
that it would be fine so it's it's all

975
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:33,300
those things I mean you then also think

976
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:36,180
of the type of company so is it a tech

977
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:37,260
company where people are going to be

978
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:39,480
wearing jeans and t-shirts or is it this

979
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:41,579
was a insurance company so I knew

980
00:37:41,579 --> 00:37:44,280
there'd be a bit smarter now luckily I'm

981
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:47,040
a very generic white looking male so I

982
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,960
kind of fit in quite well if I put on a

983
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:52,440
suit I fit in with London types

984
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:55,680
um and that helps quite a lot I'm quite

985
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:58,200
forgettable so people will will meet me

986
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:59,940
and then 10 minutes later I'll be like

987
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:02,040
who are you which is great

988
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:03,300
weirdly

989
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:05,280
um but yeah so it's trying to find out

990
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,619
as much as you can and it's very rare

991
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:10,020
that because I don't live in London I I

992
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:11,579
didn't really want to spend a day going

993
00:38:11,579 --> 00:38:14,040
down to watch the building to go back

994
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:15,599
again but I know some other people won't

995
