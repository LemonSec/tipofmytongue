1
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:06,600
so uh hi everyone pretty scary being out

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,940
here to be honest but um

3
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:11,519
just quickly before I get into the sort

4
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:13,860
of talk content if everyone could scan

5
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:16,740
that QR code or like visit the link it's

6
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:18,060
just going to be a bit important for

7
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:20,160
later on in my presentation

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,199
um I'll put the QR code back up later if

9
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:23,760
you miss it right now but I'll give you

10
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,519
maybe about 10 seconds to just

11
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:29,240
um get that going

12
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:40,440
okay so that seems to be pretty good

13
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,520
um

14
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,700
so a quick game before I get into my

15
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,860
sort of content which is

16
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:48,120
I'd like to play a game of quick

17
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:51,120
associations so for each word that shows

18
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,379
up on this screen this could be pretty

19
00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:54,300
dangerous I'll be honest but each word

20
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:55,920
that shows up on the screen I'd like you

21
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,899
all to shout out the first word that

22
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:00,000
comes to mind in relation to each of

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,860
them so

24
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:04,578
first off

25
00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:07,159
okay

26
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:11,880
okay

27
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,740
so fast

28
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:19,280
[Music]

29
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,320
okay that last two those are pretty

30
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,240
interesting but I'll demonstrate the

31
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,799
importance of these quick associations

32
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:28,560
in a bit but that's a little bit about

33
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,400
me so hi I'm Anna I'm currently a second

34
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,320
year cyber security student at the

35
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,659
University of Warwick and whilst I am

36
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:39,360
president of our cyber Society I do have

37
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,799
interests that aren't just a technical

38
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:42,659
so I'm here giving a pretty sort of

39
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:44,939
non-technical talk just to talk about

40
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:46,979
one of my big interests outside of cyber

41
00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:49,439
which is Art and Design so I really love

42
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,960
to draw and I thought that design is

43
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,159
something that's not very often

44
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:54,720
highlighted when it comes to cyber

45
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,340
security and it's actually really

46
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:58,920
important so basically my job is to

47
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,540
hopefully tell you why and raise a bit

48
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:01,979
of that awareness

49
00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:05,579
so a quick primer on the state of design

50
00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:08,038
currently in cyber security so a

51
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:09,598
research group called daylight lab

52
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:11,220
recently created this thing called the

53
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:13,560
cyber security imagery data set where

54
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,120
they got two years worth of Google

55
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,180
Images searches about cyber security and

56
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:19,920
collated them into one big data set and

57
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,440
analyzed it and they found that this

58
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,360
color scheme these five colors were the

59
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,700
top five colors used in all of those

60
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:29,280
images and two three five five nine four

61
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,200
and hex was the color of cyber security

62
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,020
so that appeared in almost every single

63
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:38,180
image in that data set so essentially

64
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:40,860
blue is used to often symbolize this

65
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,840
sort of peaceful kind of digital side of

66
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,459
the field but what's interesting is we

67
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:46,860
have a nice little blob of red here as

68
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:49,019
well and it raises a few questions

69
00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:51,780
because red is designed to highlight a

70
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:54,660
sort of alarming risk or insecurity in a

71
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:56,879
lot of these images and why are we

72
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:59,640
trying to essentially raise fear in the

73
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,560
images that we so often associate with

74
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,780
our field so that's a big question to

75
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:05,099
sort of think about which I'd like you

76
00:03:05,099 --> 00:03:07,140
to ponder on

77
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:09,000
following on from these sort of common

78
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,920
color tropes I'd like to also talk about

79
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,720
some other visuals that we tend to get

80
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:16,019
in the design language of cyber so we

81
00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:17,519
have the padlock

82
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:19,920
this shows up almost everywhere you may

83
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,180
have seen it on the previous slide

84
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:23,819
plenty of padlocks all in all of those

85
00:03:23,819 --> 00:03:25,920
images and whilst it's a great

86
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,659
obstruction of the sort of concept of

87
00:03:27,659 --> 00:03:29,879
security it's not really a great

88
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:31,739
abstraction of the concept of cyber

89
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:34,140
security it does raise a few questions

90
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:36,239
as to why we've used the padlock to

91
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:38,040
essentially abstract the digital aspect

92
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,140
and it doesn't really reinvent the wheel

93
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:41,580
when it comes to things

94
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:45,480
we also have images like this which have

95
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,580
this sort of red versus blue kind of

96
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:51,659
color scheme and a lovely hooded figure

97
00:03:51,659 --> 00:03:53,220
um I'd like to think if I was burning

98
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:55,319
down a room I'd dress more stylishly

99
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:57,000
than that

100
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,180
um and speaking of stylish

101
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:01,680
yeah

102
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,620
we have we have whatever the Shady

103
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:07,140
figure is doing over here

104
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:08,640
um and so

105
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,500
these sort of speak for themselves and

106
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,720
how strangely Associated they are with

107
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,580
cyber when I'd like to think like no one

108
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:16,199
in this room is currently in a top hat

109
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:17,579
and a mask

110
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:20,220
so but they're commonplace in overuse

111
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:22,919
and how did this happen

112
00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:24,479
um there's one big thing which is the

113
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,820
way the media presents cyber security so

114
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:28,620
there's this sort of air of negativity

115
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:31,440
going out in the world where most of the

116
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,060
front page headlines when it comes to

117
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:35,820
cyber is simply all about

118
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:38,880
um good versus bad light versus dark

119
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,520
some evil hackers are trying to destroy

120
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,699
the Mainframe whatever that is

121
00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:46,860
um if any if there are any Marvel fans

122
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:49,560
in the room you might have seen a few of

123
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:52,080
their movie posters they often use this

124
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,180
sort of blue and orange color scheme

125
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:55,800
which represents this sort of good

126
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,199
versus evil Trope and I find that that

127
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:01,199
kind of sort of movie aspect has seeped

128
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:02,699
into the way that we use cyber security

129
00:05:02,699 --> 00:05:05,280
imagery and the graphics used by the

130
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,840
media are just really similar to these

131
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,460
and they don't show positivity and they

132
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:10,979
rely on maintaining cyber as this sort

133
00:05:10,979 --> 00:05:13,020
of mystical art that no one can really

134
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:14,460
access

135
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:17,580
so coming back to my QR code I'd like to

136
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:18,960
showcase the importance of those

137
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,940
associations so if you haven't scanned

138
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:22,860
it already just quickly take a few

139
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:25,199
seconds to do that

140
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:29,039
and um what I'm going to do is I have

141
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:31,680
found a template online lovely little

142
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,039
HTML template which is basically for

143
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:35,759
um

144
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:38,220
a typical sort of cyber security website

145
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:40,259
and I've gone and that template was

146
00:05:40,259 --> 00:05:42,660
previously blue and I've Hue adjusted

147
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:45,180
the image to represent a couple of

148
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:48,120
different colors and on your screen from

149
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,979
this website you will see you have five

150
00:05:49,979 --> 00:05:51,900
colors and those represent the five

151
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,820
colors of the Hue adjusted website and

152
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:56,600
I'd like you to press one that you think

153
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,620
represents the most sort of cyber

154
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:00,180
security based website something that

155
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:02,520
makes you feel secure if you saw that

156
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:05,699
website you would trust it and I'm just

157
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:07,259
curious to see what you know everyone

158
00:06:07,259 --> 00:06:08,699
thinks

159
00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:10,080
so

160
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,060
here are those five

161
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:15,320
hold up your phones

162
00:06:15,419 --> 00:06:18,120
wow okay

163
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,639
so

164
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:23,039
Okay so we've got some interesting

165
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:25,080
responses here because not everyone

166
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,240
actually picked blue so I could see a

167
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,460
whole variety of colors and some people

168
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:32,220
in this room might have remembered a few

169
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:33,660
sort of months ago I actually did a

170
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:36,120
survey in which I asked people to sort

171
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,680
of do a similar kind of test with

172
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,539
similar colors and I asked them to

173
00:06:39,539 --> 00:06:41,160
actually tell me why they picked that

174
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,560
color and some people actually picked

175
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,060
red and yellow

176
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:47,460
and it's interesting because those

177
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:49,080
people tended to associate red and

178
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,880
yellow with passion Health Vitality

179
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,560
those kinds of like positive

180
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,199
connotations which actually helped

181
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:56,699
represent to them a sort of secure

182
00:06:56,699 --> 00:06:59,340
healthy kind of website but again most

183
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:02,160
people lean towards blue and sort of

184
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,440
green and things and

185
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,400
um

186
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,900
essentially

187
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:09,180
human color associations actually just

188
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:12,000
heavily individual it is nothing really

189
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,100
to do with how sort of Cycles are

190
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,900
perpetuated and actually the sort of

191
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,220
associations that you've each

192
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:18,960
individually formed are based on your

193
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,259
own personal experiences so even though

194
00:07:22,259 --> 00:07:24,419
however if we put this aside and we take

195
00:07:24,419 --> 00:07:26,099
blue to be the sort of stereotypical

196
00:07:26,099 --> 00:07:28,020
cyber color a lot of you also picked

197
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:29,819
green and purple which are actually

198
00:07:29,819 --> 00:07:32,280
analogous colors to Blue so what that

199
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,720
essentially means is because they are

200
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,400
sort of harmonious on that side of the

201
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,620
color wheel they also represent like

202
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:38,639
sort of

203
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,199
um really sort of healthy kind of

204
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:42,960
connotations with security but red

205
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,479
orange and yellow are on the completely

206
00:07:45,479 --> 00:07:46,919
opposite end of the color wheel they're

207
00:07:46,919 --> 00:07:49,139
known as complementary colors and as a

208
00:07:49,139 --> 00:07:51,240
result those are meant to symbolize this

209
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:54,419
contrast this opposition to what the

210
00:07:54,419 --> 00:07:56,180
media has sort of chosen to represent

211
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:59,819
and so why is blue such a constant if we

212
00:07:59,819 --> 00:08:01,680
understand that these associations are

213
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,819
heavily personal

214
00:08:02,819 --> 00:08:05,699
its familiarity so it all comes down to

215
00:08:05,699 --> 00:08:07,259
the fact that because this sort of

216
00:08:07,259 --> 00:08:09,900
Perpetual cycle has ensued of people

217
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:11,759
using blue and not really coming up with

218
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:14,940
any new graphics to reinvent the wheel

219
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:17,039
um the use is just so ubiquitous that no

220
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:18,360
one feels that they can use anything

221
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,400
else that Association is so deeply

222
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,340
ingrained that no one has tried to see

223
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:25,080
whether individual things can be brought

224
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:25,760
out

225
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,120
[Music]

226
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,660
in fact security designs though have a

227
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:32,940
very sort of big effect on the public So

228
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:35,640
currently the sort of stereotype is very

229
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,099
unfriendly ominous kind of imagery of

230
00:08:38,099 --> 00:08:39,899
you know hackers and greenlit server

231
00:08:39,899 --> 00:08:42,299
rooms sitting in the dark not really you

232
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:45,360
know doing anything good and um

233
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,339
these designs can actually feel very

234
00:08:47,339 --> 00:08:49,200
daunting and I'd like you to all think

235
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,080
of design as making a PowerPoint if the

236
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,060
point isn't clear and visible in that

237
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:55,740
design it would be really difficult for

238
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:57,540
people to sort of understand and digest

239
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:59,700
it and we need to keep these designs

240
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:02,279
really accessible as well so we need to

241
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:03,839
ensure that people are actually able to

242
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:05,880
see the content that's within them and

243
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,160
to help digest that sort of material

244
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,140
but in fact the biggest point that I'd

245
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:12,360
like to make is most academics policy

246
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,160
makers and cyber professionals actually

247
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,080
disagree with the current state of cyber

248
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,279
Graphics they feel it really

249
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:19,320
misrepresents the field

250
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,660
but they often know Alternatives instead

251
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:23,519
and that's something interesting to mull

252
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:25,860
over no one has actually tried to change

253
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:28,500
the current status quo so in terms of

254
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:31,019
changing that what can we do

255
00:09:31,019 --> 00:09:34,080
we have two big options so one is to opt

256
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,360
for familiarity in design

257
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,580
so we can take the existing sort of

258
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:40,380
design language but sort of make little

259
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:43,440
tweaks and add spins on it so currently

260
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,740
with sort of blue elements and things we

261
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:49,680
don't necessarily need to not use blue

262
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,019
at all in any of our designs but we can

263
00:09:52,019 --> 00:09:54,360
use blue and perhaps change the other

264
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,220
design elements that surround it

265
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:58,320
or we could turn the entire thing on its

266
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,080
head stop using blue stop using padlocks

267
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,000
stop using Shady hackers in server rooms

268
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,860
and try and create an entirely new

269
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:06,660
design language that we feel represents

270
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:08,160
things better

271
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,560
so in terms of some ideas for option one

272
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,120
in terms of how you can make your

273
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,700
designs more accessible to people

274
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:16,620
um ignore the questionable spelling of

275
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:18,660
fence on this diagram but it's the only

276
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,459
one I could really find that was better

277
00:10:20,459 --> 00:10:22,860
than some other ones you don't have to

278
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:24,480
be the best designer to actually

279
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,459
Implement Clarity what you do have to

280
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:28,800
use is use great analogies and take out

281
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,779
unnecessary acronyms make sure your

282
00:10:30,779 --> 00:10:33,000
audience knows what they're reading

283
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,100
you can also take previous sort of

284
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:36,300
design elements that have already been

285
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,760
used like the padlock and add them

286
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,680
alongside other Design Elements to make

287
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,060
it more clearer as to what you're trying

288
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:43,800
to represent instead of just using a

289
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,480
padlock on its own

290
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:48,240
and finally we need to really change the

291
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,860
sort of General imagery that's going

292
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:51,720
around in the media so these are

293
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,940
actually two really recent news stories

294
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:56,700
from BBC News and both of them have

295
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:58,140
actually used

296
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:01,140
um that sort of shady hacker in a server

297
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:03,480
room surrounded by binary digits kind of

298
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:06,000
image but the two at the bottom as you

299
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,620
can see they are taken from real sort of

300
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:09,480
cyber security websites showcasing real

301
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:12,000
people and how they actually work in the

302
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,220
field and those are great images that we

303
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:16,500
should be using more in such like media

304
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,660
stories take out the negativity and put

305
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:20,459
a more positive spin on it and show how

306
00:11:20,459 --> 00:11:22,380
real people and real individuals tend to

307
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:23,640
work here

308
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,560
and then obviously for option two there

309
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,180
are some other ideas so there's a

310
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:29,399
website called cybervisuals.org which is

311
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:31,440
this Collective that is aiming to sort

312
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,740
of turn cyber imagery on its head and

313
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:36,480
here are some ideas that they have that

314
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,519
I think are pretty great so they have

315
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:40,440
this one which is designed to represent

316
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,720
phishing and this one which showcases

317
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,339
the sort of diversity in the hacking

318
00:11:44,339 --> 00:11:46,440
Community Without Really resorting to

319
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:49,380
sort of like too much blue usage

320
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:51,120
you also have this one which obviously

321
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,260
is a lot more blue and it's color

322
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:54,420
scheming but it is a great way of sort

323
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:56,640
of abstracting technical Concepts and

324
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:00,000
representing how um how real people can

325
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,740
sort of understand them

326
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:03,720
and you have this one which is a great

327
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,459
way of showcasing

328
00:12:05,459 --> 00:12:07,079
um location tracking without actually

329
00:12:07,079 --> 00:12:10,560
putting a massive emphasis on its

330
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,200
negative connotations

331
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,300
so as I said they don't have an

332
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:17,160
overwhelming focus on blue and they get

333
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:19,380
these Concepts across without resorting

334
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:21,720
to sort of very very typical graphical

335
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,760
stereotypes

336
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,620
so in terms of the conclusions that we

337
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,240
can draw from this in how we can start

338
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,740
to make our designs better

339
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:30,899
designed for people so design with

340
00:12:30,899 --> 00:12:33,240
accessibility and sort of widespread

341
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,459
information in mind

342
00:12:35,459 --> 00:12:37,980
change the formula so take a few aspects

343
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:39,899
of the current sort of blue usage or the

344
00:12:39,899 --> 00:12:42,120
current design climate and make it your

345
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:44,880
own or just rewrite it completely don't

346
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,279
follow the wheel and instead choose to

347
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:48,540
reinvent it

348
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:50,700
break stereotypes showcase how you're

349
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,440
all real people in this room with a

350
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,480
hugely diverse set of backgrounds and a

351
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,220
hugely diverse set of fields and

352
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:57,839
showcase how not everything is just

353
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,660
hackers and hoodies and represent new

354
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:02,760
areas so create abstractions of just

355
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,500
other aspects of security that you feel

356
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,360
aren't currently represented I'm sure

357
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,339
we've all seen the sort of typical sort

358
00:13:08,339 --> 00:13:11,459
of network diagram nodes with crossed

359
00:13:11,459 --> 00:13:13,980
wires used to represent security but

360
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:15,899
security is not just networking it's

361
00:13:15,899 --> 00:13:17,100
more than that and I think we should

362
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,779
start to show that

363
00:13:18,779 --> 00:13:20,700
and finally always understand

364
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:23,760
Association so I hope that this talk has

365
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,620
sort of armed you with the power to

366
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:27,420
understand the importance of color and

367
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:29,160
design and whether it's for a personal

368
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,860
project a internal company view or even

369
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:33,839
a public-facing website things like

370
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:35,579
design should really just not be taken

371
00:13:35,579 --> 00:13:37,860
lightly and associations really matter

372
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:40,440
so if you take things slow and tweak

373
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,240
your design language and learn from

374
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,160
others you'll be armed to the tools to

375
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,779
start to take steps in your design

376
00:13:45,779 --> 00:13:48,060
journey and make design more accessible

377
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:49,440
for everyone

378
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,720
and yeah thank you if you have any

379
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,959
questions

380
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:02,420
[Applause]

381
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:05,339
oh thank you for your talk I'm really

382
00:14:05,339 --> 00:14:06,600
happy that someone's actually taking a

383
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,920
look at trying to change the messaging

384
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,320
around cyber security awareness and like

385
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,300
identification of it I can't tell you

386
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:13,740
the number of times the team wrenched

387
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:15,660
displayed as an image for ransomware and

388
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:17,519
it's really annoying me

389
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:18,720
um what are you hoping to do with this

390
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,399
in terms of like future work and raising

391
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:23,040
awareness about this issue

392
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,320
um So currently I'm sort of researching

393
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,060
into how to like sort of make a

394
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:29,279
framework to make things like this more

395
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:31,320
widely accessible to create a set of

396
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,940
guidelines and rules that people can

397
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:35,639
actually follow to like essentially take

398
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:37,079
the principles that I've said in this

399
00:14:37,079 --> 00:14:39,420
and make it more widespread because I

400
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:40,800
find it's just not really talked about

401
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,839
in terms of a design context

402
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:45,320
specifically

403
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:47,050
any more questions

404
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:50,290
[Music]

405
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:55,819
then thank you very much yeah thank you
