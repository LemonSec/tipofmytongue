1
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,420
the threat intelligence report previous

2
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:48,240
incident or even just a business use

3
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,640
case so let's say for example a CIS

4
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,040
admin comes to us and they want to know

5
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,320
in their environment where are people

6
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,259
authenticating by Azure ID without

7
00:01:57,259 --> 00:01:59,820
multi-factor authentication this does

8
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,500
happen

9
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,360
um cool so we have our use case we do a

10
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,180
research and requirements so uh do we

11
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:07,560
have the logs for this

12
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,139
what quality the logs in and what

13
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:12,599
detection method would maybe apply uh we

14
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:15,599
move into development and testing so uh

15
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:17,580
what detection logic do we apply can you

16
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:18,900
test it in staging can you actually

17
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,280
validate that this actually works

18
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,239
correctly

19
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:22,500
and then finally you push it into

20
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:23,580
production

21
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:25,379
then with all other as all other

22
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:27,000
detections that have come before there

23
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,280
are issues as usual and that's where

24
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,140
maintenance comes in to make sure that

25
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:34,379
your detection is operated as designed

26
00:02:34,379 --> 00:02:36,480
uh so this might be what the possible

27
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,220
output of this looks like I did not

28
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:40,080
build this by the way

29
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,400
um specifically for our role

30
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:47,459
so why is maintenance neglected

31
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:50,160
honestly I'd imagine most people don't

32
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,200
find it that interesting it's it's in

33
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,180
the name have you ever got excited about

34
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:55,680
taking your car for a service or going

35
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,720
to the dentist once a year twice a year

36
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,640
depend who you are

37
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:02,879
um it's just not that great it's much

38
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:04,500
better to build a detection for a new

39
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:08,940
log Source or uh new detection

40
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:10,680
and it's not seen as a valuable use of

41
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,019
time unless you have a dedicated

42
00:03:13,019 --> 00:03:14,640
detection engineer within your security

43
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,900
team

44
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,099
um you're usually in charge of threat

45
00:03:17,099 --> 00:03:19,019
detection response design and security

46
00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:21,180
controls and managing tooling

47
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:22,560
um it just doesn't seem there's enough

48
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,060
time and you end up with more of a

49
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:26,580
whack-a-mole approach towards it

50
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:28,319
and then some Legacy teams would have

51
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:30,420
maybe had a detection engineer but they

52
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:31,739
weren't liable for the alert that was

53
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:32,760
generated

54
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,440
and that way they would develop a role

55
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,000
deploy it and then they're on to the

56
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,739
next thing and forget about it

57
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:39,540
and if you wanted to do all this

58
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:41,280
sometimes getting the data or metrics

59
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,500
together to identify opportunities for

60
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:46,459
maintenance is quite difficult

61
00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:48,720
okay I'm going to say I hope I should

62
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,159
have put brackets a hopefully simple

63
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:51,540
because this might may turn out to be

64
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:53,220
horrible for everyone

65
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:54,900
so if anybody doesn't recognize this is

66
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,819
Avatar The Last Airbender it's one of my

67
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:58,440
favorite TV shows and a very wise man

68
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,659
named iro he's asking asking our

69
00:04:00,659 --> 00:04:02,640
detection air detection engineer to look

70
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,080
n-words and ask themselves the big

71
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,060
questions like why do we even have this

72
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:08,400
rule which makes him Furious has made me

73
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,739
Furious in the past as well

74
00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:14,099
so firstly reducing the noise there's

75
00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:15,840
nothing very growing Brecken here I'm

76
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,760
sure you've all heard it before

77
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,680
um this is my arbitrary recommendation

78
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,540
uh if you go ahead and try and identify

79
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:23,220
your top 10 detections within your

80
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:25,680
organization with the highest volume I'd

81
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,240
say over at least a period of months

82
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,040
depending how noise your environment is

83
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,440
maybe you can stretch that out

84
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,300
um and then just prioritize further by

85
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:34,919
severity so you may have a grouping of

86
00:04:34,919 --> 00:04:36,660
high ease mediums lows and just work

87
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:38,759
your way through them if possible

88
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:39,960
and then there's a number of causes

89
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,580
behind this High rate false positives

90
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:44,160
usually your detection may be too broad

91
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,580
in scope or even incorrect

92
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:49,440
um

93
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,419
you may have no context or enrichment

94
00:04:51,419 --> 00:04:52,560
applied

95
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,180
and then if anybody's ever designed a

96
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:56,699
detection based on a TTP or behavioral

97
00:04:56,699 --> 00:04:58,320
detection if you think of your permit of

98
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,300
paying right at the top by Design those

99
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,100
are very noisy

100
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:05,040
and then lastly visualizations will be

101
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,780
really helpful here for communicating

102
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:08,580
the impact of this type of work to your

103
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:10,919
other stakeholders uh this would

104
00:05:10,919 --> 00:05:12,540
hopefully even having this work stream

105
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:14,340
prioritized in the future

106
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:16,500
so this is a really basic time series

107
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,840
analysis of what this might look like uh

108
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,400
hopefully you can see where the red line

109
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,960
is kind of where we've applied a tune

110
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:24,180
and your alerts just tend to decrease

111
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:27,900
over time this is really simplistic but

112
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:31,638
pretty impactful visually

113
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:33,360
so then on the flip side we need to

114
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,440
validate our critical and high

115
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:37,020
detections no we want to do this because

116
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:38,400
we want to make sure these are working

117
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,740
so some rules you may have and you've

118
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,300
never seen fire in the entire time

119
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,639
you've worked at your company

120
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:46,320
um so you need to identify these over

121
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,880
maybe like a one to three month period

122
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,520
because you want to make sure these work

123
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,080
so again

124
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,960
why these might not fire uh again maybe

125
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,460
to narrow and scope so if you think of

126
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:59,280
an ioc rule like a hash for example

127
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,620
or the log Source may be broken which

128
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:03,780
has happened in multiple occasions or

129
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,220
the vendor may have changed their schema

130
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:06,419
I know your detection is completely

131
00:06:06,419 --> 00:06:08,160
involved

132
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,360
um and then if you want to validate that

133
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,919
these are actually working uh you need

134
00:06:10,919 --> 00:06:12,840
to look at some adversary emulation

135
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,460
Frameworks so I've added a few up there

136
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:16,259
all publicly available so you've got

137
00:06:16,259 --> 00:06:18,660
Tonk red team Stratus red team and miter

138
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:20,660
Caldera

139
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:22,800
okay so in the next few slides I'm going

140
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,940
to go over a number of methods you can

141
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:26,520
apply after you've identified detections

142
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,800
for maintenance some you can apply

143
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,819
straight away

144
00:06:29,819 --> 00:06:31,380
others would probably take a massive

145
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:32,759
migration project if you're not already

146
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:34,139
there so I'm going to talk about it

147
00:06:34,139 --> 00:06:35,280
briefly

148
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,500
um so if anybody has uh

149
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,780
that the term detection is code has been

150
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:41,340
around for a few years now

151
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:43,759
one of the artist articles uh states

152
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:46,500
that detection code is a more systematic

153
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:49,199
flexible and comprehensive approach

154
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,539
oof I'm going to need to speed up a bit

155
00:06:51,539 --> 00:06:52,860
um there's somewhat inspired by software

156
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:55,319
development uh so if you think of this

157
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:56,819
you're thinking of detections stored in

158
00:06:56,819 --> 00:06:59,520
a repository qaf detections via CI CD

159
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,139
pipeline

160
00:07:01,139 --> 00:07:03,840
um uh reliability and scalability I've

161
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,340
also added a second bullet point there

162
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:07,380
on a very in-depth talk on detection's

163
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:09,300
code I highly recommend you check out

164
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,699
uh so one of the benefits of detection's

165
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:13,500
code as it relates to maintenance is

166
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,840
Version Control so if you've ever had a

167
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,180
rule that spiked out of nowhere or just

168
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:20,099
stopped completely uh think of Version

169
00:07:20,099 --> 00:07:22,319
Control if you can easily go back to

170
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:23,880
pull request or change you can check

171
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,680
what happened very quickly this will

172
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,300
reduce the time spent on these tasks

173
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:29,099
massively

174
00:07:29,099 --> 00:07:31,860
context so adding context to a detection

175
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:34,500
can provide a higher level Fidelity and

176
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,240
reduce noise which would let your

177
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,099
analysts or engineers make decisions

178
00:07:38,099 --> 00:07:39,599
faster during the investigation it's

179
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:42,060
always fantastic uh people tend to

180
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:44,160
immediately think threat intelligence uh

181
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,599
uh when we talk about this so your

182
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:47,880
malicious IPS demands Etc

183
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,259
um I'm sure you've all seen alert about

184
00:07:49,259 --> 00:07:51,120
an IP in your firewall logs that was

185
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,819
malicious about 15 years ago

186
00:07:53,819 --> 00:07:55,319
um so you don't just want to think that

187
00:07:55,319 --> 00:07:58,139
think asset and identity and asset

188
00:07:58,139 --> 00:07:59,520
tagging as well

189
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,919
um so I've added an article by Microsoft

190
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:03,479
there where they talked in depth about

191
00:08:03,479 --> 00:08:05,460
their impossible travel alerts which

192
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:07,080
historically used to be very noisy

193
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,720
anecdotally I can attest to this I've

194
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:12,360
closed a bunch of false positives so

195
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:15,060
they changed that and you can kind of

196
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:16,620
see the image there but basically they

197
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:19,139
build up a user profile uh the text

198
00:08:19,139 --> 00:08:21,660
metadata like your ISP user agent

199
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:23,099
comparing authentications to previous

200
00:08:23,099 --> 00:08:26,220
visits they also exclude vpns and Cloud

201
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:27,960
providers and the other part of the

202
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,759
algorithm Architects signals from Azure

203
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,139
active directory so your registered

204
00:08:31,139 --> 00:08:32,640
device information

205
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,679
so all this additional context lets

206
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:36,299
Microsoft vastly reduce the volume of

207
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:38,339
these alerts so what is Ray is this

208
00:08:38,339 --> 00:08:40,500
highly actionable

209
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,839
and then adjusting severity sometimes

210
00:08:42,839 --> 00:08:44,700
all the context in the world will just

211
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,380
not work and that's when actually

212
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:48,300
dabricating a rule or just reducing the

213
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:51,779
severity is a good way to go so in this

214
00:08:51,779 --> 00:08:53,279
example which you may or may not be able

215
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:55,860
to read the user indicates that they've

216
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:58,200
seen a bunch of false positives the logs

217
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,459
weren't that good for an investigation

218
00:08:59,459 --> 00:09:02,279
so he's suggesting that we reduce the

219
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:04,080
severity installed enhancement in the

220
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,880
technology I think it's correlation that

221
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,040
case can be made which is another

222
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:10,200
benefit of Maintenance that sometimes we

223
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,519
look at these things in hindsight you're

224
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:12,959
able to tease out additional

225
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,839
improvements to detection methods

226
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:18,959
so detection logic

227
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:20,160
um this is probably the most important

228
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,420
so if we look back at the rule we made

229
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:22,620
earlier

230
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:26,339
um this is a sigma rule that our system

231
00:09:26,339 --> 00:09:27,720
admin has now come back to us and said

232
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,760
oh my God this is so noisy why did you

233
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,899
ever build this for me can you do

234
00:09:30,899 --> 00:09:32,220
something

235
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:34,380
so let's try and look over some points

236
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:36,260
that we can do

237
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:40,019
uh so if anybody here may use do or OCTA

238
00:09:40,019 --> 00:09:42,000
as their identity provider at work

239
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,580
so they both have a default policy to

240
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:47,339
enforce MFA on Microsoft 365.

241
00:09:47,339 --> 00:09:49,680
now that user agent is for Windows

242
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,300
devices that are domain joined in Azure

243
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:53,459
ID and they use the win logon service

244
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:55,740
which uses basic Authentication

245
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:58,920
so it would get blocked by duo or octa

246
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:01,680
no they have they do allow you to add

247
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,660
custom user agent strings to bypass this

248
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:05,580
policy so this is something that you

249
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:07,019
could exclude in this role and they've

250
00:10:07,019 --> 00:10:09,180
actually used it a couple times and the

251
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:10,800
sheer amount of noise that's dropped off

252
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,320
is just insane

253
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,720
secondly you may see a message so a log

254
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:18,000
May uh Azure ID sign-in log May report

255
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,339
as a single factor of authentication but

256
00:10:20,339 --> 00:10:22,140
the message May read MFA requirements

257
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:24,779
satisfied or Skip by so the user already

258
00:10:24,779 --> 00:10:26,880
has an access token and has satisfied

259
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,620
the MFA requirements but it still

260
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:30,720
reports as a single Factor so you don't

261
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,580
really need to look at this specifically

262
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:34,380
for this alert and then some

263
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:36,540
organizations are happy to let users

264
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:38,399
have a single factor of authentication

265
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:39,959
if they're coming from a trusted device

266
00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:43,080
or a trusted Network location uh these

267
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,459
are two fields that are actually in the

268
00:10:44,459 --> 00:10:47,040
Azure ID log so if you confirm with a

269
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,560
team or your conditional access policies

270
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:52,500
you can uh you can exclude this as well

271
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:55,380
cool key takeaways and I am perfectly on

272
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:58,200
time so a rigorous maintenance process

273
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,940
allows us to better manage the risk of

274
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:01,440
false negatives while improving the

275
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,060
efficiency of detections and reducing

276
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:05,519
toil on false positives getting this

277
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:06,720
balance can actually be really difficult

278
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,540
and it will partly be based on the risk

279
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:11,040
your organization is willing to tolerate

280
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,360
from what you've seen in the last slide

281
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,399
you know I was excluding big chunks of

282
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,200
things if your organization is

283
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,700
comfortable with that then it's all good

284
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:20,339
but maybe not hopefully a small takeaway

285
00:11:20,339 --> 00:11:21,480
that you could actually go back to work

286
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,440
and do

287
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,899
start by identifying your top 10 highest

288
00:11:24,899 --> 00:11:27,120
and lowest volume detections and just

289
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,279
try and apply some of these strategies

290
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:31,140
um I think it would be very helpful once

291
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:32,700
you can see the impact of not having to

292
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,320
answer as many tickets

293
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,959
you may thank me and then the last one

294
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:38,940
is be prepared to have your work and

295
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:40,380
thinking challenged speaking from

296
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:41,820
experience here

297
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:43,620
um you may have your work reviewed and

298
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:46,200
there may be determined that the rule is

299
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,899
incorrect or as of little value

300
00:11:48,899 --> 00:11:51,060
that can be quite hard to hear and it's

301
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:53,480
best to look as an opportunity to learn

302
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:56,040
and thank you

303
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,720
um if anybody has any questions I'm more

304
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,459
than happy to try and answer

305
00:11:59,459 --> 00:12:01,019
um and the slides if you do want them

306
00:12:01,019 --> 00:12:03,540
will be available probably today or

307
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:05,719
tomorrow

308
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,019
if anyone has questions that you end up

309
00:12:13,019 --> 00:12:15,980
won't come around to the mic

310
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,720
yes

311
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,180
hi

312
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:25,920
um there's a brief mention there of the

313
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:30,000
sigma rule set yes how do you

314
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
find that that fits in using some of the

315
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,660
more QA type methodologies Six Sigma and

316
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:38,760
various other things to be constantly

317
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,800
reviewing what rules are used for what

318
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:44,940
kpis effectively are useful

319
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:47,579
sorry just so I understand that are you

320
00:12:47,579 --> 00:12:48,620
asking me

321
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:51,480
how how you would review Sigma type

322
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,500
rules

323
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:55,920
so admittedly I've only used the sigma

324
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,899
repo a few times

325
00:12:57,899 --> 00:12:58,500
um

326
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,060
the one thing I'm going to say is

327
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:01,320
definitely just don't import it and

328
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,160
start using it because it's going to

329
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,779
blow everything up every rule in there

330
00:13:03,779 --> 00:13:06,120
is made agnostically of every single

331
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:09,360
organization if you were to if the idea

332
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,639
was to start importing those you want to

333
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:12,959
have someone review each of them for

334
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,579
your organization put them in staging

335
00:13:14,579 --> 00:13:16,620
just let logs run through them before

336
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:19,139
you start creating alerts because it

337
00:13:19,139 --> 00:13:21,720
will just blow up your sim and your team

338
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,579
will be furious

339
00:13:23,579 --> 00:13:25,740
um did that answer

340
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:28,139
kind of close enough

341
00:13:28,139 --> 00:13:29,880
uh time for one more I think Martin

342
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:33,920
issue oh yeah if we've got one

343
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:38,579
no I might have got you wrong so correct

344
00:13:38,579 --> 00:13:40,440
me if I'm wrong but what we've what

345
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,060
we've heard there is is quite a good

346
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:45,839
illustration of of reducing the false

347
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:49,019
positives to some greater degree Watts

348
00:13:49,019 --> 00:13:51,360
can you do or what can you perceive

349
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,480
doing in terms of the false negatives

350
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,120
so those rules that give you a security

351
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,700
blanket to wrap around yourself but

352
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:01,920
never fire because they're actually

353
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,040
badly written

354
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:06,480
uh so I think we kind of touched this do

355
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,700
you mean real false nights so the ones

356
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:10,200
that never fire you should be trying to

357
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,880
ballot it is that kind of couple we're

358
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,440
talking about yeah so I think there's a

359
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,200
slide sorry

360
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:18,440
[Music]

361
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,200
yes uh so on the flip side basically you

362
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,240
wanna you wanna this is a very basic

363
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,040
model for for minions I think you could

364
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,899
pick up any day is just take it from

365
00:14:27,899 --> 00:14:29,880
both sides the most extreme sides

366
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:32,579
noisiest and no noise at all on that no

367
00:14:32,579 --> 00:14:35,279
noise side I'm sure Atomic red team is

368
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:37,260
something most people are somewhat aware

369
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:39,500
of if they're not it's a really cool

370
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,519
framework that lets you validate

371
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:44,100
different types of attack on the uh

372
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,959
almost like a minor attack was there

373
00:14:45,959 --> 00:14:47,820
which is embarrassing for me

374
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,740
um so helps hopefully that you sort of

375
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:52,199
validate these rules that never fire

376
00:14:52,199 --> 00:14:53,279
um of course there's always going to be

377
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:54,720
a risk of false negatives but this

378
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,699
should sort of help tackle that problem

379
00:14:56,699 --> 00:14:59,220
is that is that kind of what you're

380
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:01,620
going for cool

381
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:03,480
we're good thank you Martin awesome

382
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:06,199
thank you everyone

383
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:14,600
[Music]

384
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:18,360
and that one is for you thank you very

385
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:22,399
much your perfect timing

386
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:29,180
kind of what you were going for cool

387
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:32,100
we're good thank you awesome thank you

388
