1
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:07,140
so hello I'm Ellis firstly I'd like to

2
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:08,639
say that this is my first talk at a

3
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:10,200
conference so I'm really sorry if I

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,599
appear nervous because I really am

5
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:14,820
um to start with I thought I'd give a

6
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:17,279
brief introduction to myself I'm a cyber

7
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:19,500
security research intern at Airbus and

8
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:20,880
I'm currently an undergraduate student

9
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,619
studying ethical hacking and cyber

10
00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:25,199
security at Coventry University my main

11
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:26,760
areas of Interest are red teaming and

12
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,680
networking and in my free time I enjoy

13
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,960
playing video games and taking part in

14
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,059
ctfs and as you can see I'm a huge

15
00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:35,520
keyboard Enthusiast to be honest this

16
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,140
slide is mostly here so I could show you

17
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:40,079
some of my keyboards I've built

18
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:41,700
um but anyway on to the main topic one

19
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:43,140
of the projects I'm involved with at

20
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:45,059
work is about endpoint malware detection

21
00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:47,520
and Analysis and my research has led me

22
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,140
to learning about the emerging threat of

23
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:51,920
ransomware as a service or Raz

24
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,660
so I've compiled a timeline of some of

25
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:56,100
the key moments in the evolution of

26
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:58,500
ransomware the definition of ransomware

27
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,300
is Shifting with the Innovations in

28
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:01,800
technology used to carry out these

29
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,680
attacks in 1989 the first known instance

30
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:07,380
of a ransomware attack was distributed

31
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:09,060
to twenty thousand attendees at the

32
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:10,560
World Health Organization AIDS

33
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,780
conference it was released on floppy

34
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:14,340
disks and it didn't rely on any sort of

35
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,560
exploit only the Curiosity of attendees

36
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,020
at what was on the disk after installing

37
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:21,000
the program everything ran fine until

38
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,920
the 90th reboot where the Trojan would

39
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,140
encrypt the victim's file names although

40
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:27,299
not the contents of the files and demand

41
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:30,659
a 189 fee to restore the files

42
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:32,640
then there's the archivist Trojan which

43
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,159
first appeared in 2006 and was primarily

44
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:37,439
primarily distributed by a spam emails

45
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:39,720
and file sharing sites

46
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:42,119
the first ransomware to use RSA

47
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:45,060
encryption which is commonly used to uh

48
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:46,979
as it was difficult to decrypt because

49
00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:49,680
unlocking an RSA file it needs a

50
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,180
specific alphanumeric string of

51
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:52,619
characters

52
00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:54,600
the archivist Trojan encrypted

53
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,340
everything in the my documents directory

54
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:58,619
and can say them in a single file for

55
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:00,600
ransom it required victims to buy items

56
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,399
from specific websites in order to

57
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,680
receive a key to unlock their files

58
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,540
and this crypto Locker that appeared in

59
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:09,119
2013 this ransomware propagated by an

60
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:11,099
email attachment which was a zip file

61
00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:13,319
that contained an executable executable

62
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:16,379
disguise as a PDF when activated this

63
00:02:16,379 --> 00:02:19,739
was a that ransomware encrypted certain

64
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:21,720
files stored on the local network drives

65
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,580
using RSA encryption

66
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:25,020
the reason this was noteworthy in

67
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,819
ransomware history is because it was the

68
00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:29,459
first to demand payment in Bitcoin if

69
00:02:29,459 --> 00:02:30,959
the deadline wasn't met it offered to

70
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:32,760
decrypt data via an online service

71
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,620
provided by The Operators but for a

72
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:36,300
significantly higher price

73
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,580
and take your mind back to May 2017 when

74
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:40,379
wannada cry affected devices in more

75
00:02:40,379 --> 00:02:43,080
than 150 countries it contained a crypto

76
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,940
worm virus that propagated across a

77
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:47,340
computer network using the SMB version 1

78
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:49,560
exploit known as Eternal blue

79
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,260
it demanded a payment of 300 in Bitcoin

80
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:54,720
but no encryption key was available so

81
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,220
the victims who paid weren't actually

82
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:58,980
able to recover their files Lazarus a

83
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:00,780
North Korean state-sponsored cyberc

84
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,519
threat group is known to use wannacry

85
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:03,959
and it was believed to be behind this

86
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:04,860
attack

87
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:06,420
because of how widespread this

88
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:08,040
ransomware was it brought public

89
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,019
attention to not only the threat of

90
00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:11,580
ransomware but the importance of good

91
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:13,500
cyber security practices

92
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,420
Dark Side largely operates on the

93
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:17,580
ransomware as a service model and it was

94
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:19,140
responsible for the colonial pipeline

95
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:21,120
attack back in 2021

96
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,980
attackers got access to their Network

97
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:25,140
through an exposed password for a VPN

98
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:27,480
account and stole 100 gigabytes of data

99
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,360
within a two within a two hour window

100
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,400
Colonial pipeline paid the 4.4 million

101
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,500
dollars Ransom hoping to restore their

102
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:37,739
it systems faster and while they managed

103
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:39,599
to recover after the attack and got most

104
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,519
of the ransom payment back they will

105
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:43,200
forever have the reputation of being the

106
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,760
victims of one of the largest and most

107
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,799
successful cyber attacks in history so

108
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:48,720
far

109
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,480
the stages of a ransomware attack vary

110
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,220
depending on the strain deployed but

111
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:55,080
generally speaking it's a similar order

112
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,760
of operation

113
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,620
first phase of an attack is the

114
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:00,540
distribution of the ransomware some

115
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,040
common vectors according to the micro

116
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,379
attack framework include a network being

117
00:04:04,379 --> 00:04:05,900
compromised by a phishing email

118
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:08,220
exploiting a public-facing application

119
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:10,319
or through external remote services such

120
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:11,760
as RDP

121
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,500
once there is a foothold on the target

122
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,659
system a connection is established with

123
00:04:15,659 --> 00:04:17,040
the attacker's command and control

124
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,779
server which is then used to send

125
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:20,940
commands to a compromised system

126
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,979
and the next phase the ransomware sets

127
00:04:22,979 --> 00:04:24,600
the stage for Attack by credential

128
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,860
harvesting and moving through the

129
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:27,720
network providing of course it's not

130
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,820
just looking at the local file system an

131
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:31,800
exfiltrating data it finds which is then

132
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,000
sent back to the attacker through the

133
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,340
command and control server it also

134
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:37,500
searches for files to encrypt and then

135
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,300
the payload is executed and all the

136
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:41,220
files are encrypted on the systems it's

137
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:42,660
gained access to through lateral

138
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:43,860
movement

139
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:45,840
depending on the adversary's focus and

140
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,580
who their target is they might switch to

141
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:49,979
primarily identifying valuable data and

142
00:04:49,979 --> 00:04:52,740
Axle trading it and then finally The

143
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:54,479
Ransom request is displayed where the

144
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:56,220
attacker demands payment to decrypt the

145
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:57,060
victim's files

146
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:58,620
[Music]

147
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:00,900
ransomware as a service or browse is

148
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,820
based on the software software as a

149
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:04,440
service model and is advertised as

150
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,180
indistinguishable from regular software

151
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:09,180
vendors it allows attackers to Outsource

152
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:10,620
the infrastructure required for these

153
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:12,720
attacks and paying in cryptocurrency

154
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,120
allows criminal organizations to operate

155
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,800
at such a large scale due to there being

156
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,259
no limitations on transaction value

157
00:05:19,259 --> 00:05:21,840
in fact billions of dollars in crypto is

158
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,000
tied to the top 10 ransomware attacks

159
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,979
the problem is that an attacker of any

160
00:05:25,979 --> 00:05:28,139
skill level or black thereof can launch

161
00:05:28,139 --> 00:05:29,880
an attack making them more accessible

162
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:32,880
and therefore more prevalent

163
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,979
as mentioned before the rars model is

164
00:05:34,979 --> 00:05:36,240
similar to the software as a service

165
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,100
model these services are often

166
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,900
advertised on underground track groups

167
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:42,060
and dark web forums and there are

168
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:44,580
several ways in which affiliates

169
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:45,240
um

170
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,880

subscription for a flat fee or through

172
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,479
affiliate programs where an attacker

173
00:05:51,479 --> 00:05:52,979
earns commission for each successful

Ransom payment

175
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,400
there is also a profit sharing model

176
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,139
where a portion of the commission goes

177
00:05:58,139 --> 00:06:00,780
to the original developer or operator

178

00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:07,380
attackers are using Raz to sell

181
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:10,080
exfiltrated data as a form of secondary

182
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:13,020
monetization and as Sir Francis Bacon

183
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:15,120
famously said knowledge itself is power

184
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,820
as it can command obedience if a

185
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:20,039
company's sensitive data was leaked

186
00:06:20,039 --> 00:06:22,319
their reputation would be tarnished and

187
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:23,880
it would force compliance in order to

188
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,199
get that data back

189
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:28,080
sounds like a PR nightmare to me in some

190
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,600
cases instead of holding data for ransom

191
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,819
it's immediately exfiltrated and sold as

192
00:06:32,819 --> 00:06:34,860
it would be more valuable to the hackers

193

evade security measures

201

I'm now going to talk about an Infamous

202
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,960
Saras operation known as our evil

203
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,060
deployments of this malware type were

204
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:59,639
first observed in April 2019. they

205
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:01,199
operate predominantly in Eastern Europe

206
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:03,300
or Russia and they avoid targeting

207
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,759
systems in CIS countries even using code

208
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,979
to detect where a user is located

209
00:07:07,979 --> 00:07:10,080
even if you're not familiar with Ross

210
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,060
you might have heard of them and if not

211
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:13,680
you're almost certainly familiar with

212
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,940
some of the cyber attacks they've

213
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:16,259
conducted

214
00:07:16,259 --> 00:07:18,180
they infamously could have conducted a

215
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:20,520
ransomware attack against and the source

216
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,440
was identified to be BSA or virtual

217
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,360
system administrator which is a remote

218
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,919
monitoring and management software

219
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:28,620
package developed by casaya there are

220
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:31,020
approximately between 800 and 1500

221
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:33,000
Downstream businesses that were impacted

222
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,599
by the attack

00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,720
Ari will offered a universal decryption

universal decrypted tool from an unnamed

00:07:46,979 --> 00:07:49,259
trusted third party and was helping

victims restore their files as of 2022

00:07:52,259 --> 00:07:54,120
the Russian Federal Security Service

230
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,400
says they dismantled our evil and have

231
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,560
charged several of its members although

232
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,940
I don't believe this is the last we'll

233
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:01,740
see of this ransomware gang as some

234
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:03,240
leads suggest they might return just

235

236
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:08,160
according to the Sophos ransomware 2022

237
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,259
report within the last year there's been

238
00:08:10,259 --> 00:08:13,819
a 57 increase in cyber attacks overall

239
00:08:13,819 --> 00:08:16,620
66 of organizations were hit with

240
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:19,020
ransomware in the last year which is an

241
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:22,319
increase from 37 in 2020. this means

242
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:24,479
that there was a 78 increase in

243
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:26,759
ransomware attacks this shows the

244
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:28,979
adversaries are upping their rate and

245
00:08:28,979 --> 00:08:31,440
the rate and complexity of these attacks

246
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,799
in 2021 65 percent of attacks resulted

247
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:37,140
in successful data encryption which was

248
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:40,740
an increase from 54 reported in 2020. it

249
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:42,179
demonstrates that adversaries have

250
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:43,860
become more capable of executing

251
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:45,959
significant attacks at scale and

252
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:48,060
reflects the growing success of the rars

restored after companies across various

256
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:56,820
sectors pay the ransom across all

if ransomware hits your organization

00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:12,240
it's Paramount to follow Disaster

263
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,760
Recovery procedures firstly it's

264
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,800
essential to isolate any affected

265
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,360
devices in order to prevent further

266
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,820
spread generally speaking by the time

267
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:22,920
ransomware is deployed attackers are

268
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,720
already embedded in the environment so

269
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,880
it becomes a race against a Race Against

270
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,880
Time to contain the attack it impacts

271
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:32,040
it's important to identify the entry

272
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,660
point as it might be due to a known

273
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:35,640
vulnerability which can then be patched

274
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:38,700
along with any other holes in security

275
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,260
you might have to make the important

276
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:42,540
decision whether to pay the ransom like

277
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:45,959
Colonial pipeline or immediate however

278
00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:48,240
it must be noted that paying the ransom

279
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,680
doesn't guarantee that you'll recover

280
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,940
your files

281
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:53,459
so I hope you have backups you should

282
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:54,600
check that attackers have not

283
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,880
compromised the backup system and if

284
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,620
they've been compromised you can avoid

285
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:00,959
pain if they've not been compromised you

286
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:03,060
can avoid paying the ransom and restore

287
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:05,160
the data after the breaches be contained

288
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,420
of course

290
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,060
the problem with digitizing everything

291
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:11,100
is that there is little emphasis placed

292
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,080
on security and the threat of these

293

individuals to improve opsec

monitoring application behavior and

299
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,959
identifying abnormal processes like

also imperative that these backups are

304
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,620
tested frequently backups can also be

305
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:39,060
used to detect if there are an excessive

306
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:40,680
number of changes and to alert if

307

something is flagged as suspicious

308
00:10:42,899 --> 00:10:45,779

these techniques and countermeasures

to have high outer walls a moat a

drawbridge turrets and towers with

323

into the Castle's core

325
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,220
it's best to adopt a worst case scenario

326
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:22,860
tactic by using each next layer as an

assumption the previous one will fail

if an adversary breaks through one wall

336
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:41,820
at least there are other layers of

00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,740
see Raz is a multifaceted offensive

340
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:51,720
campaign that is on the rise and it's

341
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,880
not going anywhere anytime soon

342
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,560
the impacts of an attack goes beyond

343
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,420
what is paid in Ransom

344
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:58,740
the issue is

345
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:01,140
potential effects of the attack

346
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:03,600
it's imperative that not only you invest

347
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,459
in the right technology but have the

348
00:12:05,459 --> 00:12:06,660
skills and know how to use it

349
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:08,040
effectively

350
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:10,980
and lastly be proactive this is where

351
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,899
threat hunting comes in

352
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:14,940
so you can stop adversaries before they

353
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:16,560
can execute their attack

354
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,959
now I know there's so much more I can

355
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:20,459
talk about I haven't even scratched the

356
00:12:20,459 --> 00:12:22,800
surface of this topic but thank you for

357
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,720
listening to me ramble and I really hope

358
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,279
this talk has been interesting and I

359
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:29,300
hope you learned something new

360
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:36,799
[Applause]

361
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:44,940
[Music]

362
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:48,200
has anybody got any questions

363
00:12:48,899 --> 00:12:51,139
foreign

364
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:52,399
[Music]

365
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:55,200
what might incentivize someone to offer

366
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,300
ransomware as a service instead of doing

367
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:59,579
the campaigns themselves

368
00:12:59,579 --> 00:13:01,320
uh well I mean ransomware as a service

369
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,600
it offers the ability for people who

370
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,700
don't even know how to code or

371
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,560
don't really have any technological

372
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,600
experience to launch an attack against

373
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,540
anyone they want really so it allows it

374
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:15,180
for allows for people who don't really

375
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:16,500
know what they're doing to even launch

376
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:20,370
an attack and basically monetize it

377
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:21,560
[Music]

378
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:25,040
is there any more

379
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:29,220
thank you very much

380
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:32,279
my question is about the creators um of

381
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:33,839
Sid ransomware

382
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:35,820
um with their um what would you think

383
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,200
mother motivation would be for

384
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,019
Distributing their malware versus just

385
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:42,240
using themselves and getting big payouts

386
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,100
if you say that they offer flat fees or

387
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:46,500
subscriptions for their services sorry

388
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,480
would you be able to repeat that oh yeah

389
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,079
um

390
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:50,880
would it be more profitable for the for

391
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,519
them to do their own campaigns and get

392
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:56,519
big payouts in ransons versus just

393
00:13:56,519 --> 00:13:58,740
getting a subscription fee from their

394
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:00,120
users

395
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,820
I mean there are different strains of

396
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:05,339
like ransomware types that offer these

397
00:14:05,339 --> 00:14:06,779
different types of like subscription

398
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:08,339
fees and that so

399
00:14:08,339 --> 00:14:12,000
I mean I guess it depends on like

400
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,160
what the adversary

401
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,800
wants to get out of it I suppose I'm not

402
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,839
okay I'm not I'm not too familiar with

403
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:22,139
this um topic as a whole this is just my

404
00:14:22,139 --> 00:14:23,760
first initial Research into the topics

405
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,260
as I say I've only just started like the

406
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:27,899
project I worked on at work and this is

407
00:14:27,899 --> 00:14:30,240
all like really new to me yeah excellent

408
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,320
thank you but thank you for your

409
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,160
questions

410
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:35,360
yeah anymore

411
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,959
does the runs in my service offer a

412
00:14:39,959 --> 00:14:41,220
complete end-to-end so somebody

413
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:42,779
effectively off the street could say I

414
00:14:42,779 --> 00:14:44,760
want you to go and Target Airbus for

415
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,800
example or do they have to have some

416
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,180
expertise behind them and they have to

417
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:50,160
get an entry in

418
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,899
uh

419
00:14:51,899 --> 00:14:53,880
sure there are like any particular entry

420
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,199
requirements I mean

421
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:56,160
I mean possessed to these like

422
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,899
particular track groups I guess

423
00:14:57,899 --> 00:14:59,760
anything's possible really you don't

424
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,320
need like a specific

425
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,000
Target or anything you can Target just

426
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,139
any individual really it doesn't

427
00:15:04,139 --> 00:15:05,760
necessarily need to be like a company or

428
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,939
anything

429
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:11,760

431
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,680
reference I did my first talk on the

432
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,420
castle compared to cyber security and

433
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:20,100
all of that Bloody good reference that

434
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,100
was really good to see as well so yeah
