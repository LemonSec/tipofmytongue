1
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:05,220
thank you thank you very much for coming

2
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:07,020
to this session and good morning

3
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:11,400
everyone my name is Elisa I am an

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,259
academic researchers at King's College

5
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:15,179
and today I have the pleasure to

6
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:18,539
introduce you this group of enthusiastic

7
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:20,699
recent graduates at King's College

8
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:22,080
London

9
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,240
so I thought this group a quantitative

10
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,240
method for two semesters and I was

11
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:30,720
looking for sure I was looking for uh

12
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,840
interesting ways for them to learn data

13
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,079
analysis but also to familiarize with

14
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:39,480
the fascinating world of software

15
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,520
security so we have the

16
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,879
chance to partner with one of the

17
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:47,820
leading company in the sector that you

18
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:50,039
might know veracood who was kind enough

19
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:53,160
to give us their data on software

20
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:56,100
vulnerabilities found by their platform

21
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:58,940
in their customers

22
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:03,239
applications and so today we are going

23
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:06,299
to present the results of this analysis

24
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:08,460
on pattern Trends and practices in

25
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:11,340
software security and we are very happy

26
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:13,439
to have the chance to present the

27
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:15,659
results of this analysis here at beside

28
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:19,020
London and this was also an example of

29
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:22,439
Academia industry collaboration that we

30
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:24,840
hope to and we hope to inspire that

31
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,960
there are many more so without further

32
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:31,259
Ado I leave you to the

33
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:34,680
this very exciting group

34
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:37,859
[Applause]

35
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:42,240
so hello everyone I'll start you off

36
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,700
with a brief description uh of the

37
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:47,100
setting and the data we analyzed so

38
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,140
imagine you're the sister of a company

39
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:51,600
and your goal is to have a secure

40
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,619
application

41
00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:55,560
to enforce regulations and to enforce

42
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,820
your own requirements about the

43
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:58,560
application through a security policy

44
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,840
you can think of the security policies

45
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,700
as the types of flaws which are not

46
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,799
allowed to be found in an application

47
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:07,860
your team of developers will then upload

48
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:10,318
the application to be scanned for Flaws

49
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:12,000
in the cloud environment that is offered

50
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,420
by Vera code varicose will generate a

51
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:16,440
report

52
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:20,640
and on the report you will be able to

53
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,700
see the list of the applications of

54
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:26,520
their flaws excuse me the flow types as

55
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,940
well as the severity score for each flow

56
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:32,280
and the whether or not it breaks the

57
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,560
security policy that you have set then

58
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,099
as the CSO and with your team of

59
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:40,319
developers you're able to decide whether

60
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:43,200
or not to fix a flow or not later we

61
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,420
will see how different flaws can be

62
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:47,819
addressed

63
00:02:47,819 --> 00:02:51,900
um afterwards you can also upload the

64
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:52,879
application

65
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:56,160
and have it scanned again

66
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,780
and the cycle repeats

67
00:03:04,379 --> 00:03:06,300
um so before we start with the analysis

68
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,580
here we have a quick summary of the data

69
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:11,159
set we work with so we had available

70
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:14,239
data that covered

71
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:18,120
2587 customers across 24 distinct

72
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,400
Industries over the period of first of

73
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,959
January 2019 to 25th of January 22.

74
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:27,420
and 95 of these customers performed

75
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:30,000
scans During the period and we had more

76
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,720
than 4 million scans and

77
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,260
147

78
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:36,180
000 applications

79
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:38,819
and this data comes from one single

80
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:40,140
vendor

81
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:43,879
but as you're gonna see it is quite

82
00:03:43,879 --> 00:03:46,860
comprehensive as a data set it covers

83
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:48,959
many flood types industry sectors and so

84
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:49,799
on

85
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:51,720
and we mainly focus on detecting

86
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,580
patterns over time and differences

87
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:56,640
across different Industries and to give

88
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,840
you a quick look of like how

89
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,760
comprehensive the data set is you can

90
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,799
see two histograms of the number of

91
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:03,540
customers by Industries

92
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:04,980
and the number of applications by

93
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:07,399
Industries

94
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:14,119
okay so to begin with we

95
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,820
AK Behavior across Industries which are

96
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,680
denoted by the colorful bars as you have

97
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,139
seen so first up we looked at the mean

98
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:24,419
number of scans per application for

99
00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:27,360
applications with at least one scan this

100
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,580
is calculated by taking the mean number

101
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:32,639
of scans per per application divided by

102
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,860
the total number of applications in

103
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:37,860
given industry so in this graph the

104
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:40,500
black lines denote the 95 confidence

105
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:43,259
intervals which denote the Precision of

106
00:04:43,259 --> 00:04:46,259
the estimate Industries with more data

107
00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:48,240
have a smaller have a smaller confidence

108
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,040
interval and therefore the estimates are

109
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,419
more precise

110
00:04:51,419 --> 00:04:54,120
what we see here is a large variation in

111
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,460
data so on the left hand side of the

112
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:58,199
graph you see the industry's

113
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:00,660
manufacturing travel Recreation and

114
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:03,060
Leisure retail and government which are

115
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:06,020
industries that scan more often

116
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:08,759
the median is also depicted by the

117
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:10,680
dotted lines which we have plotted to

118
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,800
detect specific outliers in our data

119
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,660
the median also shows a generally

120
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:19,639
decreasing trend from left to right

121
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,020
the second way of analyzing industry

122
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:24,180
variation and scanning patterns is

123
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:26,220
looking at how regularly scans take

124
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:27,000
place

125
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,460
we measure this by scan Cadence which is

126
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:31,860
the average number of days in between

127
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:33,660
scans

128
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:35,759
this shows where the scans are spaced

129
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:37,860
regularly across time which would give

130
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:39,479
for instance different security

131
00:05:39,479 --> 00:05:41,759
implications

132
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,840
as you can see on the graph

133
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:47,280
Industries on the left scan less

134
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,020
regularly and Industries on the right

135
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:51,180
scan drop more regularly since the

136
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:52,919
y-axis is the mean number of days in

137
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:54,240
between scans

138
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,280
just like the previous graph the median

139
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,560
and the 95 confidence intervals are

140
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,840
plotted as well

141
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,400
as you can see a large number of

142
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,680
Industries show average time in between

143
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:08,460
scans of 5 to 15 days as depicted by the

144
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:10,860
middle portion of the graph

145
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:13,020
the overall average time between scans

146
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:16,620
across all Industries is 12.14 days this

147
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:18,479
may be related to the increasing use of

148
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:20,460
the agile methodology

149
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:22,199
so the two measures are actually

150
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:24,960
correlated we found that industries that

151
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,120
scan more frequently also tend to scan

152
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,819
more regularly as what we would expect

153
00:06:29,819 --> 00:06:31,740
this is seen by the Industries on the

154
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:32,759
right hand side of this graph

155
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:34,560
corresponding to those on the left hand

156
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,199
side of the previous graph these include

157
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:39,660
retail government and travel Recreation

158
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:42,380
and Leisure

159
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,580
next we decided to look at the behavior

160
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:50,220
of scans across time we were

161
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:52,280
particularly interested in cyclic

162
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,660
encyclicality that is how the number of

163
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:58,080
scans uh vary throughout the year we

164
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:01,800
were also very interested in how scanned

165
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,900
how scan Behavior changed after

166
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:07,139
important dates firstly we decided to

167
00:07:07,139 --> 00:07:08,940
normalize the amount of scans by the

168
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:11,039
amount of customers so we could see if

169
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:13,560
this increase in scans was either due to

170
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:16,500
people scanning more or an increase in

171
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:19,139
the number of customers in varicose

172
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:21,780
customer base even though we noticed an

173
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:24,599
increase of customers throughout time at

174
00:07:24,599 --> 00:07:30,000
a regular speed we also we saw that the

175
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,520
increase in the amount of scans per

176
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:36,120
customer was was bigger than the trend

177
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:39,599
in the increase of uh in the increase of

178
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:42,720
number of customers we also noted that

179
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,060
there was a quite a lot of cyclicality

180
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:47,880
especially uh in December as you can see

181
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:51,000
drops uh every year this is probably due

182
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,080
to a fewer amount of scans as people uh

183
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:59,580
uh go home over the holidays

184
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:02,280
um we also noticed a big

185
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:05,940
um uh a big increase in the year of 2021

186
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:08,220
uh breaking the trend

187
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:12,660
uh particularly when we focus on 2021 we

188
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:14,699
noticed that there was a very big spike

189
00:08:14,699 --> 00:08:18,000
after the log for Shell incident

190
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,639
um this uh to give you an idea of how

191
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:23,280
big this Spike was it was an increase in

192
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,740
a round of five scans per existing

193
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:29,340
customer before that the max increase in

194
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:33,240
uh the same amount of weeks was only 3.5

195
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,700
um amount of scans per customer so it

196
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:38,039
was a very

197
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:41,099
um a very big spiking lead

198
00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:45,080
passing the word over to General

199
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:48,200
perfect

200
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:54,240
Industries and what we can see from the

201
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,019
graph is that the most frequent

202
00:08:57,019 --> 00:08:59,940
vulnerabilities are cross-site scripting

203
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:03,720
crlf injection and information leakage

204
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:06,839
and this was a

205
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:09,180
calculation where we were very concerned

206
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:11,519
about the representativeness of our data

207
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:13,940
because we only have very code customers

208
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:17,100
we decided to normalize the numbers so

209
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,779
we have this little calculation on the

210
00:09:18,779 --> 00:09:21,240
right hand side where we divided the

211
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:24,779
number of flaws in an industry by the

212
00:09:24,779 --> 00:09:26,820
number of applications in that industry

213
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:30,180
so when you look at the numbers on the

214
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:33,480
bars that is the average number of that

215
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:36,600
flaw in the specific industry

216
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:41,040
so looking at the um 52 of cross-site

217
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,200
scripting and flaws in retail and

218
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,019
Hospitality that means on average there

219
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:49,800
can be 52 flaws cross-site scripting in

220
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,560
in return Hospitality however twice as

221
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,300
many can be seen in the technology

222
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:58,220
sector so on average 109 per application

223
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:01,560
and looking at General and patterns we

224
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,320
can see that the technology industry

225
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:06,480
experiences the highest number of laws

226
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,120
per application across the three most

227
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,260
frequent

228
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:12,779
um flaws so they have a lot of

229
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:14,399
cross-site scripting flaws per

230
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,800
application also crlf injection and

231
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,560
information leakage problems and

232
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,720
interestingly the government also has

233
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,540
problems with cross-site scripting and

234
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:27,060
they have on average 89 flaws per

235
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:30,360
application however Less on crlf

236
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:33,480
injection and information leakage

237
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:36,300
and next we were then interested in

238
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,880
going into which Industries have the

239
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,600
most severe flaws and by to do that we

240
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,180
calculated a regression where the

241
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:47,339
outcome variable is the number of severe

242
00:10:47,339 --> 00:10:49,500
flaws and the whole calculation was

243
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:53,040
based on the application Level again

244
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,220
um what we can see is that um in the red

245
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:58,980
box you can see the the

246
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:00,300
um coefficients for the different

247
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:03,720
Industries so we

248
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:06,240
can see that in general there is a trend

249
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,940
of of increasing numbers of severe flaws

250
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:10,920
within that red box

251
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,240
especially software and internet

252
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,660
industry and have a high number of laws

253
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:17,820
and just to tell you how exactly that

254
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:21,000
was calculated we decided to compare

255
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,620
everything to the Baseline financial

256
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:26,220
services so the numbers you can see is

257
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:28,380
um for example software and internet in

258
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:31,700
2019 they had on average

259
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:36,779
122 flaws more per application than

260
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:40,880
um the financial services industry

261
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,740
um what's also is interesting we

262
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:45,839
controlled for other factors that could

263
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:47,459
potentially influence the number of

264
00:11:47,459 --> 00:11:49,680
severe flaws such as business

265
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,140
criticality or whether the customer

266
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:54,959
requested a consultation and customer

267
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:56,899
age and also the programming language

268
00:11:56,899 --> 00:12:00,660
and interestingly the criticality of the

269
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:03,060
application had no significant effects

270
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:05,579
on the number of severe flaws one might

271
00:12:05,579 --> 00:12:07,459
expect that more business critical

272
00:12:07,459 --> 00:12:09,720
applications are actually more secure

273
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:14,220
however that doesn't seem to be the case

274
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:16,440
um in terms of the programming languages

275
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:19,500
we can see a very high variation however

276
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:23,519
we didn't go more in detail on that

277
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:26,880
um however in the next step we were more

278
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,399
concerned about industry maturity in

279
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:32,279
general so which Industries are most

280
00:12:32,279 --> 00:12:35,100
software security mature or least

281
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:37,200
software security mature and also what

282
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,420
really drives that maturity

283
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:43,320
so again we did a regression and to

284
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,180
really determine which Industries

285
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:47,459
software security mature so kind of

286
00:12:47,459 --> 00:12:50,880
optimize their way of detecting flaws we

287
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,019
have

288
00:12:52,019 --> 00:12:54,899
um a binary classification so we

289
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:56,700
distinguish between clients who have an

290
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:59,060
API account so who scan automatically

291
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:02,160
versus clients who have a manual account

292
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,200
so we assume those who scan

293
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,360
automatically are more mature

294
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:09,839
and the binary classification also takes

295
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:12,000
into account other variables that could

296
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,240
potentially affect the majorities such

297
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:18,899
as time variation the applications age

298
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:21,260
also having requests today consultation

299
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:24,240
and business criticality and again the

300
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,399
programming language

301
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:29,279
what we can see when we look at the

302
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:30,440
numbers

303
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,760
the industries with positive

304
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:35,160
coefficients especially the ones in the

305
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,779
upper green

306
00:13:36,779 --> 00:13:39,720
um box are most strongly correlated with

307
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,700
having an API account so government

308
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:44,459
travel Recreation and Leisure education

309
00:13:44,459 --> 00:13:47,279
retail and financial services seem to be

310
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:50,639
more software secure mature in that

311
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:53,279
sense and however on the other hand

312
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,899
those Industries with a negative

313
00:13:54,899 --> 00:13:57,060
coefficient such as telecommunications

314
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:59,820
wholesale distribution and federal

315
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:02,639
government and partner and companies of

316
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:06,060
varicode and seem to be less correlated

317
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:08,160
with having an API account so least

318
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,620
software security mature

319
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:12,800
looking at the control variables

320
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,300
interestingly we see a positive time

321
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:17,639
Trend so over the years

322
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:19,560
um we see increasing software security

323
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:22,200
maturity approximately there is an

324
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,420
increase in API account use of one

325
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:27,060
percent in 12 months

326
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:29,160
um however the applications age having

327
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,639
requested a consultation with an expert

328
00:14:31,639 --> 00:14:34,500
or the business criticality don't

329
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:37,920
influence how mature you you are again

330
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,839
interestingly programming language again

331
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:43,860
has an impact on the maturity or or um

332
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:47,040
yeah how optimized you are in terms of

333
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,839
um scanning and software security

334
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:51,959
maturity however those effects really

335
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:54,240
vary sometimes they predicted less or

336
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,839
more API accounts with that I now hand

337
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:00,779
over to Alan

338
00:15:00,779 --> 00:15:04,380
hi um next up we look into which flaws

339
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:06,360
get fixed and what drives the decision

340
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:09,060
to fix them and we use two logistic

341
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:11,459
regression model here in the first model

342
00:15:11,459 --> 00:15:13,980
we have modification in the code such

343
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:17,100
that the outcome variable equals one if

344
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:19,260
the flow is fixed and the outcome

345
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:21,540
variable equals zero if the flow is left

346
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:24,180
unresolved we look into a number of

347
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:26,220
independent variables that we believe

348
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:28,920
are key drivers to the decision of

349
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:31,320
whether or not to fixing the flows one

350
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:33,540
intuitive driver we may look like look

351
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:36,420
at is the floor severity in the

352
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:39,000
coefficient column and this tells us

353
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,279
whether a flow with a certain severity

354
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:43,740
level is more or less likely to get

355
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:46,440
fixed relative to our control group so

356
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,779
in flaws with informational severity

357
00:15:48,779 --> 00:15:51,660
level and if the coefficient is positive

358
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:54,600
the flaw is more likely to get fixed if

359
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,760
it's negative the flow is less likely to

360
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:59,579
get fixed here all the coefficients are

361
00:15:59,579 --> 00:16:01,740
positive so we could say that at all

362
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:03,779
level of severity increase the

363
00:16:03,779 --> 00:16:06,839
likelihood of a flow getting fixed

364
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:10,380
this is quite intuitive but as you may

365
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:12,959
see the higher severity level doesn't

366
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:16,019
mean it's making the it's the one the

367
00:16:16,019 --> 00:16:19,019
most likely to get fixed and this may be

368
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:21,480
because of the difficulties in fixing

369
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,579
the flaws which we do not observe here

370
00:16:23,579 --> 00:16:27,300
in the data and in the second panel we

371
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:29,820
consider forcing application that we we

372
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:31,880
see as business critical

373
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:36,000
and for medium business criticality and

374
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,320
above

375
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,420
um therefore are most likely to get

376
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:42,060
fixed the coefficient is both large in

377
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:45,779
magnitude and statistically significant

378
00:16:45,779 --> 00:16:49,079
another key variable we look into is the

379
00:16:49,079 --> 00:16:51,540
number of scan types this is an

380
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:53,579
indicator ranging from one to four

381
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:57,360
indicating whether uh indicating the

382
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,880
number of times the number of different

383
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:02,220
scan types an application has been

384
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:05,760
scanned this include Dynamic analysis

385
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:09,419
static analysis as CA and penetration

386
00:17:09,419 --> 00:17:12,299
testing here again the higher the number

387
00:17:12,299 --> 00:17:15,359
of different scan types the more likely

388
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:18,059
the flow gets fixed in the second model

389
00:17:18,059 --> 00:17:20,579
we have modification in the code such

390
00:17:20,579 --> 00:17:23,099
that the outcome variable equals one if

391
00:17:23,099 --> 00:17:25,439
the flow is fixed or mitigated in some

392
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:28,079
other ways or an equals zero if it's

393
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:30,480
left unresolved here you can see the

394
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,520
coefficient is very similar to the

395
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:35,520
previous model except for this very high

396
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,160
severity level and in the very high

397
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,860
severity level the coefficient is larger

398
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:43,320
in magnitude and becomes statistically

399
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:46,440
significant we interpret this result as

400
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:49,320
the very high severity flow is more

401
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:52,020
likely to be mitigated rather than fixed

402
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:55,020
and this explains why the very high

403
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:57,059
severity flows becomes large and

404
00:17:57,059 --> 00:18:01,220
significant only in the second model

405
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,320
okay

406
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:06,539
so next we ask the question how quickly

407
00:18:06,539 --> 00:18:10,380
this laws get fixed and we answer by

408
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:12,900
looking at the time it takes to fix 50

409
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:15,179
of all Flaws by industry what is also

410
00:18:15,179 --> 00:18:17,220
known as the floss half-life

411
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:21,780
and we start by calculating the lifetime

412
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:24,080
also called the duration of losing days

413
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,760
from the moment they are first found to

414
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:29,100
the moment when they are resolved and we

415
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:32,280
find the half-life by industry

416
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:34,140
um we can see that the average time it

417
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:36,720
took for 50 of all flaws to be fixed

418
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:40,380
across Industries was 121 days but you

419
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:41,880
can also see that the inter-industry

420
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,940
variation was also very large

421
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:46,140
Agriculture and Mining which was the

422
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:48,600
fastest industry had the half-life of

423
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:51,539
just 29 days whereas consumer services

424
00:18:51,539 --> 00:18:55,140
took 341 days to fix half of all flaws

425
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:58,140
found in the applications

426
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:00,419
to to illustrate the SK to illustrate

427
00:19:00,419 --> 00:19:02,160
the scale of the difference between the

428
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,960
slowest and fastest Industries we have

429
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,400
also plotted the proportion of

430
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,740
unresolved flaws over time and you can

431
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:10,500
see for example that after 20 months in

432
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,539
Agriculture and Mining almost no flow

433
00:19:12,539 --> 00:19:16,039
remains whereas even after 30 months in

434
00:19:16,039 --> 00:19:18,660
consumer services almost a quarter of

435
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:21,960
laws remain and we will later show that

436
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:24,120
this is in part because of the different

437
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,860
nature of laws that are faced by

438
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:28,760
different Industries

439
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:32,400
next we ask whether specific Industries

440
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,740
get faster at fixing flows over time and

441
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:36,720
to do this we compute the number of days

442
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,059
that it takes to fix 50 of the floors

443
00:19:39,059 --> 00:19:40,919
arising in each year for those

444
00:19:40,919 --> 00:19:42,900
Industries and we do this for each

445
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:45,360
industry and then on the entire sample

446
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,760
and that is if I explain to you the

447
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,860
columns here in the table if you look at

448
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:52,860
2019 what this says is that 2019 refers

449
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:54,539
to the number of days that it took to

450
00:19:54,539 --> 00:19:57,000
fix 50 of the floors found in the year

451
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,179
2019 2020 refers to the number of days

452
00:20:00,179 --> 00:20:02,160
that it took to fix 50 of the floors

453
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:05,520
found in 2020 and so on if you take

454
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,440
Turtle as an example that is all the

455
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,780
industries pulled together and we could

456
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:12,780
see that it took 94 days to fix 50 of

457
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:16,020
the floors found in 2019 141 to fix 50

458
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:19,140
of the floors done in 2020 and 80 days

459
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:22,919
to fix 50 of the floors found in 2021

460
00:20:22,919 --> 00:20:24,600
overall the pattern here is not that

461
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,520
easy to summarize it's quite it's quite

462
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,799
heterogeneous some Industries get faster

463
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:31,500
over time some get slower and some have

464
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,660
jumps like the turtle

465
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:35,460
but there is a few industries that

466
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:36,780
caught our attention which I've just

467
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:38,760
highlighted in green now if you look at

468
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,559
the bottom right corner you can see that

469
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:42,600
real estate and Healthcare are two

470
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,760
industries that actually get much faster

471
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:47,039
at fixing flows over time

472
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:48,600
um for example real estate goes from

473
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:51,840
over 500 Days to fix 50 of the flaws to

474
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:55,679
only 12 days in 2021 and some other

475
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,960
Industries show a inverse pattern such

476
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:00,120
as consumer services which actually gets

477
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:03,480
so slower at fixing flows over time

478
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,039
um we should keep in mind here that

479
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:07,740
those are unconditional estimates which

480
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:09,240
means that we're not controlling for

481
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:12,240
anything and these are only suggestive

482
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,679
um and if we wanted to learn more we

483
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:15,539
would have to enter a parametric model

484
00:21:15,539 --> 00:21:17,400
which is a model that takes into account

485
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,799
all those other factors at the same time

486
00:21:19,799 --> 00:21:21,720
and controls for them which we will do

487
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:24,240
over the next few slides

488
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,520
huh

489
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,020
[Music]

490
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:30,480
yeah so we just saw that there is quite

491
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,820
some variation in floor fixing times

492
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:35,940
both over time and across Industries so

493
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:38,760
the next step is to ask why is that and

494
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:41,280
to do that we estimated a parametric

495
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,600
survival model

496
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,760
the outcome we want to explain with our

497
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:48,059
model is the lifetime in days of each

498
00:21:48,059 --> 00:21:50,159
floor from the time it is first detected

499
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:52,860
detected in a scan to the time it is

500
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:54,659
resolved

501
00:21:54,659 --> 00:21:57,600
um and at first we estimate this model

502
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,960
pooled with all the data over all over

503
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,000
all three years and across all

504
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,200
Industries

505
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,480
and we estimate the influence of four

506
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,280
variables of interest on the time it

507
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:10,799
takes to fix the floor first we look at

508
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:13,200
whether that kind of floor is permitted

509
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,419
to go unaddressed under that respective

510
00:22:15,419 --> 00:22:17,460
businesses security policy or whether

511
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:19,140
there is a requirement to address that

512
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:21,900
kind of law second we look at how severe

513
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:23,220
the floor is

514
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:25,620
third how critical the application is

515
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:29,039
for that developer and lastly how old

516
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:31,260
the application is

517
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:33,900
and we also control for a couple of more

518
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,700
variables first whether the business

519
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:37,799
requested an expert consultation from

520
00:22:37,799 --> 00:22:40,679
Vero code about that application how

521
00:22:40,679 --> 00:22:42,240
long they've been using this scanning

522
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,559
service

523
00:22:43,559 --> 00:22:45,720
thirds which programming language is

524
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:48,120
primarily used in the application and

525
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:49,799
finally whether the application was

526
00:22:49,799 --> 00:22:52,799
submitted only for say a static analysis

527
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:55,200
or for multiple types of scan and also

528
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,059
software composition analysis and manual

529
00:22:57,059 --> 00:22:59,340
penetration testing for example

530
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:02,100
so one way to compare the effect of

531
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:04,679
these variables on floor fixing time is

532
00:23:04,679 --> 00:23:07,260
to look at Hazard ratios a relative

533
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:08,820
measure of

534
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:12,360
um of how quickly flaws are fixed so it

535
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:15,539
has a ratio of 1 would mean that the

536
00:23:15,539 --> 00:23:17,100
variable we're looking at is not

537
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:19,500
associated with the outcome a hazard

538
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:22,620
ratio greater than one which means that

539
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:25,320
flaws with that characteristic tend to

540
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,480
be fixed faster than those without and

541
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,340
it has a ratio of less than one would

542
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:33,480
mean slower slower floor fixing so here

543
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,700
we can see the results of that first

544
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:37,860
model

545
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:41,520
um the perhaps most clear pattern is

546
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,620
here actually whether a floor is allowed

547
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:46,080
under the business's security policy or

548
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,059
not we can see if you look at the very

549
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:50,760
top bar in the figure that such flaws

550
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,740
that aren't required to actually be

551
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:55,140
addressed are fixed about

552
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:58,500
uh one-third slower than than any other

553
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:01,080
flaws that are required to be addressed

554
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:03,480
with regard to severity we would have

555
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:05,760
maybe expected to see some kind of clear

556
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,460
pattern that potentially that very

557
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:10,500
severe flaws would be addressed with the

558
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:12,720
greatest urgency however the pattern is

559
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,280
not actually as clear as one might

560
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:17,700
expect what we can say is that very

561
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:22,080
little severe flaws are fixed about 30

562
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:25,260
slower than the 20 slower than than

563
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:27,900
those with medium severity but there is

564
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:30,000
no significant difference between the

565
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,880
time it takes to fix medium high or very

566
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,640
high severity flaws and applications age

567
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:38,100
does not seem to have a significant

568
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:40,740
impact on the time it takes to fix flaws

569
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:42,600
in that application but business

570
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:45,720
criticality is again a pattern that fits

571
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:48,179
well with the intuition the more

572
00:24:48,179 --> 00:24:50,640
critical an application is for the

573
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:53,159
business of the faster flaws in it get

574
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:55,440
fixed we can see that very low

575
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:58,200
criticality applications

576
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:01,200
um are are resolved the flaws and those

577
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,020
are resolved about 30 slower than and

578
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:06,659
medium severity uh medium criticality

579
00:25:06,659 --> 00:25:09,110
applications

580
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:10,320
[Music]

581
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,860
yes

582
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:15,059
and now that we've seen what a

583
00:25:15,059 --> 00:25:16,620
parametric model is and now that you

584
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:17,580
understand a little bit more about

585
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:19,380
Hazard ratios which are the coefficients

586
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:22,200
here again and we're going to do it

587
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,460
we're going to say we're going to run

588
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:25,440
the same model but for the floors

589
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,360
arising in each year for only two

590
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,159
industries the two industries that you

591
00:25:29,159 --> 00:25:30,480
see here are actually the two industries

592
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,580
we identified earlier real estate and

593
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:34,320
Healthcare we identified as two

594
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,000
industries that got faster fixing flows

595
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,799
over time and we're going to dive a

596
00:25:37,799 --> 00:25:40,380
little bit closer into what may drive

597
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:42,419
this pattern of them getting faster over

598
00:25:42,419 --> 00:25:43,799
time

599
00:25:43,799 --> 00:25:47,400
and if you look closely here at the

600
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,440
customer tenure it appears that

601
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,880
customers that have been with very good

602
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:54,120
for longer actually get uh with time get

603
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:56,700
to fix flaws faster I'm gonna walk you

604
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:57,600
through how to interpret the

605
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,460
coefficients here so the first

606
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:01,100
coefficient in 2019

607
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:04,740
0.749 can be rounded up to 0.75 which

608
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:06,779
means that those the floors found in

609
00:26:06,779 --> 00:26:10,799
2019 are 25 less likely to be fixed

610
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:12,360
um because of the tenure of the customer

611
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:16,020
but if you move to 2021 that coefficient

612
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:18,480
actually becomes above one which means

613
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:22,620
now 1.1 means that there's a 10 more

614
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:25,020
likely chance that the floors get fixed

615
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:27,000
with customers of that customer tenure

616
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,159
so with time Customs actually get faster

617
00:26:29,159 --> 00:26:31,260
at fixing floors

618
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:33,480
if we now look at the floor at the

619
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:35,520
severity of the floors

620
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,020
um there's an interesting pattern here

621
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:40,260
which is that in 2019 a relatively low

622
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:44,279
severe flaws actually are fixed slower

623
00:26:44,279 --> 00:26:48,000
relative to medium severity flaws

624
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,799
um but these results become

625
00:26:49,799 --> 00:26:52,679
insignificant in 2020 and 2021

626
00:26:52,679 --> 00:26:53,640
um which means that there's no effect

627
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,799
because you can see that the the stars

628
00:26:55,799 --> 00:26:57,720
are gone from the coefficients and you

629
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,760
see the inverse pattern for relatively

630
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,320
High severe flows which are

631
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:05,340
insignificant to affect floor fixing

632
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:08,220
rates in 2019 but actually significant

633
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:10,679
in 2020 and 2021

634
00:27:10,679 --> 00:27:13,020
reducing the likelihood of the floor

635
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:15,659
being fixed then

636
00:27:15,659 --> 00:27:18,779
um by as much as 60 percent

637
00:27:18,779 --> 00:27:21,360
if you now move on to healthcare we can

638
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,340
actually see that customer tenure in

639
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:24,600
green again

640
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,460
um coincides with the early observations

641
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:29,039
we made for Real Estate which is that

642
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:30,600
with time customer tenure actually

643
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,039
increases

644
00:27:32,039 --> 00:27:34,559
um the likelihood that floor is fixed

645
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:35,880
um as you can see we moved from a

646
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:38,039
coefficient below one in 2019 took

647
00:27:38,039 --> 00:27:41,039
efficient above one in 2021 which can be

648
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:44,400
attributed for 2021 as an increase in

649
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,900
the likelihood of the floor being faced

650
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:48,960
in that fixed in that year of 16 if we

651
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,840
round it up

652
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:53,159
and then let's now look at business

653
00:27:53,159 --> 00:27:56,039
criticality in the case of healthcare

654
00:27:56,039 --> 00:27:57,779
um what is interesting here is that

655
00:27:57,779 --> 00:28:00,900
flaws which are associated with

656
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:03,240
um relatively High critical uh

657
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:06,240
application for business are more likely

658
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,700
to be fixed in all years and as a

659
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:10,380
comparison we can compare very low and

660
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:12,840
very high business criticality flaws and

661
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:14,760
you can see that

662
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,799
um very that flows are associated with

663
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:19,440
very low business criticality have the

664
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,400
lowest

665
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,840
um Hazard I have some of the lowest

666
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:24,360
Hazard ratios reducing the floor the

667
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:27,179
likelihood the flow is fixed in in 2020

668
00:28:27,179 --> 00:28:29,880
by as much as 78

669
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,620
um and if you move to the very high

670
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:33,960
business criticality Flows at the last

671
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:36,480
line of that square Red Square you can

672
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:40,380
see that um you have the opposite with a

673
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:42,840
very high flaws associated with very

674
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,880
high business criticality

675
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:47,700
um are sped up by as much as 75 in 2019

676
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:52,820
and 100 in 2020.

677
00:28:53,159 --> 00:28:55,440
we can now conclude on everything we've

678
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,539
seen today we've we've understood that

679
00:28:57,539 --> 00:28:59,460
scans have increased over time and

680
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:01,980
particularly so in 2021

681
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:03,600
um we've observed some cyclicality

682
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,020
around the December period we've also

683
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:09,600
seen that some shocks in the system are

684
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,220
seen throughout the number of scans done

685
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:12,960
such as the lock for Shell flow becoming

686
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,900
public there's also a high variability

687
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:18,419
of behavior across Industries whether

688
00:29:18,419 --> 00:29:20,940
that is in terms of scan frequency scan

689
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:24,480
Cadence software security maturity and

690
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:27,299
the time that it takes to fix uh 50 of

691
00:29:27,299 --> 00:29:29,460
the flaws which and those can range from

692
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:32,940
29 days to 341.

693
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:35,580
and we've also seen with the last part

694
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:37,380
of our analysis that some Industries get

695
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:38,880
actually faster at fixing flows over

696
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,799
time and some get slower such as

697
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:42,299
consumer services

698
00:29:42,299 --> 00:29:45,120
and this rate of flow fixing is actually

699
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,159
sped up by the by the fact that this

700
00:29:47,159 --> 00:29:49,260
floor is not allowed under the client's

701
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:51,840
policy the business criticality of the

702
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:54,480
application the flow is in and most

703
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,860
importantly the customer tenure with

704
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:58,919
error code and thank you for having us

705
00:29:58,919 --> 00:30:00,779
and listening

706
00:30:00,779 --> 00:30:03,559
foreign

707
00:30:03,910 --> 00:30:08,539
[Applause]

708
00:30:08,539 --> 00:30:10,860
happy to answer any questions you may

709
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:13,879
have at this point

710
00:30:14,779 --> 00:30:18,360
yes so can I ask a question yeah so um

711
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:20,340
you have the shocks to assist they're a

712
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:21,960
vlog 4J have you been able to look at

713
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:24,179
any examples of say

714
00:30:24,179 --> 00:30:26,159
um releases in say Android version or

715
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:30,539
iOS version or other operating system

716
00:30:30,539 --> 00:30:34,039
versions over that time

717
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:38,159
for as far as I know we didn't uh

718
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:40,140
consider those okay

719
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:41,399
um just because

720
00:30:41,399 --> 00:30:45,659
we we had limited time and uh efforts

721
00:30:45,659 --> 00:30:47,039
it's another research question there you

722
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:49,200
go yeah of course and let me pass this

723
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,799
around thank you

724
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:54,960
hello uh you mentioned business

725
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:57,720
criticality as like when the aspects

726
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:00,720
that you were having into consideration

727
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:03,120
how how do you measure business

728
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:06,918
criticality for the

729
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:09,779
I think so that's like in the data set

730
00:31:09,779 --> 00:31:12,840
that was given to us by varicose

731
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,760
um they have

732
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:17,460
um actually a very detailed explanation

733
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:19,860
and code book for each variable and they

734
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:23,580
have uh coded for a business

735
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:26,580
mechanicality on like four points

736
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:28,740
um which I imagine is they didn't say

737
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:31,020
but I imagine that would be

738
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:32,940
um as a feedback from the customer that

739
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:35,399
would say what is considered for them an

740
00:31:35,399 --> 00:31:38,100
important uh app and what is not you

741
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:39,960
know when you register on a website on

742
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:41,580
like when they register their account I

743
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:43,440
imagine they have to say how important

744
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:46,399
that app is to their business

745
00:31:46,919 --> 00:31:50,220
so so the sectors that you saw big

746
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:52,440
changes in either positive or negative

747
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:54,779
do you know from very code how many

748
00:31:54,779 --> 00:31:56,700
customers they had in that sector could

749
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:58,260
it just be one or two people getting

750
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:00,600
their act together yeah do you could you

751
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,580
uh is it are you talking about the time

752
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:04,200
they took to fix which I know you're

753
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:06,620
referring to

754
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:08,760
this

755
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:11,159
one where you show in the different

756
00:32:11,159 --> 00:32:12,840
sectors and they were like one of them

757
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:15,240
one of the sectors got much better one

758
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:17,580
of the sectors got much worse in terms

759
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:19,620
of being yeah so Healthcare and real

760
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:21,480
estate were getting better and consumer

761
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:24,360
services was getting slower right so I

762
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:25,160
think

763
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:25,620
[Music]

764
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:26,279
um

765
00:32:26,279 --> 00:32:28,980
from what I remember there's about four

766
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:30,299
and five percent

767
00:32:30,299 --> 00:32:31,440
um so real estate and Healthcare

768
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,200
represent about four and five percent of

769
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:36,360
the of the customers of varicose each so

770
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:38,880
in total about 10 so there's actually

771
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:41,399
quite a lot of observations if you if

772
00:32:41,399 --> 00:32:45,419
you move to this table

773
00:32:45,419 --> 00:32:47,279
here you can see at the bottom of the

774
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:48,539
table that you have the number of

775
00:32:48,539 --> 00:32:50,760
Innovations for each year so you have

776
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:53,279
minimum 200

777
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:56,880
000 observations for that year so it

778
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:00,559
would suggest that it's quite accurate

779
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,580
this

780
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:06,360
for fixing flows per floors

781
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:10,440
and do we know the data set

782
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:12,860
is it

783
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:15,899
uh data that the floors have they

784
00:33:15,899 --> 00:33:17,519
potentially been ignored and that's

785
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:20,940
what's considered as fixed or is it

786
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:23,279
actually fixed what does that data set

787
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:24,299
include

788
00:33:24,299 --> 00:33:26,760
so we interpreted flaws that are

789
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:30,659
deliberately on left unfixed

790
00:33:30,659 --> 00:33:31,559
um

791
00:33:31,559 --> 00:33:34,080
that where where the customer said we

792
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:36,960
don't want to fix this as resolved but

793
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:39,539
so in in the in the survival analysis we

794
00:33:39,539 --> 00:33:41,820
treated them as as resolved well for

795
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:42,659
example

796
00:33:42,659 --> 00:33:44,720
um

797
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:55,440
so so we do have a lot we do have um we

798
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:58,799
do know whether a floor was addressed or

799
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:02,460
Not by so so the cost in in the case

800
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:04,679
where the flow wasn't fixed in the code

801
00:34:04,679 --> 00:34:08,159
it might have been mitigated through

802
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:09,480
other ways by the cost so the customer

803
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,159
said they have taken appropriate

804
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:13,199
measures so that it's not that bad so

805
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:14,940
for example in this model we consider

806
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:16,859
that separated separately where that

807
00:34:16,859 --> 00:34:19,020
floor was actually fixed in the code or

808
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:20,219
mitigated

809
00:34:20,219 --> 00:34:23,820
or a customer could also register that

810
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:25,859
floor as we just accept the risk of that

811
00:34:25,859 --> 00:34:27,418
flow and we don't do anything about it

812
00:34:27,418 --> 00:34:29,460
but that is a separate category from

813
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:32,040
just left unresolved so basically that

814
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:34,560
information is not part of here

815
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,780
or is that also included part of this

816
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:38,699
whole data set

817
00:34:38,699 --> 00:34:41,699
s so in those that where the customer

818
00:34:41,699 --> 00:34:43,500
said we are not going to do anything

819
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:45,359
about it those would be treated as

820
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:48,659
resolved in our data set and those where

821
00:34:48,659 --> 00:34:50,099
we don't know anything would be treated

822
00:34:50,099 --> 00:34:53,060
as left unfixed

823
00:34:54,379 --> 00:34:56,060
foreign

824
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:59,580
so I have a question regarding uh the

825
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:01,980
particular customers of Vera codes and

826
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:04,080
at potentially this information is

827
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:06,060
missing from your data set but do you

828
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:08,240
have an understanding of

829
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:11,280
these applications were used with high

830
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,900
volumes of users or if these were

831
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:15,660
perhaps even like just minor

832
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:17,820
applications that have slightly

833
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:20,040
collected your data set there

834
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,900
um it's a pivoted question I apologize

835
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:26,099
but look we don't have any data on what

836
00:35:26,099 --> 00:35:28,200
how their user who who they are used by

837
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:30,240
just how critical they are for the

838
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:33,078
