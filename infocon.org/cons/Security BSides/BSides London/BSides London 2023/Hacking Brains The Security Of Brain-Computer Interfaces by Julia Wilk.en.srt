00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:05,520
hello hi everyone

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,799
um I'm Julia and I'm a computer science

3
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:10,260
student and I'm currently on my

4
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:12,599
placement here with Airbus as a cyber

5
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:15,420
security research intern and today I

6
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:16,980
would like to talk to you about some

7
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:18,600
interesting things that I have learned

8
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,939
about brain computer interfaces and

9
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:22,800
their security

10
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,140
so I'll start with a quick explanation

11
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:28,320
of how and why this technology works so

12
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,720
the things that you can see here smell

13
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,239
taste and experience are caused by

14
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:35,520
neurons in your brain firing in a

15
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,160
certain pattern so if we could record

16
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,440
that pattern and then replay it in your

17
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,780
brain you could potentially experience

18
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:44,460
these things without physically

19
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:46,620
experiencing them and this may

20
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:49,020
eventually allow for for example fully

21
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:51,660
immersed virtual reality

22
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:54,620
and it also works the other way around

23
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:57,059
if we could observe the way that

24
00:00:57,059 --> 00:00:59,100
someone's neurons fire we could know

25
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,199
what it is that they are experiencing or

26
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:03,539
what they are currently thinking so this

27
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:05,700
is what the brain computer interfaces or

28
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:08,820
bcis do they allow for bi-directional

29
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:10,380
connection between the brain's

30
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:12,240
electrical activity and the computer

31
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,000
which allows for both stimulating the

32
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,780
brain and recording its activity

33
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:20,880
now for a few quick words about the

34
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,520
history of bcis

35
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,500
um they started in the 20s with the

36
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,540
discovery of the EEG and first

37
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:30,420
recordings of the brain's activity

38
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:34,080
in the 70s EEG was used to allow a

39
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,360
person to move an object through a maze

40
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,640
on a computer screen using only their

41
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,140
faults

42
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:43,920
and in 2002 a blind individual was able

43
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,900
to slowly drive around the parking lot

44
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:48,540
using some of his restored Vision after

45
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:51,180
being implanted with a BCI which is the

46
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:53,579
camera that was mounted on his glasses

47
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:56,040
to record the environment and then

48
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,020
translated into signals that were sent

49
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:00,360
to his brain and that produced

50
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,820
sensations of seeing lights and Shades

51
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:04,740
of Gray

52
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:08,639
in 2005 the first person controlled a

53
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:11,099
robotic Khan using a BCI which you can

54
00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:12,840
see on the photo I think was called the

55
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,840
brain Gates and based on which area of

56
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,760
the brain fired up when the person was

57
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,280
thinking about moving their real arm the

58
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,020
machine knew how to move the robotic

59
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:23,940
hand

60
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:27,300
and 2021 monkeys could play video games

61
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:30,300
using only their minds and in this case

62
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:32,819
it was the game of punk and they used a

63
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:34,530
wireless BCI

64
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:36,480
[Music]

65
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,360
and currently bcis are used to control

66
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,940
prosthetic limbs to restore some hearing

67
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:44,760
of a Cochlear implants to estos a vision

68
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,680
of a retinal implants

69
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,840
or to allow paralyzed people to

70
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,180
communicate words using only their brain

71
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:52,430
activity

[Music]

73
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,040
and it's even possible to record

74
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,140
someone's brain activity while they are

75
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:00,180
watching a video and then using only

76
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,400
those recorded brain signals you could

77
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,379
recreate the video that they've watched

78
00:03:04,379 --> 00:03:06,780
using the most closely matching YouTube

79
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:08,450
clips

80
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:09,739
[Music]

81
00:03:09,739 --> 00:03:13,260
in terms of Hardware bcis range from

82
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:15,239
non-invasive to highly invasive

83
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:18,060
Solutions with the accuracy usually

84
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:20,519
increasing with invasiveness because the

85
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:22,500
closer you can get to the neurons the

86
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,360
more accurate it can be

87
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:27,239
and some of the least invasive are EEG

88
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:30,300
which is an array of electrodes that

89
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:32,280
goes on top of your head but it can only

90
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,920
record a broad average of neurons in an

91
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:35,760
area

92
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,879
a more accurate one is ecog or

93
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:41,040
electrocorticography

94
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,860
and just like EEG it uses surface

95
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:46,379
electrodes but in this case they go

96
00:03:46,379 --> 00:03:49,200
under your skull on top of the brain

97
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,940
and one of the

98
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:54,000
most invasive ones is a multi-electrode

99
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,879
array which instead of surface electrode

100
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:59,819
uses microarray electrodes and those are

101
00:03:59,819 --> 00:04:01,860
like tiny little needles that stick

102
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:04,940
inside of your brain

103
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:07,319
so invasiveness is one of the biggest

104
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:09,360
challenges since you don't want to mess

105
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,400
around with people's brains and drill

106
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,260
big holes in their skulls and I think

107
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:15,239
it's usually preferable to not have to

108
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:16,978
walk around with something big sticking

109
00:04:16,978 --> 00:04:18,478
out of your brain

110
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:20,699
so in order for this technology to take

111
00:04:20,699 --> 00:04:22,560
off the invasiveness will probably need

112
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,550
to decrease

113
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:25,380
[Music]

114
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:27,240
and there are some companies working to

115
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,639
address this issue for example on the

116
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:31,919
left you can see neuraling and the

117
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:34,500
surgical robot which could allegedly

118
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:37,860
make implanting bcis as easy as Lasik

119
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:40,740
eye surgery in a few years and the robot

120
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:42,060
was also designed to look

121
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:44,180
non-intimidating

122
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:47,100
on top right you can see neural dust

123
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:50,280
which are tiny Wireless sensors that

124
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,380
could be sprinkled in different areas of

125
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:53,400
the brain

126
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:56,940
oh we also have stent roads and it's a

127
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:59,820
BCI that goes in your vein and that it's

128
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:02,100
pushed to the veins in your brain where

129
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:03,660
it unwinds

130
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:05,759
and that avoids having to make holes in

131
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:07,800
the skull even though it still sounds

132
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,900
quite invasive

133
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:12,479
and as Sanders was actually implanted in

134
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,880
two people successfully who lost the

135
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,360
ability to move the arms and using that

136
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,580
BCI they could use their faults to

137
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:22,919
communicate with a computer in order to

138
00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:25,620
text send emails and online shopping and

139
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:27,720
online banking

140
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,800
foreign

141
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,720
but another challenge for this

142
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,020
technology is security vcis can directly

143
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:36,120
read from someone's brain or stimulate

144
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,800
the brain and you can probably imagine

145
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,800
some bad scenarios that can occur if

146
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,320
their security could be compromised

147
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,300
so there are a lot of potential future

148
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,940
users or pcis that sound quite sci-fi

149
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:51,000
and futuristic such as fully immersed VR

150
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,880
or controlling robotic bodies all direct

151
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:56,460
brain to brain communication but the

152
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:58,860
fast user pcis and in fact their current

153
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:02,300
use is as medical devices

154
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:06,060
and bcis are still in their infancy but

155
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:07,680
there are some widely used medical

156
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,259
devices that connect your body to a

157
00:06:10,259 --> 00:06:12,419
computer and allow for both reading and

158
00:06:12,419 --> 00:06:13,740
stimulation

159
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:16,440
and an example of that are pacemaker

160
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,960
implants in the UK there are thousands

161
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,060
of these devices implanted every year

162
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:23,520
and they can record the heart and send

163
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,639
electrical impulses to it these devices

164
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:29,400
store data about the heart rate of the

165
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,620
users and there are some ethical and

166
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:35,419
privacy concerns that come with it

167
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,780
for example data from a pacemaker was

168
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:41,819
used to convict amount of insurance

169
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:45,600
frauds after his house burned down and

170
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,759
what happened was that the man claimed

171
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:50,160
that during the fire he packed a

172
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,020
suitcase with his items broke his

173
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:54,120
bedroom window and threw the suitcase

174
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:57,319
outside and police in the United States

175
00:06:57,319 --> 00:07:00,479
accessed his pacemaker data and the

176
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:02,520
cardiologist reviewed his heart rate for

177
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:05,639
signs of exertion during that time and

178
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:07,800
they concluded that his version of

179
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,840
events was highly improbable and that

180
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,580
was one of the key pieces of evidence

181
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:15,979
used to charge him with frauds

182
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:19,560
so even with BCI technology being in its

183
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,840
infancy there is already a lot of data

184
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,240
that you can learn about someone just by

185
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,099
looking at their brain signals for

186
00:07:26,099 --> 00:07:28,620
example with the use of EEG you could

187
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:30,960
partially extract someone's pin number

188
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,060
by showing them different combinations

189
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:35,220
and recording their brain signals in

190
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:37,259
response to it

191
00:07:37,259 --> 00:07:40,080
by recording brain signals you could

192
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,759
tell things like whether someone is

193
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:43,259
religious or not

194
00:07:43,259 --> 00:07:45,660
and it can also reveal your mood or

195
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:47,099
whether you're attracted to the person

196
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:48,479
that you're looking at

197
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,639
so there's a lot of extremely personal

198
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,979
data that could be recorded and stored

199
00:07:52,979 --> 00:07:56,099
and once pcis are less invasive and more

200
00:07:56,099 --> 00:07:57,660
widely used it could be done

201
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:00,170
continuously throughout the day

202
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:01,979
[Music]

203
00:08:01,979 --> 00:08:04,199
another security concern is remote

204
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:06,960
access which is often necessary with

205
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,940
medical devices because you usually

206
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:10,979
can't just put the device in and forget

207
00:08:10,979 --> 00:08:13,440
about it it might need to receive

208
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,960
firmware updates and needs to be able to

209
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:19,020
be turned off in case it malfunctions it

210
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:21,139
might need to send some data to your GP

211
00:08:21,139 --> 00:08:23,940
or it might need remote monitoring

212
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:25,560
access to make sure that it's working

213
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,780
properly

214
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:30,539
as an example of a BCI receiving

215
00:08:30,539 --> 00:08:33,240
receiving a firmware update there is a

216
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,520
commercial retinal implant called Argus

217
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,979
II which can restore some Vision to its

218
00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:39,779
users using a camera mounted on the

219
00:08:39,779 --> 00:08:42,240
glasses and the device originally only

220
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,180
provided black and white Vision but it

221
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:47,040
received a firmware update which

222
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,080
upgraded the vision to seeing colors and

223
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,930
increased the resolution

224
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:53,519
[Music]

225
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:56,220
or another example are some pacemakers

226
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:58,860
which use Bluetooth to send data about

227
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:01,860
your heart rates to a smartphone app and

228
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:03,899
the app can send nightly reports to the

229
00:09:03,899 --> 00:09:05,700
GP using Wi-Fi

230
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:09,420
so most medical devices including bcis

231
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:11,640
need some way of wireless communication

232
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:14,339
and remote access and with that there

233
00:09:14,339 --> 00:09:16,440
are many potential vulnerabilities that

234
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,310
will need to be considered

235
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:19,980
[Music]

236
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:23,040
in a paper from 2019 researchers

237
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,080
considered security of specifically

238
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:28,019
brain computer interfaces and identified

239
00:09:28,019 --> 00:09:30,000
potential attacks

240
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,940
the bad news is is that there is a lot

241
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:35,519
of potential attacks but the good news

242
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:37,620
is is that we're already familiar with

243
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:39,720
most of them because they apply to other

244
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:42,660
already existing computer systems for

245
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:45,120
example replay attacks buffer overflow

246
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,120
or battery drain attacks and that means

247
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,620
that we have already developed the

248
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:51,540
countermeasures to these attacks for

249
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:53,820
example anomaly detection based on

250
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:56,750
machine learning or input validation

00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:58,260
[Music]

252
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:00,420
another potential attack is an

253
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:02,580
adversarial attack there are devices

254
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:06,120
called BCI spellers which use EEG to

255
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,220
record brain activity in people who

256
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:10,620
might have lost the ability to speak and

257
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:12,240
then they use that activity to display

258
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,820
words on a screen that the person wants

259
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:17,880
to say using machine learning and a

260
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:20,820
study from 2020 showed thus that these

261
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:23,100
devices are vulnerable to adversarial

262
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:25,560
attacks where an adversary can add small

263
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:28,380
noise to EEG signals which can mislead

264
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:30,360
the device to spell anything that an

265
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,430
attacker wants

266
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:33,800
[Applause]

267
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,940
so there are a lot of potential

268
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:38,100
vulnerabilities in bcis that will need

269
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,260
to be addressed as those devices become

270
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:41,880
more widespread

271
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:44,040
in terms of widely used medical devices

272
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:46,920
such as insulin pumps in 2011 at the

273
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:49,079
conference a hacker shown that he could

274
00:10:49,079 --> 00:10:51,000
remotely hack insulin pumps and make

275
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,120
them deliver little doses to patients

276
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,760
and in 2013 the same hakai was about to

277
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,800
reveal how to remotely kill pacemaker

278
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,899
patients he claimed that he could send

279
00:11:00,899 --> 00:11:02,700
high voltage shock from a 50 feet

280
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:05,279
distance however he died one week before

281
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:07,500
presenting it at the conference

282
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,420
so these examples show that medical

283
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:11,459
devices are not immune to attacks by

284
00:11:11,459 --> 00:11:13,440
hackers and if a device can access your

285
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,420
brain that provides some opportunities

286
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:18,120
for serious damage

287
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,040
so what makes it difficult to implement

288
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,959
Security in brain computer interfaces

289
00:11:21,959 --> 00:11:24,360
and other medical devices one of the

290
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,220
reasons is that changes to the software

291
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:28,200
of medical devices might require getting

292
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,839
it re-certified by for example the FDA

293
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:32,399
and that's why they don't usually

294
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:34,500
receive regular software updates like

295
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:37,260
smartphones or self-driving cars too

296
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:39,360
another reason is that there is a

297
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,800
trade-off between the device being

298
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,079
closed off from access and a device

299
00:11:43,079 --> 00:11:45,060
being able to be accessed quickly by

300
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:46,860
medical professionals in case of an

301
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:47,940
emergency

302
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:49,740
and one more reason is that adding

303
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:51,720
security measures such as expensive

304
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,880
cryptographic operations could mean

305
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,620
increasing power consumption which

306
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:57,890
already has to be very limited

307
00:11:57,890 --> 00:11:59,399
[Music]

308
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:02,040
so in general I think that bcis are very

309
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:04,019
exciting and promising technology with

310
00:12:04,019 --> 00:12:06,540
the potential to improve lives but a lot

311
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:08,399
of care and consideration will need to

312
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:10,380
be taken to address the various security

313
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:12,899
concerns what this makes me think about

314
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:15,480
is security by design for example the

315
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,700
internet was not expected to take off

316
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,620
the way it did and it was not design of

317
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:22,260
security in mind but with bcis we have

318
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:24,120
the advantage of knowing what types of

319
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,399
attacks to expect and what we need to

320
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:28,620
prepare for and we also know that they

321
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:31,560
will be used for medical purposes so we

322
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:32,760
know that there will be a risk of

323
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,380
someone getting hurt if they're not

324
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:35,820
secure enough

325
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:37,740
and in terms of the direction of

326
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:39,720
research there is an immediate

327
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,120
commercial reward for making bcis more

328
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:44,399
reliable or faster but it might not be

329
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,380
as immediately advantageous to make them

330
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:47,519
more secure

331
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:49,380
and when I talk to other people in the

332
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:51,300
cyber security Community most of them

333
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:53,279
have not had very much about brain

334
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:55,860
computer interfaces and my hope is that

335
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:57,300
if there is more cyber Security

336
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:00,120
Professionals interested in bcis then

337
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,500
there will be more research in the

338
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:04,200
security of these devices so I hope that

339
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,060
you have found this talk interesting and

340
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:08,479
thank you

341
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:15,199
thank you

342
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:18,199
any questions

343
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,839
hey a really nice talk really good quite

344
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:22,860
a few things

345
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:25,019
um it's a bit of a dystopian question I

346
00:13:25,019 --> 00:13:26,459
think you mentioned

347
00:13:26,459 --> 00:13:28,620
um that with one of the implants it

348
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:30,240
blocks the person being able to move

349
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,639
their arm is that correct it could it

350
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:34,560
could interact with the brain in such a

351
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,380
way that it could uh sort of I don't

352
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:40,320
know change signals or my ultimate

353
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,940
question being did you see a future

354
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:43,980
where someone had an implant that would

355
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:46,019
they would actually if they were hacked

356
00:13:46,019 --> 00:13:48,060
they would you know be able to overpower

357
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:50,519
the brain bit of free will like even if

358
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:52,079
I didn't want to move my arm if somebody

359
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:54,600
had the right access they could you know

360
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,579
trigger the electrical signal synapses

361
00:13:56,579 --> 00:14:01,219
to make me go and do something like that

362
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:01,880
um

363
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:04,680
potentially yes I believe that the way

364
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,720
they work right now is that you don't

365
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,180
use any different part of your brain you

366
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:10,440
just use the same part that you would

367
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,779
use thinking about moving your arm only

368
00:14:12,779 --> 00:14:16,019
it goes into your prosthetic arm and

369
00:14:16,019 --> 00:14:18,000
that arm knows to move that same way so

370
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,500
you don't use a different part of your

371
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:20,399
brain

372
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:22,260
and yeah there's quite a lot of

373
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:24,839
potential scary scenarios that could be

374
00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:26,880
a script of a Black Mirror episode I'm

375
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,100
sure

376
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:30,899
that's it so yeah they sound very

377
00:14:30,899 --> 00:14:32,459
futuristic but I think it's something

378
00:14:32,459 --> 00:14:34,320
worth considering because the technology

379
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,779
is getting their hands yeah thank you

380
00:14:36,779 --> 00:14:39,000
thank you

381
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,240
foreign

382
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:45,000
so a couple of questions sorry I'm

383
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,980
really cheeky first I've just happened

384
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:48,839
just why everybody so what does your

385
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:50,160
Airbus have

386
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,220
um what is their interest in this field

387
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:54,959
and secondly

388
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:57,300
um from you personally so is your

389
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:59,399
interest more in the security element of

390
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:00,899
it or obviously is it just because it's

391
00:15:00,899 --> 00:15:03,240
besides you're speaking more to that or

392
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,519
is yours more broadly about this kind of

393
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:08,120
human computer oh sorry brain computer

394
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:10,620
uh connectivity piece like what's your

395
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:13,139
kind of specific

396
00:15:13,139 --> 00:15:17,839
um interest in it be Airbus interesting

397
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:21,959
oh

398
00:15:21,959 --> 00:15:23,880
and what I know

399
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,680
at least what I'm working on right now

400
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,600
at Airbus is not related to brain

401
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,339
computer interfaces it's just an

402
00:15:29,339 --> 00:15:31,560
interest that they have and they let me

403
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,480
come here as a part of an intern

404
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,100
development program so I'm not working

405
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,139
on it currently

406
00:15:37,139 --> 00:15:39,540
um and your next question

407
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:41,579
um yeah my main interest is not

408
00:15:41,579 --> 00:15:43,260
specifically the security of them it's

409
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:44,579
one of many things that I think are

410
00:15:44,579 --> 00:15:47,579
important but what interests me the most

411
00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:50,100
about BC pies I think is just a

412
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:52,620
potential future possibilities I feel

413
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:54,240
that they could really improve human

414
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,519
lives there is of course risk of things

415
00:15:56,519 --> 00:15:58,260
going wrong

416
00:15:58,260 --> 00:15:58,920
um

417
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,839
but yeah I think what excites me the

418
00:16:00,839 --> 00:16:03,060
most is what could happen and what life

419
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:05,339
could be once those things are available

420
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:08,519
and also secure so yeah

421
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:11,160
does that answer your question

422
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,680
thank you

423
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:16,160
thank you very much
