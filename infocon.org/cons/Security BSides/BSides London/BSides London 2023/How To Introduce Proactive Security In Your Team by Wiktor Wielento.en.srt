1
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:06,120
so as many of you probably heard

2
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:08,940
security can look at it like this

3
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:11,880
that's right a dumpster fire and in many

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:14,099
ways that's true we do have problems in

5
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:16,680
the industry we often get locked into a

6
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:19,560
panic mindset where we only look for

7
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,439
when an incident is gonna happen and

8
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:24,359
that's the conventional way to go about

9
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:28,080
it and it can it is great but can miss a

10
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,380
lot of stuff so let's flip it let's be

11
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:33,840
the ones looking for trouble this time

12
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,120
let me introduce you to threat hunting

13
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:39,059
it is a proactive security measure where

14
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:42,180
we assume a sophisticated attacker has

15
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:44,940
evaded our tools and is present in the

16
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:47,219
network and that means sorting through

17
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:50,280
tons and tons of data I mean a lot of

18
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:53,219
data this cannot be understated and this

19
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:55,320
is why originally it's a domain of

20
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,600
larger organizations with big budgets

21
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,879
who can deal with this sort of thing

22
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:02,719
six months ago I started work on

23
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:04,799
implementing a thread hunting program

24
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,799
and since then I've distilled some

25
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:09,840
principles from my experience and

26
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,000
research that I think I think we can all

27
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,119
apply no matter the budget

28
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:18,119
so imagine a scenario you are browsing

29
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:19,920
through Twitter and you see a company

30
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,619
you follow has been hacked there is a

31
00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:24,960
fire in the neighborhood how can you

32
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,119
take a proactive approach to check for

33
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:29,880
similar activity in your network we need

34
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,680
to assume some things

35
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,840
you add an article and learn that the

36
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,299
particular vulnerability was used can

37
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:38,939
the same attack be used against you this

38
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:41,119
is how a hypothesis is born

39
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:43,439
hypothesis I used to narrow down the

40
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:46,200
scope of the hand and help Hunters sort

41
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,780
through all of the data having a good

42
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:51,840
hypothesis can make or break the hand so

43
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,880
how can we be sure we can nail the

44
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,220
making the hypothesis

45
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:59,159
we can use Knowledge from three domains

46
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:01,680
first one being your own knowledge

47
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,380
this can be awareness of security flaws

48
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:06,719
in the products use good knowledge of

49
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:10,080
most common attack vectors or anomaly

50
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,340
observed

51
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:15,000
the other one is knowledge of others so

52
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,280
I mentioned that Twitter post before and

53
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,260
that's a one of many great ways of

54
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:21,319
positioning it gathering information

55
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:24,959
another can be subscribing to a threat

56
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:27,060
intelligence feed but those can be

57
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:29,220
really expensive

58
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:31,379
uh if you don't have a budget for that

59
00:02:31,379 --> 00:02:34,860
just do me go make your own so create an

60
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:37,500
RSS feed and gather a bunch of blogs or

61
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,480
websites you follow

62
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:42,780
to look at every day and stay on top of

63
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:44,400
things

64
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,560
the last domain is the knowledge of the

65
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,480
environment and this one really comes

66
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,940
with experience the more you experience

67
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:53,819
the the network you're working with the

68
00:02:53,819 --> 00:02:56,400
longer you uh you look at the logs from

69
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,440
the network the Mario the more

70
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:01,500
similarities you will see you will get

71
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,420
to know the roles of different users

72
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:06,239
what times they log in what they do on

73
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:07,580
the systems

74
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:10,260
combining all of those domain I

75
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:12,180
acknowledge from all of those domain can

76
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:15,060
make can mean making a great great

77
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:17,819
hypothesis that can help cut down on the

78
00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:20,280
amount of data you need to process okay

79
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,800
so you've done some brainstorming you

80
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,260
probably have a few hypotheses so no

81
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:26,340
word

82
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:28,500
well first we need to know what we're

83
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,440
working with so how do we get your data

84
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,420
do you have to visit a few different

85
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:36,120
places to get the logs you need this can

86
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:39,239
mean this can make it hard to make

87
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:42,480
contacts if the logs are siled off in a

88
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,640
bunch of different applications it can

89
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,040
be really hard to distinguish between

90
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,860
when a certain event happened and the

91
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:51,599
the next one next one in a different

92
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:54,540
tool in this case I would suggest

93
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:57,000
starting with getting a CM or an

94
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,980
alternative that can help congregate

95
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:02,459
your logs into one place so after we

96
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:04,620
gather the logs we know where to get the

97
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:07,440
information we need so how do we get

98
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:10,260
know if we are logging enough and I know

99
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:12,239
what you're thinking logs are really

100
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:14,819
expensive as it is Splunk is already

101
00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:18,120
killing your budget but hear me out I

102
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,519
think we can strike a balance

103
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:23,220
one of the great ways to do that is

104
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:26,460
mapping your log sources to miter attack

105
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:30,360
by doing that you can assess how your

106
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,979
logs correspond to a particular

107
00:04:31,979 --> 00:04:34,440
technique and this can be done even in a

108
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:38,040
simple Excel spreadsheet by by mapping

109
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:41,720
those you can you can strike a balance

110
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:45,120
and lock the techniques you carry the

111
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,400
most while letting go of some others

112
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:50,400
that you may not find as important

113
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,560
you can also use official logging

114
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,320
recommendation for from vendors they

115
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,060
have some information on their websites

116
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:00,000
of how of word logs makes the most

117
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,460
security sense

118
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:04,020
so

119
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:06,479
remember that attackers can also linger

120
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:08,759
in your environments for months so we

121
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:10,380
need to strike a balance in terms of

122
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:12,780
retention as well try to involve some

123
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:14,699
other departments like compliance or

124
00:05:14,699 --> 00:05:18,840
maybe finance and just think of a way of

125
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:22,380
how you can make everyone happy and have

126
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:25,199
a good retention time so you can get the

127
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,380
looks even if they happened a while ago

128
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:31,199
okay so we are making progress we know

129
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:33,600
where to find the looks and we know what

130
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,940
techniques we can detect so what comes

131
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:38,699
next well we need to make some context

132
00:05:38,699 --> 00:05:41,100
different vendors can present the same

133
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:43,620
event in a slightly different context

134
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:46,139
for example One log Source can have an

135
00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:49,139
IP but another can have a username so

136
00:05:49,139 --> 00:05:51,120
how can we piece them together

137
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,000
it takes a lot of work but when done

138
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,039
right it improves data consistency

139
00:05:56,039 --> 00:05:59,039
allowing more complex analytics it also

140
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:01,740
standardizes indicator names which means

141
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:03,479
you don't have to keep guessing if a

142
00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:05,940
destination AP is called destination

143
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:08,940
desp or maybe something completely

144
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:09,780
different

145
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:12,300
luckily there exists open source

146
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:15,120
security data models I will point to

147
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,880
some of them in my resources and they

148
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,919
also all the slide offers slightly

149
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:22,800
different flavors so just after doing

150
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,780
some research pick the one that you feel

151
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:27,300
most comfortable using

152
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:30,120
okay so after you find the model you

153
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,880
like we have the context we are ready to

154
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,860
take a look at what's going on

155
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:38,220
so let's take a step back how do we even

156
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:40,680
know if what we find is malicious after

157
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,660
all we are looking for that one percent

158
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:45,360
of threads that's lived by our security

159
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,840
tools well we need to find areas where

160
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:51,360
things could happen and every model who

161
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,280
will help us determine if that's the

162
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,120
case

163
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,699
we can start building awareness of what

164
00:06:56,699 --> 00:06:59,160
is expected in our environment and there

165
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,500
are many practical ways of doing that

166
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:04,199
you could for example take two assets

167
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:06,240
and assume they are free from any

168
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,280
malware and just take a look at traffic

169
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10,740
between them similarly some simulate

170
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:13,139
some activity try to note what happens

171
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:16,080
what looks are being generated and that

172
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,080
applies to both machines and users take

173
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,060
a look look at the users of those

174
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:24,539
systems what roles do they perform what

175
00:07:24,539 --> 00:07:27,660
what hours do they normally log in at

176
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:29,819
knowledge of the domains can really come

177
00:07:29,819 --> 00:07:32,220
in handy too do you see any security

178
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:34,380
risks in the workforce that the users

179
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:36,900
are doing you can be extra thorough in

180
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,400
those areas and start building some

181
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,319
documentation around that

182
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,599
and that will kind of did that will lead

183
00:07:42,599 --> 00:07:45,180
you to baselining the environment a

184
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:47,160
baselining is establishing how traffic

185
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,319
looks like when it's business as usual

186
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:51,120
as usual

187
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,759
when you look at when you know what logs

188
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,860
look like when no incident is happening

189
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:58,380
when something goes wrong you will

190
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:00,539
definitely spot that

191
00:08:00,539 --> 00:08:03,060
start to ID any anomalies you see in the

192
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:05,280
logs what do they mean where do they

193
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,620
come from start looking into them and

194
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:09,300
making documentation

195
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:11,400
by this point you are started to

196
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,380
organize hands and disregard any

197
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:15,660
irrelevant alerts

198
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:18,539
and remember it's not a job for one

199
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:20,879
person this is a lot of work and other

200
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:23,520
teams can also help for example if you

201
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,819
need to determine that your most

202
00:08:25,819 --> 00:08:30,860
important assets assets try to involve

203
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:34,679
compliance team or maybe a users of the

204
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:37,799
systems after after all they are the

205
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:39,659
ones who use it the daily

206
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:42,120
I rotate the schedule of doing the hands

207
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,520
involve others from your team this can

208
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:47,100
help build skills of others and keep

209
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:50,820
them involved in the newest threads

210
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:53,820
and be prepared to fail most of the

211
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:55,920
times you may not even find anything

212
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,800
malicious and your hands can get halted

213
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,019
by missing data or incorrect incorrect

214
00:09:01,019 --> 00:09:03,899
looks but just keep documenting it and

215
00:09:03,899 --> 00:09:06,120
even if you don't find a threat you will

216
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,700
find many misconfigurations that you

217
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:11,760
wouldn't normally focus on

218
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,240
and what might what might make sense to

219
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,640
you to others can look like this

220
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,740
and this is why documentation is really

221
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:20,820
important

222
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:23,940
uh how linear processes and document

223
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:26,459
everything that you do and after some

224
00:09:26,459 --> 00:09:28,920
time you'll be ready to start your

225
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:31,080
thread hunting program

226
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,779
so happy Hunting that was my

227
00:09:33,779 --> 00:09:36,000
presentation so I'm ready to take any

228
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,839
questions you have

229
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:46,920
hi can I imagine Mike stick your hand

230
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,640
off if you've got a question

231
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:54,180
hey thank you for that that was very

232
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:57,180
interesting um you mentioned in there

233
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:58,740
obviously most of the time the Fret

234
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:01,500
hunting team will find nothing what kind

235
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,060
of things would you

236
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:05,940
suggest doing I guess to prove to the

237
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:07,440
business that the threat hunting program

238
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,080
is worthwhile when it's not finding

239
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,660
anything most of the time

240
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:14,459
and this is why it's important to

241
00:10:14,459 --> 00:10:17,040
document everything and it can be done

242
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,620
in many different ways for example if

243
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,779
you are mapping logs log sources to

244
00:10:21,779 --> 00:10:23,760
miter attack techniques you could

245
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,160
demonstrate over time how

246
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,459
their map map the Lexus is your mapping

247
00:10:29,459 --> 00:10:32,100
are increases you are covering more and

248
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:35,660
more tactics as time goes on and also by

249
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:38,279
documenting your miscellaneous findings

250
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:40,680
like misconfigurations you can present

251
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:43,560
them in a presentation or just a

252
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:46,680
documentation in some one place where

253
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:47,700
the

254
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:48,360
um

255
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:51,180
upper level business people can take a

256
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:53,660
look at them

257
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:57,320
any more questions

258
00:10:58,110 --> 00:11:01,249
[Music]

259
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:09,920
no great well thank you very much Victor
