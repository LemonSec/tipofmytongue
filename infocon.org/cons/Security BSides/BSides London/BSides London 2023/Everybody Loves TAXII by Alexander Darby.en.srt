1
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:06,359
so uh hi everyone

2
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:08,700
um yeah my name's Alex I'm a software

3
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:11,460
engineer at PWC I work in the great

4
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:14,160
intelligence team and a lot of my job

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,320
recently has been about building a taxi

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,779
server since uh it looks like a lot of

7
00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:20,820
people love taxi so that's what this

8
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:22,980
talk is going to be about

9
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:25,740
um how how you build one and why it's

10
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:29,939
why it's cool so to kick things off the

11
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:31,859
not appreciate not everybody might be

12
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:33,780
familiar with taxi and sticks which are

13
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:35,160
the two things I'm going to focus on

14
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,860
today and this is kind of why I think

15
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:39,360
it's worth paying attention to and

16
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,940
hopefully might be of use to you so if

17
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:43,860
you're an analyst looking at

18
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:45,600
um alerts or maybe you work in something

19
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,120
like detection engineering taxi can be

20
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,800
your probably your friend because it

21
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,020
will help get uh threat intelligence

22
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:54,180
data into a scene so into something like

23
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:56,460
Splunk or something like Sentinel pretty

24
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:59,699
easily so you can get alerts on IPS URLs

25
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:00,840
things like that

26
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,699
the other thing which you might find

27
00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:04,319
quite helpful is that when you do get an

28
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:05,220
alert

29
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:07,320
you will with a taxi server get much

30
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,600
richer alert data so if you're thinking

31
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,600
of just the IP pinging an alert with a

32
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,939
taxi server you might also get what's

33
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:17,280
the confidence on that alert

34
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,560
um when is it valid until when's it from

35
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,180
things like that that are going to

36
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:23,759
hopefully help reduce alert fatigue make

37
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:25,860
your life a little bit easier and then

38
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:27,299
you're also going to get richer context

39
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:29,340
so again suppose you're in Sentinel you

40
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:31,200
get an alert picking up and it's your

41
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,240
job to figure out what do I do with this

42
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,579
is this important or not very easy in a

43
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:37,439
taxi server to then look at everything

44
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:40,020
else associated with that campaign so

45
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:42,060
from that IP you can get what are the

46
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,799
hashes associated with that attack

47
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:46,020
campaign what are the domains what are

48
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:48,360
the URLs and you can also then look up

49
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:51,060
some other richer data in the way I've

50
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:52,200
implemented This Server you could

51
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,399
straight away go to a threat

52
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:55,740
intelligence report so I think this is

53
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,420
cool it kind of flips the instead of

54
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:58,920
going from report to indicators you can

55
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,299
kind of go from indicator straight to

56
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:02,280
the context and that's all automated in

57
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:05,820
your scene so just to break down the two

58
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:08,098
main Concepts here our taxi which is an

59
00:02:08,098 --> 00:02:09,840
acronym for trusted automated exchange

60
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,360
of indicator information that obviously

61
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,680
sounds quite abstract I would think of

62
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,739
that as just how you share and send data

63
00:02:16,739 --> 00:02:18,060
to people

64
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:21,060
um and then you also need sticks which

65
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:23,640
is the format so if tax is how we share

66
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:26,640
and send data then sticks is the format

67
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,319
that we have to send the data in and

68
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:29,400
it's really just a way of making

69
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,560
indicators machine readable so say

70
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,780
you've got something like an IP how can

71
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:35,940
we kind of mix that up into a basically

72
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:38,099
a flavor of Json that means all

73
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:39,959
computers can read it the same way

74
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:41,940
that's still sounding

75
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:43,260
um a little bit abstract I'm going to

76
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:45,000
pop on to the slide after this to a more

77
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,459
concrete example but just a little bit

78
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:48,840
more on sticks that's down to the

79
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,400
structured threat information expression

80
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,440
and I would really think of it as a

81
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,360
serialization format so again just a

82
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:58,019
flavor of Json developed by Oasis

83
00:02:58,019 --> 00:02:59,879
um I think you're an American NGO that

84
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:02,280
made sticks with miter who will crop up

85
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,739
a little bit later in the talk so point

86
00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:06,120
being it's a kind of recognize

87
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,519
standardized format and then in Python

88
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:10,319
this is what it looks like to create an

89
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:12,599
indicator in sticks

90
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:14,400
um so here you're just instantiating a

91
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,239
class

92
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:17,040
giving it a bunch of keyword arguments

93
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,720
and this can all get

94
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,360
um exported basically as Json later and

95
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,620
you might see already here some of the

96
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:23,879
things I talked about that were called

97
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:27,120
for richer alerts so things like

98
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,099
um the valid from value when it was

99
00:03:29,099 --> 00:03:31,680
created when it was last modified and

100
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,940
then you can get things like a

101
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:34,739
description and a name you you can build

102
00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:36,599
on top of this and do many more complex

103
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:38,040
things have relationships between

104
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,780
different types of objects and sticks

105
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:42,599
give them TLP red values TLP Amber

106
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:44,519
values lots of kind of fun stuff

107
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:46,920
like that so now that hopefully all

108
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:49,019
makes sense just a quick recap sticks is

109
00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:51,360
the way we format the data taxi is how

110
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,400
we share it and send it to people in

111
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,140
about hopefully 12 minutes after my talk

112
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:56,519
I'm gonna run through how do you

113
00:03:56,519 --> 00:03:58,260
actually make this taxi is a very big

114
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:00,480
topic so this is going to be just the

115
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,799
tip of the iceberg but these are the

116
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:03,180
three main challenges I had in actually

117
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:05,459
implementing this so one was getting

118
00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:07,260
your data into sticks it might

119
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:08,580
experience a lot of organizations

120
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:10,500
probably have threat intelligence data

121
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,659
in quite an unstructured format

122
00:04:12,659 --> 00:04:14,340
probably you've dumped it into some kind

123
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:16,260
of no SQL database something like

124
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:18,180
something like elasticsearch that's

125
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:19,440
quite cool at the time if you're an

126
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,639
analyst you can just Chuck it in and

127
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,320
forget about it that's a real problem

128
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,060
though if you have my job and are trying

129
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:25,680
to get it into sticks sticks is very

130
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,139
opinionated and really needs a specific

131
00:04:28,139 --> 00:04:30,720
format that's challenge One Challenge

132
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,520
two say you've got you know 100

133
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,800
gigabytes of data to convert

134
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,259
um you you probably don't ideally you

135
00:04:37,259 --> 00:04:38,820
don't want to convert that and have to

136
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,020
store it in another database because

137
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:41,580
then you have to pay for that extra

138
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:45,060
database so a neat way of doing this is

139
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:46,740
you want to convert all the data from

140
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:49,199
sticks in something like elasticsearch

141
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:51,300
and do that on the fly so you can keep

142
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:52,919
your old database that presumably

143
00:04:52,919 --> 00:04:54,840
integrates all of your existing systems

144
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,120
you don't have to create a new one and

145
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,259
you can just send it straight into

146
00:04:58,259 --> 00:05:00,300
sticks but for that to work it has to be

147
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,220
pretty reliable because again remember

148
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:04,620
sticks is very opinionated and it's also

149
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:06,360
going to have to be performant because a

150
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,820
taxi server is at least in my case and

151
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:10,080
presumably most of them is going to be

152
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,100
something people are going to want to

153
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:12,780
hit fairly regularly if they're getting

154
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:14,940
it into something like Splunk or

155
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,620
something like Sentinel so how are you

156
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:18,300
going to do that so it scales and then

157
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:20,100
Challenge three you you by this point

158
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,660
you've only got stuff into sticks so we

159
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:23,759
haven't actually got it into taxi which

160
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:26,520
is the protocol for sharing stuff so

161
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,259
that's the kind of third one so I'm

162
00:05:28,259 --> 00:05:29,759
going to start just with that first

163
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:30,960
challenge how do you get stuff into

164
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,340
sticks

165
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:34,139
um this is a sort of made up example of

166
00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:35,520
the kind of thing I would deal with at

167
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,160
work this is what an elasticsearch

168
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,259
document roughly looks like so if you

169
00:05:40,259 --> 00:05:41,340
might have forgotten but if you remember

170
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:43,979
on the slide I was showing in sticks for

171
00:05:43,979 --> 00:05:46,320
producing a six object in Python that

172
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,880
looks pretty different to this first of

173
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,160
all we've got some nested keys under

174
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,639
that source source key there we've got a

175
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:55,620
bunch of keys like index and type that

176
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:57,360
don't exist in sticks

177
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,580
that ID string is actually not uuid

178
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:01,860
compliant it's pretty long so a whole

179
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:03,419
bunch of things we have to do that is

180
00:06:03,419 --> 00:06:05,280
going to come to convert this into

181
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,440
something reliable but we do have the

182
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,300
kind of data there in all the values

183
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,919
that we want to keep

184
00:06:10,919 --> 00:06:13,860
so pedantic is the python Library I'm

185
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:15,060
using here that I would really recommend

186
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:16,680
for this this does quite a good job of

187
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,180
solving challenges one and two getting

188
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:20,220
data into sticks and getting it done

189
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:22,680
reliably and in a way that can scale

190
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:26,220
the main reason is good for converting

191
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:28,199
stuff into sticks is that penalty does

192
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:30,419
something very cool which is that it

193
00:06:30,419 --> 00:06:33,360
makes python check types at runtime so

194
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,979
python normally is not a statically

195
00:06:34,979 --> 00:06:37,199
typed language but you can put in type

196
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:40,199
hints but when python

197
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:41,940
um starts running in a python

198
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:44,759
interpreter it doesn't check those type

199
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:46,919
hints if you use pedantic it does check

200
00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:48,419
the type hints which means we're going

201
00:06:48,419 --> 00:06:50,340
to get a lot more correctness that's

202
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:52,199
useful for sticks because we need stuff

203
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:54,419
to be reliably in sticks or it's going

204
00:06:54,419 --> 00:06:55,620
to break it's not going to work in the

205
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:57,780
taxi server and the other very cool

206
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:59,880
thing about um pedantic is that it is

207
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,860
super super performant so it really

208
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:03,840
solves that problem of doing things on

209
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,580
the Fly getting stuff straight out of

210
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:06,900
something like something like

211
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:09,600
elasticsearch into sticks remove the

212
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,660
need to create a new a new database and

213
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:15,600
then also you can see here uh in that

214
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,699
that validated decorated method there

215
00:07:17,699 --> 00:07:19,680
you can do quite a lot of pre-processing

216
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,900
so it um will help you convert stuff

217
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:24,419
into sticks for that that way too so

218
00:07:24,419 --> 00:07:26,880
we've now hopefully solved challenges

219
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,740
one and two getting stuff into sticks

220
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,900
reliably and at scale and now we have to

221
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:34,199
get it into taxi the taxi spec is very

222
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:36,060
very long I haven't counted the pages

223
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:38,160
I've just looked at the HTML website but

224
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,660
it's probably several hundred pages and

225
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:42,180
quite hard to read so I would basically

226
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:44,520
recommend don't read this back and

227
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:48,120
instead I would take some

228
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,800
uh take basically have a look at the

229
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,479
code on people who've written taxi

230
00:07:51,479 --> 00:07:53,940
servers so Oasis who came up with the

231
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:56,099
stick spec have got one called Medallion

232
00:07:56,099 --> 00:07:57,720
I would really recommend taking a look

233
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:01,020
at and then you can copy and paste the

234
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:03,479
responses from that server and write

235
00:08:03,479 --> 00:08:05,400
your taxi server until you hit those

236
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,560
responses so the idea here is Skip

237
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,060
reading the spec

238
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:10,919
basically take what you know are known

239
00:08:10,919 --> 00:08:14,160
good responses and then write your code

240
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,979
until it hits those and so that's

241
00:08:16,979 --> 00:08:19,979
basically what I'm doing here I have

242
00:08:19,979 --> 00:08:23,400
um here copied and pasted some responses

243
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,620
from manifest query responses which are

244
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:27,599
part of the taxi protocol from someone

245
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:30,840
else's server I know they're good and

246
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,080
then I've just written a test Suite here

247
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:37,020
that hits those endpoints on my server

248
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:38,880
and I just wrote this until these tests

249
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,740
passed that has all the tests on my

250
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:42,179
taxes ever so there's a few things we

251
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:44,520
don't need but really the idea here is

252
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,860
you can save a lot of time and you also

253
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,300
get to call yourself a test driven

254
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:49,740
developer this is test driven

255
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:51,600
development and then if you get into

256
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,899
trouble later you can go and read the

257
00:08:54,899 --> 00:08:56,760
spec and and debug things but I

258
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,019
personally found this a lot a lot more

259
00:08:58,019 --> 00:09:01,200
fun and a lot faster so now we've kind

260
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,240
of got an idea of how we can get stuff

261
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,519
into sticks and share it in taxi what

262
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:07,200
does this actually look like if you're a

263
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,880
customer

264
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,200
um the the bit I was saying at the start

265
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,640
how do we get rich alerts with more

266
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,140
context what's it like to actually use

267
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:15,420
what's the point of this and so this is

268
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:17,760
in Sentinel what it would look like if

269
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,040
you're adding a taxi server so if you go

270
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,899
into Sentinel

271
00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:24,060
um you then go to data connectors page

272
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:27,120
from there you can pick taxi and it's

273
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,160
pretty simple you just have to put in

274
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,560
these sort of four or five values the

275
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,540
first one is um design you can come up

276
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:35,100
with I've just called it campaigns but

277
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:36,480
you could name it whatever you want to

278
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,480
remember it by and then taxi servers

279
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,880
typically use HTTP basic auth you can

280
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,339
change the auth method if you want but

281
00:09:44,339 --> 00:09:46,200
if you use that default makes life

282
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,120
pretty easy you just put the URL you

283
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,880
want to hit a username and a password

284
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,019
and then how often you want to pull the

285
00:09:52,019 --> 00:09:53,100
indicators

286
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,440
and really that's it so it should take

287
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,880
about two minutes to configure if you're

288
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,040
a customer and you built the taxi server

289
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,660
correctly for them

290
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:02,580
um and then what you get at the end is

291
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:04,440
is this this is what the view looks like

292
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:08,760
in Santa now so here on um uh my left

293
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:11,220
you're you're right you will see some of

294
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:13,860
that richer alert context hopefully

295
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:15,300
um you can see there's a confidence

296
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:17,399
value of 80 for that IP

297
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:19,680
you've got when it was created when it's

298
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,480
valid until

299
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,040
um there's a description value there

300
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,600
which is the name of the threat actor

301
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,640
that my team tracks for that IP but that

302
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,260
could be anything really that you want

303
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:29,760
to call it

304
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,800
um and then the other thing that is you

305
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:32,880
know the main thing that I think is

306
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,279
pretty cool here is if you see

307
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:37,320
on the on the far

308
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:40,140
um left of the screen the names those

309
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,000
names refer to our threat intelligence

310
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,220
reports those CTO tip values each one of

311
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:46,140
those is a unique identifier for a

312
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:49,200
report so if you want to pivot from that

313
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,420
IP suppose that IP is pinged an alert

314
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:53,940
and get the campaign that's associated

315
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:55,740
with you can literally just copy and

316
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:59,519
paste the CTO tip value for that IP into

317
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:02,160
Sentinel and then you'll be able to get

318
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,740
all the IPS URLs domains and hashes all

319
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:06,540
the indicators associated with that

320
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:09,000
campaign straight off the bat and then

321
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,560
if you're one of our clients you could

322
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,959
hit our API or hit our portal and read

323
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:15,899
the report and see what's in it so very

324
00:11:15,899 --> 00:11:18,660
very fast way to get context

325
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:20,519
um for for the person kind of monitoring

326
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:22,620
Sentinel that should make their life

327
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:26,459
a lot easier so that's kind of really

328
00:11:26,459 --> 00:11:28,019
what what we've built I'm just going to

329
00:11:28,019 --> 00:11:29,760
wrap things up now

330
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,220
um these are a couple of resources that

331
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:34,200
I was speaking about so the the first

332
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,300
two there are some example taxi servers

333
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:38,040
this is the bit where I would say just

334
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,540
keep reading the spec have a look at how

335
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:41,459
they've done it and and kind of write

336
00:11:41,459 --> 00:11:43,440
code until you hit their responses first

337
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,480
ones by Oasis who came up with the the

338
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,640
stick specs so very reliable that's the

339
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:51,060
one I used open taxi is also quite good

340
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:54,000
um they're sort of eclectic IQ team are

341
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,820
very good at Intel and then if you want

342
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:58,440
to look a bit more at sticks I would

343
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,180
recommend going to the examples there

344
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:02,339
and just having a look at stuff probably

345
00:12:02,339 --> 00:12:04,200
in Python I find that a bit easier than

346
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:07,440
reading the docs and just to summarize

347
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,660
the the three main challenges you have

348
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:11,880
in this uh how to get stuff into sticks

349
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:15,899
how to then convert that reliably and at

350
00:12:15,899 --> 00:12:18,779
scale and then how to get that all into

351
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:20,940
taxi that's quite a big job in itself to

352
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:22,500
get it into that protocol to share

353
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,339
things

354
00:12:23,339 --> 00:12:26,760
and that is about it for me thank you

355
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:29,540
very much for listening

356
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:35,760
[Applause]

357
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:39,560
and I guess anyone any questions

358
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:41,959
foreign

359
00:12:41,959 --> 00:12:44,820
thanks for the talk was interesting how

360
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:46,920
would you contrast something like sticks

361
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:49,620
to admire see in terms of showing for

362
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:51,420
intelligence information

363
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:53,579
um obviously admiracy is a bit older but

364
00:12:53,579 --> 00:12:55,500
there's a draft version of an updated

365
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:56,519
version

366
00:12:56,519 --> 00:12:57,959
um

367
00:12:57,959 --> 00:13:00,779
I I don't know that spec that well to be

368
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:03,300
honest I've mostly focused on sticks I I

369
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:04,440
guess the

370
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,240
the it seems to me that the benefit of

371
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,519
sticks is that it seems to be what a lot

372
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:11,040
of people want because you can integrate

373
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,519
it into Sentinel that's sort of been the

374
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:18,420
main use case for me at work that people

375
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:20,700
want a way to pull stuff in straight

376
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:23,220
away I I don't know if that's possible

377
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:25,079
without other format but I know that

378
00:13:25,079 --> 00:13:27,240
most of this seems that people are using

379
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,519
have a have a tax exactly the easiest

380
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:31,139
way to get it in and for that you have

381
00:13:31,139 --> 00:13:33,540
to use sticks so

382
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:34,980
um yeah so I don't really have a more

383
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,639
thorough answer

384
00:13:49,459 --> 00:13:53,239
there thank you very much
