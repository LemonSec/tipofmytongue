00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:16,240
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> aim of my talk today really it's got</font>

2
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:19,300
more to do with basically condensing

3
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:21,060
various rants<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I've had in pubs with</font>

00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:24,040
various people<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the code community</font>

over the last couple of years into<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

6
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:30,189
condensed ran to 30 minutes about how

7
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:33,250
customers do due diligence and how cloud

8
00:00:30,189 --> 00:00:35,110
vendors represent themselves so a little

9
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:37,630
bit about myself<font color="#E5E5E5"> I work for one of the</font>

10
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:39,610
uk's largest software as a service

11
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:42,160
vendors not going to mention their name

12
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:45,120
because it's I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> here to pitch I'm</font>

13
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:48,819
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> to tell you my experiences in the</font>

14
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:51,160
soft cloud security arena but<font color="#E5E5E5"> we are the</font>

15
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:53,500
second fastest growing tech company<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

16
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:56,080
Europe so we're quite successful as a

00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:58,000
European company<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm talking mainly from</font>

18
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:59,949
the SAS perspective you'll see that one

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">of my slides is talking about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the fact</font>

20
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:04,269
that the cloud is a very old encompasses

21
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,548
and in fact it seems to encompass

22
00:01:04,269 --> 00:01:08,680
everything at the moment from hosting

23
00:01:06,549 --> 00:01:10,840
vendors all the way down to actually

24
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:14,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">dropping something as a private cloud on</font>

25
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:15,820
your own premise but my perspective is

26
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:18,429
software<font color="#CCCCCC"> as a service because that's the</font>

27
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:20,529
background that I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> come from every</font>

00:01:18,429 --> 00:01:22,390
month<font color="#E5E5E5"> I conduct dozens of risk</font>

29
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:25,329
assessments from customers so I get some

30
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:27,999
idea of what customers want what they

31
00:01:25,329 --> 00:01:30,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">expect which are sometimes not always</font>

32
00:01:27,999 --> 00:01:33,969
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing and also my background is</font>

33
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:37,119
is an ISO 27001 lead auditor before I

34
00:01:33,969 --> 00:01:38,949
joined my current company the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

35
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:40,659
thing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> as always these are the</font>

36
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:41,979
opinions these are definitely<font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font>

37
00:01:40,659 --> 00:01:45,579
opinions and the whole tract of my

38
00:01:41,979 --> 00:01:46,899
employer and you know do not try these

39
00:01:45,579 --> 00:01:48,249
stunts are home I'm a trained

40
00:01:46,899 --> 00:01:52,030
professional and all that kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font>

41
00:01:48,249 --> 00:01:54,399
so the as<font color="#CCCCCC"> I said earlier one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

42
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:56,829
interesting things is the definition of

43
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:59,590
cloud computing cloud computing actually

44
00:01:56,829 --> 00:02:03,089
was in place<font color="#E5E5E5"> long before anyone tried to</font>

45
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:06,789
define it<font color="#E5E5E5"> so one of the largest and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> most</font>

46
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:08,679
sort of trusted definitions was created

47
00:02:06,789 --> 00:02:11,140
by nest and then taken up by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cloud</font>

48
00:02:08,679 --> 00:02:13,780
security alliance what you tend to see

49
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:15,730
is it's got<font color="#E5E5E5"> the three elements the</font>

50
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:17,920
service model like how it's delivered

51
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:19,599
software as a service platform as a

52
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,488
service infrastructure as a service

53
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:22,440
private cloud the essential

54
00:02:21,489 --> 00:02:24,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">characteristic</font>

55
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:27,780
elasticity and then the deployment

56
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:31,380
models blah blah blah blah<font color="#E5E5E5"> the problem</font>

57
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:34,080
with this is that the definitions are so

58
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:37,380
broad that almost everything is a cloud

59
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:39,390
so when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> start talking about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> climb</font>

60
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:41,450
due diligence and cloud computing and

61
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:44,579
you start<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get to people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ISA</font>

62
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:46,709
writing a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> good document of</font>

63
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:49,320
considerations customers<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to take</font>

64
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:51,600
into account when they're reviewing the

65
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:55,440
security of a cloud<font color="#E5E5E5"> service provider the</font>

66
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:57,810
problem is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a very broad set</font>

67
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,730
guidance and customers read this you

68
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:02,280
know a nice of document<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's 40 50</font>

69
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:03,750
pages long and they go I don't know one

70
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:06,000
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> buying platform as a service</font>

71
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:08,340
infrastructure as a service so<font color="#E5E5E5"> apart the</font>

72
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,380
problem is cloud computing is being used

73
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:12,570
by all sorts of vendors to pitch their

74
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:14,040
products so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at</font>

75
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:16,650
virtualization it's no longer

76
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:19,170
virtualization it's now a cloud enabler

77
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:21,060
and whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a you're a service</font>

78
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:24,179
provider or whether you are actually

79
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:26,489
deploying products<font color="#CCCCCC"> on-premise so this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

80
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:28,500
a part the problem that we really have

81
00:03:26,489 --> 00:03:32,670
to define what part of cloud computing

82
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:34,800
you're assessing the risk on so I mean

83
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:36,780
the inevitable thing is that people are

84
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:38,310
moving to the cloud it's happening you

85
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:41,820
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> even governments are looking at it</font>

86
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:44,010
now but I tend to see cloud customers is

87
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:46,019
like worried parents it's the first time

88
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:47,730
they've ever got a babysitter in yeah

89
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:49,440
and they go out for a nice meal they

90
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:51,119
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> enjoy themselves and then they</font>

91
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:53,130
spend the whole time on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> phone to the</font>

92
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,780
babysitter going is the kid all<font color="#CCCCCC"> right is</font>

93
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:56,850
the kid all right<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know is he always</font>

94
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:58,890
he got to sleep<font color="#CCCCCC"> a Z and things like that</font>

95
00:03:56,850 --> 00:04:01,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">so they want all the benefits of cloud</font>

96
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:03,059
computing but then they<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stop</font>

97
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:04,890
worrying<font color="#E5E5E5"> about their data in the cloud</font>

98
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:06,750
and that's even after they've done a

99
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:09,540
hideous amount of due diligence on the

100
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:11,130
cloud provider so the first thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd</font>

101
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:13,950
say<font color="#E5E5E5"> for anyone that's considering going</font>

102
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:17,159
into the cloud is it really sensible you

103
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:18,690
know classify your data and if you're

104
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:20,400
never going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be happy with it not</font>

105
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:22,260
being on servers you can go and kiss<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

106
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:25,140
hug<font color="#CCCCCC"> them cuddle and see noise flashy</font>

107
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:28,200
blinky lights don't put<font color="#E5E5E5"> it in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the crowd</font>

108
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:29,760
don't waste<font color="#CCCCCC"> my time you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in a day of</font>

109
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:31,469
my time filling out due diligence

110
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:34,140
questionnaire if you've deliberately

111
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:36,030
loaded it so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will never pass your</font>

112
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:38,039
due diligence let's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

113
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:40,169
this makeup hug and go in two separate

114
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:41,970
directions now so really<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is the</font>

115
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:44,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">most important thing classify your data</font>

116
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:46,920
what's<font color="#CCCCCC"> insensitivity what's his</font>

117
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:48,960
criticality you know whatchu RTO an RPO

118
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:51,690
of it for an availability perspective

119
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:53,669
and you know what would happen if<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

120
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:55,440
breached because that sets the tone for

121
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:57,260
the amount of due diligence that you

122
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,820
should do on the cloud service provider

123
00:04:57,260 --> 00:05:02,159
so we all know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that well governed</font>

124
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:04,740
organizations make all decisions yet

125
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:07,530
taken into account risk the fact that it

126
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:09,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">is the business people that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make me</font>

127
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:10,950
making the decisions move to the cloud

128
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:13,260
because they've got some photos on

129
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:14,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">Flickr and they suddenly think is a good</font>

130
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:18,030
idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> for all their corporate data in the</font>

131
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:19,800
cloud but I mean I was at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first UK</font>

132
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:22,619
cloud security alliance meeting the

133
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:24,930
other day and there were probably 200

134
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:27,540
people there and there were three cloud

135
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:29,730
vendors there were 120 consultants from

136
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:31,860
KPMG in accenture and everyone else

137
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:34,230
telling us how the perfect world<font color="#E5E5E5"> should</font>

138
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:38,220
work but the problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> is it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not really</font>

139
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:40,470
how businesses work so we all<font color="#CCCCCC"> know how</font>

140
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:42,390
many<font color="#E5E5E5"> organizations well governed we may</font>

141
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:46,070
work for one we have work for<font color="#E5E5E5"> one in the</font>

142
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:49,110
previous business the reality is most

143
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:50,909
organizations do not really make all of

144
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:53,820
their decisions based on risk and a

145
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:57,120
balance of risk so that's one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

153

they don't know about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the risks involved</font>

provider they go to their IT team and

157
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:23,219
their IT team don't really understand

00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:25,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">this they're not risk management people</font>

their security people we keep everything

00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:30,869
secure we stop external attacks what

161
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:32,640
they don't do is look at how much risk

162
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:34,710
is there and what we're currently doing

163
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:36,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">on-premise and how much risk does this</font>

164
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:38,099
service provider providers what are the

165
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:39,870
different kinds of risks and what is the

166
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:42,480
balance of risk between the two<font color="#CCCCCC"> of them</font>

167
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:43,830
what they do is I'll talk about later is

168
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:45,510
they count the amount of controls

169
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:47,099
they've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> on premise and then go to</font>

tackled the risk so as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mentioned</font>

174
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:58,650
earlier yeah they'd like to be able to

be made redundant by cloud computing so

182
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:16,350
the people of doing the risk assessment

<font color="#E5E5E5">of the cloud vendor all the people</font>

184
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:20,910
that's going to be made redundant if you

185
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:23,220
move to the cloud though I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know if</font>

186
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:25,440
that would tarnish your viewing with the

200

that is 3000 days of due diligence I

standard say you're managing a security

system and then there's a set of

controls which are not bigotry which you

may or may not use from a sister's down

we're not certified yet because that's

so far if 'ok amount of controls to put

288
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:29,940
e-commerce for<font color="#E5E5E5"> instance we don't do</font>

289
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:31,650
ecommerce so you know some of them

290
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:32,910
relate to outsource software development

291
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:34,650
we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> do out source software</font>

292
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:40,709
development so we get an X in that box

293
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:42,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">straightaway so 27001 it's great</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to work</font>

294
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:45,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">out for company has the security system</font>

295

<font color="#E5E5E5">in place for managing security assessing</font>

296
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,750
risk and things like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it's not a</font>

297
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:50,760
great standard to actually work out what

298
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:54,060
risks your data or facing within that

299
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:57,630
operator there's another standard you

300
00:11:54,060 --> 00:12:00,000
usually see SAS 70 now such 7c can be

301
00:11:57,630 --> 00:12:02,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually quite a good standard but the</font>

302
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,280
way most<font color="#E5E5E5"> people use it it isn't so SAS</font>

303
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:08,070
70 what you literally do is you write

304
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:09,930
control statements so it's up to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you you</font>

305
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:12,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">can write whatever you want so i can</font>

306
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:14,609
write<font color="#CCCCCC"> a control statement about how we</font>

307
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:16,589
on board employees how about we<font color="#E5E5E5"> review</font>

308
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:19,290
access control<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can choose whatever</font>

309
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:21,330
topics in a security scope that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i want</font>

310
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:23,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">to control statement then an external</font>

311
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:26,730
auditor comes in and just make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

312
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:28,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">i'm saying is true it's good standard</font>

313
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:31,110
from that perspective because I could

314
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:34,110
literally write a statement<font color="#E5E5E5"> about every</font>

315
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:35,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">single one of our 2700 to controls and</font>

316
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:37,410
then you would see how we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

317
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:39,150
doing them so it gives you a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit</font>

318
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:40,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">more transparency about how we're doing</font>

319
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:42,780
things internally and you get the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fact</font>

320
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:45,900
and auditors coming in order to dip the

321
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:48,420
problem is most SAS 70 only relates to a

322
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:50,130
very limited subset of controls which

323
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:52,410
are the finding the sarbanes-oxley<font color="#E5E5E5"> act</font>

324
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:55,530
because the requirements to conform to

325
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:57,569
sox 404 controls requires a SAS 70

326
00:12:55,530 --> 00:13:00,209
statement so if you're listed US company

327
00:12:57,570 --> 00:13:03,450
so the fact is SAS 70 is used in the

328
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:05,760
wrong way really<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're a UK company</font>

329
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:08,730
or global company it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very us centric</font>

330
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:11,100
as well and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> being removed soon</font>

331
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:13,530
being replaced by the stamp<font color="#E5E5E5"> address the</font>

332
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:16,950
envelope took a standard I don't know

333
00:13:13,530 --> 00:13:19,500
what it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> se so the thing is we've got</font>

334
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:22,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">me please to sort of standards that</font>

335
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:25,020
people using this yardstick to to test

336
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:27,140
this and they really don't work so what

337
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:28,290
we end up actually doing is answering a

338
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:30,509
very

339
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:33,149
young<font color="#CCCCCC"> RFP from every single customer</font>

340
00:13:30,509 --> 00:13:34,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">about every single possible control some</font>

341
00:13:33,149 --> 00:13:36,690
of which are completely in applicable

342
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:38,310
for us so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just want to give you some</font>

343
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:44,370
examples of some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the things that I've</font>

344
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:46,199
seen so one of the question is I

345
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:48,389
typically get is how would you limit

346
00:13:46,199 --> 00:13:51,689
physical access to your data centers

347
00:13:48,389 --> 00:13:53,310
where my data will be and then same

348
00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:56,220
questionnaire they'll say can I do at

349
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:59,130
all your data center so and as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

350
00:13:56,220 --> 00:14:04,019
mentioned<font color="#CCCCCC"> earlier a footfall of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 3,000</font>

351
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:05,939
you know or 300<font color="#E5E5E5"> 3,000 customers a year</font>

352
00:14:04,019 --> 00:14:07,319
doing an audit<font color="#E5E5E5"> on our data center you</font>

353
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:09,750
don't want those<font color="#E5E5E5"> walking through your</font>

354
00:14:07,319 --> 00:14:11,849
datacenter so the thing is nigga I can't

355
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:13,860
you just do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it for us you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know and</font>

356
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:16,350
everyone asks can't you<font color="#CCCCCC"> just do it for</font>

357
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:18,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">us so the thing is is they're asking</font>

358
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:20,160
things and they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> expecting things and</font>

359
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:23,399
then what they want to do is completely

360
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:25,860
contradictory to to what what they're

361
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:28,410
asking for so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not really security</font>

362
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:30,509
there are further after this yeah we

363
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:33,569
thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> about what they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want this is</font>

364
00:14:30,509 --> 00:14:36,180
another real life example I spent 45

365
00:14:33,569 --> 00:14:39,089
minutes on the phone to a customer we

366
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:40,920
have a proprietary distributed filing

367
00:14:39,089 --> 00:14:44,760
system that works on<font color="#E5E5E5"> a grid which has</font>

368
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:47,490
inherent encryption and I spent 45

369
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:49,889
minutes with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this guy drilling in to how</font>

370
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:52,199
does our key of rotation work how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

371
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:54,209
do that<font color="#CCCCCC"> how do we manage our keys and I</font>

372
00:14:52,199 --> 00:14:56,519
just stopped<font color="#E5E5E5"> at one point I said so what</font>

373
00:14:54,209 --> 00:15:00,839
do you do<font color="#E5E5E5"> currently are we back up to</font>

374
00:14:56,519 --> 00:15:02,160
take and is that encrypted no and what

375
00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:03,930
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> you do with the tapes are we take</font>

376
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:06,540
them<font color="#E5E5E5"> off site how do we take them off</font>

377
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:09,060
site in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the back of the IT managers car</font>

378
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:12,389
and where does he keep his car overnight

379
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:14,910
on his driveway so the guys quizzing us

380
00:15:12,389 --> 00:15:17,610
for 45 minutes about how we use<font color="#E5E5E5"> AES</font>

381
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:19,620
encryption and how we do key rotation

382
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:21,420
yeah at the moment he's taking<font color="#CCCCCC"> his</font>

383
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:22,620
backup tapes which are unencrypted and

384
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:24,839
leaving<font color="#E5E5E5"> them in the back of a car on a</font>

385
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:27,180
driveway overnight so the thing is is

386
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:29,519
what they've actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> got ago is here is</font>

387
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:31,560
the current<font color="#E5E5E5"> level their baseline of what</font>

388
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:34,529
they've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> a security all they need is</font>

389
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:36,180
that much better<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it's a solution but</font>

390
00:15:34,529 --> 00:15:39,240
they're asking us questions about out

391
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:41,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">here we've really got do is base your</font>

392
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:43,440
level of risk on what you're currently

393
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:45,959
on-premise an<font color="#CCCCCC"> inter side but the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> service</font>

394
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:47,970
provider offers more or less risk and if

395
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:49,920
he offers if he provides more risk other

396
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:52,110
contractual controls or other controls

397
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:54,630
or asking for<font color="#CCCCCC"> more transparency that</font>

398
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:56,730
will bring that down or<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the cost</font>

399
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:58,830
savings<font color="#CCCCCC"> so great that it's worth taking</font>

400
00:15:56,730 --> 00:16:00,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">that extra risk and that is a business</font>

401
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:04,140
risk management decision not a security

402
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:06,329
one so I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> started to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> turn the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tables a</font>

403
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:08,460
little bit now so when i get an<font color="#E5E5E5"> RFP for</font>

404
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:12,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">my customer i send him a questionnaire</font>

405
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:13,800
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i say how do you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> plant you know</font>

406
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:15,630
there's a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of confidential</font>

407
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:17,459
information in this<font color="#CCCCCC"> rfp information</font>

408
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:20,130
about our infrastructure our processes

409
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:22,770
our<font color="#E5E5E5"> IDs bender IPS lender how we do</font>

410
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:24,990
vulnerability analysis so i send my

411
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:27,750
question and say how do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> classify our</font>

412
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:28,950
oath piece and they go we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't hang on</font>

413
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:30,630
you just<font color="#E5E5E5"> sent me a questionnaire about</font>

414
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:35,610
classification and how we do it

415
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:37,320
internally<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay how many people have</font>

416
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:39,029
access to my completed<font color="#CCCCCC"> rfp within your</font>

417
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:42,990
organization all we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know we put it</font>

418
00:16:39,029 --> 00:16:44,640
on a file share somewhere<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay does</font>

419
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:46,470
anyone print this out and review<font color="#CCCCCC"> it oh</font>

420
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:49,500
yeah people print it out how do you

421
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:51,660
ensure they dispose of that RFP with all

422
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:54,510
our confidential information or we don't

423
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:55,650
so this custom<font color="#CCCCCC"> o saying we're going to</font>

424
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:58,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">have source one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of our business</font>

425
00:16:55,650 --> 00:17:00,930
processes to a service provider we have

426
00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:02,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">this expectation of security yet all our</font>

427

00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:06,869
already screwed up so they are thinking

that we represent<font color="#E5E5E5"> the greatest amount of</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">systems we're connecting to you probably</font>

435
00:17:20,369 --> 00:17:24,869
could do with a little bit more

00:17:22,589 --> 00:17:27,958
improvement in quite a few number of

437

438
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:31,920
much less risk moving moving to

quite a heavy place in all of the client

468
00:18:44,649 --> 00:18:49,809
security alliances materials if you look

469
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:51,850
at their guidance to the 2.1 guidance I

470
00:18:49,809 --> 00:18:53,678
think virtualization mentioned a couple

471
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:55,299
of hundred of times when you can build a

472
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:56,980
service platform without any form of

473
00:18:55,299 --> 00:18:59,230
virtualization<font color="#E5E5E5"> at all with proper</font>

474
00:18:56,980 --> 00:19:00,789
multi-tenancy and everything else in

475
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:02,259
fact is what we've done based on a

476
00:19:00,789 --> 00:19:05,289
couple of thousand servers and we built

477
00:19:02,259 --> 00:19:07,179
our own platform so the problem is the

478
00:19:05,289 --> 00:19:10,299
vendors have too much<font color="#CCCCCC"> of an invested</font>

479
00:19:07,179 --> 00:19:12,730
interest in the fact that they're

on-premise<font color="#CCCCCC"> you if you look at us we</font>

00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:22,360
these infrastructure vendors their

485
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:26,498
cloud so they're looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at new ways to</font>

486

reinvent themselves and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> by</font>

embedding themselves in the cloud

providers you must use virtualization

00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:34,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">you must do that and the other thing is</font>

490
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:37,330
is the invention<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this whole idea of</font>

491
00:19:34,299 --> 00:19:39,100
the private cloud yeah I<font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't got a</font>

492
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:41,580
slide on this but I've got enough time

quickly<font color="#CCCCCC"> taught on it and then is I</font>

494
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:45,549
mentioned<font color="#CCCCCC"> earlier that there's this</font>

495
00:19:43,419 --> 00:19:47,080
amorphous term the cloud that covers

496
00:19:45,549 --> 00:19:48,580
everything and there were different

abstract it and as you start to move

509
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:19,189
down those layers you take on more and

had some buzz so virtualization<font color="#E5E5E5"> vendors</font>

those you've now got nine products or 10

change you know solves the problem it

540
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:23,860
just changes its nature slightly so what

do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we need as I mentioned</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> earlier</font>

for baseline what they're doing right so

551
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:50,420
they can<font color="#E5E5E5"> use a traditional qualitative</font>

or quantitative risk assessment process

their current solutions and controls and

risks that they face present them and

556
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:04,820
then what they need is a way to assess

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> risks</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the service provider and</font>

different cloud industry bodies and I

574
00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:43,580
have to point out when I made that

575
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:45,950
diagram earlier with all the vendor

576
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:48,139
logos on them it's pretty much the same

577
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:50,720
across all these vendors dominate all of

578
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:52,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">these infrastructure vendors so now all</font>

579
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:54,680
of these have<font color="#CCCCCC"> come up with their own</font>

580
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:56,720
standard for evaluating the risk of a

581
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:59,870
kite<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a cloud environment the cloud</font>

582
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:01,490
industry forum has euro cloud has some

583
00:22:59,870 --> 00:23:03,080
of these are<font color="#E5E5E5"> external audits some of</font>

584
00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:05,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">them</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a self-assessment questionnaires</font>

585
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:07,159
one of the best ones I've seen so<font color="#CCCCCC"> far is</font>

586
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:10,700
actually cam which cloud audit is being

587
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:12,410
merged into so so what they're all

588
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:14,990
coming up<font color="#E5E5E5"> with is their own standard so</font>

589
00:23:12,410 --> 00:23:17,810
now I expect most of my customers to

590
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:21,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">still be sending the RFPs</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> rfis I know I</font>

591
00:23:17,810 --> 00:23:23,419
have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> certify to SAS 70 ISO 27001 I</font>

592
00:23:21,410 --> 00:23:25,280
have to complete the cloud industry

593
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:30,560
forum self-assessment questionnaire I

594
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:33,290
have to do the euro cloud external audit

595
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:35,179
as well my situation is not getting

596
00:23:33,290 --> 00:23:36,980
better and having all these different

597
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:39,950
standards is not helping the customer

598
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:41,270
either so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I understand that the you know</font>

599
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:43,340
because now everything's archived

600
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:44,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">there's large chunk of things that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

601
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:47,330
these industry bodies can start getting

602
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:48,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">their teeth into you but personally</font>

603
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:51,020
myself I'd like to see something<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

604
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:53,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">the client security alliance taking on</font>

605
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:54,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">the responsibility of security from all</font>

606
00:23:53,150 --> 00:23:56,030
these other ones but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it isn't going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

607
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:58,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">happen because on members of all of</font>

608
00:23:56,030 --> 00:24:02,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">these and yeah they're never going to</font>

609
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:04,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">come together so here's my plate so I've</font>

610
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:07,280
got<font color="#E5E5E5"> about 45 minutes of this burn any</font>

611
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:09,530
questions from my perspective but first

612
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:12,889
thing is for your customer look at your

613
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:15,649
current risk you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know what are you doing</font>

614
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:17,900
on promise what is your<font color="#E5E5E5"> pants innings</font>

615
00:24:15,650 --> 00:24:19,190
and pence figure for the amount of<font color="#E5E5E5"> risk</font>

616
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:22,070
you're exposed to with what you're doing

617
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:24,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">on premise then forget about what the</font>

618
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:26,720
cloud service providers doing do a

619
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:29,360
complete audit of that cloud service

620
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:30,950
provider yeah either by going through

621
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:33,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">their statement of applicability or</font>

622
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:36,550
their control statements in SAS 70 and

623
00:24:33,730 --> 00:24:38,650
do a risk assessment on that service

624
00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:40,600
provider and get the same pounds

625
00:24:38,650 --> 00:24:43,780
shillings and pence and that gives you

626
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:45,939
two figures cloud on-premise then look

627
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:47,920
at the differentiate differentiator is

628
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:51,040
there more risk less<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to the cloud</font>

629
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:53,380
what controls this is standard like risk

630
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:55,810
assessment and risk management 101 that

631
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:57,580
you do in an organization but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the thing</font>

632
00:24:55,810 --> 00:24:59,020
is people<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't do it they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just throw a</font>

633
00:24:57,580 --> 00:25:02,350
question out at the cloud service

634
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:04,180
provider and don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really do anything a</font>

635
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:07,510
pop can go from the person that's tick

636
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:10,450
the most boxes when it comes<font color="#CCCCCC"> back the</font>

637
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:12,490
other thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you want champagne</font>

638
00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:14,290
expect to pay<font color="#CCCCCC"> for it so the other thing</font>

639
00:25:12,490 --> 00:25:17,440
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to come in and audit me</font>

640
00:25:14,290 --> 00:25:19,090
every<font color="#E5E5E5"> year don't expect to have a cost</font>

641
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:21,820
saving on top of what you're currently

642
00:25:19,090 --> 00:25:24,070
doing yeah the cost saving because my

643
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:25,540
overheads have gone up and I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

644
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:27,010
pass those overheads to the rest of the

645
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:29,350
business which means the cost of our

646
00:25:27,010 --> 00:25:31,480
service goes up so that<font color="#CCCCCC"> means the</font>

647
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:33,610
motivations for going to the cloud which

648
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:35,470
is almost predominantly at the moment

649
00:25:33,610 --> 00:25:37,360
not about managing complexity of on

650
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:39,640
houzz solutions it's not about focusing

651
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:41,860
on core business no going<font color="#E5E5E5"> back to my</font>

652
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:43,720
first<font color="#E5E5E5"> slide about companies really don't</font>

653
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:48,760
govern themselves very well it's all

654
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:52,210
about saving money so you know what you

655
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:54,910
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do is if you expect you know the</font>

656
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:56,470
earth expect to pay<font color="#CCCCCC"> for it and with</font>

657
00:25:54,910 --> 00:25:59,170
there are tears of cloud service

658
00:25:56,470 --> 00:26:01,000
providers<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the software and service</font>

659
00:25:59,170 --> 00:26:02,920
arena so we have people we compete with

660
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:05,980
which are very much commodity products

661
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:07,750
their consumer products some of them

662
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:11,200
from very large vendors and multicolored

663
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:13,360
logos but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing is you get what you</font>

664
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:15,520
pay for and we're more expensive and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

665
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:18,429
didn't decide to<font color="#CCCCCC"> go down a race to the</font>

666
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:22,450
bottom we<font color="#E5E5E5"> decided to maintain you know</font>

667
00:26:18,430 --> 00:26:24,490
that level and standards security but we

668
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:27,880
won't drop our prices but<font color="#E5E5E5"> then again</font>

669
00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:30,550
don't expect you know this probably the

670
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:31,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">all 133 questions to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be ticked exactly</font>

671
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:35,139
as you want unless you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to paper</font>

672
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:36,399
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know look at the price</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of a cloud</font>

673
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:39,520
service provider and what you actually

674
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:41,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">need and then take that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> decision based</font>

675
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:42,639
on are you paying over<font color="#CCCCCC"> the top because I</font>

676
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:44,350
don't actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> need this level of</font>

677
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:47,230
security so you could go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to one of those</font>

678
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:51,639
commodities of is it my CEO overseas is

679
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:53,470
resin tation<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm dead so the industry</font>

680
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:55,210
bodies as I said I wish<font color="#E5E5E5"> they've come</font>

681
00:26:53,470 --> 00:26:57,970
together and<font color="#E5E5E5"> just come up one standard</font>

682
00:26:55,210 --> 00:26:59,890
for all it the other thing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wish</font>

683
00:26:57,970 --> 00:27:02,410
they'd represent both the customer and

684
00:26:59,890 --> 00:27:04,360
the service provider not the person

685
00:27:02,410 --> 00:27:07,179
trying to sell stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the service</font>

686
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:08,409
provider and cloud providers we need to

687
00:27:07,179 --> 00:27:10,570
embrace<font color="#E5E5E5"> our we need to embrace</font>

688
00:27:08,410 --> 00:27:12,250
transparency so I've got a project<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

689
00:27:10,570 --> 00:27:15,428
<font color="#CCCCCC">the moment to try and give customers</font>

metrics about how the system<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> owned is performing and</font>

692
00:27:17,169 --> 00:27:21,280
sort of things like that I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's</font>

693
00:27:18,669 --> 00:27:23,350
a a lot of cloud providers are very

694
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:24,668
cagey about giving you information<font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font>

695
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:26,469
there is some information I won't give

696
00:27:24,669 --> 00:27:27,790
you because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's related to our</font>

697
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:29,830
intellectual property<font color="#CCCCCC"> and how we build</font>

698
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:32,710
our grid and things like that but<font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font>

699
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:34,629
are other things i can give you to

700
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:36,790
compensate for the fact that i can't

701
00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:39,669
disclose that information so if a client

702
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:41,290
provider isn't telling you something it

703
00:27:39,669 --> 00:27:42,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">could be because they can't afford that</font>

704
00:27:41,290 --> 00:27:44,500
overhead if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> asking a very</font>

705
00:27:42,610 --> 00:27:46,990
specific question but they should have

706
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:49,570
prepared in advance<font color="#CCCCCC"> of standard answers</font>

707
00:27:46,990 --> 00:27:55,030
to all the sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of usual queries that</font>

708
00:27:49,570 --> 00:27:57,220
you get so that is in effect my rant my

709
00:27:55,030 --> 00:28:00,070
mind<font color="#E5E5E5"> says customers have don't really</font>

710
00:27:57,220 --> 00:28:01,780
assess the risk properly in cloud

711
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:03,850
service providers they use the<font color="#E5E5E5"> wrong</font>

712
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:06,639
standards for doing it they have

00:28:03,850 --> 00:28:10,299
unreasoning reasonable expectations a

714
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:11,890
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the time and the people are</font>
