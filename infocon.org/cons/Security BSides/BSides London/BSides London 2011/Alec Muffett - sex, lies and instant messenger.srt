history all over again it's virtually

108

impossible to expend expunging recent

messages subscribe and the fun thing is

110
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:21,940
that your lover or other partner has got

111
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:24,970
exactly the same data<font color="#CCCCCC"> too so even if you</font>

506
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:29,969
towards the end here so the key thing is

507
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:32,040
also to remember it's the other person

508
00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:33,690
who has all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> data</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> too so it's coming</font>

they would send you<font color="#E5E5E5"> the things whether</font>

you in it they are<font color="#CCCCCC"> probably well there</font>

514
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:44,970
are the people who are not here

515
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:47,580
listening to this talk therefore they're

516
00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:49,260
probably less invested in understanding

517
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:52,050
how to maintain secrecy in fact they may

518
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:53,340
be quite fat that's about it so if

519
00:22:52,050 --> 00:22:55,080
you're the person with a lot to lose

520
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:57,600
make sure the other person is on your

really

540
00:23:54,580 --> 00:24:01,330
cool so long as you can trust where they

541
00:23:55,960 --> 00:24:04,390

554
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:35,830
you live like this or you accept the

risks or you get a divorce indirectly

556
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:46,330
there's also some signal that's a really
