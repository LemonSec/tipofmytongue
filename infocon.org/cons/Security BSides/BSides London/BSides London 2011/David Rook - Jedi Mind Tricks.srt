1
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:12,920
welcome to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the second talk I'd like to</font>

2
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:14,899
choose two Jedi Masters for today and

3
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:19,610
then we're going to Chris my supple

4
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:20,900
basin<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so we kind of written this</font>

5
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:23,779
talk in a way that it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of two</font>

6
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:26,619
talks in one so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> start off</font>

7
00:00:23,779 --> 00:00:29,300
right in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first part of the talk here</font>

8
00:00:26,619 --> 00:00:31,880
which kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of talks more about working</font>

9
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:34,309
with developers and the local management

10
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:36,500
within an<font color="#E5E5E5"> stl</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sees the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

11
00:00:34,309 --> 00:00:39,169
responsible<font color="#E5E5E5"> for delivery and then chris</font>

12
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:42,380
is going to talk more about<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

13
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:44,960
selling and getting executive and

14
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:47,480
management level buying for application

15
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:49,040
security I guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's why I've been</font>

16
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:51,800
the t-shirt<font color="#CCCCCC"> and chris is in the suit</font>

17
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:54,350
today so we can give it a gable of our

18
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:55,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">constituents exactly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and we kind of</font>

19
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:58,790
split it up like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> because in our day</font>

20
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:01,218
jobs those are the<font color="#E5E5E5"> main areas that we</font>

21
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:03,079
focus<font color="#CCCCCC"> on so I would work primarily with</font>

22
00:01:01,219 --> 00:01:05,269
developers and kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of within the</font>

23
00:01:03,079 --> 00:01:07,340
development team and Chris obviously is

24
00:01:05,269 --> 00:01:09,350
the CTO of an application security

25
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:11,570
company would work a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> with helping</font>

26
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:12,770
people understand how to get that kind

27
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:15,080
of management level by and that

28
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:18,949
ultimately spend money on application

29
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:22,039
security<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they give away so i'll start</font>

30
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:24,229
<font color="#CCCCCC">off here so my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> name is david cook as you</font>

31
00:01:22,039 --> 00:01:26,209
probably seen on the agenda on the first

32
00:01:24,229 --> 00:01:28,099
slide there my work is a security

33
00:01:26,209 --> 00:01:31,369
analyst for real ex payments and<font color="#E5E5E5"> dublin</font>

34
00:01:28,099 --> 00:01:33,380
and my job is<font color="#CCCCCC"> full-time application of</font>

35
00:01:31,369 --> 00:01:35,420
securities that would include everything

36
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:37,330
from kind of getting management to

37
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:39,709
commit to do an application security

38
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:42,080
application security results in as<font color="#E5E5E5"> well</font>

39
00:01:39,709 --> 00:01:45,560
as things like security code reviews

40
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:47,119
threat<font color="#CCCCCC"> model pen testing and so on and I</font>

41
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:50,509
guess a lot of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably know me</font>

42
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:53,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">better as security ninja on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Twitter or</font>

43
00:01:50,509 --> 00:01:55,789
through the security ninja website I do

44
00:01:53,509 --> 00:01:57,500
a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of other</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things as you can see on</font>

45
00:01:55,789 --> 00:01:59,119
the screen either the point of the

46
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:01,369
bottom<font color="#E5E5E5"> about a third product nishio</font>

47
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,780
that's when I presents- afternoon if you

48
00:02:01,369 --> 00:02:06,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">want</font>

49
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:09,009
find out more about that so I guess this

50
00:02:06,369 --> 00:02:11,350
is my the agenda for my part of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font>

51
00:02:09,008 --> 00:02:13,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's really how can you work</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

52
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:15,340
developers and how can<font color="#CCCCCC"> you help</font>

53
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:17,470
developers get what they need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to help</font>

54
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:19,569
you so how can<font color="#E5E5E5"> you give them information</font>

55
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:23,020
the tools the process is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they need</font>

56
00:02:19,569 --> 00:02:25,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">to write secure code which ultimately is</font>

57
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:27,370
what you want to achieve and then

58
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:30,400
secondly<font color="#E5E5E5"> translate and what I call</font>

59
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:32,680
application security alien into the

60
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,720
business language because as much as I

61
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:36,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">think most probably don't want to get</font>

62
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:38,560
involved with business language and

63
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:40,750
business people they the end the<font color="#CCCCCC"> day the</font>

64
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,730
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who sign off on just about</font>

65
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:44,470
everything so if you want application

66
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:47,200
security resource and you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> money if</font>

67
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:49,060
you want tools you need not always money

68
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,518
but you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need you know the business to</font>

69
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:53,410
accept the cost of putting those<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

70
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:55,690
into<font color="#CCCCCC"> a development life cycle for</font>

71
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:58,180
example so again there's more of taking

72
00:02:55,690 --> 00:03:00,010
the things we talked about and figuring

73
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:02,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">out how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you put those things into a</font>

74
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:06,399
former and definitions at the business

75
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:08,620
cares bug so firstly from my experience

76
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:11,500
both<font color="#CCCCCC"> relaxant and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other places and</font>

77
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:12,610
conferences and so on<font color="#E5E5E5"> and maybe that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

78
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:14,829
first bullet<font color="#E5E5E5"> payment there is not</font>

79
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:16,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">completely true most developers don't</font>

80
00:03:14,829 --> 00:03:19,360
come up<font color="#CCCCCC"> to me and say I want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to write</font>

81
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:21,040
secure code but what I found is I've yet

82
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,829
to come across the developer who's<font color="#E5E5E5"> told</font>

83
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:25,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">me they don't want to write secure code</font>

84
00:03:22,829 --> 00:03:27,850
so it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> like you fight it in a</font>

85
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:30,280
completely uphill battle with the

86
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:33,489
developers but what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> need to</font>

87
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:35,680
understand is that you need to own the

88
00:03:33,489 --> 00:03:38,350
application security patterns for them

89
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:41,109
in some ways it shouldn't just be a case

90
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:42,970
of producing<font color="#E5E5E5"> a list of vulnerabilities</font>

91
00:03:41,109 --> 00:03:46,329
and giving it to them and walking away

92
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:49,209
if your job is to produce secure code

93
00:03:46,329 --> 00:03:52,480
and secure applications you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to help</font>

94
00:03:49,209 --> 00:03:54,519
them achieve secure code and just given

95
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,470
them a report full of vulnerabilities

96
00:03:54,519 --> 00:03:59,859
with severity five or whatever it might

97
00:03:56,470 --> 00:04:02,950
be doesn't give them a feeling that<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

98
00:03:59,859 --> 00:04:05,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">your eat as equally eager to get their</font>

99
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:07,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">Cobra and securely as as you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want them</font>

100
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:09,369
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be so when I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about own in the</font>

101
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:12,220
problem with him i don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean writing</font>

102
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:13,460
the code for them but I mean help them

103
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:16,339
understand

104
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:18,410
the code they need to write to fix the

105
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:21,799
issues you've come up with and if

106
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:23,660
developers need a process surrounding

107
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:25,580
that so whether it's you know the fact

108
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:28,520
that you have to getting security

109
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:31,870
ingrained in the sdlc maybe or the<font color="#CCCCCC"> fact</font>

110
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:33,919
that if things like security

111
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:36,380
requirements aren't<font color="#E5E5E5"> in requirements</font>

112
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:38,420
document in documents are then you could

113
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:39,860
still<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually argue the developer is</font>

114
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:41,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing their job if they don't write</font>

115
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:45,260
secure code and I know that sounds a bit

116
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:47,180
confusing but if we don't have security

117
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:48,920
in there as a requirement because we

118
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:51,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">have an only application security</font>

119
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:54,050
problem then they're probably not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

120
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:56,360
to write secure code something<font color="#E5E5E5"> chris</font>

121
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:59,150
said to me recently<font color="#CCCCCC"> to along a similar</font>

122
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:00,890
vein there was that if they did go like

123
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:02,659
secure code then arguably they're not

124
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:04,460
doing their job<font color="#E5E5E5"> because they they didn't</font>

125
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:05,930
build the application as per the

126
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:08,510
requirements in the design that was

127
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:10,010
signed off so only now<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're making</font>

128
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:13,219
sure they have<font color="#CCCCCC"> everything that they need</font>

129
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:16,400
in place to write secure<font color="#CCCCCC"> cody's is vital</font>

130
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:18,020
and what you can also try<font color="#CCCCCC"> and uses</font>

131
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,780
developers generally like to write

132
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:22,400
quality code not all of<font color="#CCCCCC"> them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

133
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:24,950
we've all used products which are far

134
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,659
from being a quality application but in

135
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:28,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">general I found developers like</font>

136
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:29,870
producing something that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> quality</font>

137
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:32,480
something like they can generally be

138
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:34,100
proud of and you'll also want a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

139
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:37,370
businesses want to produce quality

140
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:39,380
products now if you can work too in some

141
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:41,920
ways change the definition of quality

142
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:44,120
within your business to include security

143
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:45,800
then you can use that<font color="#CCCCCC"> because if the</font>

144
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:48,440
developers want the right quality hope

145
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:51,260
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can include</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> security as part of</font>

146
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:54,380
quality I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying that same thing</font>

147
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:56,599
but if your definition of quality or are

148
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:59,180
more specifically a good application and

149
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:00,650
your business<font color="#E5E5E5"> includes security then</font>

150
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:03,650
you'll find it a lot easier<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get the</font>

151
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:06,409
right secure code and then finally what

152
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:08,690
I found when developers is they want the

153
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:10,100
right knowledge the right practices

154
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:12,890
there are a synthesis and the right

155
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:13,760
tools I know in some ways<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> probably</font>

156
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:15,200
sounds a little

157
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:17,330
obvious that they want the right

158
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:19,219
knowledge but then for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a second think</font>

159
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:22,909
about if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're a developer or security</font>

160
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:25,430
person how you do secure development

161
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:28,580
education or what if you're a developer

162
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:31,400
what developer education programs have

163
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:33,859
you been subjected<font color="#CCCCCC"> to I you subjected as</font>

164
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:35,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">the word there specifically because some</font>

165
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:38,510
are terrible and they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> give the</font>

166
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:41,420
developers the knowledge they need and

167
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:43,219
that's kind of this comment recently I

168
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:46,370
saw on<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a blog that I was commenting</font>

169
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:48,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm kind of really reinforced that with</font>

170
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:50,690
me that this guy Jim bird come along and

171
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:52,460
he said that<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the context of talking</font>

172
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:54,380
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting developers to write secure</font>

173
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:56,419
<font color="#CCCCCC">po with it's the blog was talking about</font>

174
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:58,790
he said that he's a software guy and

175
00:06:56,420 --> 00:07:01,100
what he wants is he wants practices and

176
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:02,450
tools that actually work so not<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

177
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:04,580
saying all your will follow the

178
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:06,740
Microsoft<font color="#CCCCCC"> stl because that might be</font>

179
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:09,020
great if your Microsoft but if you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

180
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:11,240
very small company that probably doesn't

181
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:13,099
make sense so making sure that whatever

182
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:15,620
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> put in place ad will actually work</font>

183
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:17,270
in your environment and more

184
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:19,040
specifically they must help him get it

185
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:21,020
help them get software out of the door

186
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:25,010
better software that's more reliable<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

187
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:28,010
more secure so what<font color="#CCCCCC"> can we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to help</font>

188
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:30,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">developers so and we do need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to help</font>

189
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:31,880
developers because ultimately they're

190
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:33,680
the ones who are<font color="#E5E5E5"> determined whether your</font>

191
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:35,510
application security program produces

192
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:40,640
secure code or not because they're the

193
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:42,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">people writing that code so first bullet</font>

194
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:45,020
point again to me seems<font color="#CCCCCC"> like one that's</font>

195
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:48,320
almost too obvious for me<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put in the</font>

196
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:50,270
presentation but I'm saying make sure

197
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:52,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you help developers understand how</font>

198
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:55,219
to write secure code and again think

199
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:56,270
back to develop her education things

200
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:59,240
that you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen though you've been</font>

201
00:07:56,270 --> 00:08:02,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">through and how many of them actually</font>

202
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:04,130
taught you how to write secure code so

203
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:05,750
if you've gone aren't<font color="#CCCCCC"> secure develop</font>

204
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:08,600
training courses or whatever it might be

205
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:11,510
how many of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them sat you down actually</font>

206
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:13,190
taught you how to write secure code in

207
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:14,870
my<font color="#CCCCCC"> experience and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from seeing what's out</font>

208
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:18,830
there in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the marketplace probably very</font>

209
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:19,970
few of the developers who we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

210
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:22,310
write<font color="#E5E5E5"> secure code have actually been</font>

211
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:23,969
taught and write secure code we teach

212
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:25,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">them about vulnerabilities and then we</font>

213
00:08:23,969 --> 00:08:27,869
to exploit it something like web goes

214
00:08:25,889 --> 00:08:29,519
then we hope that<font color="#E5E5E5"> from there they can</font>

215
00:08:27,869 --> 00:08:31,949
<font color="#CCCCCC">kind of figure out how to write their</font>

216
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:33,899
secure code or if we do cover secure

217
00:08:31,949 --> 00:08:35,310
podium it's probably for maybe ten

218
00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:36,688
percent of the time where's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other</font>

219
00:08:35,309 --> 00:08:38,938
ninety percent of the time we're talking

220
00:08:36,688 --> 00:08:41,039
about vulnerabilities and exploits you

221
00:08:38,938 --> 00:08:42,899
need to really think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the way</font>

222
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:44,399
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing your training and figure</font>

223
00:08:42,899 --> 00:08:46,589
out whether you're trying to give<font color="#CCCCCC"> them a</font>

224
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:48,720
web app pen testing on a one-on-one

225
00:08:46,589 --> 00:08:51,709
course or whether you're actually

226
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:54,509
teaching them to write secure code and

227
00:08:51,709 --> 00:08:56,279
really if you if your training doesn't

228
00:08:54,509 --> 00:08:58,860
include some element and secure coding

229
00:08:56,279 --> 00:09:00,120
then your developers never actually

230
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:01,889
going to write secure code because

231
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:04,589
you've not told them what they<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to</font>

232
00:09:01,889 --> 00:09:06,120
know and then just<font color="#E5E5E5"> to reiterate point</font>

233
00:09:04,589 --> 00:09:08,040
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> only an application security</font>

234
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:10,110
problems with them make sure that rather

235
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:12,120
than being<font color="#E5E5E5"> seem seen as an auditor</font>

236
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:15,180
within the team that you're seen as a

237
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:16,949
teammate but<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're as equally concerned</font>

238
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:19,589
about getting software<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of the door</font>

239
00:09:16,949 --> 00:09:21,709
you've got your<font color="#E5E5E5"> own agenda obviously it</font>

240
00:09:19,589 --> 00:09:25,439
needs to be secure software but

241
00:09:21,709 --> 00:09:27,149
understand that the thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I guess</font>

242
00:09:25,439 --> 00:09:28,860
drives their bonuses and their

243
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:32,490
performance reviews is whether they're

244
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:34,589
getting co-produced<font color="#CCCCCC"> sometime if you show</font>

245
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:37,259
concern for that and you show that

246
00:09:34,589 --> 00:09:39,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're willing to help them do security</font>

247
00:09:37,259 --> 00:09:41,189
right but also meet their deadlines then

248
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:43,949
again<font color="#E5E5E5"> from my experience that's been</font>

249
00:09:41,189 --> 00:09:47,189
very<font color="#CCCCCC"> useful and then the final point</font>

250
00:09:43,949 --> 00:09:49,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">there is is very important don't dictate</font>

251
00:09:47,189 --> 00:09:52,740
them don't go to them with the attitude

252
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:54,420
of I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> the security person I know about</font>

253
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:58,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">these difficult security problems so I</font>

254
00:09:54,420 --> 00:10:00,000
better than<font color="#E5E5E5"> you we might not all do that</font>

255
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:01,889
but there are loads of people in

256
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,439
security do have that asked you to go

257
00:10:01,889 --> 00:10:06,089
along<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the idler security person you</font>

258
00:10:04,439 --> 00:10:09,149
must<font color="#E5E5E5"> do what I say and don't ever dare</font>

259
00:10:06,089 --> 00:10:12,089
question me but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem is on the</font>

260
00:10:09,149 --> 00:10:13,740
flip side we're talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

261
00:10:12,089 --> 00:10:15,600
development which means that they

262
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:18,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually probably know more about</font>

263
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,709
actually rising a piece of code to

264
00:10:18,059 --> 00:10:22,469
prevent the issues you'll find in the

265
00:10:19,709 --> 00:10:23,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">new do so in some ways they could come</font>

266
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:25,829
with that smoke I'm better<font color="#CCCCCC"> than new</font>

267
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:28,949
attitude as well but from my experience

268
00:10:25,829 --> 00:10:30,719
they don't tend<font color="#CCCCCC"> to they mock my code</font>

269
00:10:28,949 --> 00:10:34,740
because I'm not developer in a right

270
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:36,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">hold but not in the same way so rather</font>

271
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:38,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">than dictating to them and say you</font>

272
00:10:36,209 --> 00:10:42,029
right securecode speak with them and

273
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:43,379
help<font color="#E5E5E5"> all that help to learn from that as</font>

274
00:10:42,029 --> 00:10:45,990
well<font color="#CCCCCC"> so you can learn from each other</font>

275
00:10:43,379 --> 00:10:47,759
but then finally when you learn from

276
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:50,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">them the things you get back from them</font>

277
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:52,860
try and use that information<font color="#E5E5E5"> to improve</font>

278
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:54,959
things for them and one<font color="#CCCCCC"> example of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

279
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:57,119
regex was that we spoke with our

280
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:59,008
developers because one of the things we

281
00:10:57,119 --> 00:11:00,899
did<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the security staff application</font>

282
00:10:59,009 --> 00:11:05,759
security seat with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the developers in the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">same team same managers so we just the</font>

284
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:10,290
same as those guys in terms of our 24

285
00:11:08,279 --> 00:11:12,480
hour performances<font color="#E5E5E5"> the department is</font>

286
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:14,368
measured on getting an application

delivered on time and security<font color="#E5E5E5"> is part</font>

288
00:11:14,369 --> 00:11:19,679
of that but to improve things we spoke

289
00:11:18,059 --> 00:11:21,719
<font color="#CCCCCC">with the developers about security</font>

290
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:23,670
testing and what they said was that when

291
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:25,949
we go out of the development phase we've

292
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:28,529
done some level of kind of function on

293
00:11:25,949 --> 00:11:33,689
QA testing so we at least know our code

294
00:11:28,529 --> 00:11:35,519
works<font color="#CCCCCC"> in it it's somewhat a way towards</font>

295
00:11:33,689 --> 00:11:37,439
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> what it's supposed to do what the</font>

296
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:39,509
problem is when when we look at security

297
00:11:37,439 --> 00:11:41,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">testing we've got no idea what you're</font>

298
00:11:39,509 --> 00:11:44,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to find two or three phases along</font>

299
00:11:41,819 --> 00:11:46,709
in the sdlc which is a problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> for us is</font>

300
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:48,599
there any way that we can start<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing</font>

301
00:11:46,709 --> 00:11:50,309
some security testing ourselves just the

302
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:53,160
same way as we do functional and kind of

303
00:11:50,309 --> 00:11:55,769
regression testing ourselves as well so

304
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:58,589
we took<font color="#CCCCCC"> that away</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we had a think about</font>

305
00:11:55,769 --> 00:12:00,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">how we could enable that for them and to</font>

306
00:11:58,589 --> 00:12:02,639
cut a long story<font color="#CCCCCC"> short the approach we</font>

307
00:12:00,299 --> 00:12:04,769
toughed was in the threat models the

308
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:07,619
security staff create kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at the</font>

309
00:12:04,769 --> 00:12:09,929
design phase<font color="#CCCCCC"> the sdlc we write very</font>

310
00:12:07,619 --> 00:12:12,209
clear security test cases not really

311
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:14,279
clear whereas before they were used by

312
00:12:12,209 --> 00:12:16,559
the same security staff a lot of the

313
00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:18,600
time so they they want that useful to

314
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:21,569
developers but<font color="#E5E5E5"> now they're very clear</font>

315
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:24,540
and then what we do is we invested in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

316
00:12:21,569 --> 00:12:26,759
license for books we probe for every one

317
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:29,248
of our developers so all security staff

318
00:12:26,759 --> 00:12:31,709
all tests and stuff and all developers

319
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:33,779
have a copy of this tool now on their

320
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:35,998
desktop and they're given to every

321
00:12:33,779 --> 00:12:37,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">single project the test case is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

322
00:12:35,999 --> 00:12:39,149
they should<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably run based on the</font>

323
00:12:37,949 --> 00:12:41,758
threats and the risks we've identified

324
00:12:39,149 --> 00:12:43,769
in the threat model so again it's a case

325
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:44,390
of speak with them and learn from them

326
00:12:43,769 --> 00:12:48,080
and then

327
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:50,569
prove things from<font color="#CCCCCC"> that so then next up</font>

328
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:53,000
is is like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said what I call</font>

329
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:55,190
application security alien and I guess

330
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,410
when<font color="#CCCCCC"> we talk in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> terms of things like</font>

331
00:12:55,190 --> 00:13:00,410
injections and jackings and polling is

332
00:12:57,410 --> 00:13:02,510
it probably makes<font color="#CCCCCC"> sense to all of us but</font>

333
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:04,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">ultimately all of us in this room and</font>

334
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:07,280
probably many other security people

335
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:10,010
we're not generally the ones who sign

336
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:12,439
off checks we're not the ones who make

337
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:15,170
commitments on fixing these issues if

338
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:16,730
those people don't understand what the

339
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:18,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">hell we're talking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about they won't sign</font>

340
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:21,050
the checks for tools they won't sign

341
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:22,850
checks for resources<font color="#E5E5E5"> they won't accept</font>

342
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:25,430
the cost of adding all these additional

343
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:26,990
deliverables into their sdlc if you go

344
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:29,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">to them and talk about these three</font>

345
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:31,130
things that they might think more along

346
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:37,479
these lines you know we're talking of it

347
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:41,420
injections and jackings and<font color="#E5E5E5"> holdings so</font>

348
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:44,330
if if in their head if that's what your

349
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:46,010
findings look like I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't think you're</font>

350
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:48,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to get the the commitment you need</font>

351
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:51,380
from the business<font color="#E5E5E5"> to address</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your issues</font>

352
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:53,630
so there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> different ways of</font>

353
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:57,340
approaching this so I guess what I'm

354
00:13:53,630 --> 00:14:00,290
looking at here is more of how you get

355
00:13:57,340 --> 00:14:02,840
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> delivery managers or whoever's</font>

356
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:04,610
responsible within like<font color="#CCCCCC"> the SCLC</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:06,980

358
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:10,040
get them<font color="#CCCCCC"> to fix issues you find and</font>

chris<font color="#E5E5E5"> is going to cover this a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font>

360

in his slides of how you take that upper

00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:17,570
level in<font color="#E5E5E5"> riddick how do you get</font>

362
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:19,099
management and kind of sea level<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

363
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:21,860
in the business to<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually sign off</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

364
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:23,660
checks or to even say look as a business

365
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:28,160
the whole we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> making a commitment to</font>

366
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:30,199
write secure poul from now on so it the

367
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:32,360
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about is more kind of</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">aimed at convincing a project manager</font>

369
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:37,100
that he needs in today's project for a

370
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:40,400
week because the<font color="#E5E5E5"> issue you found isn't</font>

371
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:41,450
what isn't a golden my little<font color="#CCCCCC"> pony but</font>

372
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:43,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's actually something that could</font>

373
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:47,690
really be a serious issue for the

374
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:48,980
business ok so it's following<font color="#E5E5E5"> on from</font>

375
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:51,500
that little bit as well as we<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

376
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:53,890
sometimes<font color="#CCCCCC"> t speed what outside</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of our</font>

00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:56,750
community<font color="#E5E5E5"> a weird language</font>

378
00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:59,660
but then sometimes present those things

379
00:14:56,750 --> 00:15:02,450
in weird formats as well formats<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

380
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:04,550
again may make sense to us but again

00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:07,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're not generally the ones making the</font>

382
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:10,900
final decision on fixing these things or

383
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:13,490
invest in an application security so

384
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:16,220
something that I've spoken about quite a

385
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:20,860
few times<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular on twitter at CBS s</font>

386
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:24,770
and its use as a way of scoring

387
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:27,650
vulnerabilities can be useful in certain

388
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:29,420
situations but probably outside of the

389
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:31,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">applique or not just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the application</font>

390

security but outside of the security

391
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:36,170
team your findings probably make very

392
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:38,209
little sense to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> business so let's</font>

393
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:40,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">take a look at make-believe sequel</font>

of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these issues the business so using</font>

the calculator you have look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> a base</font>

score so you fill in the baseball which

00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:06,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">is mandatory and then you have</font>

environmental and temporal scores which

give<font color="#E5E5E5"> you a score in fact they give us</font>

you know a few<font color="#CCCCCC"> different scores as you</font>

411
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:16,819
can see there but what it's telling us

412
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:18,770
is that our<font color="#E5E5E5"> secret injection</font>

about systems and a few other things

419
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:38,540
there and it gives us a score of 2.2 now

420
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:41,510
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't use CBS s very much so I really</font>

i'd certainly what<font color="#E5E5E5"> i could tell you that</font>

423

was what 2.2 is a score in terms of risk

424
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:49,700
means and<font color="#CCCCCC"> real eggs it means that that's</font>

never going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get looked at and I'll</font>

426
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:55,280
show you why in a second because you

427
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:56,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">need to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look at well before</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we move on</font>

to it I just<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to put these</font>

429
00:16:56,670 --> 00:17:02,400
in here how those scores are calculated

430
00:16:58,770 --> 00:17:04,020
how do we get to a score of<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2.2 one this</font>

431
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:06,389
is how we calculate the base score which

00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:07,800
for us was 8.3 and then we throw in

433
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:10,260
these as well<font color="#CCCCCC"> as this one's actually</font>

434
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:12,810
i'll be the simplest one temporal

435
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:14,579
equation and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then the environmental</font>

436
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:15,990
equation so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i looked at them and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

437
00:17:14,579 --> 00:17:17,699
thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm actually not even going to</font>

438
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:23,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">try and figure out how we got to 2.2</font>

439
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:24,930
there and but we did we got<font color="#E5E5E5"> a 2.2 but</font>

440
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:27,060
the things that you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at is</font>

441
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:30,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">2.2 you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> might make sense to you in terms</font>

442
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:33,000
of understanding the vulnerability and

443
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:35,730
how how likely is it to be exploited for

444
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,440
example what is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the impact of it but if</font>

445
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:39,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">you take that score 2.2 to the business</font>

446
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:41,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">does that make sense</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to them we'll look</font>

447
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:45,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">at in the second one I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think sometimes</font>

448
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:47,450
it won't and then again<font color="#CCCCCC"> sometimes as a</font>

449
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:49,680
community which sometimes guilty of

450
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:51,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">feeling security</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> should just happen</font>

451
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:54,630
without really haven't adjusted for you

452
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:58,439
because XYZ company got hacked last week

453
00:17:54,630 --> 00:18:00,900
we might use that<font color="#CCCCCC"> as a lever to try and</font>

454
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:03,510
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> ourselves some technologies volatile</font>

455
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:04,890
results and so on so what you again need

456
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:07,860
to understand is what's important to

457
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:09,150
your business and and then use be

458
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:11,909
realistic about what your expectations

459
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:14,790
are for security and use good

460
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:17,040
justifications and again chris<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

461
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:19,200
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to give you more more of</font>

462
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:21,270
a bigger stick to going to be so areas

463
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:24,480
of the business within his talk is slide

464
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:26,730
sorry than than mine<font color="#CCCCCC"> so ultimately</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

465
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:29,490
need to take this information<font color="#E5E5E5"> we need to</font>

466
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:31,680
speak in in in a business language or

467
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:35,310
more importantly a language that your

468
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:37,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">business cares about so it will differ</font>

469
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:39,750
from from one business to another but in

470
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:42,270
general a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the things will apply</font>

471
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:43,710
regardless of where you're working so

472
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:45,660
firstly you need to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

473
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:48,600
the business cares about they don't care

474
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:50,700
or even know about my opinion<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably</font>

475
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:53,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">rightly injections and jacking its</font>

476
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:55,080
opponents or if they do we saw both of

477
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:56,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">those things might look like in their</font>

478
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:58,199
heads when we tell them about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it which</font>

479
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:59,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">means that if that's what they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

480
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:02,310
about it means you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to get</font>

481
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:03,840
what you want so you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

482
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:04,919
what does the business character and why

483
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:07,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">should it in</font>

484
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:08,730
security so they don't care necessarily

485
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:10,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you have a sequel injection</font>

486
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:13,500
vulnerability but<font color="#E5E5E5"> what they do care</font>

487
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:15,840
about these things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like less loss of x</font>

488
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:18,090
percent of revenue and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Chris will give</font>

489
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:19,770
you more concrete information on how to

490
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:22,050
start<font color="#CCCCCC"> putting those kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of figures in</font>

491
00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:24,030
front of executives in a short while

492
00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:25,980
then you also need to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at things</font>

493
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:29,100
like you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know businesses really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> care</font>

494
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:30,390
about damage to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Brad massively care</font>

495
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:32,399
about that probably even more so

496
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:34,290
nowadays than they would have a year or

497
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,720
two ago with things like social

498
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:38,399
networking you know if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're breached</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">you're the news of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Twitter</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and security</font>

500
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:42,210
at least for a day or week and you're

501
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:45,060
the example that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we always mark until</font>

502
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:46,530
the next conflict comes along as as hard

503
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:48,510
as<font color="#E5E5E5"> it sounds that's the way it is and</font>

504
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:50,820
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can you can use some of those things</font>

505
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:52,560
as real world examples<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean look at</font>

506
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:56,250
our assay for example that I think if

507
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:57,720
you google<font color="#E5E5E5"> RSA security last week at</font>

508
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:59,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">least I think about half of the results</font>

509
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:02,520
on the first page of Google or about me

510
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:04,290
packed you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's not you know</font>

00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:06,150
using<font color="#E5E5E5"> for donuts and that's actually</font>

512
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:08,399
take him in a real example and saying to

513
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:11,040
the business you know we're not maybe as

514
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:12,600
big a brand as RSA but look this is what

515
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:16,620
happened to<font color="#E5E5E5"> our a safe and apps they got</font>

516
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:20,040
hacked and then make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that we</font>

517
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:22,530
present<font color="#CCCCCC"> findings in a format that makes</font>

518
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:24,629
sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's important to think about</font>

519
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:26,550
a format that makes sense to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

520
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:29,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">business rather than necessarily to us</font>

521
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:31,230
because the CBS s might make sense to

522
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:33,209
some of us but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that doesn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> make sense</font>

523
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:35,130
the business so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to translate</font>

524
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:38,690
that into a language<font color="#E5E5E5"> and a format that</font>

525
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:43,830
they care about and<font color="#CCCCCC"> make sense to him so</font>

526
00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:46,200
one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the biggest things I figured out</font>

527
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:48,120
when we were<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to really ramp up</font>

528
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:50,910
application security green X a couple of

529
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:52,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">years</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ago was the most important thing I</font>

530
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:55,680
ever did was<font color="#E5E5E5"> understand how the business</font>

531
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:57,720
schools risk and what we found<font color="#E5E5E5"> was that</font>

532
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:59,280
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> business in all the other areas</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

533
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:01,050
the business whether its results in in

534
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:03,300
projects whether its operational or its

535
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:06,200
finance whatever it might be they all

536
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:08,490
scored risk in the same way the the

537
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:11,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">rankings were sliding it from because</font>

538
00:21:08,490 --> 00:21:13,610
they had you know definitions

539
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:16,129
for a project so you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> this project</font>

540
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:18,290
might sleep set by five weeks or from a

541
00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:20,870
finance point of view might be losing<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10</font>

542
00:21:18,290 --> 00:21:23,270
major customers in a month<font color="#CCCCCC"> but then</font>

543
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:25,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">house security rankings were not even</font>

544
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:27,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">anywhere close to matching up to what</font>

545
00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:30,110
the business spoke about and what they

546
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:31,400
ultimately made decisions based on so

547
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:34,699
let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> take that same sequel injection</font>

548
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:37,340
again and look at look at it in terms of

549
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:40,160
a much simpler very common way of

550
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:43,280
scoring list you know probability tomes

551
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:44,750
impact it is a fairly simple way of

552
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:47,000
scores risk but if that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way the</font>

553
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:48,260
rest of your business scores risk and

554
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,880
that's the way you should at<font color="#CCCCCC"> least</font>

555
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:52,490
present your findings to the business

556
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:54,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm not saying don't things like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> CBS s</font>

557
00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:56,210
I'm saying when you take a day to and

558
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:58,460
want to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> the business to look at it</font>

559
00:21:56,210 --> 00:22:00,620
put it<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a format that they they use</font>

560
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:03,919
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they care about so if we look at</font>

561
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:05,840
this if we take<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've just making up</font>

562
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:07,340
numbers here I guess to some degree we

563
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:09,500
give it a probability of<font color="#CCCCCC"> three which</font>

564
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:11,720
might be<font color="#E5E5E5"> this happens every six months</font>

565
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:14,780
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's an impact of five because we're</font>

566
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:17,330
saying when<font color="#CCCCCC"> we put it in CBS s that it's</font>

567
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:18,860
a catastrophic loss of data it's up<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

568
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:20,659
twenty-five percent of our system

00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:22,600
doesn't work for authentication that's

570
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:25,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">also it could be an impact the file and</font>

572
00:22:25,370 --> 00:22:29,270
to work with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the business and understand</font>

might be losing the top five customers

577
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:40,129
all within a month you can put a

score an application security risk and

589
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:05,928
if we look at this here we got a total

590
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:08,209
score of 15 the business has an appetite

00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:15,440
2.2 that look at that and say that goes

to right to the bottom<font color="#CCCCCC"> haan get to</font>

we address these<font color="#CCCCCC"> other Condon's at risk</font>

00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:28,759
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't think any of us could really cope</font>

599
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:31,129
with doing at<font color="#CCCCCC"> all of the time but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

00:23:28,759 --> 00:23:33,500
times when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want them to make</font>

601
00:23:31,129 --> 00:23:35,059
decisions make decisions<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you want</font>

them<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make make sure that you're</font>

603
00:23:35,059 --> 00:23:38,330
giving them the information that they

00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:40,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">need in the format that they want to see</font>

605
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:42,080
and then ultimately understand that

606
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:43,610
application security or security as a

607
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:45,529
whole there's no exception when it comes

608
00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:48,110
to resource it<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually doesn't really</font>

609
00:23:45,529 --> 00:23:50,500
matter that there's you know the trouble

610
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:52,939
we have with the economy<font color="#CCCCCC"> at the moment</font>

611
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:54,500
regardless of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there you need to</font>

612
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:56,899
justify your results and be realistic

613
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:59,570
with it don't if you go away from here

614
00:23:56,899 --> 00:24:01,729
today look at your application security

615
00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:05,000
program i implement that then you'll

616
00:24:01,730 --> 00:24:06,230
probably find hundreds of issues if you

617
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,000
go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> business with a list of</font>

618
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:09,500
hundreds of issues long they might<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

619
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,600
look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and say that's too big for</font>

620
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:14,240
us<font color="#CCCCCC"> to deal or you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> might look a bit like</font>

621
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:16,100
the boy who cried wolf so again be

622
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:18,559
realistic with your<font color="#E5E5E5"> expectations score</font>

623
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:20,809
risk and score those issues in terms

624
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:24,110
that they care about and<font color="#E5E5E5"> take your most</font>

625
00:24:20,809 --> 00:24:25,340
critical issues to them and then you

626
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:28,820
might start to see things being

627
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:30,289
addressed and then ultimately try to

628
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:31,789
keep everything simple what I'm trying

629
00:24:30,289 --> 00:24:33,789
to do whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do with application</font>

630
00:24:31,789 --> 00:24:36,919
security is follow the KISS principle so

631
00:24:33,789 --> 00:24:38,629
keep it simple stupid or keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> it short</font>

632
00:24:36,919 --> 00:24:41,840
simple depends on I guess who you

633
00:24:38,629 --> 00:24:43,100
explain the KISS principle to and just

634
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:46,100
try and<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep everything as simple as</font>

635
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:48,230
possible it doesn't matter I suppose in

636
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:49,879
how you do your analysis now you come up

637
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:51,830
with your<font color="#CCCCCC"> results you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can do that</font>

638
00:24:49,879 --> 00:24:53,418
however you want but it's how do you

639
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:55,250
present that out to the people you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font>

640
00:24:53,419 --> 00:24:58,730
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make decisions try and keep that as</font>

641
00:24:55,250 --> 00:25:00,409
simple as possible and ultimately speak

642
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:03,500
with your developers understand what

643
00:25:00,409 --> 00:25:06,110
they need to write secure come it isn't

644
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:07,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">just a once a year refresher on what the</font>

645
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:10,519
OS top<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten is it's much more than that</font>

646
00:25:07,879 --> 00:25:12,019
but you need to understand and listen to

647
00:25:10,519 --> 00:25:14,929
what they're telling you they need to

648
00:25:12,019 --> 00:25:16,580
write secure code and then lastly you

649
00:25:14,929 --> 00:25:17,450
know work with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the business understand</font>

650
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:19,939
their languages on

651
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:23,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">sender formats and understand what they</font>

652
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:26,059
actually care about ok so I'll hand over

653
00:25:23,929 --> 00:25:28,460
to Chris now where he'll kind of carry

654
00:25:26,059 --> 00:25:32,418
on the chain within the business so uh

655
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:34,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">thanks dear son to you um so if you</font>

656
00:25:32,419 --> 00:25:36,679
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me back in the 90s I was well</font>

657
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:38,449
pond at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> loft and I was sort of on</font>

658
00:25:36,679 --> 00:25:43,299
the offense I'd doing vulnerability

659
00:25:38,450 --> 00:25:46,720
research writing tools to act systems

660
00:25:43,299 --> 00:25:49,460
but now I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a professional PR team I</font>

661
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:50,450
which means that<font color="#CCCCCC"> know I can win</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> awards</font>

662
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:52,010
now because if you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

663
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:55,700
professional PR team you're never going

664
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:58,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">to get these right and you know my job</font>

665
00:25:55,700 --> 00:26:00,260
is basically to help people<font color="#E5E5E5"> write secure</font>

666
00:25:58,549 --> 00:26:02,600
applications put together application

667
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:06,019
security programs so their organizations

668
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:08,809
can produce<font color="#E5E5E5"> secure code whether internal</font>

669
00:26:06,019 --> 00:26:11,870
or their vendor and they're selling that

670
00:26:08,809 --> 00:26:14,059
code so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know why do we need</font>

671
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:16,039
executive Mayan is because to do

672
00:26:14,059 --> 00:26:22,029
application security we typically need

673
00:26:16,039 --> 00:26:25,490
resources we need tools we need training

674
00:26:22,029 --> 00:26:28,370
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> also it's going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to have an impact on</font>

675
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:30,289
the business it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably going to at</font>

676
00:26:28,370 --> 00:26:34,639
least in the beginning change change

677
00:26:30,289 --> 00:26:37,549
development schedules and we don't want

678
00:26:34,639 --> 00:26:39,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">it to be voluntary right we don't want</font>

679
00:26:37,549 --> 00:26:41,240
some development teams to say we're

680
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:44,360
going to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> securecode another one say</font>

681
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:46,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">it doesn't really matter to us if it</font>

682
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:48,740
matters to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> business it can't be</font>

683
00:26:46,399 --> 00:26:50,739
voluntary so because of this we're going

684
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:53,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">to need money and we're going to need</font>

685
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:55,580
authority or it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to work</font>

686
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:57,740
so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> why we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> need to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get executive</font>

687
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:59,120
by and we just can't get buy-in from the

688
00:26:57,740 --> 00:27:02,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">development team so it's really a</font>

689
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:05,389
top-down and bottom-up process to get

690
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:12,918
application security working within a

691
00:27:05,389 --> 00:27:14,600
business so the David talked about you

692
00:27:12,919 --> 00:27:15,710
know speaking speaking the language of

693
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,908
the business and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm going to make it</font>

694
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:19,639
even<font color="#E5E5E5"> more simple here this is the</font>

695
00:27:16,909 --> 00:27:20,330
language that<font color="#E5E5E5"> CEOs understands</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> CFO's</font>

696
00:27:19,639 --> 00:27:23,178
understand

697
00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:24,769
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> cios understands it's very simple</font>

698
00:27:23,179 --> 00:27:29,140
speaking the language of the business

699
00:27:24,769 --> 00:27:32,000
means putting things in monetary terms

700
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:33,620
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how executives think how am i</font>

701
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,110
growing my business how am i growing my

702
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:38,809
top line it's dollars right it's not

703
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:42,350
like how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> states am I in how many</font>

704
00:27:38,809 --> 00:27:44,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">countries mi in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> its how much how many</font>

705
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:46,610
what's the revenue number of the

706
00:27:44,539 --> 00:27:48,799
business when they talk about lowering

707
00:27:46,610 --> 00:27:51,918
<font color="#E5E5E5">costs obviously that's money too but</font>

708
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:53,750
mitigating risk they think in terms of

709
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:55,820
dollars when we think about mitigating

710
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:58,090
risk<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's really its technical what is</font>

711
00:27:55,820 --> 00:28:01,158
the likelihood that this is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

712
00:27:58,090 --> 00:28:04,639
exploited or you know can I make<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

713
00:28:01,159 --> 00:28:08,269
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the impact is less and and then we</font>

714
00:28:04,639 --> 00:28:10,100
speak in technical terms they speak when

715
00:28:08,269 --> 00:28:12,470
they talk about executives talk about

716
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:14,090
risk it's almost always translated into

717
00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:15,380
a monetary terms so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have to figure</font>

718
00:28:14,090 --> 00:28:17,959
<font color="#CCCCCC">out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a way to translate this into</font>

719
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:21,169
monetary terms or it's not going to make

720
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:23,210
sense and you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> David brought up some</font>

721
00:28:21,169 --> 00:28:25,669
some points of like you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know what is the</font>

722
00:28:23,210 --> 00:28:27,380
law sales going to be you know it's got

723
00:28:25,669 --> 00:28:29,870
to be translated<font color="#CCCCCC"> into some numbers so</font>

724
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:32,630
here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> some other examples of areas of</font>

725
00:28:29,870 --> 00:28:35,268
risk in that executives need to think

726
00:28:32,630 --> 00:28:39,110
about they think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> legal risk right</font>

727
00:28:35,269 --> 00:28:41,299
when they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> something that you</font>

728
00:28:39,110 --> 00:28:44,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">know might be risky from a legal</font>

729
00:28:41,299 --> 00:28:46,039
perspective the lawyer has his own

730
00:28:44,299 --> 00:28:48,529
language<font color="#CCCCCC"> or her own language that they</font>

731
00:28:46,039 --> 00:28:51,679
speak in just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like we have our own</font>

732
00:28:48,529 --> 00:28:53,600
language but the end of the day so that

733
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:58,340
executive can make a decision on whether

734
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:59,750
to sue someone or not not not run some

735
00:28:58,340 --> 00:29:02,510
part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the business because it's too</font>

736
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:04,789
risky from a legal perspective the

737
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:06,580
lawyer puts the risk into monetary terms

738
00:29:04,789 --> 00:29:09,080
what are the court costs going to be

739
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:11,330
what is a potential fine going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

740
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:14,000
what will be the settlement costs of

741
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:16,399
this so the legal risk is translated

742
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,500
into monetary terms same thing with

743
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:21,879
compliance risk there's all kinds of

744
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:25,190
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> things you need to comply with</font>

745
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:26,929
employment regulations environmental

746
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:29,360
regulations you know we think about

747
00:29:26,929 --> 00:29:30,680
compliance as you know all<font color="#CCCCCC"> IT focus but</font>

748
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:32,719
there's a lot of compliance

749
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:36,350
have to deal with and if they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

750
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:39,140
complying you know what's the lost

751
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:42,290
business what are the fines that's that

752
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:44,630
that's what it comes down to and even

753
00:29:42,290 --> 00:29:46,670
even fuzzy things like brand risk

754
00:29:44,630 --> 00:29:49,670
marketing people translate this into

755
00:29:46,670 --> 00:29:53,030
dollars what is my lost business going

756
00:29:49,670 --> 00:29:55,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be because our brand got tarnished</font>

757
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:57,440
somehow you know we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> getting sued by</font>

758
00:29:55,220 --> 00:30:00,230
the government you know we're seeing

759
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:02,390
we're seeing we're measuring how that's

760
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:06,410
impacting the business of them to the

761
00:30:02,390 --> 00:30:07,760
brand risk so for security risk how do

762
00:30:06,410 --> 00:30:10,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">we do what these other professions are</font>

763
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:13,550
able to do right there<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're probably</font>

764
00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:16,010
more mature as professions but they

765
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:17,210
figured out<font color="#E5E5E5"> a way to communicate what</font>

766
00:30:16,010 --> 00:30:18,530
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to get done</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and what they</font>

767
00:30:17,210 --> 00:30:23,990
think has value to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the business to</font>

768
00:30:18,530 --> 00:30:25,430
executives so one way that this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font>

769
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:29,300
model<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm working on it's obviously not</font>

770
00:30:25,430 --> 00:30:31,490
not perfect this is a challenging<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font>

771
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:34,340
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do but translate technical risk into</font>

772
00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:37,130
into monetary risk using some data data

773
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:39,709
sources that are that are out there so

774
00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:41,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">to actually take you know the technical</font>

775
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:45,610
risk which is those vulnerabilities in

776
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:47,629
your application portfolio because

777
00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:48,919
speaking at a high level here the

778
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:50,990
business cares about all its

779
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:54,170
applications not just one which a

780
00:30:50,990 --> 00:30:56,840
development team might care about and

781
00:30:54,170 --> 00:30:58,850
look at expected loss derived from those

782
00:30:56,840 --> 00:31:05,439
vulnerabilities the threats<font color="#E5E5E5"> based data</font>

783
00:30:58,850 --> 00:31:08,330
out there in actual breach costs so

784
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:10,670
breach costs is something that there's

785
00:31:08,330 --> 00:31:12,280
really not enough data out there if your

786
00:31:10,670 --> 00:31:14,660
organization has been breached before

787
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:17,300
you can you can use that you can

788
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:18,800
understand what your costs were you know

789
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:22,310
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> were your fines what was your</font>

790
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:24,590
mediation costs things like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and</font>

791
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:26,720
then translate it on the vulnerabilities

792
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:28,310
that led<font color="#CCCCCC"> to that reach and translate it</font>

793
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:30,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">to the other vulnerabilities in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

794
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:32,570
organization but<font color="#E5E5E5"> if your organization</font>

795
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:34,400
hasn't been breached by<font color="#E5E5E5"> application</font>

796
00:31:32,570 --> 00:31:38,629
security you probably don't have this

797
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:42,250
data so the Ponemon Institute ponymon

798
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:46,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">Institute did a survey last</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> year of</font>

799
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:48,790
different industries and they broke it

800
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:51,280
down into detection escalation

801
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:55,149
notification ex post response and lost

802
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:58,840
business and came up with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the average</font>

803
00:31:55,150 --> 00:32:01,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">and then per capita which is a record</font>

804
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:05,350
stones this is kind of record bass was

805
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:07,750
kind of a PII centric view of the world

806
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:09,820
which<font color="#E5E5E5"> is both good if that's the risk to</font>

807
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:12,130
your businesses is getting PII expose

808
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:15,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's not so good if if your business is</font>

809
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:17,470
not that if it's not you probably have

810
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:20,590
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> find some reach costs that are more</font>

811
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:23,530
related to your business and the risks

812

in your business but<font color="#E5E5E5"> since it's the best</font>

813
00:32:23,530 --> 00:32:27,280
data out there I use<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and you can</font>

see<font color="#E5E5E5"> the down here I don't know if you</font>

815
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:31,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">could see in the back but there's</font>

816
00:32:28,210 --> 00:32:34,480
different industries like financial it's

817
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:38,220
248 dollars per record is the cost of a

818
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:41,230
breach whereas consumer is only 159

819
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:43,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">pharma it's 310 so different you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can see</font>

820
00:32:41,230 --> 00:32:46,090
right away that this is this is has some

821
00:32:43,930 --> 00:32:50,440
value<font color="#CCCCCC"> to an executive because they're</font>

seeing like<font color="#CCCCCC"> peer industry verticals what</font>

823
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:54,160
were their costs from from breaches you

00:32:52,660 --> 00:33:00,610
have to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it you have to make it as</font>

00:32:54,160 --> 00:33:03,850
relevant as possible and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then a way to</font>

826
00:33:00,610 --> 00:33:06,370
make vulnerabilities real is not to not

827
00:33:03,850 --> 00:33:09,100
to deal with them in isolation<font color="#E5E5E5"> but to</font>

828
00:33:06,370 --> 00:33:11,199
actually look at Fred space data and see

829
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:13,750
what our attacker is actually exploiting

830
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:16,030
that that's actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> leading to leading</font>

to compromises that are impacting real

00:33:16,030 --> 00:33:22,420
businesses this data comes from last

833
00:33:18,490 --> 00:33:26,920
year's verizon data data breach report

834
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:28,240
and these were real real real incidents

835
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:31,440
that had a real impact to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> business</font>

836
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:33,970
they had they had to investigate them

837
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:37,090
whether they were compelled to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do it</font>

838
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:38,920
because they're regulated or or they

839
00:33:37,090 --> 00:33:40,419
needed to call someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> in to you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

840
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:42,580
actually clean it up and figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out what</font>

841
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:46,350
happened but verizon collects this data

842
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:49,300
and these are the different<font color="#E5E5E5"> attack types</font>

843
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:51,370
that are used and one of the attack

844
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:54,669
types that's used quite often is

845
00:33:51,370 --> 00:33:56,830
hacking and this adds up to more than

846
00:33:54,670 --> 00:34:00,420
100<font color="#E5E5E5"> because a typical attack will have</font>

you know there might be hacking in order

849
