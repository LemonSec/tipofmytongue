always to to split my business and my

nothing rated to my job in my job I'm

this really<font color="#CCCCCC"> a nice picture why because</font>

internal resource inside the

72
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:15,870
organization it was it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a lot of</font>

73

resources we will see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> later in</font>

74
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:21,750
terms of people in terms of money but

75
00:03:17,609 --> 00:03:25,889
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to to assign some resources to</font>

00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:28,620
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> project first regarding the locks</font>

77
00:03:25,889 --> 00:03:31,410
what's very important is you need

78
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:33,540
disability so heavy body can read loss

79
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:35,359
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you cannot extract the right</font>

80
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:38,790
information of the right woman it's a

81
00:03:35,359 --> 00:03:40,919
senseless awfully we have no dickhead

82
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:42,989
use computers and we can also use

83
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:45,000
reproduce to manage shows because<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

84
00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:47,849
computer is more definition that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I could</font>

85
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,130
be based on internet so via computers so

86
00:03:47,849 --> 00:03:52,048
computers generate<font color="#E5E5E5"> locks but the same</font>

87
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:53,819
computers can also be used to process

88
00:03:52,049 --> 00:03:57,510
them and to extract right information

89
00:03:53,819 --> 00:03:59,179
it's very very good to increase

90
00:03:57,510 --> 00:04:03,120
visibility<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're going to see later that</font>

91
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:05,099
we can also<font color="#CCCCCC"> integrated with multiple</font>

92
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,590
source of information<font color="#CCCCCC"> coming from all</font>

93
00:04:05,099 --> 00:04:09,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">systems for third-party systems and we</font>

94
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:12,659
will have more chance<font color="#CCCCCC"> to detect</font>

95
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:14,370
suspicious very suspicious<font color="#E5E5E5"> villains and</font>

96
00:04:12,659 --> 00:04:17,010
finally the goal of the load management

97
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:19,310
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> to detect activity below the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> rhythm</font>

98
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:22,469
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> as we saw in the previous</font>

99
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:24,719
presentation you will maybe have program

100
00:04:22,469 --> 00:04:26,700
running on the system the savings on

101
00:04:24,719 --> 00:04:29,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">firewalls</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> epics on to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some security</font>

102
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:32,039
stuff but such event will be hidden<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

103
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:34,620
the global show you prefer so the goal

104
00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:36,390
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> to really put the bright point</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

105
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:38,969
right on the right events that will this

106
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:43,740
one's issues I<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to take some action</font>

107
00:04:38,969 --> 00:04:46,770
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of issues to manage</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">the direct three</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> type with you the first</font>

109
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:51,690
10 technical issue it's easy to

110
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:53,640
understand all your networks are more

111
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:55,150
and more complexity equal to integrate a

112
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:57,849
lot of our<font color="#CCCCCC"> clients</font>

113
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:59,770
the application so it may<font color="#CCCCCC"> be my friend</font>

windows tunic system you have Reuters

of nice of my appliance and all of them

generic drugs and in different different

118
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:15,700
ways so they can use some different

119

application you can take a neutral<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah</font>

120
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:20,800
didn't use some protocols from<font color="#E5E5E5"> proposed</font>

are completely closed like the upset for

00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:29,859
checkpoint firewalls and they generate a

lot of even spread million thousand

to a partner you maybe have some

131
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,470
also those applications a great rocks

possible the most important fields we

can't sorry oops help

465
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:50,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">so we need to store all the events on</font>

central place for immediate processing

467
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:55,379
but we need also to store them in an

archiving system<font color="#E5E5E5"> for long-term retention</font>

00:21:55,380 --> 00:22:00,700
yeah long-term retention what does it

470
00:21:57,910 --> 00:22:04,480
mean if you fall into some complaints

471
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:06,490
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> buy pci pci something at 90 days</font>

00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:17,860
archiving is important and once again

476
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:19,600
immunity is really important if a<font color="#E5E5E5"> system</font>

so expected irrigon so you need to

499
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:24,570
here is we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are looking for also for</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">small seniors so we don't know exactly</font>

00:23:26,670 --> 00:23:30,660
suspicions we know that suspicious

503
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:33,420
activities happened last night so we

504

start<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the time window between 2am</font>

errors coming from you will find

commercial we are really looking for

508

smoke signals the next one it's

509
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:53,190
reporting and you'll make it only<font color="#E5E5E5"> meant</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">very important we were only if the first</font>

step is working processing so when you

512
00:23:55,290 --> 00:23:59,670
deploy the solution reporting is the

513
00:23:57,690 --> 00:24:01,530
next step first to make sure that<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

the<font color="#CCCCCC"> reports which address their audience</font>

523
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:30,980
you can also have business reports

on the difference or so it's a

correlation moon again right the

544
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:28,400
resultant relation will be effective

00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:31,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">only if the other steps are working</font>

to incident management because based

you will integrate support it to train

also a free premonition system the

00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:11,840
biggest issue is it's a healthy part

666
00:31:09,529 --> 00:31:15,440
because you have no money<font color="#E5E5E5"> regarding the</font>

to start up is spc simple event or later

673

00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:44,750
it you must be a pearl regular

677
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:45,950
expression<font color="#E5E5E5"> do check this one the pattern</font>

679
00:31:45,950 --> 00:31:50,360
everybody but this it's not the very

680
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:53,809
complicated one but you need to have

681
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:55,580
some background in the regression and

682
00:31:53,809 --> 00:31:57,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">this too is very interesting because it</font>

683
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:59,809
can produce new events you can treat

your scripts and right to<font color="#CCCCCC"> find if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

00:31:59,809 --> 00:32:03,529
detect some things issues so these are I

686
00:32:02,029 --> 00:32:06,490
just got paid this example<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

00:32:03,529 --> 00:32:09,250
documentation when we just have a single

it's a regular expression<font color="#E5E5E5"> even if we</font>

689
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:13,120
match this pattern if you have Cisco

690
00:32:11,770 --> 00:32:15,070

691
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:17,379
tremendous fight we load either if

692
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:20,080
actually loaded and you can help

693
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:22,450
description so on it it we don't

694
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:27,600
represent for device lab and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can</font>

696
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:33,070
so it's quite simple like a native size

697
00:32:31,270 --> 00:32:35,470
but it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not very easy to implement</font>

698
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:38,010
people should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be to play with various</font>

699
00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:41,830
pressures but it's better than nothing

700
00:32:38,010 --> 00:32:46,030
the next one my favorite I really like

701
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:49,149
this project<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh SI OS tech is a hospice</font>

705
00:32:57,550 --> 00:33:03,460
nice tool what it does so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

detect

716

you can generate something else send

if you are that's why when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> define</font>

837

839

database and of course of course if you

840
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:32,320
are

841
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:35,379
root access of the database you can wear

842
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:37,450
a senior of course but in fact the goal

843
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:39,430
is if I find a petition here if you have

844
00:39:37,450 --> 00:39:41,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">verification somebody adds a new user</font>

845
00:39:39,430 --> 00:39:45,419
but you admin user<font color="#E5E5E5"> learning a cosmic</font>

defend future get rite which<font color="#CCCCCC"> write a</font>

temporary papers temper integrals are

851
00:39:58,030 --> 00:40:03,670
very very useful<font color="#E5E5E5"> in sealed environment</font>

852
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:06,009
the purpose is to detect suspicious for

853
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:08,200
example users nine campuses it's a

854
00:40:06,010 --> 00:40:11,050
common feature on commercial product

it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> available on I said</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's why</font>

856
00:40:11,050 --> 00:40:15,400
I want a patch to have this mentality

857
00:40:13,050 --> 00:40:18,359
basically you have a table when you put

858
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:21,310
IP addresses and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you only put usernames</font>

859
00:40:18,359 --> 00:40:22,839
this to stables can be completed by

860
00:40:21,310 --> 00:40:25,540
external sources so you don't

861
00:40:22,839 --> 00:40:29,109

912
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:59,930
that world it goes one pictures it's was

913

a lot of information community loves but

using a cheap price to a lamp server I

923

show with one page so i have a trend

924
00:43:28,850 --> 00:43:34,670
level so based on the all the right we

925
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:36,470
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> select which interval time you need</font>

926
00:43:34,670 --> 00:43:38,930
and basically Stefan you have to Train

927
00:43:36,470 --> 00:43:40,459
compared to the previous interval we

928
00:43:38,930 --> 00:43:43,220
have the top<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten alerts top</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ten</font>

929
00:43:40,460 --> 00:43:45,980

00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:48,350
rest which occur or<font color="#E5E5E5"> more only one time</font>
