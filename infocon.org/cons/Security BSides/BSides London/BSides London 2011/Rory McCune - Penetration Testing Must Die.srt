00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:04,830
something to try and fix it so that

00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:42,710
you actually are so if someone doesn't

know her secure they are well then

127

00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,870
have they been fixed how many fixed the

00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:15,980
major the<font color="#E5E5E5"> majority of them that's what</font>

146
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:17,600
they're looking for but they want to say

147
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:20,450
we fix those then were in a good place

148
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,590
if they got<font color="#CCCCCC"> that far</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and they think</font>

149
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:22,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're okay then they're ready</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for a</font>

150
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:24,138
pen test because then you guys should go

151
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:25,610
in and say can I compromise you don't

152
00:05:24,139 --> 00:05:28,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's possible and that's when you</font>

153
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:28,660
get your blank scope

154
00:05:30,409 --> 00:05:36,319
because they want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see the label now</font>

155
00:05:32,599 --> 00:05:37,610
it is all Aziz's yeah absolutely<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

156
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:39,409
when the<font color="#E5E5E5"> problems</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pc rise a great</font>

159
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:44,449

160
00:05:42,289 --> 00:05:46,099
if they had a pc i use so many companies

161
00:05:44,449 --> 00:05:48,110
who really touch security wasn't the VCR

162
00:05:46,099 --> 00:05:49,639
however one of the terrible<font color="#E5E5E5"> things it</font>

163
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:51,679
does is it<font color="#CCCCCC"> says you must have a chem</font>

164
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:52,999
test and uses those words and that's one

165
00:05:51,679 --> 00:05:54,619
saying overlords terminology because

166
00:05:52,999 --> 00:05:56,719
there's no<font color="#CCCCCC"> other</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> return for them to use</font>

167
00:05:54,619 --> 00:05:58,849
they had to use pen test so they used

168
00:05:56,719 --> 00:05:59,929
pen test and as a result everyone is no

169
00:05:58,849 --> 00:06:01,128
<font color="#E5E5E5">going on at single i have to have a pen</font>

170
00:05:59,929 --> 00:06:02,479
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's kind kind of it can't buy</font>

171
00:06:01,129 --> 00:06:04,489
anything else on you because<font color="#E5E5E5"> i've got a</font>

172

173
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:07,729
that's a real problem because it means

174
00:06:06,709 --> 00:06:09,289
people are selling their own very

175
00:06:07,729 --> 00:06:10,429
defined little thing and people are also

176
00:06:09,289 --> 00:06:15,169
not delivered and stuff they want a bit

177
00:06:10,429 --> 00:06:16,909

I won't touch it not going to happen so

186
00:06:29,869 --> 00:06:33,860
and and here's the behind my leadership

00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:50,380
you put out a sales document you say to

up is because I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> seen a lot chatting</font>

285
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:15,370
improper pen testing and that worries me

286
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:16,630
because you're dead right people aren't

287
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:18,340
catching the stuff that is out there and

288
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:19,950
if you look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the new verizon thing</font>

289
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:21,850
that came<font color="#E5E5E5"> out yesterday the number of</font>

290
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:23,470
breaches that were responsible to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

291
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:26,500
attachable or unpack look we're really

292
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:27,700
though it's just like but I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen that</font>

293
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,960
argument levied and that worries me

294
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:30,550
because I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> he'd give up my dental</font>

295
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:31,660
idea I have to have something to advise

296
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:38,979
you know date otherwise i'm not gonna

297
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:41,050
prevent any more and that yeah yeah but

298
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:43,140
missed in time there is also the fact

299
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:43,140
that

300
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:53,279
engineering at hands yeah whereas the

301
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:54,779
potential of<font color="#CCCCCC"> care is those you see some</font>

302
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:56,400
companies do see some<font color="#E5E5E5"> currently starting</font>

303
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:58,500
to do that way of saying and think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

304
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:59,970
social media<font color="#E5E5E5"> tool kit are starting to</font>

305
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:01,140
push people<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the idea that social</font>

306
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:02,820
engineering is an absolutely fundamental

307
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:04,890
part of a penetration test if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you are</font>

308
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:06,930
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to emulate an attacker who would</font>

309
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:08,850
use that<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a which is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the critical</font>

310
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:13,709
point is who are you<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to any of it</font>

311
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:16,770
so fixing it all so the first thing I

312
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:20,130
reckon use different names for different

313
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:21,839
types of job stop buying thing just

314
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:24,000
caught it on to buy our chem test and

315
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:27,480
stop selling a thing to<font color="#E5E5E5"> just call the</font>

316
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,920
pen test but this is just a suggestion

317
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:30,690
there's some stuff on<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> monitor this</font>

318
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:32,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">is where</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll actually but maybe use one</font>

319
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:34,350
abilities can see you've actually done

320
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,790
your thread world link directly and

321
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:38,210
you've assessed that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gaming system</font>

322
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:40,439
is the only<font color="#CCCCCC"> everybody</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> targeted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but I</font>

323
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:42,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">non-targeted people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> by opportunistic</font>

324
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:43,890
attackers so what do you want to do is

325
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:45,449
emulate an opportunistic attacker you

326
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:48,089
don't want to go in there really heavy

327
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:49,140
because what's the point if you've done

328
00:11:48,089 --> 00:11:50,490
different world I mean you've come to

329
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:52,080
conclusion yoona think optimistic

330
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:55,070
attacks are there well<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe you want to</font>

331
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:58,040
use on with opportunistic testing method

332
00:11:55,070 --> 00:12:01,370
may become really understand with its

333
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:03,199
red agents will be little target is<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah</font>

334
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:04,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">an athletic Starbuck tech because right</font>

335
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,050
where the promise is it<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the pool</font>

336
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:08,120
problem is if you lose someone you say

337
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:10,400
whatever data is typically attacked and

338
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:11,750
breached I'm card data for example as if

339
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:13,430
red flag you know if you could card day

340
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:14,960
to your target you know if you do

341
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:16,339
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> which people are going to</font>

342
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:19,430
potentially find objectionable your

343
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:22,160
target but if none of those things apply

344
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:23,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">are your target yeah it bounced</font>

345
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:25,819
probability your right leg around upset

346
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:28,069
some we wake up tomorrow morning boy hey

347
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:29,930
the ship in tourism board especially

with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> increased</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> activism right you</font>

00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:32,870
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh yeah sure but you better say</font>

350
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:34,760
some people more likely get hacktivism

351
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:36,140
develops if your security company

352
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:37,310
absolutely you should<font color="#E5E5E5"> accept your</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">targeted we not going obvious the</font>

354
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:52,609
problem but otherwise yeah correct<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

355
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:54,589
agree with<font color="#E5E5E5"> me entirely I agree with you</font>

356
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:56,870
directly without is very bold like

357
00:12:54,590 --> 00:13:03,620
you're blaming your testing like Justin

358
00:12:56,870 --> 00:13:05,180
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the so if you work</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with it you're</font>

359
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:06,980
much more let's let's get targeted

360
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:09,050
argued managing the threat right now

361
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:10,790
manage the vulnerability is all and it

362
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:12,650
needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be partially saying who might</font>

363
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:14,329
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> be threatened by and when I'm</font>

364
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:16,310
doing texting I should be targeting<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

365
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:17,900
threat model and you have to get to

366
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:19,579
approximate greed you've never going to

367
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:20,870
be on represent right but you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can be a</font>

368
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:23,180
lot rather than to blindly say I'm just

369
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:24,710
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do the pen text on my exterior</font>

370
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:25,910
forever to which unfortunately is where

371
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:27,020
a lot of companies are sometimes a

372
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:28,640
better not got a lot of countries you

373
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:29,630
see what's by the dentist every year

374
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:31,610
because they've been<font color="#CCCCCC"> told</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they have to</font>

375
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:34,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">have the pen test and I that's not the</font>

376
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:36,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">best back pull up and then you can go up</font>

377
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:38,030
for their and these are all<font color="#CCCCCC"> assessments</font>

378
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:38,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">so whatever arguing is is the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> grading</font>

379
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:41,520
pad companies

380
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,600
mature so they don't understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> their</font>

381
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,710
security posture or they don't

382
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,420
understand where their run abilities

383
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:46,560
like that they are far better to be

384
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:48,240
looking at an assessment style

385
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:50,099
methodology so instead a big goal based

386
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,720
only trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> say here's your weekly</font>

387
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:53,640
really strong but we'll go in prov the

388
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:54,810
white box we won't go<font color="#E5E5E5"> in blackboard</font>

389
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:57,630
schedule a lot of time big black box

390
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:58,890
we're in reality they might benefit

391
00:13:57,630 --> 00:14:00,360
veteran being so visually strong here

392
00:13:58,890 --> 00:14:02,310
for your week here's where you're doing

393
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:04,230
things badly and we do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> eaten more</font>

394
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:05,459
quickly more effectively there's many a

395
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:07,260
lot of time researching and give them an

396
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:13,970
ability<font color="#CCCCCC"> waiting actually by</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> possible</font>

397
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:18,750
possible so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean test over to the book</font>

398
00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:20,760
but then once you've done that yeah so

399
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:22,170
hey I should<font color="#E5E5E5"> predict some people know</font>

400
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:25,350
about this threat model needs to be done

401
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:28,620
first the right type of<font color="#E5E5E5"> test for a</font>

402
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:29,670
customer so it's a source out yet so if

403
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:30,720
you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got people who are less developed</font>

404
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:32,189
they should gain assessment<font color="#E5E5E5"> start</font>

405
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">testing if you've got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people who are</font>

406
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:35,040
more developed that you're getting

407
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:37,170
absolutely than that point penetration

408
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:39,750
testing style testing<font color="#CCCCCC"> gold based testing</font>

409
00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:43,310
makes sense but it's actually getting

410
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:43,310
the right type of testing for a customer

411
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:06,248
that's amore amore considered approach

412
00:15:05,019 --> 00:15:07,990
to score purring I think the problem you

413
00:15:06,249 --> 00:15:10,329
see with Scott because is is this idea

414
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:12,339
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> one-size-fits-all and one type of</font>

415
00:15:10,329 --> 00:15:14,050
testing pixel and unfortunately things

416
00:15:12,339 --> 00:15:15,399
like pci<font color="#CCCCCC"> and things like the general the</font>

417
00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:16,748
use of the word pen testing this is why

418
00:15:15,399 --> 00:15:17,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">best pen testing will start it's not</font>

419
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:19,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">that I think this kiss have time to</font>

420
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,680
assess your security is a bad idea is

421
00:15:19,449 --> 00:15:26,439
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I really hate the fact that</font>

422
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:27,998
everything's a pen test for RTL task

423
00:15:26,439 --> 00:15:29,469
force oh yeah is what you call it does

424
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:31,660
really matter the problems that people

425
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:33,399
have you need to start off<font color="#E5E5E5"> by getting</font>

426
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:34,629
regulators in the industry<font color="#E5E5E5"> on stop off</font>

427

starting news<font color="#E5E5E5"> Nora pair testing</font>

428
00:15:34,629 --> 00:15:38,889
unfortunately the thing that really

429
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:40,269
concerns me is it's taken five years to

00:15:40,269 --> 00:15:43,269

is add text and now you get to another

period of time see<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay we made it back</font>

439
00:15:53,769 --> 00:15:56,709
for actually we didn't leave meeting

440
00:15:54,999 --> 00:15:57,910
that what we meant was you want to do

441
00:15:56,709 --> 00:15:59,079
some bread modeling you want to assess

442
00:15:57,910 --> 00:16:01,689
your risk appropriately event you want

00:16:09,069 --> 00:16:13,360
the SS<font color="#CCCCCC"> six and you know what they don't</font>

448
00:16:11,559 --> 00:16:14,649
say about safes when they<font color="#E5E5E5"> assess</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sa</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

don't see either yes i see but no it

450
00:16:14,649 --> 00:16:19,269
wasn't what they do is they say how long

451
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:21,879
is that safe able to resist more type of

452

attack or more part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the safety so</font>

453
00:16:21,879 --> 00:16:26,490
they say<font color="#E5E5E5"> the wait is saying 30 minutes</font>

454
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:28,839
with handheld tools on all<font color="#E5E5E5"> six sites</font>

455
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:29,829
that Kingdom assessment<font color="#E5E5E5"> serves to be</font>

456
00:16:28,839 --> 00:16:31,449
more like<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> should be doing on</font>

457
00:16:29,829 --> 00:16:33,309
security and when you're essentially

458
00:16:31,449 --> 00:16:35,559
security saying what a spectacle<font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font>

459
00:16:33,309 --> 00:16:37,959
industry for how long<font color="#E5E5E5"> using wall tools</font>

460
00:16:35,559 --> 00:16:39,879
and that Brady report that says that

461
00:16:37,959 --> 00:16:41,079
exactly someone can say here's why I

462
00:16:39,879 --> 00:16:43,950
think a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> tested against and hear you</font>

463
00:16:41,079 --> 00:16:52,900
i have a security

464
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:55,570
so secure about things that they're not

465
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:57,069
saying yes your car it's a lie but

466
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:59,460
that's my point is the fact that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

00:16:57,070 --> 00:17:02,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">moment you look at to an extent I'm</font>

468
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:04,030
generalizing by necessity but there are

00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:06,190
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a lot of cases the pen testing</font>

473
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,690
really want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to say is we spend this lot</font>

school resistant for a specific duration

487

and it specifies what type of attack you

one I mean definitely the swarm of

498
00:18:39,209 --> 00:18:42,809
outsourcing when you get companies like

499
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:44,369
Amazon and Google can take our family

500
00:18:42,809 --> 00:18:45,629
realistic approach to this where they

501
00:18:44,369 --> 00:18:46,918
also pay you to find stuff in their

502
00:18:45,629 --> 00:18:48,449
systems and you got all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> companies</font>

503
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:50,519
what if you try and<font color="#E5E5E5"> touch their systems</font>

504
00:18:48,450 --> 00:19:00,450
you forget it<font color="#E5E5E5"> we work to do a contest on</font>

yourself new yep<font color="#CCCCCC"> yep absolutely is this</font>

506
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:04,859
aspect of any type of that of attack is

automatically<font color="#E5E5E5"> malaysia's from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there for</font>

perspective if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> were tested</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

510
00:19:08,219 --> 00:19:11,190
reason that they do that is they've got

511
00:19:09,749 --> 00:19:12,690
availability up time so the reason there

512
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:15,209
is a social<font color="#CCCCCC"> service that the client is</font>

513
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:17,489
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's an SLA necessarily as uptight as is</font>

514
00:19:15,209 --> 00:19:19,079
it security subtype so if you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

515
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:20,459
system<font color="#E5E5E5"> over after the rest of then they</font>

516
00:19:19,079 --> 00:19:22,918
will lose money when I sell a that's all

517
00:19:20,459 --> 00:19:24,899
they care about so if you invest test

518
00:19:22,919 --> 00:19:26,009
notice so their incentive is to say no

519
00:19:24,899 --> 00:19:27,599
I'm not gonna like a test because you

520
00:19:26,009 --> 00:19:29,639
might knock it<font color="#E5E5E5"> over if you do not before</font>

00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:38,799
this we really want to do some security

526
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:40,870
testing but what we want to do is like

527
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:43,330
test that bit that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you've built mystical</font>

arrival it's not vulnerable to the

to test the whole environment<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

534
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:54,940
it and it's not centered in existing

00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:58,000
it which involves these people and what

537
00:19:56,650 --> 00:19:59,530
the business ultimately we talking for

538
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">the business and what business care of a</font>

business network money if you saw a

secure 32 insecure process and then that

541
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:07,270
gets hacked people it wasn't that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

542
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:08,910
know who's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to take it in the neck</font>

543
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:11,200
it's the kind you said that was secure

544
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:13,600
even though<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was actually you know so</font>

545
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:15,809
the problem is<font color="#E5E5E5"> Scott guests are you work</font>

546
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,809
next

progress<font color="#E5E5E5"> from this context in years and</font>

548
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:40,140
was

549
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:41,760
very very it comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> down to it comes to</font>

550
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:43,140
customer education in a large bar which

00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,490
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of these I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing so come to its</font>

552
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:45,570
customer education because until

553
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:46,890
customers know that they shouldn't ask

554
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:48,720
for that I told customers know that

555
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:50,700
actually you need to actually give it

556
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:53,550
more thought to that and if you ask<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

557
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:55,980
you can get what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want then they're</font>

you vet try that new way of doing and

they'll just<font color="#E5E5E5"> go over the horizon that</font>

already rising<font color="#CCCCCC"> fort came a couple</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> days</font>

ago it was fascinating<font color="#CCCCCC"> because it sure</font>

632
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:14,610
how many basic completely basic attacks

633
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:16,649
because they always<font color="#E5E5E5"> go in the easiest</font>

634

point they won't go<font color="#E5E5E5"> through so they were</font>

everything because frankly they will be

638
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:24,510
up above most of the opportunistic

639
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:26,310
attackers so<font color="#E5E5E5"> unless you're a real target</font>

640
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:27,600
choice focusing on getting the basics

641
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:29,040
right everywhere is actually more

642
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,810
important than focusing on having really

643
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:36,300
high stuff up here or in one place

644
00:24:30,810 --> 00:24:38,520
