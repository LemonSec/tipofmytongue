47
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:22,400
for powerpoint and basically they set a

48
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:23,720
set of rules it's very popular there are

49
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,859
meetings going on all over the world in

50
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:27,049
lots and lots of different countries and

51
00:03:24,859 --> 00:03:28,459
the rule is and it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> bad match against</font>

52
00:03:27,049 --> 00:03:30,170
traditional power point presentations

53
00:03:28,459 --> 00:03:31,220
where you know you've drawn this 500

54
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:33,589
slides and it's packed full of

55
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:36,950
information the rule is there's 20

56
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:39,170
slides 20 seconds per slide images only

57
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:42,320
that's the rule if you can tell your

58
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:44,030
story with that and so great it's a

59
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:47,980
great movement actually genuine<font color="#E5E5E5"> this it</font>

60
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:55,940
exists if you look up pecha kucha<font color="#CCCCCC"> ptch a</font>

pronounced cachaca then if you calculate

64
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:09,800
for do sums that's six point six minutes

65
00:04:08,299 --> 00:04:15,640
this presentation

circus this is its kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the mix</font>

that's in the company really<font color="#E5E5E5"> but we know</font>

communications problems and every bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

82
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:04,310
banal and rubbish but this really is to

83
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:05,659
bring some kind of reality back to

84
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:08,840
business<font color="#E5E5E5"> to business and business to</font>

employee communications using intimacy

86
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:12,739
and authenticity to feed a starving

87
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:15,640
workforce but well they are starving

88
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:21,250
because they're fed brand compliant

89
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:23,870
media usually information heavy usually

90
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:25,400
if it's a compliance issue like security

91
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:26,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">they have to read it's partly contract</font>

92
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:28,580
they have to go through<font color="#CCCCCC"> a PowerPoint</font>

93
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:30,200
presentation or online e-learning or

94
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:33,140
something like that they have to do it

95
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:34,460
and tick a box you and I both know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

96
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:36,140
that doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean they've understood it</font>

97
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:38,060
necessarily or worse still they

98
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:39,590
definitely engaged with it and they may

99
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:42,830
not change their behavior as a result of

100
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:43,940
that I know one executive that said to

101
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:45,740
me that when he<font color="#E5E5E5"> was going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> through his</font>

102
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:48,410
compliance training he paid his teenage

daughter thirty dollars to fill it after

104
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:52,880
she'd done her homework<font color="#CCCCCC"> my own extra</font>

105
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,230
money it got him accredited and it also

106
00:05:52,880 --> 00:06:00,169
meant she was really good<font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> information</font>

of<font color="#E5E5E5"> management who have the most to lose</font>

00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:13,710
access to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the leaders and they are the</font>

you can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get them on board then you</font>

they'd say that was just two characters

159
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:03,150
from a series of films that we made that

160
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:04,650
were hugely successful for them<font color="#E5E5E5"> even</font>

within the first<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten days they were</font>

00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:09,330
seeing sales increases of thirty percent

163
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:11,640
across at sample of 25 stores because of

164
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:13,979
the nature of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the little comedy series</font>

00:08:30,789 --> 00:08:33,669
proud and we also had access to the

00:08:32,049 --> 00:08:36,338
posters which we<font color="#E5E5E5"> could rewrite and</font>

176
00:08:33,669 --> 00:08:37,509
recast which was fun so<font color="#E5E5E5"> people would all</font>

take the posters because they use the

reasons can't meet in the video so

189

apologies guys but um you know where we

are hey<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Experian not too far</font>

191
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:18,579
away from here in Nottingham actually

192
00:09:16,779 --> 00:09:23,230
one of the closest companies we've ever

193
00:09:18,579 --> 00:09:25,290
worked for this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the work that we do</font>

194
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:27,149
for salary

195
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:28,680
I like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that idea that they're trying to</font>

196
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:30,600
integrate superheroes back into society

197
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:35,180
by letting workers in terms in your

198
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:37,649
company I think that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> great idea um so</font>

199
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:41,219
why did we land on information security

200
00:09:37,649 --> 00:09:45,589
as a niche market and essentially it sir

201
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:45,589
it's very difficult to make it look<font color="#E5E5E5"> sexy</font>

202
00:09:46,279 --> 00:09:49,860
you know the<font color="#E5E5E5"> real incidents for example</font>

203
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:51,779
one customer hadn't had an incident

204
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:53,639
where a<font color="#CCCCCC"> disk was lost now it didn't</font>

205
00:09:51,779 --> 00:09:55,829
surface the information on<font color="#E5E5E5"> it never came</font>

206
00:09:53,639 --> 00:09:57,990
to light but the information<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was on</font>

207
00:09:55,829 --> 00:10:01,519
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> was a major tender document for a</font>

208
00:09:57,990 --> 00:10:03,930
massive multi-million dollar project and

209
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:05,610
they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> terrified that the competition</font>

210
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:07,349
<font color="#CCCCCC">might get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> over</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this document and so they</font>

211
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:09,110
rewrite rewrote the entire security

212
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:12,870
policy to try and deal with this issue

213
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:17,730
and what happened was nobody went to the

214
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:19,589
website to<font color="#E5E5E5"> read that document you so we</font>

215
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:21,630
got a call to say how can<font color="#E5E5E5"> we make people</font>

216
00:10:19,589 --> 00:10:25,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">read this and said well</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I reckon</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> either</font>

217
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:27,449
threaten them or store or pay them

218
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:29,279
another<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those ideas we're going to</font>

219
00:10:27,449 --> 00:10:31,229
fly on budgets that I had and also the

220
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:33,870
illegal<font color="#CCCCCC"> T of actually hitting people</font>

221
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:34,860
making a big document so what we so what

222
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:37,260
we came up<font color="#E5E5E5"> with there's a series of</font>

223
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:39,029
short humorous videos and the contract

224
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:40,290
with the viewer is essentially that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

225
00:10:39,029 --> 00:10:42,420
if you give<font color="#CCCCCC"> me two or three minutes of</font>

226
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:44,189
your time we will entertain you that's

227
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:46,680
it it's a really simple<font color="#E5E5E5"> contract</font>

228
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:48,510
essentially because then you change the

229
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:53,189
whole dynamic of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the communications and</font>

230
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:55,589
training arrangement to a pull dynamic

231
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:56,370
rather than a push because a lot of

232
00:10:55,589 --> 00:10:58,410
people in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the room are probably</font>

233
00:10:56,370 --> 00:11:01,500
responsible for sending<font color="#CCCCCC"> our information</font>

234
00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:04,380
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> broadcast model yeah if I tell you</font>

235
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:06,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">everything I know regularly a Shirley</font>

236
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:08,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">Somerville stick you know but the</font>

237
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:10,709
opposite model we<font color="#E5E5E5"> found more effective</font>

238
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:12,930
where you make something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's sort of</font>

239
00:11:10,709 --> 00:11:14,609
viral because it's very specific to that

240
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:17,099
group of people IE everybody that works

241
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:18,810
at<font color="#CCCCCC"> that company and they're in to pull</font>

242
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:20,490
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> people got actually do you know</font>

243
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:22,170
art that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was quite funny</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

244
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:22,830
might<font color="#E5E5E5"> mention that to somebody at the</font>

245
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:24,930
water

246
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:26,130
the talk it's an American term really we

247
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:29,880
don't really talk around water cooler

248
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:30,960
theory so the smokers group but they'll

249
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:32,430
mention it to their friends and their

250
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:34,500
colleagues<font color="#CCCCCC"> or they'll send a link on</font>

251
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:35,819
internally and that happens a lot have

252
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:37,530
you seen this is this Britain have you

253
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:38,880
seen my informations to go to video it's

254
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:42,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">brilliant that's the sentence you don't</font>

255
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:44,640
hear very often and so then that acts as

256
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:45,630
the firework to attract people to a

257
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,040
landing page where there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

258
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:48,240
information<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> true</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in that</font>

259
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">mode we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't want to make you laugh for</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">two minutes you might go actually dinner</font>

261
00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:54,810
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know how to pick a good password</font>

262
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:56,220
click frequently asked questions what

263
00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:59,250
what you mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> encrypts an attachment</font>

264
00:11:56,220 --> 00:12:01,320
what do you mean that the uptake is far

265
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:03,270
far higher because<font color="#CCCCCC"> you set</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up a wrap or</font>

266
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:05,310
with the person so there are open to the

267
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:06,930
information<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's just really helpful and</font>

268
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:08,670
then the trick is<font color="#CCCCCC"> to not make it one</font>

269
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:11,010
firework or to let a firework off every

270
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:14,819
couple of weeks so<font color="#E5E5E5"> people go home not</font>

271
00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:18,360
next one is yeah so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the that's</font>

272
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:19,620
why information security and also the

273
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:21,060
interesting thing we found<font color="#E5E5E5"> after do a</font>

274
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:22,710
bit of research with some clients was

275
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:26,069
that the old way of doing it involved

276
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:27,120
the compliance training and i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not sure</font>

277
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:28,710
what sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> training you guys are</font>

278
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,180
involved<font color="#E5E5E5"> with but this is you know</font>

279
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:32,910
necessary as part of your employee

280
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:34,229
contract to do this training and so what

281
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:35,850
they will do this is one particular

282
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:38,250
system literally from one particular

283
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:40,470
client conversation so we make them do

284
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:43,130
the compliance training so that if they

285
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:45,420
breach the security we can sue them

286
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:46,830
because they ticked a box saying that

287
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:49,469
they read the document or they finish

288
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:51,150
the training good so then presumably you

289
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:55,230
have to find<font color="#E5E5E5"> some more people because</font>

290
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:56,730
you just sue<font color="#E5E5E5"> them all or whatever and we</font>

291
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:59,430
felt that<font color="#E5E5E5"> if people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just understood</font>

292
00:12:56,730 --> 00:13:01,020
context around what you're asking<font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

293
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:02,760
to do they probably do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> because they</font>

294
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:05,579
felt it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the right thing to do just</font>

295
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:07,380
putting it out there yeah so so<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

296
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:08,490
explaining context really helping them

297
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:10,439
understand and entertaining them a

298
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:12,570
little bit just raising awareness most

299
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:14,880
people aren't against picking a strong

300
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:16,200
password or you know remembering<font color="#E5E5E5"> to zip</font>

301
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,640
up an attachment or so do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know it</font>

302
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:19,200
adds a couple of seconds<font color="#CCCCCC"> to that day but</font>

303
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:20,720
they'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> probably do it if they</font>

304
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,770
understand how important it is

305
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,870
especially if understand<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's connected</font>

306
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:27,810
with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> safety and security of the</font>

307
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:29,580
company and therefore their job so

308
00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:33,010
anyway that's

309
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:34,720
the formula<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was in play at a</font>

310
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:36,400
particular customer and so the IT

311
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,900
department or<font color="#E5E5E5"> the information security</font>

312
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:39,760
department put on their own campaign and

313
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:43,900
so they'll find a picture<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a padlock</font>

314
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:45,310
symbol of<font color="#E5E5E5"> security that's like send that</font>

315
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:47,319
postcard with a padlock on it or

316
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:48,579
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then some bullet points on</font>

317
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:50,440
the back that say do this don't do this

318
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:51,340
don't do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this do this type of this so</font>

319
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:55,660
they're there to spoil<font color="#E5E5E5"> the party</font>

320
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:57,490
basically but that's a not creativity

321
00:13:55,660 --> 00:14:01,180
and it's not that<font color="#E5E5E5"> engaging and they've</font>

322
00:13:57,490 --> 00:14:04,500
seen it a million times I'm like really

323
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:04,500
this is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> best</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you could come up with</font>

324
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:13,390
so I've talked about port the pull

325
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:15,430
method of engagement one thing one force

326
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:18,189
of nature that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do come up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with is the</font>

327
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:19,989
internal communications department which

328
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:22,180
have a set of brand guidelines that have

329
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:26,040
to be there<font color="#CCCCCC"> too the trouble is if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

330
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:29,430
creative idea is set in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the 16th century</font>

331
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:31,540
when they didn't have Helvetica medium

332
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:33,310
what you do you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> because you've just</font>

333
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:36,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">killed your idea by having to use that</font>

334
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:39,339
font and not only<font color="#E5E5E5"> worldly or whatever my</font>

335
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:41,440
point is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the brand guidelines we</font>

336
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:42,580
forget what<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're for and for those</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

337
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,600
you that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> France advanced obsessions</font>

338
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:46,420
you won't know probably all about

339
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:48,220
objective setting and the idea that if

340
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:50,829
you look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the objective</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of a brand</font>

341
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:52,960
it's so that somebody in a warehouse in

342
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:55,690
Calcutta can label a<font color="#E5E5E5"> crate properly</font>

343
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:57,820
without it being in red crayon<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's to</font>

344
00:14:55,690 --> 00:15:00,370
bring up a lower level of standard to

345
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:04,780
raise up<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a standard it's a minimum</font>

346
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:07,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">standard of communications it's not</font>

347
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:09,520
meant to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a ceiling to creativity it's</font>

348
00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:12,160
not meant<font color="#E5E5E5"> to stop you go beyond that</font>

349
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:13,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">point and so working with the brown</font>

350
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:15,819
guidelines and the department that

351
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:17,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">police's them is interesting we usually</font>

352
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:18,550
try to get them evolve really early

353
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:20,860
because if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can get them excited about</font>

354
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:23,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">the ideas they'll help us find a way of</font>

355
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:30,100
presenting it that doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> contravene or</font>

356
00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:33,490
ruin their sort of standard and so we're

357
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:36,850
really looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> for clever ways of</font>

358
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:38,470
positioning creativity in a shell<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

359
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:40,780
can still be brand compliant the shell

360
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:41,540
so for example the logo at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the start of</font>

361
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:42,769
the video

362
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:44,899
which fades out and then the video

363
00:15:42,769 --> 00:15:47,269
starts or if it supposed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the</font>

364
00:15:44,899 --> 00:15:49,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">barclays we have movie posters as part</font>

365
00:15:47,269 --> 00:15:50,839
of this creative but of course to follow

366
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:52,069
a traditional brand guideline it would

367
00:15:50,839 --> 00:15:54,110
have looked anything like a movie poster

368
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:56,449
because there are certain fonts in a

369
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:59,300
certain way a poster is that you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

370
00:15:56,449 --> 00:16:01,099
follow<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we put the movie poster an</font>

371
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:02,569
angle within the shell of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the blue</font>

372
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:04,399
background in the standard bar across

373
00:16:02,569 --> 00:16:06,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">the bottom and so the poster was on the</font>

374
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:08,269
poster<font color="#E5E5E5"> that makes sense and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that was</font>

375
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:10,699
their idea they said we understand that

376
00:16:08,269 --> 00:16:12,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can't break it in that way so will</font>

377
00:16:10,699 --> 00:16:13,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">other think about how best to present it</font>

378
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:15,199
and of course<font color="#CCCCCC"> then it's automatically</font>

379
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:17,120
approved this is the great<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing it's</font>

380
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:19,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">pre-approved so you got and print the</font>

381
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:23,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">posters and if I know that they build</font>

382
00:16:19,399 --> 00:16:24,889
them so let's talk about engagement how

383
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:28,100
do we engage employees and customers and

384
00:16:24,889 --> 00:16:29,389
partners and third parties it's it can

385
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:31,759
start with something as simple as

386
00:16:29,389 --> 00:16:34,069
language the reason that so many

387
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:37,899
companies compli speak in<font color="#CCCCCC"> this sort of</font>

388
00:16:34,069 --> 00:16:42,279
Brosius beep way you know this anodyne

389
00:16:37,899 --> 00:16:45,459
cold sort of horrible you know we at

390
00:16:42,279 --> 00:16:47,240
astrazeneca believe blah blah blah

391
00:16:45,459 --> 00:16:50,888
everyone's guilty obvious<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not just</font>

392
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:53,120
picking<font color="#E5E5E5"> on me but but the idea that and</font>

393
00:16:50,889 --> 00:16:56,750
businesses grow up with a language and

394
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:58,279
they use<font color="#CCCCCC"> it to suggest a club that you</font>

395
00:16:56,750 --> 00:17:00,110
can belong to suggest that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're</font>

396
00:16:58,279 --> 00:17:02,689
specialists in a same way that a

397
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:06,380
policeman develops<font color="#E5E5E5"> this weird way of</font>

398
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:08,329
speaking that sort of says you know on

399
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:10,419
<font color="#CCCCCC">the night in question the perpetrator</font>

400
00:17:08,329 --> 00:17:12,589
all moved off in a northerly direction

401
00:17:10,419 --> 00:17:15,980
so I just say the guy<font color="#CCCCCC"> that did it ran</font>

402
00:17:12,589 --> 00:17:17,418
out run away because I keep in evidence

403
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:18,799
in call all the time so they develop

404
00:17:17,419 --> 00:17:20,240
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> manner and it's something they feel</font>

405
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:23,839
they have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do because they hear other</font>

406
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:25,339
people to it so a language just simply

407
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:27,649
changing the use of language within an

408
00:17:25,339 --> 00:17:30,049
organization can help and now with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

409
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:31,940
proliferation of social media<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of</font>

410
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:34,668
<font color="#CCCCCC">the time we are up against that as a</font>

411
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:37,730
standard now it's expected that you will

412
00:17:34,669 --> 00:17:39,290
be personal in<font color="#E5E5E5"> your communication yeah</font>

413
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:41,590
put some personality into it now there

414
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:43,850
is a worry<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> braddock departments and</font>

415
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:46,040
communications people<font color="#E5E5E5"> that if you start</font>

416
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:47,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">to do that and we're a global firm the</font>

417
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:49,428
nuances will cause trouble in other

418
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:52,840
areas if we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> clear we might lose</font>

419
00:17:49,429 --> 00:17:54,700
clarity now it's possible I guess in sir

420
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:56,908
very rare circumstances that you might

421
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:59,020
lose some clarity if you are to<font color="#E5E5E5"> global</font>

422
00:17:56,909 --> 00:18:02,380
but that's a really small price to pay

423
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:05,049
for the massive benefit the personal

424
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:07,240
connection will make if you are if

425
00:18:05,049 --> 00:18:10,059
people go wow who wrote this wow that

426
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:13,659
speaks to me it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not about a wee or a</font>

427
00:18:10,059 --> 00:18:16,240
royal we it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a you know a directive</font>

428
00:18:13,659 --> 00:18:18,159
it's a conversation<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's that kind</font>

429
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:20,020
of language<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we really need to sort</font>

430
00:18:18,159 --> 00:18:21,669

431
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:23,980
can start with something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't</font>

432
00:18:21,669 --> 00:18:27,940
require any kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> budget just the</font>

433
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:30,190
language there's a great one on a

434
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:31,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">commonly read it from there but on the</font>

435
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:34,299
bottom of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that cart and it says stop</font>

436
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:35,500
looking at my bottom innocent smoothies

437
00:18:34,299 --> 00:18:37,418
are great because if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> read the small</font>

00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:53,020
nobody reads the terms and conditions

00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:55,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">you just take it and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> move on it says do</font>

444
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:57,639

<font color="#E5E5E5">put in by the legal department just um</font>

446
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:01,929
you know it really<font color="#E5E5E5"> does it connects with</font>

447
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:06,210
people people appreciate<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and they're</font>

448
00:19:01,929 --> 00:19:13,240
being<font color="#E5E5E5"> treated like human beings okay um</font>

449
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:16,240
so let's see okay so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

450
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:18,700
how we build a communications plan how

451
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:20,440
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> how we create the firework and all</font>

452
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:22,179
that kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and this is what we</font>

453
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:24,520
call the creative hierarchy I don't like

454
00:19:22,179 --> 00:19:29,220
pyramid graphs so up it's a different

455
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:32,590
type<font color="#E5E5E5"> of pyramid be more entertaining any</font>

456
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:35,470
piece of communication whether it be a

457
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:38,830
video<font color="#CCCCCC"> or a poster or an email</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or a or a</font>

458
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:41,380
you know postcard and really should

459
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:42,639
center around one concept given the

460
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:44,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">amount of traffic flying around an</font>

461
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:47,350
organization today you are lucky if you

462
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:49,000
get that one concept through the door if

463
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:50,590
you're giving a presentation maybe

464
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,049
you'll get away with two or<font color="#CCCCCC"> three but</font>

465
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:57,908
within any section you really are asking

466
00:19:53,049 --> 00:19:59,679
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> to understand one concept that's</font>

467
00:19:57,909 --> 00:20:02,350
the rule that<font color="#E5E5E5"> most companies break and</font>

468
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:06,140
I'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> explain why in a moment because</font>

469
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:08,780
when I sparklies to give me five

470
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:10,910
three four five films so that each film

471
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:12,590
could be about single concept they said

472
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:14,030
we've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> working for weeks on us we</font>

473
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:18,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">really struggle and we've got it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> down to</font>

474
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:19,879
26 now I was I went dancing in the

475
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:22,370
streets cuz I thought I<font color="#E5E5E5"> got a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> budget for</font>

476
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:25,460
26 miles great you know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was the</font>

477
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:27,199
case but it's difficult<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the reason</font>

478
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:30,350
it's important to pick one concept is

479
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:31,730
because it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a hierarchy you no matter</font>

480
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:33,740
what the medium is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> matter how much</font>

481
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:39,830
money<font color="#CCCCCC"> you've got you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get that one</font>

482
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:42,200
idea across using creativity the idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

483
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:44,540
for one of the better word of the sort

484
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:47,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">of creativity is when you've got your</font>

485
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:49,159
concept which might for example be what

486
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:50,600
a good example I'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> hit the car industry</font>

487
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:54,800
because they are very<font color="#CCCCCC"> good using</font>

488
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:56,990
metaphors things the Volkswagen Polo was

489
00:20:54,800 --> 00:21:00,430
marketed a few years ago as being very

490
00:20:56,990 --> 00:21:04,790
small and strong and the whole

491
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:07,550
commercial was shots of people under

492
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:09,620
threat like rugby players bearing down

493
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:11,419
on somebody or an explosion happening

494
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:12,860
with firefighters and they're all

495
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:15,650
crouching down right<font color="#CCCCCC"> not and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> making</font>

496
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:16,939
himself smaller and the message was that

497
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:18,680
have you noticed you always try to make

498
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:21,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">itself small and you want to protect</font>

499
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:23,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">yourself and at the end it just had a</font>

500
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:26,449
shot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> polo you just said strong</font>

501
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:28,010
and it was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very powerful metaphor yeah</font>

502
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:30,110
so that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> their creativity now that</font>

503
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:32,990
would have worked on<font color="#E5E5E5"> a postcard with</font>

504
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:35,209
stock photography that could you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

505
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:36,890
the language was very<font color="#E5E5E5"> very simple but it</font>

506
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:38,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">was one concept they didn't say is</font>

507
00:21:36,890 --> 00:21:40,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">stronger when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's economical and it</font>

508
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:42,860
comes in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a range of different colors and</font>

509
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:44,179
and and and because if they<font color="#CCCCCC"> had it would</font>

510
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:46,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just been information it would have</font>

511
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:47,510
been an idea and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the difference</font>

512
00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:49,100
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the mistake most people make</font>

513
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:51,230
with internal communications or even

514
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:53,030
customer communications fatter is they

515
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:55,610
come through<font color="#E5E5E5"> in business-to-business we</font>

516
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:58,040
are all<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the information the next</font>

517
00:21:55,610 --> 00:22:00,530
level down I've talked about this the

518
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:04,760
execution is it a postcard is it a film

519
00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:06,770
is it an email am<font color="#CCCCCC"> i using</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> language am i</font>

520
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:09,260
using a font am<font color="#CCCCCC"> I using a controlling</font>

521
00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:12,650
image whatever happens this doesn't

522
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:15,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">change the concept remains the same we</font>

523
00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:18,550
can stay with the concept no matter what

524
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:22,850
we're doing because if our concept is

525
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:25,040
with passwords for example question the

526
00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:26,780
person trying to get it<font color="#E5E5E5"> challenged the</font>

527
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:29,480
you know the person trying to get past a

528
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:31,790
certain point then the<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea might be in</font>

529
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:34,820
medieval times they said what's the

530
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:36,500
password outside the portcullis and then

531
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:39,290
if it's mehdi evil then your execution

532
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:44,530
needs many evil<font color="#E5E5E5"> files and you know no</font>

533
00:22:39,290 --> 00:22:47,389
digital calculators or mobile phones and

534
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:50,510
finally finally at the bottom of the

535
00:22:47,390 --> 00:22:52,880
hierarchy which the least important

536
00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:56,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">thing is the thing most companies start</font>

537
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:59,000
with the information because when we've

538
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:01,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">got our idea and we've thought about how</font>

539
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:04,070
we're going to execute it now finally

540
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:05,629
we'll cherry-pick the two or three bits

541
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:07,790
of information that<font color="#E5E5E5"> will support that</font>

542
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:09,950
one concept that's where the information

543
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:12,290
is useful that's why it's targeted and

544
00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:13,490
that's what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> get remembered the</font>

545
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:15,860
other thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is to bear in mind that this</font>

546
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:18,050
also forms a model for a communications

547
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:20,810
plan where<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're one concept might be</font>

548
00:23:18,050 --> 00:23:22,340
here to draw people<font color="#CCCCCC"> in and go oh yeah</font>

549
00:23:20,810 --> 00:23:23,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">I've problem with that or I understand</font>

550
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:25,010
that and then when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you've got the</font>

551
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:26,770
retention and you've opened up

552
00:23:25,010 --> 00:23:29,840
potentially add rapport and a channel of

553
00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:31,970
communication<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can offer more</font>

554
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:33,020
information so what that what I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying</font>

555
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:35,270
there is really with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the information</font>

556
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:36,889
layer make sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's the right</font>

557
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:38,600
amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of information and that there's</font>

558
00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:40,510
no barrier to that information make it

559
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:44,360
downloadable and usable and

560
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:47,330
user-friendly clear in the language you

561
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:50,330
know conversational if necessary just

562
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:54,439
real sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of keep it real really and</font>

563
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:56,510
that the problem really is that many

564
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:57,920
companies<font color="#E5E5E5"> got try to go upstream they'll</font>

565
00:23:56,510 --> 00:24:00,170
start<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a meeting going okay so what</font>

566
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:02,600
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all we know loans turns out</font>

567
00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:03,950
we know<font color="#CCCCCC"> turnings</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of stuff ah what I've</font>

568
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:05,600
got 20 pages here and I had to choose a

569
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:07,430
password alone we've got loads of stuff

570
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:10,129
now obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> they don't push that</font>

571
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:11,750
upstream and it gets whittled away well

572
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:13,160
it's two lives<font color="#E5E5E5"> too much too much less</font>

573
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:14,690
that right we've worked<font color="#E5E5E5"> it out to 26</font>

574
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:16,400
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay it's fine let's put that in</font>

575
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:18,650
a film or a video or a document or PDF

576
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:20,690
it's very long need to put it down even

577
00:24:18,650 --> 00:24:22,760
further use fewer words or shorter words

578
00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:24,500
or read faster or you know it's all

579
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:26,390
about trimming the information and it's

580
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:27,580
it's all broken by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the time it gets the</font>

581
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:30,000
top people don't really

582
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:32,679
what the one idea is or what it's about

583
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,900
because I tried<font color="#E5E5E5"> to cram information into</font>

584
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:36,790
a smaller and smaller space that's all

585
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:38,530
they're trying to do and that isn't an

586
00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:40,240
idea that people will remember I'm

587
00:24:38,530 --> 00:24:42,010
actually it damages the information even

588
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:43,780
to try and strip it down that much to

589
00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:46,060
get it into a<font color="#CCCCCC"> bite-sized thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what's</font>

590
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:47,920
people go look gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> make a video to get</font>

591
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:50,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to buy into this thing and it's</font>

592
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:53,320
obviously 12 minutes<font color="#CCCCCC"> two minutes just</font>

593
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:54,880
two minutes<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean I've seen loads and</font>

594
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:59,980
loads of movies I've looked and none of

595
00:24:54,880 --> 00:25:01,990
them the two minutes long so so I get

596
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:03,850
quite evangelical about this I get quite

597
00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:06,610
frustrated with the way that we embrace

598
00:25:03,850 --> 00:25:08,020
the security of information and I

599
00:25:06,610 --> 00:25:10,689
understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> that because a lot of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

600
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:12,310
certainly marketing in b2b have come up

601
00:25:10,690 --> 00:25:13,960
through the business so they may have

602
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:15,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">been a lawyer or an engineer or a</font>

603
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:17,290
chemist or whatever and they've been

604
00:25:15,730 --> 00:25:18,520
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> good at that they've got of great</font>

605
00:25:17,290 --> 00:25:19,990
product knowledge and they're pretty

606
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:21,490
personable so they've got reasonable

607
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:23,530
communication skills and then they get

608
00:25:21,490 --> 00:25:25,690
promoted into marketing and it's break

609
00:25:23,530 --> 00:25:28,600
them or they've come from service or

610
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:31,300
sales engineer into marketer and then

611
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:33,429
they've ended up in a position where I'm

612
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:34,960
sorry I um no a recognition them and

613
00:25:33,430 --> 00:25:36,400
they've ended up in a position where

614
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:38,500
they're expected to make creative

615
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:41,020
decisions but what they know is

616
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:43,210
information so there's never any real

617
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:49,300
training and the way creativity can help

618
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:50,470
you solve a business problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay brand</font>

619
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:52,450
or<font color="#CCCCCC"> bland</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we've already sort of</font>

620
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:54,610
covered this and I've already talked

621
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:56,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">about how the brand can get in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> way</font>

622
00:25:54,610 --> 00:25:58,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">and we need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to remember what it's for</font>

623
00:25:56,230 --> 00:26:00,100
its for uniformity and consistency<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

624
00:25:58,870 --> 00:26:02,679
when you're trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a firework up</font>

625
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:04,990
there it's the opposite of uniformity

626
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:08,080
and consistency so you have this tension

627
00:26:04,990 --> 00:26:10,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">between creativity and the brand now if</font>

628
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:11,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're a consumer brand quite often</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

629
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:13,780
brand<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> already created if you're</font>

630
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:15,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">Maggie or coca-cola or whatever it's</font>

631
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:17,950
already uses creativity very well to

632
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:19,150
engage<font color="#E5E5E5"> a market so we're they're used to</font>

633
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:22,000
it kind of put your business-to-business

634
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:24,340
communications or internal

635
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,140
communications we think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that that's</font>

636
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:27,459
nothing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do with us we think that</font>

637
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:30,400
we're in a different<font color="#E5E5E5"> world and we have</font>

638
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:31,840
to use information and so the brand is

639
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:36,130
something that helps us create a piece

640
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:37,480
of design that looks nice and isn't

641
00:26:36,130 --> 00:26:38,620
get me fired so that's what's going to

642
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,670
happen then I'm going to follow brand

643
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:41,550
guidelines and I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get our</font>

644
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:44,560
information out there and that's my job

645
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:46,720
did people engage with it did people

646
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:50,139
read change their behavior not<font color="#E5E5E5"> my job my</font>

647
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:51,460
job was to get that document out<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok so I</font>

648
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:54,430
think the system is<font color="#CCCCCC"> broken and that</font>

649
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:56,860
respect the reason we shy away from

650
00:26:54,430 --> 00:26:59,700
doing brave things the old saying that

651
00:26:56,860 --> 00:27:03,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">nobody ever got fired for buying IBM is</font>

652
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:04,960
that we we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to lean into the</font>

653
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:06,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">problem of creativity because actually</font>

654
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:10,990
don't understand it and it could get us

655
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:12,640
fired I understand<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I think that's</font>

656
00:27:10,990 --> 00:27:14,290
why<font color="#E5E5E5"> more education and training on the</font>

657
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:15,850
nature of creativity in business is

658
00:27:14,290 --> 00:27:18,220
required I think it's a really<font color="#E5E5E5"> vital</font>

659
00:27:15,850 --> 00:27:19,600
part of business<font color="#E5E5E5"> everybody talks about</font>

660
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:21,640
creativity in business they say

661
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:24,429
innovation and creativity are essential

662
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:25,900
for survival the constant change that

663
00:27:24,430 --> 00:27:28,810
happens then people talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it a lot</font>

664
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:31,270
in business terms but it's never applied

665
00:27:28,810 --> 00:27:32,679
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the actual communications the bit</font>

666
00:27:31,270 --> 00:27:34,120
where<font color="#CCCCCC"> is supposed to be a politic</font>

667
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:37,900
especially in<font color="#CCCCCC"> business-to-business</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

668
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:39,520
believe so there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> question I'm often</font>

669
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:41,770
asked which is Jim you make these sort

670
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:44,560
of really cool little comedies is

671
00:27:41,770 --> 00:27:47,170
somebody in Jakarta going to get it you

672
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:49,659
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> and actually uncovered quite a lot</font>

673
00:27:47,170 --> 00:27:51,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">of research to suggest that compared</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

674
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:54,580
a Talking Heads video by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Chairman</font>

675
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:56,710
it's still more effective because if

676
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:57,850
you're clever with the scripting these

677
00:27:56,710 --> 00:28:00,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">things are multi-layered you know how</font>

678
00:27:57,850 --> 00:28:02,199
these kids movies these days are who's

679
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:04,810
got kids and put<font color="#E5E5E5"> hand up if you've got</font>

680
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:07,810
children<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay nearly tomorrow across</font>

681
00:28:04,810 --> 00:28:11,200
you'll be before you handle so is about

682
00:28:07,810 --> 00:28:12,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">to have a baby</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just look at work from</font>

light you can tell uh-huh but but

685
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:18,370
basically when you you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> you've got</font>

00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:19,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">to sit through those kids films the very</font>

687
00:28:18,370 --> 00:28:26,080
clever now<font color="#E5E5E5"> Pixar will make them really</font>

688
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:27,970
cool i love watching<font color="#CCCCCC"> i watched Oh Rio is</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">hard</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to see I sound lots of in gags for</font>

690
00:28:27,970 --> 00:28:31,930
growing up lots of movie references that

691
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:33,340
we all get the kids like with characters

692
00:28:31,930 --> 00:28:35,140
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the situations</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and the slapstick</font>

693
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:36,639
we're loving the sort of nod to the

694
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:40,030
parents<font color="#E5E5E5"> that sort of says you see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

695
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:41,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">out in Scarface nice you know and and</font>

696
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:43,899
I'm they're very clever that's a layered

697
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:45,580
communication yeah they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> communicated</font>

698
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:46,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">to two completely different markets with</font>

699
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:48,399
the same

700
00:28:46,019 --> 00:28:49,779
what we're saying is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> if we're</font>

701
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:52,840
creating scenarios like I've shown

702
00:28:49,779 --> 00:28:55,120
examples of today where there are vivid

703
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:56,799
characters and we kind of get it there

704
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:58,508
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there's enough action if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

705
00:28:56,799 --> 00:29:02,379
turn the sound off<font color="#CCCCCC"> you'd probably</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

706
00:28:58,509 --> 00:29:04,809
what was going on really and so that's

707
00:29:02,379 --> 00:29:07,509
still<font color="#E5E5E5"> a vivid picture and a story we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

708
00:29:04,809 --> 00:29:09,129
hard-wired to remember stories we're not

709
00:29:07,509 --> 00:29:10,570
hardwired to remember information and

710
00:29:09,129 --> 00:29:13,990
multiple bullet points that's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font>

711
00:29:10,570 --> 00:29:15,580
our brain works generations ago when our

712
00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:16,509
mothers told her stories of the bears in

713
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:18,309
the woods that would eat us all the

714
00:29:16,509 --> 00:29:19,929
witches that were turn us into a frog to

something about how you got a nickname

00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:48,789
again<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's something that lots of people</font>

00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:51,370
are comfortable with<font color="#E5E5E5"> if I asked you to</font>

list your top<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> favorite films you</font>

732
00:29:53,769 --> 00:29:57,100
that's a really worried<font color="#CCCCCC"> about something</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">you could just reel off</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 10</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> films that</font>

terms<font color="#E5E5E5"> of multicultural work and global</font>

736
00:30:02,139 --> 00:30:08,559
organizations it's still better to try

00:30:05,639 --> 00:30:10,629
now maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> you'll get you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> won't get a</font>

741
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:17,649
that's still a lot more<font color="#CCCCCC"> than you would</font>

00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:19,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">have got if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you could just simply</font>

743
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:22,360
presented information and the biggest

744
00:30:19,870 --> 00:30:23,830
crime is where video is used to present

745
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:25,870
information because it's a really

746
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:29,199
expensive medium for delivering

747
00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:31,178
information it<font color="#E5E5E5"> delivers ideas and</font>

748
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:32,649
stories it's not very<font color="#E5E5E5"> good it's a</font>

749
00:30:31,179 --> 00:30:34,059
time-based media and once it's gone it's

750
00:30:32,649 --> 00:30:35,289
gone so delivering information it's

751
00:30:34,059 --> 00:30:39,190
really hard to sort of keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> track of it</font>

752
00:30:35,289 --> 00:30:44,610
without rewinding people don't want it's

753
00:30:39,190 --> 00:30:44,610
good at<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's one of the problems right</font>

754
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:51,440
before and after the firework well first

755
00:30:50,419 --> 00:30:53,240
of all if<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to send up a</font>

763
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:13,850
even if its internal because saying

764
00:31:11,659 --> 00:31:15,679
something was coming down<font color="#CCCCCC"> the line you</font>

know presenting HTML email with some

occup adopts which is actually to raise

770
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:27,709
more questions than you're answering

771
00:31:25,789 --> 00:31:32,780
don't tell people exactly what you're

772

<font color="#CCCCCC">doing make them curious coming soon may</font>

773
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:38,360
2011 and then you can put any picture or

00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:40,760
word<font color="#E5E5E5"> after that you want and people go</font>

00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:46,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people curious just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> by the</font>

00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:49,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">way you present information but if you</font>

00:31:46,669 --> 00:31:51,140
say<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming soon watch this space you</font>

780
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:52,970
create an anticipation effect so that

781
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:54,530
when you do set up the firework people

782
00:31:52,970 --> 00:31:55,970
though<font color="#E5E5E5"> I remember that thing is that</font>

783
00:31:54,530 --> 00:31:58,340
thing remember that<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing which are that</font>

785
00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:02,360
trailer theme so you creates

786
00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:04,309
anticipation it's a proper campaign and

787
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:06,350
again it's just thinking about how you

788
00:32:04,309 --> 00:32:10,370
present this information then you send

789
00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:12,678
up a firework hopefully you don't send

790
00:32:10,370 --> 00:32:15,350
up just one firework new you spread out

791
00:32:12,679 --> 00:32:16,280
your resources over time especially if

792
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:18,039
it's something where you really want to

793
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:20,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">change behavior and actually you know</font>

794
00:32:18,039 --> 00:32:21,650
one of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> company's experience did</font>

795
00:32:20,210 --> 00:32:24,470
their campaign in one week of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the year</font>

796
00:32:21,650 --> 00:32:26,090
and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> weren't sure that that was really</font>

797
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:28,250
the right<font color="#E5E5E5"> way they wanted fit it was</font>

798
00:32:26,090 --> 00:32:30,379
great<font color="#E5E5E5"> during the week they had four</font>

799
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:32,960
hundred visitors to their website in

800
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:35,900
information security before that week on

801
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:37,510
average per week by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the end of the week</font>

802
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:39,770
there were getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> 30 thousand hits on</font>

803
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:43,580
that landing page because they were

804
00:32:39,770 --> 00:32:45,230
releasing a film every day but kind of

805
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:47,960
three or four<font color="#CCCCCC"> months</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are minutes back</font>

806
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:50,000
down to sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> under a thousand and</font>

807
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:52,210
that's the problem whereas if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get a</font>

808
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,560
momentum you know how we're all into TV

809
00:32:52,210 --> 00:32:55,690
is we all like to follow characters and

810
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:58,389
stories and things if we can get just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

811
00:32:55,690 --> 00:33:01,210
little bit of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> effect going then we</font>

812
00:32:58,390 --> 00:33:03,430
will have a sustainable thing so the

813
00:33:01,210 --> 00:33:05,560
campaign over six months is far more

814
00:33:03,430 --> 00:33:08,410
effective and it will embed itself as a

815
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:09,669
cultural thing more<font color="#E5E5E5"> likely and there's</font>

816
00:33:08,410 --> 00:33:12,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">no reason</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you can't repeat</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cat</font>

817
00:33:09,670 --> 00:33:15,160
campaign later or take that collateral

818
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:17,350
and introduce it<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the induction</font>

819
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:18,750
scheme from your employees there's our

820
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:21,969
own you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just every now and again</font>

821
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:23,290
rerun the coming soon bit and point

822
00:33:21,970 --> 00:33:25,570
people to the landing page and making

823
00:33:23,290 --> 00:33:26,830
access to that the media and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

824
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:30,810
instructions and the stuff that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font>

825
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:33,580
them<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> get so that was before</font>

826
00:33:30,810 --> 00:33:36,520
afterwards how do we<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> who if we've</font>

827
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:38,199
won what was the measurement it's not

828
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:40,990
that revealing actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mentioned hits</font>

829
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:42,520
on the landing page well that's nice<font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font>

830
00:33:40,990 --> 00:33:44,290
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a really accurate way of</font>

831
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:45,850
understanding engagement or<font color="#CCCCCC"> behavioural</font>

832
00:33:44,290 --> 00:33:47,110
change and one of the weird things that

833
00:33:45,850 --> 00:33:50,050
happened were going to our customers was

834
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:51,820
that before the campaign ran over a

835
00:33:50,050 --> 00:33:53,740
period of say three months<font color="#CCCCCC"> around world</font>

836
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:55,750
they had a certain<font color="#E5E5E5"> level of reported</font>

837
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:57,820
incidents and information<font color="#CCCCCC"> security when</font>

838
00:33:55,750 --> 00:34:02,110
the campaign ran those incidents went

839
00:33:57,820 --> 00:34:04,600
all massively witch panic them a bit for

840
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:06,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">about a day till they explained that all</font>

841
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:08,380
of those incidents were happening anyway

842
00:34:06,130 --> 00:34:09,790
that just won't be reported<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I</font>

843
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:11,380
encourage people to do is pick<font color="#E5E5E5"> up the</font>

844
00:34:09,790 --> 00:34:12,550
phone and go you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> nothing</font>

845
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:16,000
happening that video that happen to<font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font>

846
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:17,170
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so actually now they've got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

847
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,969
handle on<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and they know what the</font>

848
00:34:17,170 --> 00:34:20,350
picture is what the real picture is they

849
00:34:18,969 --> 00:34:23,379
can control it they can do something

850
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:24,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">about it so the news isn't not always</font>

851
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:27,220
what you'll expect but some kind of

852
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:28,960
measurement programme and<font color="#CCCCCC"> certainly an</font>

853
00:34:27,219 --> 00:34:32,199
information security there's no<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy fix</font>

854
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:35,710
for this is no easy answer you really

855
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:37,239
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to run clever surveys to get to ask</font>

856
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:38,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">the right questions it's a specialist</font>

857
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:41,799
area it's not an area we profess to know

858
00:34:38,830 --> 00:34:43,060
much<font color="#E5E5E5"> about but I know that surveys and</font>

859
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:45,940
the statistical analysis of

860
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:47,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">communications is a real dark heart in</font>

861
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:49,960
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> respects that you must try to do</font>

862
00:34:47,650 --> 00:34:52,150
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that gives you a clue as to</font>

863
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:54,790
the change in behavior you'll return on

864
00:34:52,150 --> 00:34:57,220
investment it's easy with sales training

865
00:34:54,790 --> 00:34:59,710
because you can see a rise in sales but

866
00:34:57,220 --> 00:35:00,828
it's harder with core functions and

867
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:03,709
softer topics

868
00:35:00,829 --> 00:35:07,880
that kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing so I'd like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to end</font>

869
00:35:03,709 --> 00:35:10,129
the presentation now with one of the

870
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:12,559
episodes from our new customer<font color="#E5E5E5"> Warner</font>

871
00:35:10,130 --> 00:35:14,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">Brothers the campaign went live a few</font>

872
00:35:12,559 --> 00:35:16,249
weeks<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago and they've had a lot of</font>

873
00:35:14,239 --> 00:35:17,239
success with it very pleased and that

874
00:35:16,249 --> 00:35:20,089
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> very proud to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have them as a</font>

875
00:35:17,239 --> 00:35:21,769
customer you're privileged because only

876
00:35:20,089 --> 00:35:22,940
the people in<font color="#CCCCCC"> front me can see they're</font>

877
00:35:21,769 --> 00:35:24,200
allowed to see this this won't be on our

878
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:26,209
website anywhere and we're not allowed

879
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:28,399
to broadcast it so I henry bragg in

880
00:35:26,209 --> 00:35:29,868
front of you lot really which<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not</font>

881
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:33,729
nearly a big<font color="#E5E5E5"> enough audience for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me i'm</font>

882
00:35:29,869 --> 00:35:33,729
saying so<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

883
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:42,730
to make program for you can imagine this

884
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:44,109
or pressure we will be creatively to

885
00:35:42,730 --> 00:35:46,109
come up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something I mean that</font>

886
00:35:44,109 --> 00:35:48,819
audience has seen it all and made it all

887
00:35:46,109 --> 00:35:51,670
and it's been seen by the directors on

888
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:53,859
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Hollywood a lot those programs have</font>

889
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:57,160
been shown as trailers before premieres

890
00:35:53,859 --> 00:35:59,880
of major movies in Hollywood so that's

891
00:35:57,160 --> 00:36:02,399
probably our proudest moment and and

892
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:05,290
sort of stood up pretty well actually

893
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:07,599
they hold premieres on the lot in the

894
00:36:05,290 --> 00:36:11,349
private 600 seat<font color="#E5E5E5"> theater that they have</font>

895
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:13,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">on the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Warner Brothers campus and all</font>

896
00:36:11,349 --> 00:36:16,750
the employees are invited to see the

897
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:18,400
screening and at least I said<font color="#E5E5E5"> these are</font>

898
00:36:16,750 --> 00:36:20,079
used as trailers so right now it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

899
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:21,940
great great way to get mountain and make

900
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:23,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">sure everybody season so and they've</font>

901
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:24,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">been they've had great feedback and</font>

902
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:26,530
having great<font color="#E5E5E5"> success with the campaign</font>

903
00:36:24,790 --> 00:36:28,540
as a whole there were a series of

904
00:36:26,530 --> 00:36:31,300
posters that were produced<font color="#E5E5E5"> as you saw</font>

905
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:33,369
earlier mocking up popular films that

906
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:34,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">Warner Brothers have made unfortunately</font>

907
00:36:33,369 --> 00:36:37,420
we weren't allowed to touch Harry Potter

908
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:38,799
because it's off-limits JK Rowling

909
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:43,930
wouldn't let us replace Harry and

910
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:45,730
Hermione with the two guys so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font>

911
00:36:43,930 --> 00:36:47,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">days all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i have to say is any questions</font>

912
00:36:45,730 --> 00:36:49,240
anyone want to ask about<font color="#E5E5E5"> any of the work</font>

913
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:50,740
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we see or would you like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to suck</font>

914
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:55,029
that any<font color="#E5E5E5"> other areas other than</font>

915
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:57,520
information security I just say one

916
00:36:55,030 --> 00:37:00,869
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> Thank You security recites next</font>

917
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:00,869
time I'll try and<font color="#E5E5E5"> press the record book</font>

918
00:37:02,609 --> 00:37:09,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">ok any questions not think of the thing</font>

919
00:37:07,329 --> 00:37:11,109
can I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just ask question in the room in</font>

920
00:37:09,130 --> 00:37:13,660
terms of communications I know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

921
00:37:11,109 --> 00:37:15,490
perhaps some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the work that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would show</font>

922
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:16,899
you today sorting well either<font color="#E5E5E5"> a there's</font>

923
00:37:15,490 --> 00:37:21,669
no way we'd ever get clearance for that

924
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:23,859
the budget or we never we never get away

925
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:27,069
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that as an idea you know just</font>

926
00:37:23,859 --> 00:37:28,509
corporately<font color="#E5E5E5"> as what sort of things do</font>

927
00:37:27,069 --> 00:37:31,259
you think<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you see those sorts of</font>

928
00:37:28,510 --> 00:37:31,260
campaigns

929
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:34,760
inspector

930
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:39,710
instrumental

931
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:46,820
I think you have the idea of having like

932
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:51,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">hearty posters around just to get</font>

933
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:53,450
through<font color="#E5E5E5"> the message because the training</font>

934
00:37:51,950 --> 00:37:55,910
is necessary<font color="#E5E5E5"> no get me wrong I'm not</font>

935
00:37:53,450 --> 00:37:59,660
saying this isn't the place training it

936
00:37:55,910 --> 00:38:01,850
adds as a method of driving people to

937
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:07,330
know that may the training is important

938
00:38:01,850 --> 00:38:07,330
and where it is you know how to<font color="#E5E5E5"> find it</font>

939
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:18,859
she say budgets oh definitely but I

940
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:20,210
think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you just extrapolate now</font>

941
00:38:18,859 --> 00:38:22,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of hierarchy that I talked about</font>

942
00:38:20,210 --> 00:38:24,770
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are still ways of a little</font>

943
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:25,970
creativity goes an awful long way and I

944
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:27,290
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you just look at that higher</font>

945
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:29,720
arc and just let think of your core

946
00:38:27,290 --> 00:38:30,830
concept what is one because<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone</font>

947
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:32,000
thinks<font color="#E5E5E5"> so if we're going to send out</font>

948
00:38:30,830 --> 00:38:33,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">communication we better get everything</font>

949
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,390
in it otherwise it's a wasted

950
00:38:33,590 --> 00:38:37,880
opportunity and that's the opposite<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

951
00:38:35,390 --> 00:38:39,830
true I think if you send out one thing

952
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:41,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">people go wow I've never thought about</font>

953
00:38:39,830 --> 00:38:44,450
before you make them truly engage with

954
00:38:41,330 --> 00:38:45,950
that issue then they will fire beat a

955
00:38:44,450 --> 00:38:47,660
path back to you and then you can talk

956
00:38:45,950 --> 00:38:49,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">about other issues but i think this</font>

957
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:53,509
notion of you know the firework and then

958
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:54,890
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> pull theory really does work and and</font>

959
00:38:53,510 --> 00:38:57,890
there are very simple<font color="#E5E5E5"> things you can do</font>

960
00:38:54,890 --> 00:38:59,150
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't require you know huge</font>

961
00:38:57,890 --> 00:39:00,859
expensive videos all of that kind of

962
00:38:59,150 --> 00:39:04,820
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're a lot you can do just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

963
00:39:00,859 --> 00:39:07,130
language just with simple cool things

964
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:09,830
with a one little idea that we suggested

965
00:39:07,130 --> 00:39:11,210
to a client was about checking identity

966
00:39:09,830 --> 00:39:13,100
of somebody when they were in the

967
00:39:11,210 --> 00:39:15,859
building or checking identity online

968
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:18,890
that kind of thing to create a series of

969
00:39:15,859 --> 00:39:21,170
little transparent stickers this lots of

970
00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:24,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">buildings have glass doors or glass</font>

971
00:39:21,170 --> 00:39:26,480
walls and that kind of thing and we have

972
00:39:24,350 --> 00:39:28,759
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea of having a campaign to talk</font>

973
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:31,250
about identity and we stuck the sort of

974
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:32,300
glasses and fake nose on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the sticker on</font>

975
00:39:31,250 --> 00:39:34,940
the glass<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> could walk up behind</font>

976
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:36,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">anything like that that's a silly little</font>

977
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:38,240
thing it's a silly little thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> but then</font>

978
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:39,680
the number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of photos that people will</font>

979
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">take on the other side like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that so you</font>

980
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:42,160
could pull

981
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:43,930
you know it's great and they can make

982
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:45,399
lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of different types and they can</font>

983
00:39:43,930 --> 00:39:46,480
look load the photos or they can send

984
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:49,120
them to somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> who can put them in the</font>

985
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:50,830
staff magazine it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

986
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:52,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">that sort of thing is not all expensive</font>

987
00:39:50,830 --> 00:39:55,020
and fix it takes a bit of thought

988
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:57,400
obviously<font color="#CCCCCC"> but that is to try and</font>

989
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:59,259
encourage that creative thought because

990
00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:01,420
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> just makes the communications more</font>

991
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:05,140
effective and memorable and in terms<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

training<font color="#E5E5E5"> one thing that we're like two</font>

00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:08,259
things were pioneering to some extent is

994
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:10,480
taking where they have gone<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

995
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:13,090
extent of investing in a campaign like

996
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:17,890
this that<font color="#CCCCCC"> all you're ready to kick is</font>
