00:00:10,269 --> 00:00:14,460
we had to earn healthy interested in

2
00:00:12,249 --> 00:00:17,220
security for the past

3
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:18,810
or trades I've patched up a lot picking

4
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:20,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">such engineering expert comprehensive</font>

5
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:24,060
research fantastic anything really

6
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:26,189
<font color="#CCCCCC">security related so outline of my talk</font>

7
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:29,340
this is an extended talk from a pro con

8
00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:31,169
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did last year I was going to do a</font>

9
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:33,989
live videos but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I chickened out so I'm</font>

10
00:00:31,169 --> 00:00:35,070
just going to do this<font color="#E5E5E5"> video and we also</font>

11
00:00:33,989 --> 00:00:37,169
going to show you how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to fix it which</font>

12
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:38,370
sucks and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a bit of a random</font>

13
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:41,970
torch covers lots of other<font color="#CCCCCC"> things such</font>

14
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:43,440
as the IDP issue so what am<font color="#E5E5E5"> I discovered</font>

15
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:47,190
pretty much if you've got terminal

16
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:49,320
server anybody who connects to it and by

17
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:50,789
passive group policy settings and run

18
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:54,449
pretty much any type of software they

19
00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:57,780
really want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> run so it's a security</font>

20
00:00:54,449 --> 00:01:00,780
issue or not George of people spoken<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

21
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:02,339
think this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is an issue I've been fooled</font>

22
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:06,480
Microsoft they didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> give a fuck so hot</font>

23
00:01:02,339 --> 00:01:08,070
okay this is open by default all the

24
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:10,740
systems<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you have to actually locking</font>

25
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:14,669
system down<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I have seen this in the</font>

26
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:16,429
wild so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> break in let's do</font>

27
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:20,670
something so basically done nmap scan

28
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:22,860
and try<font color="#CCCCCC"> find port 3389 open you need a</font>

29
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:26,310
person account to get in if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know a</font>

30
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:27,960
bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a problem yes awesome let's go if</font>

31
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:30,750
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have the username this</font>

32
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:33,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">Microsoft you can use check the website</font>

33
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:36,210
and normally the user name in the email

34
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:39,659
address<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the login name by default for</font>

35
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:41,570
Microsoft if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> ever got a password you</font>

36
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:43,619
can remember<font color="#CCCCCC"> the password lockout policy</font>

37
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:45,960
brute force<font color="#CCCCCC"> it especially going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lock</font>

38
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:49,380
out so you can social engineer your

39
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:51,719
victim you don't have to use TS crack to

40
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:53,750
crack turn on services if they've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got</font>

41
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:56,908
other ports open for Microsoft FTP or

42
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:58,399
IMAP on you can use Hydra and that will

43
00:01:56,909 --> 00:02:00,960
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> break the account as well</font>

44
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:03,270
remember the ministry account does it

45
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,529
look out going back to social

46
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:06,780
engineering if you do lock the account

47
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:08,038
<font color="#CCCCCC">out just from the helpdesk up and most</font>

48
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:10,050
likely they're going to reset it for you

49
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:12,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">for a nice easy password so he pretends</font>

50
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:16,350
to be that person<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we've got fella</font>

51
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:19,620
username password so we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> login so</font>

52
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:21,810
now the<font color="#CCCCCC"> cool</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bits the videos the demo so</font>

53
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:22,920
basically I've got three videos once

54
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:25,080
it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to show you the group policy</font>

55
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:27,869
set up the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> one it's going to show</font>

56
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:29,670
you logging in it's restricted

57
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:32,190
the only going to show<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to get</font>

58
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:33,988
command in about five seconds let me

59
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:35,909
show how<font color="#E5E5E5"> deputies to get your privileges</font>

60
00:02:33,989 --> 00:02:38,790
and then I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to show you how to</font>

61
00:02:35,909 --> 00:02:42,149
prevent this from happening so the group

62
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:43,890
policy set up hope<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is right so</font>

63
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:45,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">basically this is the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> group policy on</font>

64
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:48,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">your terminal server</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Fox so I'm just</font>

65
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:50,129
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to quickly just show you that is</font>

66
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:52,799
actually tied down and<font color="#CCCCCC"> locked down so if</font>

67
00:02:50,129 --> 00:02:54,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">we go to the Windows Explorer you can</font>

68
00:02:52,799 --> 00:02:57,180
see pretty much<font color="#CCCCCC"> everything's enabled so</font>

69
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:59,069
it's quite pretty much tied down my

70
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:02,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">computer is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all restricted to the hard</font>

71
00:02:59,069 --> 00:03:07,709
disks which you won't see so that's also

72
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:09,150
restricted so carry on looking the

73
00:03:07,709 --> 00:03:11,459
desktops all locked down so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can</font>

74
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:13,200
access<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything on the desktop so you</font>

75
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:15,980
might<font color="#E5E5E5"> not have a machine tied down this</font>

76
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:18,119
much but<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the demonstration purposes</font>

77
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:23,090
desktop so lock down so you can't do

78
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:27,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">anything there we go into this system</font>

79
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:30,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">and you say they've got prevented access</font>

80
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:33,750
to command prompt so that's locked out

81
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:35,730
we can only run certain<font color="#CCCCCC"> windows</font>

82
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:41,370
applications these are we can only run

83
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:44,060
calculating ms paint<font color="#E5E5E5"> this demo and being</font>

84
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:47,069
pacifically<font color="#CCCCCC"> till windows not to run</font>

85
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:54,540
command CMD<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet explorer and</font>

86
00:03:47,069 --> 00:03:58,018
notepad so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the admin spit them so</font>

87
00:03:54,540 --> 00:04:00,629
now that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're going to break in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

88
00:03:58,019 --> 00:04:03,870
in my broken one I<font color="#E5E5E5"> did it for Microsoft</font>

89
00:04:00,629 --> 00:04:06,268
so from here I'm doing it from backtrack

90
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:07,379
so basically all I'm doing is<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing</font>

91
00:04:06,269 --> 00:04:08,669
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to show you restrict his</font>

92
00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:12,418
connection what you normally look like

93
00:04:08,669 --> 00:04:14,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm using our desktop we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> connected to</font>

94
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:20,039
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> server as we were expected with</font>

95
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:22,229
restricted user account login so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

96
00:04:20,039 --> 00:04:26,880
all restricted so we won't run paint

97
00:04:22,229 --> 00:04:29,610
that works as expected notepad wasn't

98
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:31,250
allowed to run so that's denied as you

99
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:35,909
see the desktops pretty much locked down

100
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:38,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">so can't run pretty much nothing so</font>

101
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:38,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">locked down nice and tight</font>

102
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:47,810
so we're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to explore yeah full</font>

103
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:51,409
lockdown<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so let's break into it</font>

104
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:54,320
takes<font color="#E5E5E5"> about five seconds or so type so</font>

105
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:57,200
type in our desktop again or I'll type

106
00:04:54,320 --> 00:05:00,980
it in space minus<font color="#CCCCCC"> S which stands for the</font>

107
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:02,780
shell you put in the percent system<font color="#E5E5E5"> root</font>

108
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:05,650
which is the variable for the windows

109
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:09,440
directory backs us back stress system 32

110
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:16,099
bash command<font color="#E5E5E5"> calm the IP address of the</font>

111
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:21,650
target and load up we log in again with

112
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:24,380
restricted user let's put the<font color="#E5E5E5"> past of</font>

113
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:27,500
you and just let my GV that command

114
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:28,909
prompt so it's all locked down so<font color="#CCCCCC"> to say</font>

115
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:31,280
we can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> run other stuff from the</font>

116
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:33,350
command prompt beacon the load of

117
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:36,049
Internet Explorer so because we're using

118
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:37,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">command esscom it's all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in the short</font>

119
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:40,490
format see if you want to see everything

120
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:41,750
else you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got put dir</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> four slash X</font>

121
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:44,540
which will give you the short name

122
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:51,020
version so we're going to program till

123
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:56,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">21 I did videos also to slow me down</font>

124
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:56,979
from talking going to Internet Explorer

125
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:03,080
and we can load it into exploit so you

126
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:06,980
can win any command we want then from

127
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:09,140
there as the restricted user so just to

128
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:11,240
prove that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can run any application and</font>

129
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:13,729
want not just come on calm i'm going to

130
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:16,370
log up here and do the same again boost

131
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:19,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">on with internet explorer so just to</font>

132
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:26,890
prove a point so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are desktop minus s</font>

133
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:26,890
and then put in c program files

134
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:44,940
I'm not fast typing and then it's an

135
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:46,890
explorer I explorer.exe and this will

136
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:48,540
just when we log in automatically launch

137
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:50,400
its export remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's X Pro has also</font>

138
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:55,590
denied so we weren't<font color="#E5E5E5"> allowed to run that</font>

139
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:57,570
so we log back in so now<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we can do</font>

140
00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:59,039
put into Explorer we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> upload our</font>

141
00:06:57,570 --> 00:07:01,710
payloads to this machine<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite happily</font>

142
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:04,320
black truck can either be our malicious

143
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:07,349
but can<font color="#E5E5E5"> either be inside the network</font>

144
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:09,180
outside the network so<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically I've</font>

145
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:12,720
launched the apache server on<font color="#CCCCCC"> their</font>

146
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:15,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">patch on the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> box so 150 and with your</font>

147
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:18,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">metasploit i just created a payload</font>

148
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:22,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">board clown exe which I copy to the far</font>

149
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:24,900
dub folder so as you<font color="#E5E5E5"> see it there so all</font>

150
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:27,390
I can do now from my box from the

151
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:34,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">terminal server box I can upload that to</font>

152
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:36,360
my machine so upload it so I want to

153
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:39,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">save it because the system is actually</font>

154
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:40,680
locked down can't access the c drive or

155
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:43,109
any other drives so it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually quite</font>

156
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:44,640
hard to find a<font color="#E5E5E5"> place that's actually we</font>

157
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:46,740
can save it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to so you need we try</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

158
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:48,180
save it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the desktop or make any</font>

159
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:50,820
change<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the desktop we're denied</font>

160
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:53,370
access we don't even have rights to save

161
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:54,840
it to my documents folder but we can

162
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:56,820
save<font color="#E5E5E5"> to is the temp folder</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> within</font>

163
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:58,140
windows since<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know where the</font>

164
00:07:56,820 --> 00:08:03,380
operating system inis we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> just type</font>

165
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:06,840
again present system route it's % / temp

166
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:09,480
/ clown exe is everybody has to be

167
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:12,030
rights to the temp folder so we save

168
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:15,180
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so now we saved uploaded a payload</font>

169
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:16,950
to this box for malicious purposes so

170
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:19,560
now we<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> run the payload began</font>

171
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:22,289
guess I can do this so from the window

172
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:23,700
again just type in our desktop<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can</font>

173
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:27,060
show the<font color="#E5E5E5"> metasploit I've already set</font>

174
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:29,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">most about ready to listen</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to it so our</font>

175
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:29,870
desktop minus s

176
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:34,960
because we don't know where the forest

177
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:41,500
we can just same again just put % system

178
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:45,280
route<font color="#E5E5E5"> vitis backslash temp black / clown</font>

179
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:46,540
to exe<font color="#CCCCCC"> the reason why</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm showing you</font>

180
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:51,370
this is because<font color="#CCCCCC"> you see in a minute that</font>

181
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:52,990
is it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> as simple as firing the</font>

182
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:56,710
metasploit payload to it you've got to

183
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:59,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">make a few changes so as it launches you</font>

184
00:08:56,710 --> 00:09:01,360
see here that palos been executed as you

185
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:03,219
would expect it so<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone is now</font>

186
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:06,250
automatically typed shell we try that

187
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:10,960
now in this box it fails so we get a

188
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:13,690
nice little area<font color="#E5E5E5"> when i type shell so it</font>

189
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:15,100
felt good type list of processes you'll

190
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:16,750
actually see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're only not getting</font>

191
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:20,050
we're not getting all the processes

192
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:22,690
we're interests a lemonade restrict and

193
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:33,180
other processes seem to be missing the

194
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:35,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">user name so we type get system come on</font>

195
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:39,280
this should escalate I<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty distant</font>

196
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:42,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">hope so but it works cool banoffee type</font>

197
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:43,780
here so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually get a restricted</font>

198
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:46,230
account so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we still haven't got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

199
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:49,150
properly<font color="#CCCCCC"> so what you need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do now is</font>

200
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:51,670
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to migrate to one of the system</font>

201
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:54,930
accounts so if we type PS again you see

202
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:57,459
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the sore appeared now so we can now</font>

203
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:59,530
the one you can't really see<font color="#CCCCCC"> it because</font>

204
00:09:57,460 --> 00:10:02,320
of my<font color="#E5E5E5"> cramp editing but i always</font>

205
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:05,500
recommend to use the migrate with the

206
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:07,060
winlogon<font color="#E5E5E5"> exe at the top there it's the</font>

207
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:09,370
first<font color="#E5E5E5"> one you come across multiple on</font>

208
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:10,930
there and if you use when<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other ones</font>

209
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:14,310
it just kills the<font color="#E5E5E5"> machine fuck knows why</font>

210
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:21,839
it's going so just migrated to that one

211
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:25,199
<font color="#CCCCCC">and then once it's done that what</font>

212
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:28,350
though<font color="#E5E5E5"> shell again and we now got system</font>

213
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,760
so basically pretty much on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the box just</font>

214
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:35,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">to prove it I would help if I could</font>

215
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:40,170
spell so there<font color="#E5E5E5"> you go got system and</font>

216
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:50,310
we've come<font color="#E5E5E5"> out again dump hashes just to</font>

217
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:52,079
show it all works<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so next so how to</font>

218
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:53,219
fix the boring better buy it all get

219
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:57,360
pissed now if you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> care how</font>

220
00:10:53,220 --> 00:11:00,480
you fix it<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was just the standard</font>

221
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:03,030
restricted user so basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is how</font>

222
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:05,610
you would fix this problem if you go to

223
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:06,689
see if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you try</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there from here I like to</font>

224
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:08,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">remember this screams it looks very</font>

225
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:10,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">similar to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one we click OK it</font>

226
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:13,280
doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> work says you've got to enter</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

227
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:18,540
path of file name so what we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

228
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:22,500
is we go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and we load up the</font>

229
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:24,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">tillman service configurator but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our DB</font>

230
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:26,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">tcp environment you just gotta put</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

231
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:28,620
tick in there as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is it's a tick</font>

232
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:30,270
but no one<font color="#E5E5E5"> Microsoft can't do it we put</font>

233
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:32,100
a tick in there and you also might be

234
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:34,650
think you got put something in there but

235
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:37,290
you don't just leave it blank so like I

236
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:39,630
said<font color="#E5E5E5"> on to the terminal at the group</font>

237
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:41,760
policy you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a change so just</font>

238
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:44,730
to show that<font color="#E5E5E5"> tick does work so we do our</font>

239
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:48,240
desktop minus s and we run Internet

240
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:49,740
Explorer again it will actually won't

241
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:56,190
work just come up and log in as the

242
00:11:49,740 --> 00:12:06,920
normal user program files I explored

243
00:11:56,190 --> 00:12:06,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">that I explore and when that it's there</font>

244
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:16,800
come on and when we login at the

245
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:19,020
restricted user again it would just load

246
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:21,240
up as the restricted terminal servers or

247
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:23,310
stricted screen we're expected to be

248
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:25,410
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> lockdown so as you see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet</font>

249
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:28,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">Explorer hasn't run ms plate runs like</font>

250
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:29,699
normal nope neither it's not restricted

251
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:32,939
so it's just the restricted laptop

252
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:35,550
desktop again so just to show you again

253
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:37,770
so if I can't there just shows<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

254
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:43,740
simple tick or go back to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

255
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:46,680
server move the tick which is removed<font color="#E5E5E5"> by</font>

256
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:48,420
default so if you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> see in that box</font>

257
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:54,150
you mess around<font color="#CCCCCC"> Terminal Services</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

258
00:12:48,420 --> 00:13:04,079
open to this type of attack so just run

259
00:12:54,150 --> 00:13:05,400
again login and<font color="#CCCCCC"> into X plural runs so</font>

260
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:09,360
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that single tick they actually</font>

261
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:11,880
screwed you over<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so now let's fuck</font>

262
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:13,500
around with a network once we've got it

263
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:15,060
we can try<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the local admin passwords</font>

264
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:17,580
I've try that on other servers to see if

265
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:19,979
it works because<font color="#E5E5E5"> most likely be the same</font>

266
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:22,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">password check other services like</font>

267
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:23,250
running up VNC you've got VNC and it

268
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:25,109
takes you five seconds to crack the

269
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:26,400
password each point on the registry on

270
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:29,430
your target box and then you can use it

271
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:31,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">to attack other boxes you can use</font>

272
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:33,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">metasploit so to route exploits through</font>

273
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:35,640
this box so you can actually set up

274
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:37,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">metasploit so on that box so when you</font>

275
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:39,600
connect in and metal it connects back

276
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:41,430
out you can attack other boxes within

277
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,710
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> network quite happily but loading</font>

278
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:45,180
payloads you can actually see the video

279
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:48,090
