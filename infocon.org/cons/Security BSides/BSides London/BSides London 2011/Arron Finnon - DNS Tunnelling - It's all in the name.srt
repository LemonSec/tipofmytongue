so I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to speak to you about DNS</font>

4
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:24,740
time this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a crash course</font>

5
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:26,060
if you've done DNS time before you're

6
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:27,439
not going to learn anything super new

7
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:29,540
today I have to be honest<font color="#E5E5E5"> with you but</font>

8
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:31,460
if you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> just heard about it never</font>

let's say ens tumblr it does sound a

12
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:45,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">little bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more complicated than then</font>

13
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:48,200
than it really is I promise you that you

14

18
00:00:57,380 --> 00:01:00,800
very likely that if you're not doing in

19
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:05,210
a test environment that is going to be

20

<font color="#E5E5E5">illegal so behave yourself so I put mine</font>

21
00:01:05,209 --> 00:01:12,530
this question I do ask yourself quite

22
00:01:07,369 --> 00:01:14,930

secure to consult an independent

26

35
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:46,729
what we're talking about today just some

36
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:49,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the history involved a little bit of</font>

a technical review a limited snapshot of

00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:54,259
some of the tools available making time

39
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:57,549
to flip chart are those some of those

40
00:01:54,260 --> 00:02:00,049
sites that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> seen some of those</font>

41
00:01:57,549 --> 00:02:02,350
portals and stuff like that I've seen

42
00:02:00,049 --> 00:02:04,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">that may be a little bit vulnerable</font>

00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:05,240

just a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of Q&A of time domain</font>

46
00:02:07,149 --> 00:02:12,860
so without doubt this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is very illegal</font>

47
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:18,440
domestic was on that the on your own

48
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:21,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">tests now however I really hate using</font>

up with Fabio and it's basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> the art</font>

52

of war teachers is not to rely from the

likelihood of an enemy not coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> but on</font>

54

chances of his not attacking the rather

56
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,360
than fact that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we've made</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our position</font>

57
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:42,260
unassailable and so I sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of meaning</font>

58
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:46,250
not if I had becomes but I think this

59
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:48,910
stuff is important to learn back it's

60
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:53,000
for you guys my intended audience today

61
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:54,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">Farkas and I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mean this media blah</font>

good friend of mine Pete word from first

65
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:04,730
base when I interviewed<font color="#E5E5E5"> him for pottery</font>

66
00:03:03,019 --> 00:03:08,690
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> talked about going into the industry</font>

67
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:10,010
and he said<font color="#CCCCCC"> to me he</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was you know a part</font>

68
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:11,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">and parcel what you do is to take things</font>

70
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:17,780
bad way and if you hadn't been

71
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:21,230
electrocuted by 10 this probably

72
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:23,030
probably isn't the right movie I'm happy

73
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:24,858
<font color="#E5E5E5">to say that I was electrocuted tampering</font>

74
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:26,859
around things by six and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can imagine</font>

76
00:03:26,859 --> 00:03:33,680
anyway so move on a small inch of snow

77
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:36,290
in September<font color="#E5E5E5"> 2000 article chem coughs he</font>

78
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:39,319
slashed up website and basically it was

79
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:43,760
a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of German researchers had come</font>

80
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:48,200
up with a protocol called an STX name

81
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:52,340
sir bertran phone call however course

82
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:53,660
that kind of got a little bit more media

83
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:55,880
coverage when that little known

84
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:57,769
researcher<font color="#CCCCCC"> Dan Kaminsky start talking</font>

85
00:03:55,880 --> 00:04:01,190
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and you're at least a set of</font>

86
00:03:57,769 --> 00:04:03,440
scripts in 2005 written and poll that

87
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:07,069
made dms coming reasonably<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy to</font>

88
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:09,739
establish I mean the fact of it is is

89
00:04:07,069 --> 00:04:12,040
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> dinners tunneling enables you to do</font>

00:04:09,739 --> 00:04:15,579
TCP IP traffic over you

00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:17,858
DP over UDP protocol so Alice its own

92
00:04:15,579 --> 00:04:19,780
challenges although<font color="#E5E5E5"> dinner styling can</font>

93
00:04:17,858 --> 00:04:21,250
help you obtain free internet and stuff

94
00:04:19,779 --> 00:04:23,258
like that and I would argue that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

95
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:25,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">not free if you go to jail for it but</font>

96
00:04:23,259 --> 00:04:27,490
it's also very effective<font color="#CCCCCC"> at hiding</font>

97
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:30,449
things it's a very<font color="#CCCCCC"> good covert channel</font>

98
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:33,160
it's good<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see and data if you've got</font>

99
00:04:30,449 --> 00:04:37,360
FTP and so on<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so forth taking away</font>

100
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:40,660
you can establish an ssh or ICP

101
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:43,960
connection with data so<font color="#CCCCCC"> on so forth it's</font>

102
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:46,479
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> can be used for delivering shell</font>

00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:48,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">coves let's reverse connecting bank is</font>

104
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:50,590
very good at reversing nuts it's an

105
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:52,059
interesting concept and there is some

106
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:54,099
tools nothing about leaving my

107
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:59,410
ex-boyfriend to talk of the MS clubs

108
00:04:54,099 --> 00:05:03,460
well they<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to use to use forward so</font>

109
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:06,160
in 1987 to the remaining protocol came

110
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:07,870
into existence replaced few RFC's so

111
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,729
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> 13 years later these german</font>

112
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:12,160
hackers donors talking about we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> able</font>

113
00:05:09,729 --> 00:05:16,060
to use the dms tunnel provided by

00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:19,810
Microsoft's PPP dialogue update sir and

115
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:22,479
they were<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to obtain free internet</font>

116
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:26,380
basically this is because<font color="#CCCCCC"> microsoft</font>

117
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:28,750
allowed dns lookups<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can came into</font>

118
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:31,409
existence after this and it's based on

119
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:35,139
NSD<font color="#CCCCCC"> x but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it has password authentication</font>

120
00:05:31,409 --> 00:05:38,440
however i'm going to talk predominately

121
00:05:35,139 --> 00:05:40,090
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> documents</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> these awesome at the</font>

122
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:41,650
enough<font color="#E5E5E5"> setup because it's incredibly</font>

123
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:43,210
easy to deploy so if you wanting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to play</font>

124
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:45,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">around in the test environment them and</font>

125
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:47,229
get this<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> set up I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't but it's</font>

126
00:05:45,789 --> 00:05:49,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">nice</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to get your hands on to something</font>

127
00:05:47,229 --> 00:05:51,610
to be able to to get a working resolves

128
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:52,870
quickly so that you can get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a feel for</font>

129
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:55,150
what's going on so that's where I'm

130
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:58,570
going for as the mugginess does have its

131
00:05:55,150 --> 00:06:00,549
problems but it's good so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm sure</font>

132
00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:03,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">mostly we know how the domain name</font>

133
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:06,849
server systems and all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this works out</font>

134
00:06:03,159 --> 00:06:07,780
but basically we have root servers that

135
00:06:06,849 --> 00:06:09,789
handled

136
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:14,169
arms of the orbs and all of these other

137
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:17,740
things and then these are broken down

138
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:20,410
into the domain name service that under

139
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:23,430
maybe the<font color="#CCCCCC"> supplements so the route will</font>

140
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:25,720
find example calm and a subdomain

141
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:29,080
inbound<font color="#CCCCCC"> our example will be handled by</font>

142
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:31,750

and all these or so and emotionally it

145
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:41,290
could be 255 architects or you know 255

146
00:06:37,419 --> 00:06:44,130
bytes in addition we can send an illness

147
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:48,340
text file back but can also create a

148

license within this 255 bytes that were

149

<font color="#E5E5E5">able to even touch lately and send it</font>

decode and Riaan code or response but

154
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:07,409
this will be delivered by txt is a very

plausible<font color="#E5E5E5"> Avenue and calculate this way</font>

156
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:11,830
this is what you would probably see one

of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> time files if you doing dns</font>

159
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:24,419
trick<font color="#CCCCCC"> of really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> funds is that it comes</font>

decoding you can use the<font color="#CCCCCC"> indian s and</font>

166
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:39,130
went directly to it as well the result

167
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:41,770
of settings I have lots and lots of two

168
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:44,200

there's about three pages of the link to

173
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:55,240
the end I thought when I set up what I

174
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:57,729
plan to use as I tend to use ad in DNS

175
00:07:55,240 --> 00:08:01,600
account however they don't allow you to

176
00:07:57,729 --> 00:08:04,748
do recursive DNS to delegate a domain

however free dentistry or does allow you

179
00:08:08,209 --> 00:08:14,179
to do personally quite like using an

always use a virtual machine<font color="#CCCCCC"> be good but</font>

00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:59,509

<font color="#E5E5E5">up a key tables or something like that</font>

208
00:09:23,899 --> 00:09:28,430
to handle the fact that you've got two

services running on the same port just

210
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:34,040
get right Prince dropped and set up so

211
00:09:31,309 --> 00:09:37,759
as<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can see in my example here one</font>

212
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:41,990
arms is we load up the script by

213
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:44,720
pointing to work on this is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> big in</font>

214
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:47,029
bounty and i skate on through and we set

215
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:50,540
the system running and it takes<font color="#CCCCCC"> up then</font>

216
00:09:47,029 --> 00:09:52,410
what we do is on our client we install

217
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:54,149
some of these tools

218
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:57,449
there's a few packages of talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about in</font>

219
00:09:54,149 --> 00:10:00,000
a second now how the response comes back

220
00:09:57,449 --> 00:10:02,490
is by<font color="#E5E5E5"> Australia's thinking L out which</font>

221
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:06,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">is in itself</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not very helpful but we can</font>

222
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:09,000
use the proxy commander then ssh to run

223
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:12,119
the clients got the pumpkin seeds

224
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:15,779
wreckage will receive all of the encoded

225
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:17,699
responses in be encoded by the octree

226
00:10:15,779 --> 00:10:21,269
basis our plan will be sending<font color="#E5E5E5"> in base</font>

227
00:10:17,699 --> 00:10:25,139
level<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2 and our server will respond back</font>

228
00:10:21,269 --> 00:10:26,610
in base64 which allows our case and

229
00:10:25,139 --> 00:10:30,269
lower case and ascii characters and so

230
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:33,209
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> so unless we were able to transfer it</font>

231
00:10:30,269 --> 00:10:34,680
just helps time to learn to bake them so

232
00:10:33,209 --> 00:10:39,660
we can see late some smarts comes back

233
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:41,370
it's pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> encoded you can see an</font>

234
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:44,850
environment<font color="#CCCCCC"> chrysler something someone</font>

235
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:47,480
to this so quick recap of what we need

236
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:49,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">self like a little self in your house</font>

237
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:52,500
need to install some packages of say

238
00:10:49,829 --> 00:10:55,258
based on debian upon to install screen

239
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:57,540
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have to be honest with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you dns</font>

240
00:10:55,259 --> 00:11:00,230
atomic can be flaky sometimes and if

241
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:04,230
you're doing something to get cut off

242
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:07,769
teen and upon a couple of extra belt

243
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:10,439
library fires i have copy of the script

244
00:11:07,769 --> 00:11:11,730
i have copied<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for my own website</font>

245
00:11:10,439 --> 00:11:16,099
because it can<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a little bit difficult</font>

246
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:20,819
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> fight however I did find a version</font>

247
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:22,800
from a gentleman angelus dog who retook

248
00:11:20,819 --> 00:11:24,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">dan kaminsky is worth maybe 23 years</font>

249
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:26,639
later to kind of clean the coop made it

250
00:11:24,779 --> 00:11:28,709
a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> more stable so that's the</font>

251
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:32,670
version<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have available that's just</font>

252
00:11:28,709 --> 00:11:38,880
that my side down /a /li awesome<font color="#E5E5E5"> ideas</font>

253
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:41,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">yes that does well and if you want to go</font>

254
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:44,209
to the site where<font color="#CCCCCC"> the guy's original</font>

255
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:44,209
work was it's just that

256
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:50,670
on a client we need to install a couple

257
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:52,920
of these packages as I said basically

258
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:55,229
some polite responding DN essence and a

259
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:56,759
stage<font color="#E5E5E5"> 2 so and then this would be the</font>

260
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:58,560
type of commander<font color="#E5E5E5"> boomers wrong on our</font>

261
00:11:56,759 --> 00:12:00,240
part this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is just to set up an ssh</font>

262
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:02,579
connection these are the things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

263
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:04,259
can do the month<font color="#CCCCCC"> period</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> documentation</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

264
00:12:02,579 --> 00:12:06,930
still a little bit sketchy but you do

265
00:12:04,259 --> 00:12:09,839
find guys about it but there's a proof

266
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:12,269
of concept and being able to tunnel<font color="#E5E5E5"> SSH</font>

267
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:14,670
is a handy thing to have as well boxing

268
00:12:12,269 --> 00:12:16,410
it's on a circle what's the interesting

269
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:18,660
thing here is when you're doing a

270
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:20,850
connection and through the property upon

271
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:23,069
your kind of your remote client you're

272
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:26,220
actually SS aging locally<font color="#CCCCCC"> finish or</font>

273
00:12:23,069 --> 00:12:28,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">props in back so like a standard normal</font>

274
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:32,100
who say for new people<font color="#E5E5E5"> Chinese would be</font>

275
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:35,819
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> put the remote address that they</font>

276
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:37,380
wanting<font color="#E5E5E5"> to connect to the software so it</font>

277
00:12:35,819 --> 00:12:40,170
made the connection as though it's

278
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:41,970
actually time to the local host it's

279
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:47,579
strange<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it does make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sense in the</font>

280
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:51,660
end so if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we come of what obeys the one</font>

281
00:12:47,579 --> 00:12:56,430
basically so when you run this command

282
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:58,199
what happen is the ssh server will

283
00:12:56,430 --> 00:13:00,388

running and I himself and how that<font color="#CCCCCC"> works</font>

314
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:19,459
is that works up by setting up<font color="#E5E5E5"> virtual</font>

315
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:22,370
interfaces so that you can set up almost

00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:24,350
like a VPN connection so as<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can see</font>

you straightaway we've got more power

little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> more stable however it</font>

so on and so forth so little bit gone

i will be fixed soon someone told me has

00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:51,580
firstly that's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> throwaway completely</font>

00:15:57,370 --> 00:16:02,770
popping about using the 3g network

356
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:04,839
tunneled through the<font color="#E5E5E5"> DMS you've got no</font>

357
00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:06,579
bandwidth required some also probably

358
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:09,190
quite hard to trace unless you did

00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:13,029
something particularly<font color="#CCCCCC"> Northey and this</font>

361
00:16:13,029 --> 00:16:17,080
than you know unsecured wireless

362
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:18,760
networks you know you don't have to find

363
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:21,279
something to this<font color="#E5E5E5"> center it is plug into</font>

366
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,380
you can pretty much throw that this

better throw sim card away was gone

368
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:33,339
again it's very very easy to test it but

you're on like a captive portal the

up your network now fair enough it might

401
00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:56,959
be a little bit slow but if I leave

402
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:59,960
something running overnight how to take

403
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:03,110
my sensitive doc not that I would become

00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:08,559

don't know how much<font color="#E5E5E5"> you cut to drink or</font>

00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:22,219
like two o'clock in the morning walking

nothing but not how to play around<font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

417
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,570
too much so that's about any questions

418
00:18:40,129 --> 00:18:45,408
about but most important things to talk

419
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:46,789
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> compromises which is unusual put</font>

420
00:18:45,409 --> 00:18:49,490
on a few talks and normally

00:18:46,789 --> 00:18:51,500
countermeasures our defense in depth and

422
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:55,759
all of those great buzz words we tend to

423
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:57,679
use but it's really<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> two three</font>

424
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:58,879
slides on this and but is it is there is

425
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:01,759
some things that we can do this is a

426
00:18:58,879 --> 00:19:03,980
very heart attack to deal with we want

427
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:07,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">to offer services to our user but those</font>

428
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:11,340
various services that we give our<font color="#CCCCCC"> opens</font>

429
00:19:07,009 --> 00:19:13,650
up to potential attacks so decent

430
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:16,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">stickle anomaly detection this is a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

431
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:18,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">good sort of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a very good kind key I mean</font>

432
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:20,939
it dead giveaway is is if you have three

433
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:24,290
or four thousand times the increase in

434
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:26,250
base data to encoded domain names

435
00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:27,720
there's a good chance that someone's up

436
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:29,940
to something because<font color="#E5E5E5"> the whole point of</font>

437
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:32,880
the domain name system is it to be

438
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:35,070
readable rememberable you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean so</font>

439
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:40,050
we Santa see very strange domain name

440
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:42,899
requests were also monitor the amount of

441
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:45,720
data<font color="#E5E5E5"> that those are the 53</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as simply is</font>

442
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:49,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really shouldn't be getting and</font>

443
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:51,300
a half gigs worth of data the one of the

444
00:19:49,260 --> 00:20:03,540
big problems are saying with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the idea is</font>

445
00:19:51,300 --> 00:20:05,520
monitoring dns yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean I think it's</font>

446
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:08,040
a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> point I'm not saying that us a</font>

447
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:10,620
big indicator for you know when you save

448
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:12,330
like take a university campus how many

449
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:14,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">Google look what's the game they can't</font>

450
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:18,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">just say if a domain name get X amount</font>

451
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:20,940
of requests killer you just it may sound

452
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:23,159
a good idea when texting to text but the

453
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:26,100
reality of rolling now how is that you

454
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:28,500
can have problems but having a look and

455
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:31,199
saying WOW we've got 25 times the

456
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:34,110
increase on what we normally see in 53

457
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:35,940
maybe someone should<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a look at that</font>

458
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:38,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">nothing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is a big problem now but you're</font>

459
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:41,970
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> is injecting the potential for</font>

460
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:43,980
more false positives but it's a way to

461
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:47,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">try me fly it up along but subtly</font>

462
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:51,390
pointed episode he have a subdomain of

463
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:53,940
50 characters<font color="#E5E5E5"> alaikum yeah there is this</font>

464
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:56,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">a those sort of normally lookups there's</font>

465
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:58,140
a good stop but they're not sort of

468
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:05,010
ground have a look and say right there

469
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:06,389
is maybe something going on I need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

470
00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:08,550
investigate and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I suppose that's all we</font>

can ask for thing as<font color="#E5E5E5"> Germany and can't</font>

472
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:11,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">really ask for much more than that if</font>

you<font color="#E5E5E5"> are running like a for free</font>

out

476
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:19,399
I know this sounds stupid<font color="#E5E5E5"> but we going</font>

477
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:22,280
to see it I've seen it<font color="#CCCCCC"> very much many</font>

478
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:25,280
organizations do this HTTP<font color="#CCCCCC"> requests</font>

479
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:27,740
rewrite it and that's how they do but

480
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:30,649
still allow the resultant of external

481
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:33,170
dns thing that we've got so maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

482
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:35,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">could</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use by instead of locally to route</font>

484
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:44,000
then once in one place let them do

00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:49,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">external ear cups the other thing we're</font>

crazy maybe denial txt I'm come again it

487
00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:56,419
shouldn't massively impact than that

488
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:58,070
huge in general<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's really kind of</font>

489
00:21:56,419 --> 00:22:00,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">only incoming mail service that</font>

490
00:21:58,070 --> 00:22:01,309
massively need this and in the

00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:04,639
environments that you see<font color="#CCCCCC"> now and only</font>

492
00:22:01,309 --> 00:22:06,860
see a separation<font color="#CCCCCC"> between what's handling</font>

493
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:08,210
mail server look lopsy<font color="#CCCCCC"> and so I'm sort</font>

494
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:13,639
of but that might not be the situation

495
00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:17,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">here fully</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> appreciate but that's as far</font>

496
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:19,580
as<font color="#E5E5E5"> really kind of take any more song</font>

497
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:21,559
flowers away because it will have huge

498
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:22,970
problems then conclusion and red star

499
00:22:21,559 --> 00:22:27,250
service<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want to kind of give you</font>

500
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:29,660
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> tester and kind of give you some ideas</font>

501
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:31,490
if you're not looking at DNS I did ask

502
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:33,650
how many people among from deer nuts and

503
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:35,780
you get one hand off there's a great

504
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:40,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">potential that maybe someone else is or</font>

505
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:42,830
will be wondered little uses our limit

506
00:22:40,549 --> 00:22:44,990
three deep connection stuff is massive I

507
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:47,360
do you think so and as i said earlier on

508
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:48,799
don't get fooled with this 10 11 12 it's

509
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:51,530
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> sec and i do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think we'll see some</font>

510
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:54,559
increases in a before the next step

511
00:22:51,530 --> 00:22:56,299
probably rides thyself<font color="#E5E5E5"> so as I say here</font>

quick questions in the more than welcome

it I have to be honest<font color="#CCCCCC"> with you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't</font>

523
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:27,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">think it must of if you have a</font>

524
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:30,610
legitimate domain name when you're doing

525
00:23:27,409 --> 00:23:34,399
this then you know inside<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

526
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:35,779
theoretically<font color="#E5E5E5"> the level that you're</font>

527
00:23:34,399 --> 00:23:37,639
doing if you're not absolutes an

528
00:23:35,779 --> 00:23:39,490
implementation vulnerability rather than

529
00:23:37,639 --> 00:23:41,840
anything else that's how it works so

530
00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:44,750
there's certain further research I think

531
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:46,549
it's still<font color="#CCCCCC"> early days for an IR geometry</font>

532
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:48,620
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> a huge amount of research into dns</font>

533
00:23:46,549 --> 00:23:50,600
actors<font color="#CCCCCC"> just trying to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> got to speed</font>

534
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:51,918
<font color="#E5E5E5">quickly with that but yeah</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i think it</font>

535
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:54,918
<font color="#E5E5E5">will throw some hurdles but i don't</font>

536
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:57,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">think it will kill you i don't buy you</font>

537
00:23:54,919 --> 00:24:00,740
that observes<font color="#E5E5E5"> i got me from you to a</font>

538
00:23:57,409 --> 00:24:02,929
very good point and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is a that's it</font>

539
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:04,700
for nutshell you have to be careful that

540
00:24:02,929 --> 00:24:06,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">you don't share your faith demeaning</font>

account on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the box there's</font>

543
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:13,370
Eternals area yeah but you you examine

544
00:24:11,779 --> 00:24:15,019
you still need the shadow cabinet using

545
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:17,779
it in the password but if you know those

546
00:24:15,019 --> 00:24:19,549
things yeah you know if you knew my my

547
00:24:17,779 --> 00:24:21,320
cell my password there's nothing

00:24:24,889 --> 00:24:29,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">service there is no authenticate there</font>

552
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:32,149
is no authentication of really apart

553
00:24:29,809 --> 00:24:33,769
from your SS a stop stop so you would be

554
00:24:32,149 --> 00:24:36,709
able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do some stuff it is a way into</font>

555
00:24:33,769 --> 00:24:42,789
you on that one as well as<font color="#CCCCCC"> you compare</font>

556
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:42,789
this is my CP you see

to be honest with<font color="#E5E5E5"> you DN a-- the reason</font>

560
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:58,760
those two or three years ago and i went

561
00:24:57,110 --> 00:25:00,860
did a little bit of research afterwards

562
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:03,650
and that's why i meant to the DNA stuff

563
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:06,050
and it wasn't into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the basically</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pink</font>
