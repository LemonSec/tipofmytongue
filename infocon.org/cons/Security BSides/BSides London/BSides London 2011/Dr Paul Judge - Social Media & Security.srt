00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:14,979
move in these directions right so if you

30
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:17,140

33
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:25,749
2003 2003 there was maybe five percent

34
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:27,759
of email spam right five to ten percent

35
00:01:25,749 --> 00:01:29,649
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> emails family you might forget you</font>

percent of email you forget<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it</font>

38
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:34,420
wasn't always like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that right so just</font>

39

eight<font color="#CCCCCC"> years ago that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> goes like five to</font>

40
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:38,380
ten percent of email was with spam and

41
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:40,090
went to twenty and thirty and forty

42
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:42,100
percent of the group and so nowadays

43
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:44,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">were just accustomed to ninety percent</font>

44
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:46,719
of email being spam well what happened

45
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:50,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">last year if you look at 2010 this weird</font>

thing happened<font color="#E5E5E5"> where a half the spam</font>

47
00:01:50,469 --> 00:01:59,008
disappear so so literally so this is a

48
00:01:54,249 --> 00:02:02,288
view of the amount of spam showing up at

49
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:05,380
Barracuda customers around the world so

50
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:08,080
you look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the beginning of 2010 we</font>

51
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:11,410
were averaging about<font color="#CCCCCC"> 50 billion spam</font>

52
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:13,840
messages per day that we're seeing show

53
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:15,730
up at our customers if you look from

54
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,620
july to the end of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> year it literally</font>

55
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:21,369
went down to 26 points so half the spam

56
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:23,170
disappeared<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so did all the</font>

57
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:25,360
spammers like go skiing

58
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:27,549
all the spammers kind of go hang out go

59
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,110
here to puff<font color="#E5E5E5"> no so what happened</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is I</font>

60
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:31,569
mean think about it you put yourself in

61
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:33,550
the mindset of a spammer or attack or

62
00:02:31,569 --> 00:02:35,859
someone trying to illegally make money

63
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:37,330
from computer activity right there a

64
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:39,190
business so they're like<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay how can I</font>

65
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:40,450
make the most money how can I make the

66
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:42,280
most money I have limited resources I

67
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:43,869
have some butts I have some bandwidth I

68
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:46,810
have some computers like how<font color="#CCCCCC"> can i</font>

69
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:48,190
maximize my profits and you think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

70
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:49,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">I have some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> BOTS what's the best thing</font>

71
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:51,459
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do with us I mean the spamming</font>

72
00:02:49,989 --> 00:02:53,470
business is getting hard it's been hard

73
00:02:51,459 --> 00:02:54,910
for a while right because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're sending</font>

74
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:57,459
spam and you're hitting some spam

75
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:58,959
gateways you're going to block<font color="#E5E5E5"> 99% of</font>

76
00:02:57,459 --> 00:03:00,730
those things then even the ones that go

77
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:02,260
through my senator spam folder people

78
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:04,179
might not read<font color="#CCCCCC"> it I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> barely can read my</font>

79
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:06,370
own real email like I can't keep up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

80
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:07,540
Sam as well so like the profit margins

81
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:09,730
for spammers is getting worse and worse

82
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:12,280
and so they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at how do i make</font>

83
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:13,750
other ways of using these resources I

84
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:15,459
have these<font color="#E5E5E5"> BOTS I have this bandwidth I</font>

85
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:17,319
have this code how can I continue to

86
00:03:15,459 --> 00:03:20,170
make money on it and so what we're

87
00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:21,910
seeing<font color="#E5E5E5"> is no more and more so they're</font>

88
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:23,410
moving over to kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the web</font>

89
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:25,569
activities right they're moving over to

90
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:26,859
where<font color="#CCCCCC"> the eyeballs if I can't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get in</font>

91
00:03:25,569 --> 00:03:28,510
front of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your eyeballs while you're</font>

92
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:30,070
reading your email maybe I can get in

93
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:31,899
front of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your eyeballs while you're on a</font>

94
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:33,640
social network while you're on a search

95
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:42,640
engine and so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of what I want</font>

96
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:47,230
to dig<font color="#CCCCCC"> into a little bit pardon my my my</font>

97
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:48,850
frequent coffee consumption good night

98
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:51,910
before last I<font color="#CCCCCC"> spent</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the night on an</font>

99
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:55,170
airplane last night I spend it in a

100
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:59,160
local club so it was an improvement

101
00:03:55,170 --> 00:04:02,140
however it's still tuned to vol sleep so

102
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:03,459
so if you look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the web you look at</font>

103
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:05,350
kind of all the activity is happening on

104
00:04:03,459 --> 00:04:06,670
the web right now you know one thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

105
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:07,989
want to touch on is<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> why is it</font>

106
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:09,458
<font color="#E5E5E5">happening like what are the changes that</font>

107
00:04:07,989 --> 00:04:12,340
are happening that's making<font color="#CCCCCC"> it so easy</font>

108
00:04:09,459 --> 00:04:13,630
for attackers right now and but theory

109
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:15,609
is that there's these five things that

110
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:18,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">have occurred that are kind of</font>

111
00:04:15,609 --> 00:04:20,109
innovations they are beneficial things

112
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:21,760
as a whole but they've also disrupted

113
00:04:20,108 --> 00:04:23,409
the traditional ways that we secure web

114
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:26,729
right so one of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> for example</font>

115
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:28,840
is just a rapid growth right there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> 190</font>

116
00:04:26,729 --> 00:04:32,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">697</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> million domain names registered</font>

124
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:47,590
industry we did<font color="#CCCCCC"> wet filter we're</font>

00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,780
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I was there I mean I was</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">before</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Barracuda as a company called</font>

129
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,120
had a big web filtering database and

00:04:56,470 --> 00:05:00,250
people license our web filtering

131

132

basically people logged in every day

they kind of spent the day is you just

145
00:05:25,389 --> 00:05:29,830
manually try to organize the web and you

146
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:31,300
just can't keep up one domain name per

147
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:32,889
second you can't type fast<font color="#E5E5E5"> enough you</font>

148
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:34,900
can't you can't react fast enough so

149
00:05:32,889 --> 00:05:37,260
that's disrupted the traditional way

150
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:40,960
that companies were dealing<font color="#CCCCCC"> with this</font>

151
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:42,849
right so a second thing is whatever you

152
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:45,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to call it dynamic web apps Ajax</font>

153
00:05:42,849 --> 00:05:47,020
web 20 the point is it's brought us

154
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:49,179
great things I expresses their run in a

155
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:50,740
browser right is it brought us great

156
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:53,260
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like Outlook Web Access that</font>

157
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:55,660
feels like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a desktop fly in and but it's</font>

158
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:57,130
now made a point where remote<font color="#E5E5E5"> website</font>

159
00:05:55,660 --> 00:06:00,130
has more control<font color="#E5E5E5"> of your browser and</font>

160
00:05:57,130 --> 00:06:01,479
your computer than ever before right and

161
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:04,000
now one of the problems is like

162
00:06:01,479 --> 00:06:05,680
traditional application security used to

163
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,840
mean I would download an executable file

164
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:10,389
I would virus scan that file<font color="#CCCCCC"> and say</font>

165
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:11,948
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay this app is safe or not but</font>

166
00:06:10,389 --> 00:06:14,289
nowadays I mean that app is just a web

167
00:06:11,949 --> 00:06:16,180
app right it's xmlhttprequest so how do

168
00:06:14,289 --> 00:06:17,919
you virus scan that how do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell if</font>

169
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:19,389
it happens safe or not like who's in the

170
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:21,190
middle looking at all the calls and

171
00:06:19,389 --> 00:06:22,570
deciding if I app is safe or not because

172
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:24,400
you no longer have executed when you're

173
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:26,139
downloading a virus scanning right so

174
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:29,590
that's a shift that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're having to deal</font>

175
00:06:26,139 --> 00:06:31,840
with these other<font color="#E5E5E5"> two a pretty close</font>

176
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:33,250
related these are really<font color="#CCCCCC"> about different</font>

177
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,469
types of devices and where people are

178
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:38,169
accessing things wrong in one problem is

179
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:39,699
anybody here responsible for a corporate

180
00:06:38,169 --> 00:06:42,130
IT of corporate security out of business

181
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:44,919
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> company yeah and for the folks right</font>

182
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:46,539
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you look back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now five years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ago so</font>

183
00:06:44,919 --> 00:06:48,250
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> built out these infrastructure they</font>

184
00:06:46,539 --> 00:06:50,529
were very perimeter and<font color="#E5E5E5"> gateway focus</font>

185
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:52,569
and as long as somebody like walked into

186
00:06:50,529 --> 00:06:55,479
office and plugged into the ethernet and

187
00:06:52,569 --> 00:06:56,829
they were safe right but as soon as you

188
00:06:55,479 --> 00:06:58,269
picked<font color="#E5E5E5"> up the laptop you went across</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

189
00:06:56,829 --> 00:07:00,459
<font color="#CCCCCC">street for coffee you want across the</font>

190
00:06:58,269 --> 00:07:01,989
country for some for conference<font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font>

191
00:07:00,459 --> 00:07:03,819
outside<font color="#E5E5E5"> the perimeter to outside your</font>

192
00:07:01,989 --> 00:07:06,518
protection their neck it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font>

193
00:07:03,819 --> 00:07:08,499
exposed and you can look at the stats

194
00:07:06,519 --> 00:07:10,179
here basically a large<font color="#CCCCCC"> percentage of</font>

195
00:07:08,499 --> 00:07:12,039
people that leave the office end up

196
00:07:10,179 --> 00:07:13,719
being infected a lot of those infections

197
00:07:12,039 --> 00:07:16,149
come from visiting malicious websites

198
00:07:13,719 --> 00:07:18,429
now very similar<font color="#CCCCCC"> to that kind of new</font>

199
00:07:16,149 --> 00:07:19,959
devices like these mobile devices how do

200
00:07:18,429 --> 00:07:22,448
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> secure those things so it's really</font>

201
00:07:19,959 --> 00:07:23,919
it's a venir attackers to reach you

202
00:07:22,449 --> 00:07:26,109
while you're while you're exposed and

203
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:29,049
then<font color="#CCCCCC"> bring that attack back into into</font>

204
00:07:26,109 --> 00:07:30,579
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fifth</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> change this is</font>

205
00:07:29,049 --> 00:07:33,188
one will spend all the time one is

206
00:07:30,579 --> 00:07:35,049
user-generated content<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean if you</font>

207
00:07:33,189 --> 00:07:37,149
think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> just over the last several</font>

208
00:07:35,049 --> 00:07:39,459
years how user-generated content has

209
00:07:37,149 --> 00:07:40,899
taken over right half of the top 100

210
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:42,519
websites in the world use you to

211
00:07:40,899 --> 00:07:44,199
generated content whether that be like

212
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:46,749
Facebook Twitter the obvious ones are

213
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:48,969
even normal<font color="#CCCCCC"> brick and mortar sites that</font>

214
00:07:46,749 --> 00:07:51,429
added social media components right you

215
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:53,349
go now to buy a CD online or to buy a

216
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:54,698
refrigerator online there's some social

217
00:07:53,349 --> 00:07:56,860
media there's user-generated content

218
00:07:54,699 --> 00:07:59,860
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> are posting things well the</font>

219
00:07:56,860 --> 00:08:02,199
problem with that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is you think about the</font>

220
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:04,539
last time we educated the community

221
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:05,709
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> web security who said a when you</font>

222
00:08:04,539 --> 00:08:07,509
get on<font color="#CCCCCC"> your computer if you're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

223
00:08:05,709 --> 00:08:09,249
<font color="#CCCCCC">a website look for a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lock at the</font>

224
00:08:07,509 --> 00:08:12,009
bottom<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the browser and you see that</font>

225
00:08:09,249 --> 00:08:13,479
little lock everything's fine<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

226
00:08:12,009 --> 00:08:15,189
<font color="#CCCCCC">laughing is that's the last time we told</font>

227
00:08:13,479 --> 00:08:16,269
like you like think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> your mother</font>

228
00:08:15,189 --> 00:08:17,679
was the last time you told your mother

229
00:08:16,269 --> 00:08:19,209
anything about web security group or

230
00:08:17,679 --> 00:08:20,649
your<font color="#CCCCCC"> sisters like look for that little</font>

231
00:08:19,209 --> 00:08:22,289
lock at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bottom of the browser so I'm</font>

232
00:08:20,649 --> 00:08:24,459
did you<font color="#E5E5E5"> see that everything is fine</font>

233
00:08:22,289 --> 00:08:26,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">right and that mattered you know eight</font>

234
00:08:24,459 --> 00:08:30,039
<font color="#CCCCCC">years ago 10 years ago was like okay</font>

235
00:08:26,109 --> 00:08:31,599
<font color="#CCCCCC">this is e toys bubble calm and that's</font>

236
00:08:30,039 --> 00:08:33,848
really them you can trust and<font color="#E5E5E5"> move on</font>

237
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:35,620
but now it's no<font color="#E5E5E5"> matter no longer just a</font>

238
00:08:33,849 --> 00:08:36,909
matter of this domain level trust you

239
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:39,039
have this question of<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

240
00:08:36,909 --> 00:08:40,659
user-generated content behind that

241
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:42,458
domain and maybe 500 million people

242
00:08:40,659 --> 00:08:44,259
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> may be a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hundred million people so</font>

243
00:08:42,458 --> 00:08:46,809
<font color="#CCCCCC">i don't need to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just trust the domain i</font>

244
00:08:44,259 --> 00:08:48,129
need to understand each of these users

245
00:08:46,809 --> 00:08:49,929
are a legitimate or not are they even

246
00:08:48,129 --> 00:08:52,209
real or not right so there's this gap

247
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:54,040
there's this gap between kind of the the

248
00:08:52,209 --> 00:08:56,949
trust model that's possible on the web

249
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:59,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">today and kind of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what the functionality</font>

250
00:08:56,949 --> 00:09:02,258
of user-generated content has provided

251
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:04,130
and the attackers realized that this gap

252
00:09:02,259 --> 00:09:06,950
is there there's this gap

253
00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:08,600
trust facebook so the average<font color="#E5E5E5"> user by</font>

254
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:10,670
default trust a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's on</font>

255
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:12,470
there they trust<font color="#CCCCCC"> Twitter and by default</font>

256
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:14,240
trust a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of stuff that's on there and</font>

257
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:15,590
so the attackers really leveraging this

258
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,570
right now they're pounding it if you

259
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:19,520
think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> why</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i haff that that spam</font>

260
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:21,980
disappeared is because there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> this big</font>

261
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:24,310
window and portal for them to carry out

262
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:28,600
these attacks and social networks so

263
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:28,599
let's take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a look at a couple things</font>

264
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:45,290
facebook so here's a guy's arooga that's

265
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:47,210
actually a friend of mine on facebook he

266
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:51,230
was tagged in this person photo album

267
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:53,510
and see the photo got some of your

268
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:54,890
attention<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right so even with the</font>

269
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:56,330
shadowing from the projector and even

270
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:58,310
with the censored block that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I put on</font>

271
00:09:56,330 --> 00:10:01,010
there right it still is

272
00:09:58,310 --> 00:10:02,660
attention-grabbing and it's a I check

273
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:05,030
out this website on model for a sneaker

274
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:06,170
hide that info right so like<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay what's</font>

275
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:08,810
the big deal well this shows up in my

276
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:11,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">news feed right and we look at the</font>

277
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:14,540
photos you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know they tagged 50 people</font>

278
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:15,830
detect 50 people per photo they post and

279
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:18,500
you assume<font color="#CCCCCC"> that every person has a</font>

280
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:20,720
thousand friends then there's 50,000

281
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:23,780
people that just received this link

282
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,800
right so again think about your an

283
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:26,750
attacker you're trying to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> money</font>

284
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:29,180
would you rather sit there it's in

285
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:30,230
50,000 spam messages only to have them

286
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:32,359
hit the wall of a spam firewall

287
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:34,490
somewhere<font color="#E5E5E5"> I hit the floor or just post</font>

288
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:36,830

about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the efficiencies I basically</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

291
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:41,780
barrel features that made these networks

292
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:43,040
grow so much the attackers are really

293
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:45,829
learning how to take advantage of them

294
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:47,689
right so 50 people tagged 50,000 people

295
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:49,520
advertise this website so here's<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

296

300
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:57,680
look at the prices they're actually

301
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:59,390
below wholesale prices so there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> no way</font>

302
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:01,459
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to get a shoe in the nike</font>

you're going to put in your<font color="#E5E5E5"> credit card</font>

306
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:07,160
information and then you're going to see

307
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:09,079
a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of charges that you have no idea</font>

308
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:11,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">where they came from right but these are</font>

00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:14,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">the types of just kind of basic stuff</font>

310
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:17,569

so like Jackie's is interesting because

314
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:26,560
what's happening is they're making use

315
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:28,880
of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> facebook open graph API and</font>

316
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:30,979
everybody wants like me like my company

318
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:36,079

319
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:38,300
oh my friend Scott<font color="#E5E5E5"> over here like this</font>

323
00:11:42,769 --> 00:11:47,060
office it's early in the morning he'd

324
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:48,680
like the<font color="#E5E5E5"> link maybe I'll take a look</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

325
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:51,439
<font color="#CCCCCC">right so you take a look you click and</font>

326
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:54,109
what happens is it takes you to this

327
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:56,390
page and you're almost there is a minute

328
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:57,620
video you read your<font color="#CCCCCC"> + pray just see it</font>

329
00:11:56,390 --> 00:12:00,980
right quick before<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get back to work</font>

330
00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:03,140
right well the problem is when you click

331
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:07,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">to play this there's really no video</font>

332
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:10,550
it's a image that is encapsulated with

333
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:13,610
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> facebook open graph</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> API to take your</font>

334
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:17,329
click and turn it into a like right so

335
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:20,240
you look at the code here right so this

336
00:12:17,329 --> 00:12:23,120
this code is basically taking an entire

337
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:25,640
image a video frame to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the function as a</font>

338
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:27,170
facebook<font color="#CCCCCC"> like button right so on the</font>

341
00:12:29,449 --> 00:12:33,439
posting on your profile and posting on

342
00:12:31,339 --> 00:12:35,690

344
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:39,140
I didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> even see any Italian brush yet</font>

345
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:41,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">ok so then the other thing it does is</font>

346
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:43,010
after I click on it it is sitting there

347
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:45,320
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> also going to redirect me to some</font>

348
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:47,510
surveys so they're taking other

349
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:48,949
opportunities to monetize it take you to

350
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:51,199
some surveys where they<font color="#E5E5E5"> get affiliate</font>

351
00:12:48,949 --> 00:12:54,469
money back for for pointing you to those

352
00:12:51,199 --> 00:12:56,510
right so it's kind of kind of see here

353
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:58,010
once you click you get a like on your

00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:30,780
this link I'll see a website and I get

430
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:32,100
an explanation of what happened well if

431
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:35,150
you click that<font color="#E5E5E5"> link what happens is you</font>

432
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:38,190
get a couple series of redirections and

433
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:40,439
brings you back to facebook app this

434
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:42,240
one's not as greedy this one only wants

435
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:44,010
access to all your information it wants

436
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,510
to post to<font color="#E5E5E5"> your wall and it also like</font>

437
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:46,890
access to your photos

438
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:49,290
right because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it wants to use your</font>

439
00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:50,970
photos to lower more people in right and

440
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:53,790
so you look at it it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the hidden</font>

441
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:56,310
truth video app this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is pretty fresh it</font>

442
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:59,370
had 0 users so far so you actually go to

443
00:15:56,310 --> 00:16:00,750
the application page here's the

444
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:02,160
application page they didn't put<font color="#E5E5E5"> a logo</font>

445
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:03,840
up they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have any ratings don't</font>

446
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:07,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">have any monthly active users but</font>

447
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:09,690
there's a developer kit<font color="#E5E5E5"> agron developers</font>

448
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:13,140
so let's take a look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> that developer</font>

449
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:16,290
profile so kit agri kit are you here no

450
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:18,630
kiss not here so supposedly this is a

451
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:20,880
developer that<font color="#E5E5E5"> built that app right and</font>

452
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:23,189
here's the music she's into here the

453
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:24,689
movies that she's into and and so the

454
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:26,310
attacker has taken the time to create

455
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:28,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">this identity create this profile and</font>

456
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:29,880
make the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the accountant look more and</font>

457
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:30,990
more real and we were seeing that a lot

458
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:33,270
nowadays they're actually taking the

459
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:35,880
time to create<font color="#E5E5E5"> fake profiles specific to</font>

460
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:38,189
geographic regions right and so they'll

461
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:40,470
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> one for something as a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> specific as</font>

462
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:42,450
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little town in a certain</font>

463
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:43,890
state and they'll show that this person

464
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:45,870
went to this<font color="#CCCCCC"> college this person went to</font>

465
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:48,120
this high school<font color="#CCCCCC"> and they work at this</font>

466
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:49,650
company and use that to lure people that

467
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:51,000
went to those places so they they have

468
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:52,620
no problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> making thousands and</font>

469
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,970
thousands<font color="#E5E5E5"> of accounts and using them</font>

470
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:57,660
specifically to lure people from

471
00:16:53,970 --> 00:17:00,720
different regions so<font color="#E5E5E5"> Facebook examples</font>

472
00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:04,700
my last last facebook example here so

473
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,700
it's automated social<font color="#CCCCCC"> engineering</font>

474
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:19,020
so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a real chat session that</font>

475
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:21,540
popped up to me and this lady Kate

476
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:22,920
Wrigley is a lady that I work with a

477
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:25,319
barracuda worked with it for years a

478
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:28,260
couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> different</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> companies and she is a</font>

479
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:29,820

customer sides and dealing with<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

481
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:35,850

482
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:37,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">Facebook so when I get something from</font>

498
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:17,430
response right but<font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously this wasn't</font>

499
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:19,350
her this is automated kind of box

500
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:20,790
sitting on her computer had access to

501
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:21,959
her Facebook credentials and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

502
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:24,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">sitting there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going back and forth</font>

503
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:26,370
having a dialogue right so you think

504
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:29,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">about user education how do you teach a</font>

505
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:33,810
user to ignore this<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I SAT</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there and</font>

506
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:35,820
talked to it I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> they use very casual</font>

507
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:37,889
language they go back and forth estimate

508
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:40,409
what you're going to say and so I mean

509
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:42,030
you think again about those spammers and

510
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:43,260
why that spam volume went down so much

511
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:44,879
you're sitting<font color="#CCCCCC"> there with a bunch</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

512
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:46,470
bots out there your other<font color="#E5E5E5"> students</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> BAM</font>

513
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,640
messages out with those bots are you

514
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:49,200
rather sit there<font color="#CCCCCC"> and do facebook chats</font>

515
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:55,370
which was going to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> you a higher</font>

516
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:58,040
click rate so that was a piece<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

517
00:18:55,370 --> 00:19:00,870
malware running on that on that computer

518
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:02,220
you know one thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we we see is we</font>

519
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:05,459
<font color="#CCCCCC">should get tens of thousands of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pieces</font>

520
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:07,410
of malware day across email and web and

521
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:09,390
so one thing that we've done<font color="#E5E5E5"> to try to</font>

522
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:11,250
keep up with<font color="#E5E5E5"> it we try to if not you</font>

523
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:12,960
have to like manually take one sample

524
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:14,730
malware installed in an environment run

525
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:16,710
it analyzed it see what it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

526
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:20,850
we create this thing we call mal trace

527
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:23,670
and basically is a virtual<font color="#CCCCCC"> environment</font>

528
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:25,158
for analyzing and and observing malware

529
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:26,960
and so what we do is

530
00:19:25,159 --> 00:19:29,239
we let<font color="#CCCCCC"> the mountain come</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in we run it on</font>

531
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:31,759
a vm we let it run<font color="#CCCCCC"> on a nice windows vm</font>

532
00:19:29,239 --> 00:19:33,739
with all the apps loaded and it<font color="#E5E5E5"> it gets</font>

533
00:19:31,759 --> 00:19:35,210
in there and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it gets comfortable right</font>

534
00:19:33,739 --> 00:19:37,070
it gets comfortably makes itself at home

535
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:38,629
it starts changing registry settings and

536
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:40,489
starts calling out to command and

537
00:19:38,629 --> 00:19:41,779
control and sending out some spam and

538
00:19:40,489 --> 00:19:44,059
just does everything now we're supposed

539
00:19:41,779 --> 00:19:45,409
to do but meanwhile system isn't a vm

540
00:19:44,059 --> 00:19:47,479
it's not really<font color="#CCCCCC"> connected</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to anything</font>

541
00:19:45,409 --> 00:19:49,639
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> just capturing all the network</font>

542
00:19:47,479 --> 00:19:51,080
traces and understanding what domains

543
00:19:49,639 --> 00:19:53,090
what command and control is what this

544
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:54,889
and that so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it actually allows us to you</font>

545
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:57,709
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> go through 60 80 thousands of</font>

546
00:19:54,889 --> 00:19:59,570
pieces of malware day and make<font color="#E5E5E5"> Network</font>

547
00:19:57,710 --> 00:20:01,129
traces and turn that back into kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

548
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:03,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">interest in data we can use to kind of</font>

549
00:20:01,129 --> 00:20:06,080
protect people so it's kind of one thing

550
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:08,090
that has been<font color="#E5E5E5"> sparked by just all these</font>

551
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:10,908
different pieces of malware that we're

552
00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:12,080
seeing the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing so cuz it's kind</font>

631
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:57,980

633
00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:01,400
anyone's<font color="#E5E5E5"> ever wonder right and we</font>

634
00:22:59,930 --> 00:23:02,900
estimated three minutes per dance I mean

635
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:04,430
as a personal preference though right

636
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:06,080
but if you just<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at the amount of</font>

637
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:08,060
time like humans spin on<font color="#E5E5E5"> Twitter it's</font>

638
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:09,379
kind of just a funny example of how much

00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:12,110
time goes into this and this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> reading</font>

00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:14,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">one guy's tweets in one week and so the</font>

641
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:15,830
point is you know attackers realize

642
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:18,610
there's there's a lot of eyeballs out

643
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:18,610
there

644
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:38,910
so there's a lot of eyeballs out there

645
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:41,399
so the doctors are saying how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> I get</font>

646
00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:42,690
in front of these eyeballs so a couple

647
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:44,310
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that happened you look at Twitter</font>

648
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:46,550
they've<font color="#E5E5E5"> had a couple different types of</font>

649
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:49,200
incidents they've had account hijackings

650
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:51,510
where the high-profile person had their

651
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:53,190
account taking over attacker used it to

652
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:55,200
either send 20 messages out or malicious

653
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:57,540
messages out and so forth they had a

654
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:59,880
series of things that were kind of

655
00:23:57,540 --> 00:24:02,040
Twitter security problems like<font color="#CCCCCC"> Cody</font>

656
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:04,680
flaws that they had on their network

657
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:06,480
that caused problems and then they have

658
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:08,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">this other problem of people using</font>

659
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:10,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">Twitter as a platform to distribute</font>

660
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:12,870
malicious links press it kind of has

661
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:13,910
three different<font color="#E5E5E5"> types of things that</font>

662
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:16,439
they've had<font color="#E5E5E5"> to deal with over the years</font>

663
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:21,450
so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we take a look at some of the</font>

712
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:14,280
year they sentenced him to 25 months on

713
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:16,140
the suspended it but he basically broke

714
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:19,050
into the back end and had full access<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

twitter support system another<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem</font>

716
00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:23,190
that they had this was last year was a

717
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:26,280
thing called<font color="#E5E5E5"> forced follow anyone hear</font>

718
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:29,190
this they kept me pretty quiet so forced

719
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:31,680
follow there was a some<font color="#E5E5E5"> code sitting</font>

720
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:37,530
there in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the back of Twitter that if you</font>

721
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:40,920
sent a tweet and it said except yeah

722
00:26:37,530 --> 00:26:44,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay if you sent a tweet and it said</font>

723
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:46,950

want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to wake everybody here follow me</font>

727
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:55,620
except Bob you're following me now and

728
00:26:53,370 --> 00:26:57,419
so there was<font color="#CCCCCC"> this logic that was built</font>

729
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:59,850
into Twitter from the beginning it's

730
00:26:57,420 --> 00:27:01,590
been there from day one somehow they

731
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:03,330
forgot about it and no<font color="#CCCCCC"> one ever stumbled</font>

732
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:06,330
across it but it was this thing to force

733
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:09,540
someone to follow you and so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> 17 year</font>

734
00:27:06,330 --> 00:27:11,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">old kid in Turkey found it notified them</font>

and they<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually fixed it but it's kind</font>

736
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:15,030
of interesting problem that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> sitting</font>

having to actually give them<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

we've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> spending some time is</font>

851
00:31:26,090 --> 00:31:31,859
exploring how can you build a reputation

852
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:33,238
system for social networks right in the

853
00:31:31,859 --> 00:31:35,639
same way that we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> built over the years</font>

854
00:31:33,239 --> 00:31:37,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">we've both reputation systems for like</font>

855
00:31:35,639 --> 00:31:39,689
email are you familiar like IP

856
00:31:37,529 --> 00:31:41,159
reputation systems for email right over

857
00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:43,769
the world<font color="#E5E5E5"> went from like content-based</font>

858
00:31:41,159 --> 00:31:46,529
filtering to<font color="#CCCCCC"> an ip-based blacklist</font>

859
00:31:43,769 --> 00:31:47,759
ip-based reputation systems for emails

860
00:31:46,529 --> 00:31:50,460
one of the things that in my opinion

861
00:31:47,759 --> 00:31:52,409
kind of saved email it kind of kept to

862
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:54,570
the point<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the industry could keep</font>

863
00:31:52,409 --> 00:31:57,330
90 plus percent effective catch rates

864
00:31:54,570 --> 00:31:58,769
and stop spam for showing up in in boxes

865
00:31:57,330 --> 00:32:00,720
because it was all<font color="#E5E5E5"> about understanding</font>

866
00:31:58,769 --> 00:32:02,669
<font color="#CCCCCC">IP as an identity and taking the</font>

867
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:04,559
behavior of that IP and turn into

868
00:32:02,669 --> 00:32:06,419
indication of this guy useful or not

869
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:08,460
right so how can you<font color="#E5E5E5"> take that same</font>

870
00:32:06,419 --> 00:32:09,869
concept and apply to social network how

871
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:11,669
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> you apply</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to a particular account</font>

872
00:32:09,869 --> 00:32:13,259
how can I look at your behavior<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

873
00:32:11,669 --> 00:32:15,299
decide if you're a real account or not

874
00:32:13,259 --> 00:32:17,700
of your legitimate account or not so

875
00:32:15,299 --> 00:32:20,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">that was kind of the goal is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to based on</font>

876
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:22,080
someone's behavior not not wait and to

877
00:32:20,549 --> 00:32:23,730
read their content not do signature

878
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:25,230
scans and URL filtering and stuff on the

879
00:32:23,730 --> 00:32:27,389
content but if I can understand the

880
00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:28,790
behavior one account versus another how

881
00:32:27,389 --> 00:32:32,540
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use that to the side of your</font>

882
00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:38,540
legitimate or not so so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> build the</font>

883
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:40,370
system<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it goes through the Twitter</font>

884
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:41,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">stream to get information it also does</font>

885
00:32:40,370 --> 00:32:43,729
the queers to get information but the

886
00:32:41,810 --> 00:32:45,379
gold again is right not<font color="#E5E5E5"> content based</font>

887
00:32:43,730 --> 00:32:46,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">purely activity-based if you think about</font>

888
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:48,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">Twitter</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> whether the activities and then</font>

889
00:32:46,970 --> 00:32:50,750
basically looking do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know about</font>

890
00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:52,610
account I know when you join I know how

891
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:54,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">many times</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or what frequency you tweet I</font>

892
00:32:52,610 --> 00:32:55,550
know how many<font color="#CCCCCC"> people follow you and I</font>

893
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:56,629
know how<font color="#E5E5E5"> many people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you follow and I</font>

894
00:32:55,550 --> 00:32:59,480
can look at the relationships between

895
00:32:56,630 --> 00:33:01,730
those things so just based on that how

896
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:04,550
can I begin<font color="#CCCCCC"> to figure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out who's good</font>

897
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:06,140
who's bad so there's a few thing is one

898
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:07,220
thing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at first it's</font>

899
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:09,500
kind of what's the baseline what's a

900
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:11,030
normal user what's the normal user is a

901
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:12,590
hundred million plus Twitter users

902
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:17,810
what's a normal user look like feel like

903
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:20,030
and so we created a pretty low bar we

904
00:33:17,810 --> 00:33:22,669
said okay you're a true Twitter user if

905
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:24,080
you've tweeted at least<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> times and 10</font>

906
00:33:22,670 --> 00:33:26,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">people follow you and you follow 10</font>

907
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:28,340
people your true Twitter user you at

908
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:31,250
least turn the thing on all right you

909
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:33,290
kick the tires well we<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at all the</font>

910
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:35,120
accounts on Twitter what we've seen is

911
00:33:33,290 --> 00:33:37,460
less than half of them qualify for that

912
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:39,469
low bar so<font color="#CCCCCC"> forty-three</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> percent of them</font>

913
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:41,600
are a true Twitter user that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10</font>

914
00:33:39,470 --> 00:33:43,130
follows<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 tweets10 so you have over</font>

915
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:45,919
half of the network that's just sitting

916
00:33:43,130 --> 00:33:47,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">out there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what accounts</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> alright so</font>

917
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:48,560
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first thing half of the</font>

918
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:50,840
network's just sitting out there<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

919
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:54,590
accounts so then you start to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at</font>

920
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:57,169
okay well how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people are are you</font>

921
00:33:54,590 --> 00:34:00,290
following right how<font color="#E5E5E5"> many people are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

922
00:33:57,170 --> 00:34:02,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">are you following and what happens is</font>

923
00:34:00,290 --> 00:34:03,440
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Twitter as a whole basically</font>

924
00:34:02,330 --> 00:34:07,310
sixteen percent of accounts<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

925
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:09,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">following nobody right almost you had 16</font>

926
00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:13,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">plus 27 almost half of the accounts are</font>

927
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:14,720
following less than 10 people racing

928
00:34:13,489 --> 00:34:16,040
think about the whole network sixteen

929
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,969
percent of a poly nobody so you have a

930
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:18,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">Twitter account you're not following</font>

931
00:34:16,969 --> 00:34:20,600
anybody what do you see when you log in

932
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:22,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright so you start to think about</font>

933
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:24,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">what's the normal user trying to profile</font>

934
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:26,270
and baseline a normal user so we can

935
00:34:24,590 --> 00:34:27,830
figure out what are the outliers right

936
00:34:26,270 --> 00:34:29,750
so this is an interesting just stuff

937
00:34:27,830 --> 00:34:31,580
about kind of how people<font color="#CCCCCC"> are using the</font>

938
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:32,900
network because all you ever hear is all

939
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:34,489
Twitter's growing is growing<font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> growing</font>

940
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:36,080
is growing but you never<font color="#E5E5E5"> really hear</font>

941
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:37,909
data about okay how are people actually

942
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:39,080
using<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so the fact that sixteen</font>

943
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:41,899
percent of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> account</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Samuel</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is that</font>

944
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:42,739
one in every 887 accounts not following

945
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:44,480
anybody

946
00:34:42,739 --> 00:34:45,830
how it happens you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> log into your</font>

947
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:49,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">twitter client i followed anybody you</font>

948
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:51,830
getting empty screen right so other

949
00:34:49,610 --> 00:34:53,899
thing that we start to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at is the</font>

950
00:34:51,830 --> 00:34:55,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">relationship between how many people</font>

951
00:34:53,899 --> 00:34:57,560
you're following how many people follow

952
00:34:55,250 --> 00:35:00,110
you and so the question is are people

953
00:34:57,560 --> 00:35:02,960
using<font color="#E5E5E5"> Twitter like a normal social</font>

954
00:35:00,110 --> 00:35:04,700
network where you have a two-way

955
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:06,470
connection or two-way graph or you look

956
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:08,689
at facebook as soon as we're Facebook

957
00:35:06,470 --> 00:35:10,459
friends it's a two-way relationship I'm

958
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:12,290
your friend you're my friend whereas on

959
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:13,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">Twitter there's one related relationship</font>

960
00:35:12,290 --> 00:35:15,619
right i follow you and then you decide

961
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:18,140
whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> or not you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want to follow me so</font>

962
00:35:15,619 --> 00:35:19,880
we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at where people using it</font>

963
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:21,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">and more of a two-way connection mode or</font>

964
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:23,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">where there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people there were more so</font>

965
00:35:21,290 --> 00:35:25,640
consumers information more so producers

966
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:27,800
of information and so what we looked at

967
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:30,618
is basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> forty-three percent of the</font>

968
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:32,300
accounts on Twitter have the same number

969
00:35:30,619 --> 00:35:34,820
of friends and followers so the same

970
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:35,990
being plus or minus five right so

971
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:37,280
forty-three percent<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the accounts</font>

972
00:35:35,990 --> 00:35:39,080
almost half of the accounts out there

973
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:42,080
are using<font color="#CCCCCC"> as a full kind of two way</font>

974
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:43,940
connected graph relationship but then

975
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:44,930
you look there's this<font color="#CCCCCC"> 34% to have more</font>

976
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:46,760
followers there a little bit more

977
00:35:44,930 --> 00:35:48,529
producers of content and there's twenty

978
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:49,520
three percent that have more people<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

979
00:35:48,530 --> 00:35:53,480
they're following so they're a little

980
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:54,890
bit more consumers of content right so i

981
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:56,690
get to i get to<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of why that's</font>

982
00:35:54,890 --> 00:35:57,830
important here the other thing that we

983
00:35:56,690 --> 00:36:00,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">want to measure is what we call a</font>

984
00:35:57,830 --> 00:36:02,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">twitter crime rate the twitter crime</font>

985
00:36:00,710 --> 00:36:03,200
rate what's that that's basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you</font>

986
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:05,299
look at all the accounts that<font color="#E5E5E5"> were</font>

987
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:06,680
creating any given month on<font color="#CCCCCC"> twitter what</font>

988
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:09,740
percent of those accounts were kicked

989
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:12,049
off right they violated the terms of

990
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:14,540
service and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they were suspended not they</font>

991
00:36:12,050 --> 00:36:16,010
quit they were suspended right so we

992
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:17,660
look at any particular month what

993
00:36:16,010 --> 00:36:21,950
percent of the accounts were suspended

994
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:23,750
so to look at that the other thing we

995
00:36:21,950 --> 00:36:26,299
looked at was the growth we look at

996
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:27,800
every<font color="#E5E5E5"> month because the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Twitter account</font>

997
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:29,000
will tell you what day they join so we

998
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:30,980
look at enough<font color="#E5E5E5"> Twitter account so i can</font>

999
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:34,340
see what day you join<font color="#E5E5E5"> i can get a really</font>

1000
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:35,210
look at the growth cycle of<font color="#CCCCCC"> twitter so</font>

1001
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:37,490
that's what we did we went back and

1002
00:36:35,210 --> 00:36:39,619
<font color="#CCCCCC">looked at since 2006</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what was a growth</font>

1003
00:36:37,490 --> 00:36:41,810
cycle of<font color="#CCCCCC"> twitter so one interesting</font>

1004
00:36:39,619 --> 00:36:43,520
thing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we stumbled across is there's</font>

1005
00:36:41,810 --> 00:36:45,619
this period at the end of 08 right

1006
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:49,670
between a<font color="#CCCCCC"> november oval-8 and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> april</font>

1007
00:36:45,619 --> 00:36:51,020
whole nine you<font color="#CCCCCC"> look at the top 100 users</font>

1008
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:52,940
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> Twitter right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now by number</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1009
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:55,130
followers the top 100 people on Twitter

1010
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:56,710
half of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them came</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in the same six-month</font>

1011
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:59,090
period

1012
00:36:56,710 --> 00:37:00,950
right so pick your favorite celebrity

1013
00:36:59,090 --> 00:37:03,560
like with it Martha Stewart or kim

1014
00:37:00,950 --> 00:37:06,259
kardashian or 50 cent or are you know

1015
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:08,600
whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're into half of the</font>

1016
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:11,360
celebrities came in the same six-month

1017
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:12,500
period so i don't know they all called

1018
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:14,270
each<font color="#E5E5E5"> other they're like celebrity</font>

1019
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:16,040
committee meeting<font color="#E5E5E5"> and nearly</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay we're</font>

1020
00:37:14,270 --> 00:37:17,600
going to join<font color="#E5E5E5"> Twitter now but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we look</font>

1021
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:19,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">Badgers literally look at the top 100</font>

1022
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:20,810
people on Twitter fifty percent of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

1023
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:22,340
join the same six-month<font color="#E5E5E5"> period so what</font>

1024
00:37:20,810 --> 00:37:24,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">happened is the growth rate of Twitter</font>

1025
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:27,320
went up to two from two percent to

1026
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:29,150
twenty percent right so all the users

1027
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:31,370
you can see kind of Twitter account

1028
00:37:29,150 --> 00:37:32,450
creation during that time period right

1029
00:37:31,370 --> 00:37:33,830
and what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as security kind of</font>

1030
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:35,660
wherever the users go is kind of where

1031
00:37:33,830 --> 00:37:36,799
the attackers will come and<font color="#CCCCCC"> so we want</font>

1032
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:38,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">to measure that we want to see like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how</font>

1033
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:39,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">is that really happening how fast is</font>

1034
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:44,180
that happening how quickly are the

1035
00:37:39,950 --> 00:37:46,220
attackers responding and so we looked at

1036
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:47,839
is this measures the crime rate right

1037
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:50,240
what percent of accounts are suspended

1038
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:52,220
that were created in any given month so

1039
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:54,680
since the beginning of a network 2006

1040
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:56,120
Twitter was<font color="#E5E5E5"> averaging about 1.2 percent</font>

1041
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:58,819
of accounts that were creating any given

1042
00:37:56,120 --> 00:38:01,009
month<font color="#E5E5E5"> where a suspended 2007 it went up</font>

1043
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:03,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">to one-point-seven percent 2008 it was</font>

1044
00:38:01,010 --> 00:38:06,140
at 2.2% he had this red carpet error and

1045
00:38:03,970 --> 00:38:08,450
during the red corporate area where for

1046
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:10,400
two percent 22 three-point-three percent

1047
00:38:08,450 --> 00:38:13,069
so it increased sixty percent right

1048
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:15,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">during this red carpet error but then</font>

1049
00:38:13,070 --> 00:38:18,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">kinda within four months</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> after that it</font>

1050
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:21,200
jumped up to twelve percent someone from

1051
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:23,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">two to three to twelve as the users</font>

1052
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:24,740
increasing<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so twelve percent</font>

1053
00:38:23,270 --> 00:38:27,380
looks like one in every eight account

1054
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:29,750
that's created suspended and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

1055
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:31,310
the people they're catching right they

1056
00:38:29,750 --> 00:38:33,470
catch in half I doubt it<font color="#CCCCCC"> are they</font>

1057
00:38:31,310 --> 00:38:34,940
catching ten percent<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe kitchen</font>

1058
00:38:33,470 --> 00:38:37,790
twenty percent so<font color="#E5E5E5"> an eye-catching</font>

1059
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:39,530
ninety-nine percent right so it just

1060
00:38:37,790 --> 00:38:41,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">shows the ability to the attacker to</font>

1061
00:38:39,530 --> 00:38:43,060
respond quickly<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh wait</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all the users</font>

1062
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:51,080
are here<font color="#E5E5E5"> alright I'm over here now and</font>

1063
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:53,120
and and dig in so kind of with that that

1064
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:56,120
understanding we we<font color="#E5E5E5"> start to then look</font>

1065
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:58,040
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay how do we kind of find these</font>

1066
00:38:56,120 --> 00:39:04,640
accounts how do we find these accounts

1067
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:07,450
proactively so we take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a look so what</font>

1068
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:09,589
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is looking at is the Delta between</font>

1069
00:39:07,450 --> 00:39:12,290
how many people<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font>

1070
00:39:09,590 --> 00:39:14,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">Halloween how many people are do you</font>

1071
00:39:12,290 --> 00:39:15,800
have as flowers right how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> followers</font>

1072
00:39:14,210 --> 00:39:19,790
you have I mean people you're following

1073
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:23,000
and it the the red are suspended

1074
00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:25,520
accounts and the green are still active

1075
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:28,010
accounts right and so what you see is

1076
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:31,190
that people that were suspended had a

1077
00:39:28,010 --> 00:39:33,650
larger<font color="#E5E5E5"> Delta between their friend count</font>

1078
00:39:31,190 --> 00:39:36,470
and a<font color="#E5E5E5"> follower count then normal</font>

1079
00:39:33,650 --> 00:39:37,640
legitimate users but why is that why is

1080
00:39:36,470 --> 00:39:39,290
that well you look at your kind of

1081
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:40,190
creating a fake account on<font color="#E5E5E5"> Twitter and</font>

1082
00:39:39,290 --> 00:39:43,660
you trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get a bunch of followers</font>

1083
00:39:40,190 --> 00:39:47,270
what do you do the first thing you go do

1084
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:48,920
you go follow a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people right you</font>

1085
00:39:47,270 --> 00:39:50,930
go follow a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people and you hope</font>

1086
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:52,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">that they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> follow you back and the</font>

1087
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:54,259
attackers have tools right to automate

1088
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:55,970
this for them<font color="#E5E5E5"> there go follow a thousand</font>

1089
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:57,830
people they'll wait 100<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them to</font>

1090
00:39:55,970 --> 00:39:59,060
follow back they'll unfollow they'll go

1091
00:39:57,830 --> 00:40:01,009
follow<font color="#CCCCCC"> the next thousand people try to</font>

1092
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:02,720
recruit<font color="#CCCCCC"> people to fuck so they as they</font>

1093
00:40:01,010 --> 00:40:05,240
crank these accounts up they go and they

1094
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:06,830
follow a lot of people<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then once</font>

1095
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:08,750
they're successful they actually

1096
00:40:06,830 --> 00:40:09,920
unfollow they unfollowed most of them so

1097
00:40:08,750 --> 00:40:11,420
then they end up here they end up with

1098
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:14,240
way more followers than they then they

1099
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:16,190
have halloween so they go back and forth

1100
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:18,979
between these two sides of things trying

1101
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:20,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">to create and harvest at account and so</font>

1102
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:22,430
you see<font color="#E5E5E5"> the pretty big distinction</font>

1103
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:23,900
between legitimate accounts and in

1104
00:40:22,430 --> 00:40:25,370
legitimate accounts in that French

1105
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:28,400
follower<font color="#E5E5E5"> Delta so that's kind of just</font>

1106
00:40:25,370 --> 00:40:30,589
one data point another thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font>

1107
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:33,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to look at was kinda how much does</font>

1108
00:40:30,590 --> 00:40:38,210
someone tweet how much did you tweet so

1109
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:40,010
you can see I can see like Twitter API

1110
00:40:38,210 --> 00:40:41,870
will tell you the number of tweets

1111
00:40:40,010 --> 00:40:43,340
you've sent you send this many tweets in

1112
00:40:41,870 --> 00:40:45,200
this minute week well the number of

1113
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:47,660
tweets that you sent is it as

1114
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:48,919
interesting as like the rate right have

1115
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:50,450
you sent a hundred thousand tweets that

1116
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:52,520
you soon have you<font color="#E5E5E5"> been on Twitter for</font>

1117
00:40:50,450 --> 00:40:54,710
two days or five years<font color="#E5E5E5"> so if you look at</font>

1118
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:56,030
the average and just<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically a near</font>

1119
00:40:54,710 --> 00:40:58,130
the average<font color="#CCCCCC"> average number of tweets</font>

1120
00:40:56,030 --> 00:41:00,920
that you send per day so we call the

1121
00:40:58,130 --> 00:41:02,420
tweet number all right sleep numbering

1122
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:03,560
or tweeting them and it was kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1123
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:04,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">interesting there first because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we said</font>

1124
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:06,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">oh</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay let</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me see what my tweet number</font>

1125
00:41:04,910 --> 00:41:09,770
is my tweet numbers at one point for all

1126
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:11,120
right so some days<font color="#E5E5E5"> I tweet twice and</font>

1127
00:41:09,770 --> 00:41:12,320
some days I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> tweet and so much</font>

1128
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:14,529
between them was one point<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the guy</font>

1129
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:17,720
sitting next to me<font color="#CCCCCC"> the officers like 3.1</font>

1130
00:41:14,530 --> 00:41:19,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">will you don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> node it right and so then</font>

1131
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:21,109

<font color="#E5E5E5">represent about thirty-eight percent of</font>

1155
00:42:18,979 --> 00:42:22,549
compare it like someone tweeting<font color="#CCCCCC"> 200</font>

features and use a classifier to show me

1175
00:43:00,439 --> 00:43:04,999
okays some separation between two data

1176

what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on right now I'm using it</font>

1275
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:07,060
as a search<font color="#CCCCCC"> engine and twitter as well</font>

1276
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:09,970
as the other search engines are becoming

1277
00:47:07,060 --> 00:47:11,799
a very and an<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting data point for</font>

1278
00:47:09,970 --> 00:47:13,450
four attackers because as the web is

1279
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:15,130
growing so quickly the search volumes

1280
00:47:13,450 --> 00:47:17,109
that are occurring every day or higher

1281
00:47:15,130 --> 00:47:18,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">than ever the number</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of searches that</font>

1282
00:47:17,110 --> 00:47:20,380
happen on<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google mean the region</font>

1283
00:47:18,340 --> 00:47:21,850
Google's such a huge companies people

1284
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:23,560
use<font color="#CCCCCC"> it to search same thing for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> being</font>

1285
00:47:21,850 --> 00:47:24,610
same thing for Yahoo so the attackers

1286
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:26,049
are realized oh there's a lot of

1287
00:47:24,610 --> 00:47:28,270
eyeballs how do I get in front of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

1288
00:47:26,050 --> 00:47:29,800
eyeballs so their users search engine

1289
00:47:28,270 --> 00:47:31,480
optimization and kind of make themselves

1290
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:32,860
rank high for certain searches they're

1291
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:34,450
actually going out<font color="#CCCCCC"> and compromise in</font>

1292
00:47:32,860 --> 00:47:36,550
certain sites that there already have

1293
00:47:34,450 --> 00:47:38,319
high rankings so what we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do was</font>

1294
00:47:36,550 --> 00:47:40,840
understanding how much is this happening

1295
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:41,860
how often is happening so we built this

1296
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:45,280
thing that we call a search engine

1297
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:47,650
malware crawler and it does just that it

1298
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:48,760
goes<font color="#CCCCCC"> to each of the engines</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and it says</font>

1299
00:47:47,650 --> 00:47:51,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">hey what are the popular search terms</font>

1300
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:53,290
right now and it goes it just searches

1301
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:55,839
for them and it looks at the results and

1302
00:47:53,290 --> 00:47:57,310
analyze them look for malware so

1303
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:59,410
basically just does what a user would do

1304
00:47:57,310 --> 00:48:00,850
I figure<font color="#CCCCCC"> out what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our popular search</font>

1305
00:47:59,410 --> 00:48:01,990
terms for each engine because<font color="#E5E5E5"> they'll</font>

1306
00:48:00,850 --> 00:48:04,569
all tell me<font color="#E5E5E5"> like hourly or daily</font>

1307
00:48:01,990 --> 00:48:06,580
depending on how they're configure ask

1308
00:48:04,570 --> 00:48:08,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">what's a popular search terms those okay</font>

1309
00:48:06,580 --> 00:48:09,490
let me go search for them let me take

1310
00:48:08,050 --> 00:48:10,840
the results<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go analyze</font>

1311
00:48:09,490 --> 00:48:12,430
them same thing with being same thing

1312
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:13,510
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> yahoo same thing with twitter and</font>

1313
00:48:12,430 --> 00:48:15,759
so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we did we've been running</font>

1314
00:48:13,510 --> 00:48:18,760
this for<font color="#E5E5E5"> over last year year and a half</font>

1315
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:21,910
or so so here's a snapshot of some of

1316
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:24,130
the results so<font color="#CCCCCC"> four different search</font>

1317
00:48:21,910 --> 00:48:26,799
engines these are 153 days in the last

1318
00:48:24,130 --> 00:48:29,470
five<font color="#CCCCCC"> months of 2010 so in a five month</font>

1319
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:31,060
period you act every search engine

1320
00:48:29,470 --> 00:48:34,569
regularly what are the popular search

1321
00:48:31,060 --> 00:48:37,390
terms that<font color="#CCCCCC"> gets you 157,000 popular</font>

1322
00:48:34,570 --> 00:48:39,850
topics right you actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> go and pull</font>

1323
00:48:37,390 --> 00:48:42,730
the results for those that gets you<font color="#E5E5E5"> 36</font>

1324
00:48:39,850 --> 00:48:44,440
million search results so what we're

1325
00:48:42,730 --> 00:48:45,940
doing is say hey what's popular give me

1326
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:48,010
a search results let me see if I find

1327
00:48:45,940 --> 00:48:50,680
any malware so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think the funny</font>

1328
00:48:48,010 --> 00:48:54,790
malware yeah maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit so we</font>

1329
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:56,379
found 34 thousand pieces of<font color="#E5E5E5"> malware you</font>

1330
00:48:54,790 --> 00:48:58,990
can just looking at top search results

1331
00:48:56,380 --> 00:49:01,270
for popular terms we didn't go looking

1332
00:48:58,990 --> 00:49:02,859
for a let me go find<font color="#CCCCCC"> screensavers and</font>

1333
00:49:01,270 --> 00:49:04,300
see what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can find let me go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> over here</font>

1334
00:49:02,860 --> 00:49:06,520
and search for malware to see what i can

1335
00:49:04,300 --> 00:49:07,750
find it was whatever was popular right

1336
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:09,580
then we searched for<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and got the</font>

1337
00:49:07,750 --> 00:49:12,730
results thirty-four thousand pieces of

1338
00:49:09,580 --> 00:49:14,560
malware right so that on average is 1 in

1339
00:49:12,730 --> 00:49:17,890
every<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1,000 search results led to</font>

1340
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:20,110
malware right and on average basically

1341
00:49:17,890 --> 00:49:22,779
one in every five search topics led to

1342
00:49:20,110 --> 00:49:25,710
malware right if you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the</font>

1343
00:49:22,780 --> 00:49:28,990
distribution of where that malware was

1344
00:49:25,710 --> 00:49:31,840
is interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> Google was thirty-eight</font>

1345
00:49:28,990 --> 00:49:34,299
percent yahoo 30 being 24<font color="#CCCCCC"> Twitter at</font>

1346
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:36,430
eight so 22 interesting points here one

1347
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:40,030
last time we did this the middle<font color="#E5E5E5"> of last</font>

1348
00:49:36,430 --> 00:49:43,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">year Google was sixty-nine percent right</font>

1349
00:49:40,030 --> 00:49:46,210
now what happened is the amount of

1350
00:49:43,930 --> 00:49:48,210
malware found daily on Google remained

1351
00:49:46,210 --> 00:49:51,300
about the same so didn't go down in half

1352
00:49:48,210 --> 00:49:53,680
the amount on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other engines went up</font>

1353
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:55,150
so we found in about almost twice as

1354
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:56,440
much malware the end of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> year is</font>

1355
00:49:55,150 --> 00:49:58,090
we're finding in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the middle of the year</font>

1356
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:59,770
and it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the google the</font>

1357
00:49:58,090 --> 00:50:00,790
proportionate they look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> google</font>

1358
00:49:59,770 --> 00:50:02,350
probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think they did an</font>

1359
00:50:00,790 --> 00:50:04,270
announcement hey look our search<font color="#E5E5E5"> percent</font>

1360
00:50:02,350 --> 00:50:06,940
went down according to<font color="#CCCCCC"> bearracuda laughs</font>

1361
00:50:04,270 --> 00:50:08,740
no like your actual number of malware as

1362
00:50:06,940 --> 00:50:10,510
a day actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> remain consistent it's</font>

1363
00:50:08,740 --> 00:50:11,680
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the attackers my opinion</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

1364
00:50:10,510 --> 00:50:14,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">that the attackers are trying this out</font>

1365
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:15,490
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> google oh man this works they went</font>

1366
00:50:14,380 --> 00:50:16,750
over to being<font color="#E5E5E5"> and started do the same</font>

1367
00:50:15,490 --> 00:50:17,950
thing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> went over</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to yahoo start do</font>

1368
00:50:16,750 --> 00:50:18,130
the same things that's why the numbers

1369
00:50:17,950 --> 00:50:21,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">one</font>

1370
00:50:18,130 --> 00:50:23,200
same thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> on Twitter and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the reason in</font>

1371
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:26,230
my opinion that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the number on twitter is</font>

1372
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:27,549
low compared to the others is because

1373
00:50:26,230 --> 00:50:29,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">i'm a search engine well as certain as</font>

1374
00:50:27,549 --> 00:50:31,119
opposed to do is take results for your

1375
00:50:29,380 --> 00:50:32,920
make them relevant you know supposed to

1376
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:34,599
go find what you're looking for<font color="#E5E5E5"> help you</font>

1377
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:36,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">find it where's twitter you know the way</font>

1378
00:50:34,599 --> 00:50:38,079
search works on twitter especially<font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font>

1379
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:39,579
what term do you want huge all right

1380
00:50:38,079 --> 00:50:41,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">there's a latest</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> snapshot of who's</font>

1381
00:50:39,579 --> 00:50:45,309
talking about that right there's no

1382
00:50:41,410 --> 00:50:47,470
relevance there's no ranking and so that

1383
00:50:45,309 --> 00:50:49,299
works for and against the attacker in

1384
00:50:47,470 --> 00:50:51,189
that they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the opportunity</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1385
00:50:49,299 --> 00:50:53,829
do search engine optimization and make

1386
00:50:51,190 --> 00:50:55,150
their sites ranked higher so attack of

1387
00:50:53,829 --> 00:50:57,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">you're smart you have resources you have</font>

1388
00:50:55,150 --> 00:50:59,380
opportunity<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get your attack higher in</font>

1389
00:50:57,730 --> 00:51:00,970
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> google search results then you do on</font>

1390
00:50:59,380 --> 00:51:02,740
twitter<font color="#CCCCCC"> with twitter is a gamble it's</font>

1391
00:51:00,970 --> 00:51:04,839
just you plan the odds right as I

1392
00:51:02,740 --> 00:51:06,430
playing roulette like uma data in there

1393
00:51:04,839 --> 00:51:07,750
did<font color="#E5E5E5"> it get pic put my day</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Turner</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> did</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

1394
00:51:06,430 --> 00:51:10,359
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> picked so that's why I kind of</font>

1395
00:51:07,750 --> 00:51:12,519
artificially the number for twitter is

1396
00:51:10,359 --> 00:51:13,509
lower because attackers don't have the

1397
00:51:12,519 --> 00:51:14,799
ability<font color="#CCCCCC"> to use search engine</font>

1398
00:51:13,509 --> 00:51:20,140
optimization in their in their favor

1399
00:51:14,799 --> 00:51:21,730
right so a quick example of search

1400
00:51:20,140 --> 00:51:23,890
engine malware so anybody know this guy

1401
00:51:21,730 --> 00:51:25,690
yeah I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think he plays basketball or</font>

1402
00:51:23,890 --> 00:51:28,000
something yeah all right so you guys

1403
00:51:25,690 --> 00:51:29,289
