1
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:06,580
next week of this morning is a Tom

2
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:07,840
Langford for going to talk about an

3
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:10,930
anatomy of a risk assessment for the

4
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:14,230
next power questions at the end Tom yeah

5
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:15,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">absolutely and then I think we've got</font>

6
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:17,950
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> more talking then it's lunch so</font>

7
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:21,279
without<font color="#E5E5E5"> further ado over Tito thank you</font>

8
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:24,250
very much so firstly welcome to an

9
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:25,990
anatomy of a risk assessment and also

10
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:27,490
secondly thank you very much i know at

11
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:30,400
least one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you must have voted for</font>

12
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:31,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">this talk i know i did and i don't know</font>

13
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">what the figures are so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't know how</font>

14
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:35,530
they tailed off towards the end so you

15
00:00:33,699 --> 00:00:38,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm hoping</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to meet the expectations</font>

16
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:39,699
of at least one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you my key</font>

17
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:41,409
performance indicator of course is

18
00:00:39,699 --> 00:00:43,690
trying to reduce the percentage of

19
00:00:41,409 --> 00:00:49,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">people who actually walk out during the</font>

20
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:52,750
the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> 50 minutes or so so this is an</font>

21
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:54,760
anatomy of a risk assessment it was

22
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:56,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">originally titled when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I first</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> came up</font>

23
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:58,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the idea you know the anatomy of a</font>

24
00:00:56,830 --> 00:01:01,540
risk assessment but I kind of figured

25
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:04,839
quite quickly that risk assessments are

26
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:06,759
very much unique there is no such<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font>

27
00:01:04,839 --> 00:01:07,899
as<font color="#CCCCCC"> a definitive risk assessment and you</font>

28
00:01:06,759 --> 00:01:09,460
know especially when we throw in other

29
00:01:07,899 --> 00:01:12,609
terms as well like audit which will come

30
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:15,219
on later there's a vast range of things

31
00:01:12,609 --> 00:01:17,679
that we can do and we you know we focus

32
00:01:15,219 --> 00:01:20,829
it down into security as well we get

33
00:01:17,679 --> 00:01:22,869
even you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> even you know we're kind</font>

34
00:01:20,829 --> 00:01:25,059
of throwing it open even<font color="#CCCCCC"> more you know</font>

35
00:01:22,869 --> 00:01:29,740
within the ranges of what we do with

36
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:31,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">insecurity but as you probably gathered</font>

37
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:34,359
from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the theme and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Anatomy we're going</font>

38
00:01:31,899 --> 00:01:37,869
to be talking about a range of body

39
00:01:34,359 --> 00:01:40,390
parts today starting with<font color="#E5E5E5"> a cadaver and</font>

40
00:01:37,869 --> 00:01:44,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">working all the way down to the final</font>

41
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:46,240
evisceration of the body itself and you

42
00:01:44,619 --> 00:01:48,460
know the reason for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is I'm trying</font>

43
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,658
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> put across as you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know human social</font>

44
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:52,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">element</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here and try to give you some</font>

45
00:01:49,659 --> 00:01:55,479
tools from my experience and<font color="#E5E5E5"> experience</font>

46
00:01:52,899 --> 00:01:57,640
my peers<font color="#CCCCCC"> and colleagues and away are not</font>

47
00:01:55,479 --> 00:02:00,069
almost am anomic of how you can use

48
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:02,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">everything that's available to you you</font>

49
00:02:00,069 --> 00:02:05,170
know you born with it you know depending

50
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:06,969
upon whatever deity or<font color="#E5E5E5"> non-data you</font>

51
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:08,619
believe in you've been granted you know

52
00:02:06,969 --> 00:02:10,780
these many things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are listed here</font>

53
00:02:08,619 --> 00:02:14,230
and how you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> use them more</font>

54
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:15,500
effectively in a risk assessment it's

55
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:17,119
pretty graphical

56
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:19,520
if you got if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> are of a nervous</font>

57
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:21,170
disposition and judging<font color="#CCCCCC"> by the size of</font>

58
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">this bloody screen these pictures are</font>

59
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:26,959
going to look pretty gruesome in some

60
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:28,520
cases so you know just kind of shy fade

61
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:33,260
out the one side if it's if it's a

62
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:34,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">little bit excessive now how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> many how</font>

63
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:37,190
many other presentations are going to

64
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:39,470
show you a<font color="#E5E5E5"> slo-mo pause of a body</font>

65
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:42,020
exploding in front of another body not

66
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:46,910
many that's pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much the highlight of</font>

67
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:49,160
it but<font color="#CCCCCC"> so what again this is analogous</font>

68
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:52,310
to the anatomy of a person and like

69
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:54,770
every good talk like this you come up

70
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:56,660
with the title first and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> you kind</font>

71
00:02:54,770 --> 00:03:00,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">of wedge everything else in after that</font>

72
00:02:56,660 --> 00:03:02,420
right and so I had them via the the idea

73
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:05,690
anatomy of a risk assessment that works

74
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:08,329
and I came<font color="#CCCCCC"> up with a few topics so</font>

75
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:10,850
you'll see that in maybe one or two

76
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:13,670
cases<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've stretched that analogy a</font>

77
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:15,560
little bit but bear with me I'll pointed

78
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:18,019
out so it's not too disappointing when

79
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:22,880
you do come across it this is not

80
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:26,140
heavily technical<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay this is not this</font>

81
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:29,510
is not a checklist this is not you know

82
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:32,329
compliance by the numbers or<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ten</font>

83
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:33,829
deficiencies in cloud computing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

84
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:37,070
need to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> out for or anything</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

85
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:39,260
that this is the human social element

86
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:41,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is how you interact with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

87
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:44,600
over the table when you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> carrying out</font>

88
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:46,880
a risk assessment it draws on

89
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:50,410
experiences from both sides of the table

90
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:53,480
so as both an assess or and an assessee

91
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:55,220
and I will you know I'll try<font color="#CCCCCC"> and give as</font>

92
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:57,738
many examples as I can and those

93
00:03:55,220 --> 00:04:00,320
examples I you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> I bring up these</font>

94
00:03:57,739 --> 00:04:02,390
examples based on my experience not to

95
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:04,070
show how widely traveled i<font color="#CCCCCC"> amand you</font>

96
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:05,450
know how awesome<font color="#CCCCCC"> i am at these sort of</font>

97
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:07,070
things but to bring color to these

98
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:09,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">things because that's what's important</font>

99
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:11,720
if you don't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> real-world</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> examples on</font>

100
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:14,359
which you can pin these things onto it's

101
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:16,070
very difficult so actually understood

102
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:20,150
into practice you know some of these

103
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:22,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">techniques if I if I may it also brings</font>

104
00:04:20,149 --> 00:04:24,979
in about in a various geographic and

105
00:04:22,669 --> 00:04:26,390
cultural differences as well in certain

106
00:04:24,979 --> 00:04:28,280
a quick show of hands is there anybody

107
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:29,000
here who works across multiple

108
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:32,840
geographies

109
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,100
these hands up anyone so quite a few

110
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:36,979
that's great so you're probably already

111
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:38,150
you already<font color="#E5E5E5"> know that there's a huge</font>

112
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:40,520
amount of cultural differences between

113
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:42,469
the English<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Germans the Americans</font>

114
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:44,690
the Indians etc you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know especially when</font>

115
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:48,140
you travel there and so you can't rely

116
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:49,490
purely upon your own it as it were into

117
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:52,760
the view of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the world when you are</font>

118
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:54,260
talking you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know and assessing projects</font>

119
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:58,400
or teams or clients within those

120
00:04:54,260 --> 00:05:00,080
locations<font color="#E5E5E5"> um it may come across as</font>

121
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,090
cynical in some cases<font color="#CCCCCC"> as some of the</font>

122
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:04,849
things I'm saying and trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

123
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:07,549
trick trick people and trip them up it's

124
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:09,980
not meant<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be it's probably based upon</font>

125
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:11,990
the fact that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know I was kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of a</font>

126
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:14,660
poacher turned gamekeeper in certain

127
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:16,160
aspects so I you know I tried if I'm

128
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:17,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">trying to trip someone up as it was</font>

129
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:21,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">because I know that it you know these</font>

130
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:22,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">things happen in the real world another</font>

131
00:05:21,169 --> 00:05:26,380
question hands up who actually carries

132
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:28,370
out risk assessments themselves

133
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:30,169
fantastic well it's perfect audience in

134
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:34,390
that case which is good news and who has

135
00:05:30,169 --> 00:05:37,219
risk assessments carried out upon them

136
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:38,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay oh no that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> good we got for your</font>

137
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:41,030
hands up there<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay that's fine that's</font>

138
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:42,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">good you know and when we throw that in</font>

139
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:44,000
across multiple geographies we've got an

140
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:47,270
awful lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you know iterations and</font>

141
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,450
interactions that go on and finally<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

142
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:51,650
know possibly the unspoken word audit

143
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:53,419
you know the difference<font color="#CCCCCC"> between</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

144
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:54,919
assessment and an audience<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will tell</font>

145
00:05:53,419 --> 00:05:57,140
you that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will use the term</font>

146
00:05:54,919 --> 00:05:59,030
interchangeably you know but<font color="#CCCCCC"> just to be</font>

147
00:05:57,140 --> 00:06:01,400
clear<font color="#CCCCCC"> and auditors against a given</font>

148
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:04,130
standard it's virtually you know a<font color="#E5E5E5"> tick</font>

149
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:06,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">box yes no pass/fail yeah a little bit</font>

150
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:09,050
of gray area<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think with ISO 27001</font>

151
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:10,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">their their lexicon is area of concern</font>

152
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:12,560
but ultimately you are<font color="#E5E5E5"> being measured</font>

153
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:14,919
against something whereas a risk

154
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:17,960
assessment is something altogether more

155
00:06:14,919 --> 00:06:19,520
you know subjective and a little bit

156
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:21,469
more difficult to<font color="#E5E5E5"> pin down and we'll</font>

157
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:23,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">talk about some of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> those aspects of what</font>

158
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:25,370
we do there but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know bear with me I</font>

159
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:26,810
will use them interchangeably basically

160
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:29,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">because having been on both sides of the</font>

161
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:31,100
table on both assessments and audits you

162
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:33,640
know those experiences kind of blended

163
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:33,640
somewhat

164
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:40,380
so we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna start</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with the the feet I</font>

165
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:42,930
did<font color="#E5E5E5"> think about having</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this as the</font>

166
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:45,330
skeleton as sorry as the spine because i

167
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:47,340
thought you know the point of this slide

168
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:49,320
is you know what is the foundation of

169
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:51,599
what it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to do in a</font>

170
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:54,780
risk assessment you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what it is that</font>

171
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:57,420
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to to achieve by carrying</font>

172
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:59,460
out the assessment but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i did find</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

173
00:06:57,420 --> 00:07:01,410
picture<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I kind of preferred this one</font>

174
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:03,659
too just a white spine on a white

175
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:04,980
background but the principle remains the

176
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:07,170
same you know your feet are you know

177
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:08,880
they allow you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> A to B they</font>

178
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:11,510
allow you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to achieve your goal of</font>

179
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:14,310
carrying out your your risk assessment

180
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:16,170
if you don't understand what your goals

181
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:18,090
are before you even go in there you're

182
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:20,730
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start uncovering you know the</font>

183
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:23,400
wrong skeletons effectively or or in in

184
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:27,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">worse cases you know perhaps perhaps</font>

185
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:29,159
even no skeletons so my backgrounds you

186
00:07:27,419 --> 00:07:31,859
know funnily enough is from a security

187
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:33,390
perspective and I'm sure most of you are

188
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:35,130
but is are there any other<font color="#CCCCCC"> any people</font>

189
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:36,960
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> that no carry out assessments from</font>

190
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:46,880
a different perspective from purely

191
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:50,700
security so yes sir tsem<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay yep</font>

192
00:07:46,880 --> 00:08:05,630
otherwise<font color="#E5E5E5"> other ones so I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thinking</font>

193
00:07:50,700 --> 00:08:07,979
<font color="#CCCCCC">about yes yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay forever yes yeah</font>

194
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:09,810
yeah and<font color="#E5E5E5"> just the broadness out again</font>

195
00:08:07,979 --> 00:08:12,419
we've got financial risks that we need

196
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:15,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">to look at or that people will look at</font>

197
00:08:12,419 --> 00:08:17,940
we might also have you know legislative

198
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:20,820
risks that need to be assessed or market

199
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:22,770
risks for instance you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know or you know</font>

200
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:24,750
perhaps crisis style risk you know

201
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:26,370
earthquakes of Kuran in you know certain

202
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:28,320
geographies and things like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

203
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:29,940
again understanding your perspective

204
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:31,710
obviously<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think you know I think from</font>

205
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:33,120
the the overwhelming response<font color="#E5E5E5"> they were</font>

206
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:35,189
probably all<font color="#E5E5E5"> from a security risk</font>

207
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,589
perspective here but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think it's it's</font>

208
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:39,750
keen to it's important<font color="#E5E5E5"> to understand</font>

209
00:08:37,589 --> 00:08:41,070
that difference so I have colleagues in

210
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:43,409
Boston who are part of the

211
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:45,600
sarbanes-oxley<font color="#CCCCCC"> take</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the Sox team you</font>

212
00:08:43,409 --> 00:08:47,520
know in sarbanes-oxley you know very

213
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">quickly came out as a result of the</font>

214
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,650
Enron

215
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:51,239
and you know looks at the financial

216
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:53,279
viability and the financial stability of

217
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:55,410
a company and certain you know and risks

218
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:58,439
are analyzed through that to paraphrase

219
00:08:55,410 --> 00:09:00,630
it very very dramatically when they go

220
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:02,610
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> and carry out an assessment of a team</font>

221
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:04,890
for instance say for instance<font color="#CCCCCC"> likely</font>

222
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:07,350
that the payroll team they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at</font>

223
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:12,770
the financial risks you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know so they're</font>

224
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:15,540
interested in for instance if within<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

225
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:17,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">within expensive system our expenses</font>

226
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:18,810
being signed off by the right<font color="#CCCCCC"> people in</font>

227
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:20,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">the right process in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the right time and</font>

228
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:22,829
all that sort of thing that's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> NASA</font>

229
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:25,080
anathema to me as a sick as a<font color="#CCCCCC"> security</font>

230
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:27,150
risk assessment I could go in and assess

231
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:28,310
the payroll team and see the door

232
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:30,689
propped open with a fire extinguisher

233
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:33,420
that's a security risk because people

234
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:35,250
come in we might go in looking at the

235
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:37,079
same team and come out with two entirely

236
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:39,150
different set of risks I think that's

237
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:40,650
something that's worthwhile bearing in

238
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:42,959
mind when you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you go into it</font>

239
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:46,260
ensuring you know what is your universe

240
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:48,930
that you're covering<font color="#CCCCCC"> the second or third</font>

241
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:50,640
i should say what tools do we use you

242
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:52,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">know what is your baseline you know if</font>

243
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,750
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing an audit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to an iso audit</font>

244
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:57,030
it's fairly straightforward right<font color="#E5E5E5"> iso</font>

245
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:58,470
27001 standard you've got a list of

requirements you take across<font color="#CCCCCC"> a very</font>

247
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:02,790
straightforward if it's if it's an

248
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:04,949
assessment as such you know look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

249
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:06,660
different stands<font color="#E5E5E5"> as risk IT for instance</font>

250
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:08,310
or octave or different you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything</font>

251
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:10,079
could<font color="#E5E5E5"> be your own internal standard as</font>

252
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:11,489
well we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to have something that</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">something you can you can come back to</font>

255
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:20,040
and they different different standards

256
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:23,189
and different approaches are favored<font color="#CCCCCC"> by</font>

257
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:25,020
different industries so you know many

258
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:26,790
clients of ours for instance will come

259
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:30,360
to us and say show us your PCI

260
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:31,680
compliance will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> not PCI compliant we</font>

261
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,940
don't handle credit card details but

262
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:35,520
that's what they understand that's what

263
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:37,740
they know and understand so when you go

264
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:38,730
if you're looking at<font color="#E5E5E5"> a given team or a</font>

267
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:44,610
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> start to at least you know pick</font>

268
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:46,380
out some of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> risks in a language</font>

269
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:49,080
that they're going to understand in the

270
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:51,360
first place<font color="#E5E5E5"> and when you find the risks</font>

271
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:55,200
how are you going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to measure them you</font>

272
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:57,000
know for me I<font color="#CCCCCC"> I like ISO 27001</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's it</font>

273
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,370
kind of reflects me you know simple and

274
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,860
straightforward it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very simple to</font>

275
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:03,720
understand it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> very easy to put across</font>

risk asset value likelihood impact and a

278
00:11:07,829 --> 00:11:11,939
score and you can measure everything

279
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:13,500
across that<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I like I said</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> twenty</font>

thing that often comes back I found you

00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:39,320
know over the number of years is this

misunderstanding of what it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

question great yes look really looking

forward to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the assessment let me know</font>

kind of not the<font color="#E5E5E5"> point of an assessment</font>

344
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:55,490
the point is<font color="#CCCCCC"> for me to come in do a</font>

00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:57,770
sampling exercise ask you the questions

346
00:13:55,490 --> 00:13:59,960
and get you<font color="#CCCCCC"> two to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then show me all of</font>

off and start typing it all up for<font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font>

351
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:11,480
and it will be<font color="#CCCCCC"> perfect an absolute waste</font>

352

of time<font color="#E5E5E5"> and conversely you know from the</font>

356
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:23,300
shouldn't you know put the work in but

357
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:25,460
don't think there's an audit in six

months<font color="#E5E5E5"> time and in a month before just</font>

work furiously to pass it you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know you</font>

360
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:33,500
may get away with it a couple of three

361
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:35,600
times you know at best but at some point

362
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:37,190
the wheels are going to come off<font color="#CCCCCC"> it at</font>

363
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:39,740
some point<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody's going to be held</font>

accountable for why you know compliance

365
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:45,110
or you know the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> risk profile is low</font>

366
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:47,060
at the right round about the time<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

367
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:49,220
assessment and then shoots up afterwards

368
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:50,449
and something goes wrong you know your

369
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:52,370
senior management are going to be held

<font color="#E5E5E5">quickly reach its way down to you try</font>

00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:01,430
and ensure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that at all times you're</font>

374
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:03,380
ready for an audit technically<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

375
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:05,270
should be ready for somebody to<font color="#CCCCCC"> come in</font>

376
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:07,130
on no notice that's my first point

377
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:09,079
that's neither polite professional or

378
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:10,730
really very helpful you know but that's

379
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:13,520
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> point of readiness that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you need to</font>

381
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:18,050
of your DNA it's not you are actually

382
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:19,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">not achieving the goals of what it is</font>

383
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:24,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you set out to do in the first</font>

385
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:28,570
involved so you set the schedule now you

386
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:30,070
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to look at the</font>

people who are involved<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know why is</font>

388
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:35,950
it important you know well finding out

who they<font color="#CCCCCC"> are look up on if its internal</font>

390
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:38,830
look on the company<font color="#CCCCCC"> directory you know</font>

391
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:40,690
find<font color="#E5E5E5"> out where they are in a structure</font>

392
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:42,250
find out<font color="#CCCCCC"> how you know how old they are</font>

how old how long they've been in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

394
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:45,820
organization i should say you know it

395
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:47,290
might be they've been in there for 15

396
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:48,790
years and they've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> very you know</font>

397
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:50,680
stuck in the you know stuck in the mud

398
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:52,569
ways of doing things you know nothing

399
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:54,130
wrong with that per se but you need to

400
00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:55,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">be prepared for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it or it might</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be that</font>

401
00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:57,280
it's an entirely new team you know

402
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:59,410
they've been recruited all in the last

403
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:00,760
year the manager came<font color="#E5E5E5"> in two months ago</font>

404
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:02,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">because the previous manager was off</font>

405
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:03,970
with stress you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's going to</font>

406
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,970
tell you something about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the assessment</font>

407
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:08,950
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the first place if it's external</font>

408
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:10,570
social networking linkedin all that sort

409
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:12,760
of stuff you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can find out exactly the</font>

410
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:14,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">same kind of information</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know you</font>

411
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:17,380
can gather a lot of inflation it's

412
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:20,230
important to<font color="#CCCCCC"> find this out because it</font>

413
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:21,880
allows you to talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> to these people in a</font>

414
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:25,210
language that they know<font color="#CCCCCC"> and understand</font>

415
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:27,250
so try and plan not only for the

416
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:29,050
assessment itself but for the people

417
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:32,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you're expecting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to meet when you</font>

418
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:33,790
get there goes without saying produce

419
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:35,350
your artifacts in advance if you've got

420
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:36,849
a sign-in sheet for instance if you use

421
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:39,280
one of those get it produced in advance

422
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:40,930
if you've got you know an evidence

423
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:42,970
record sheet get it produced in advance

424
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:44,920
if you're you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know asking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> four pieces of</font>

finally know what it is that you you

437
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:16,360
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of assessments on a wide</font>

438
00:17:12,459 --> 00:17:17,980
variety of industry areas so for

439
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:21,310
instance I might look at a particularly

440
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:23,199
technically heavy project or team or

441
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:24,909
environment need to know the

442
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:26,380
technologies that are in<font color="#CCCCCC"> use so i can</font>

443
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:28,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">just do a little bit of you know</font>

444
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:30,310
brushing up beforehand so i can again

445
00:17:28,329 --> 00:17:32,770
talk their language<font color="#E5E5E5"> i can ask the right</font>

446
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:35,050
things it might be a heavily creative

447
00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:37,030
environment in which case the use of

448
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:39,159
technology is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be somewhat</font>

449
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:41,379
limited to you know dropbox and

450
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:42,040
photoshop you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know if you'll forgive my</font>

451
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:43,930
paraphrase

452
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:45,490
but that's you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know you have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

453
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:48,310
understand where it is that you're going

454
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:51,810
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> focus and the technology that you're</font>

455
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:51,810
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to come across when you get there</font>

456
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:58,930
so we come to the eyes and believe it or

457
00:17:56,530 --> 00:18:00,970
not you know you use your eyes to look

458
00:17:58,930 --> 00:18:03,070
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> things and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this is my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> favorite part</font>

459
00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:06,120
because the observation side of things

460
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:08,620
is one of the one of the dare i say

461
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:12,639
funnest parts of things<font color="#CCCCCC"> i hate</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> when</font>

462
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:15,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">things are fun hey it's fun but it</font>

463
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:18,100
starts from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the moment you step out of</font>

464
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:20,260
the cab as you<font color="#CCCCCC"> walking up to the</font>

building you should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at the</font>

building that you're going to be

00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:27,220
assessing I can't tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> you how many</font>

468
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:29,260
times<font color="#CCCCCC"> they see CCTV cameras on corners</font>

469
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:31,690
of buildings pointing away from each

<font color="#E5E5E5">just look through London walking here</font>

from<font color="#CCCCCC"> spitalfields for instance there's</font>

476
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:47,500
one building that does very similar

00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:57,939
covering each other as well observe as

481
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:59,770
you get signed in or even<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you do get</font>

486
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:13,990
that their sign-in process is probably a

487
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:15,490
little bit deficient as well always<font color="#CCCCCC"> ask</font>

to go to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> toilet when you're in the</font>

an example for you<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do recall</font>

499
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,490
hadn't got needed the toilet I wouldn't

500
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:46,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">have found that out but that's the sort</font>

00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:50,170
outwards from the building they're not

503
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:52,720
actually concerned about what's going on

<font color="#E5E5E5">right behind their backs you know so do</font>

in there

that was you know immediately written

515
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:20,520
people look at who they look at yep try

516
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:24,520
observe if there are any long pauses

517
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:27,190
after questions and and find out who is

518
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:28,900
doing all of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> answering as well so if</font>

519
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:30,429
you ask a<font color="#CCCCCC"> question to this person and</font>

520
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:32,620
this person is constantly aren't

521
00:20:30,429 --> 00:20:34,900
answering the questions is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> because</font>

522
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:37,209
the why is this person even here you

523
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:38,559
know if they're supposed to be a part of

524
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:41,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">this assessment that's because they have</font>

525
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:43,270
a valid yeah perspective to bring the

526
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:45,908
<font color="#CCCCCC">person who's doing the are answering of</font>

527
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:48,340
all the questions maybe the senior guy

528
00:20:45,909 --> 00:20:50,500
in you know in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the in the team you know</font>

529
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:53,230
the gray hair or no hair who's actually

530
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:55,150
been there for a while and actually

531
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:56,320
knows everything and is damn well going

532
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:58,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">to make sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we get through this</font>

533
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:01,120
assessment you know and can try and

534
00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:04,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">barge his way through it so observe how</font>

535
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:06,340
people interact with each other and in

536
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:08,559
<font color="#CCCCCC">different cultures this works in you</font>

537
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:11,139
know in different ways as well you know

538
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:14,350
so in certain cultures you know junior

539
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:17,260
staffers are more subservient to senior

540
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:19,240
staff than say in UK cultures you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

541
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:23,220
so that you get different different kind

542
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:23,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">of signals in different cultures as well</font>

543
00:21:23,909 --> 00:21:27,610
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about the walk about</font>

544
00:21:26,049 --> 00:21:29,350
it later as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> also talked about</font>

545
00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:32,949
observations but the other part of this

546
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:35,799
is if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> the oddity never let the</font>

547
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:38,049
auditor out of your sight because<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font>

548
00:21:35,799 --> 00:21:40,418
the time when<font color="#E5E5E5"> mischeif happens right</font>

549
00:21:38,049 --> 00:21:43,030
because they will<font color="#CCCCCC"> also go looking around</font>

550
00:21:40,419 --> 00:21:45,220
for things escort them to the bathroom

551
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:47,470
you know escort them as you do a

552
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:50,830
walkabout when you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> finished the</font>

553
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:53,470
assessment escort them all the way down

554
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:56,168
and see them off the premises basically

555
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:58,720
a couple of<font color="#CCCCCC"> things in a couple of</font>

556
00:21:56,169 --> 00:22:02,140
experiences here<font color="#E5E5E5"> I recall as we were</font>

557
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:03,909
walking out as well engaging the chap in

558
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:06,059
conversation oh thank goodness you

559
00:22:03,909 --> 00:22:09,010
didn't talk about disaster recovery<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh</font>

560
00:22:06,059 --> 00:22:09,610
let's go<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's go back and talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

561
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:12,400
disaster

562
00:22:09,610 --> 00:22:14,169
coverage shall we you know because if

563
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,820
I'd been just built yet it's fine<font color="#E5E5E5"> see my</font>

564
00:22:14,170 --> 00:22:17,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out you actually might not get that</font>

565
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:19,120
you know get people off off their guard

566
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:21,309
as it were this is the cynical part

567
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:23,799
coming in the other parts as well as I

568
00:22:21,309 --> 00:22:26,440
was in<font color="#CCCCCC"> India it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was August it was 44</font>

569
00:22:23,799 --> 00:22:28,360
degrees centigrade and the guys cab was

570
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:30,250
late and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> found out after we'd walked</font>

571
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:32,559
off the premises and we were stood by

572
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:35,830
you know where the cars pull up 40

573
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:37,780
minutes but I was taking a shower inside

574
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:40,059
my clothes but there was no way I was

575
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:42,520
going to say thanks garish<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll see you</font>

576
00:22:40,059 --> 00:22:45,428
<font color="#E5E5E5">later he was staying in my sight until</font>

577
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:48,580
he had gone simple as that you know so

578
00:22:45,429 --> 00:22:50,350
it's it's worth doing because it as soon

579
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:51,668
<font color="#E5E5E5">as they're out of your sight unless</font>

580
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:58,799
they're off your premise isn't gone

581
00:22:51,669 --> 00:23:02,020
they're out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your control as well so</font>

582
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:05,500
he is<font color="#E5E5E5"> so observation is important</font>

583
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:07,150
listening is also important in my top

584
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:11,559
two this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thomas his number one as</font>

585
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:13,480
well as<font color="#CCCCCC"> the other</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one listen to every</font>

586
00:23:11,559 --> 00:23:16,000
single statement that's made to you

587
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:19,059
after every question you give pick it

588
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:21,610
apart repeat it back listen to that

589
00:23:19,059 --> 00:23:24,460
listen to what<font color="#E5E5E5"> they've what they respond</font>

590
00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:26,918
to and then confirm it back again why

591
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:29,530
because you're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> maximum</font>

592
00:23:26,919 --> 00:23:31,750
out of the minimum<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they want to</font>

593
00:23:29,530 --> 00:23:34,450
give you and again this is the cynic in

594
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:36,669
me coming out as an oddity the less<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

595
00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:38,620
say the less i can be you know held to

596
00:23:36,669 --> 00:23:40,720
ransom for it or held accountable<font color="#E5E5E5"> for it</font>

597
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:44,049
well in which case i'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to pick up</font>

598
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:48,040
on every single cue you know verbal you

599
00:23:44,049 --> 00:23:49,929
know oral our all sorry body language

600
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:53,470
etc again all things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we look at</font>

601
00:23:49,929 --> 00:23:56,559
later<font color="#CCCCCC"> i want to pull everything out of</font>

602
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:58,630
you as much as possible yes so just bear

603
00:23:56,559 --> 00:24:00,040
in mind the maximum out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the minimum</font>

604
00:23:58,630 --> 00:24:02,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's going to be given to you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i know</font>

605
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:04,389
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> i used to do it all the time now</font>

606
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:06,309
i do not want them to know about this

607
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:07,780
particular document do you have a

608
00:24:06,309 --> 00:24:14,320
testing doc you know have you carried

609
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:15,970
out a test yes you know and it's so on

610
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:19,600
and so on right so you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font>

611
00:24:15,970 --> 00:24:22,809
more and more out of them use your ears

612
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:23,340
in another way as well so a<font color="#E5E5E5"> good friend</font>

613
00:24:22,809 --> 00:24:24,930
of mine

614
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:26,610
I years ago he went on a counselors

615
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:27,780
course you know talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> to people who</font>

616
00:24:26,610 --> 00:24:29,639
feel stressed and all that sort of thing

617
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:32,070
it's very in-depth fascinating talking

618
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:35,580
to him about it they told<font color="#E5E5E5"> me they spent</font>

619
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:39,030
a good couple of sessions learning about

620
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:42,570
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> value</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of silence and how you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use</font>

621
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:45,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">it to elicit more information so when I</font>

622
00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:48,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">ask a question someone responds and they</font>

623
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:51,780
finish don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> immediately jump back in</font>

624
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:54,510
wait nature abhors a vacuum humans

625
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:57,030
beings<font color="#CCCCCC"> abour a silence they want to kind</font>

626
00:24:54,510 --> 00:25:00,750
of fill it right they don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to be</font>

627
00:24:57,030 --> 00:25:02,940
awkward<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it in many</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cases they</font>

628
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:05,010
don't also<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want to be rude right</font>

629
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:06,360
that's it next question move on you know

630
00:25:05,010 --> 00:25:09,270
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not there you know it's not their</font>

631
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:12,360
game to play as it were let them do it

632
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:14,190
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> so there's a quote in in a book</font>

633
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:16,250
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the leaders workbook which I really</font>

634
00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:18,690
liked which is you blessed with you know

635
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:22,560
twice as many years as you our mouths

636
00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:25,530
right use<font color="#E5E5E5"> that kind of ratio listen at</font>

637
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:27,270
least<font color="#E5E5E5"> twice as much as you talk and that</font>

638
00:25:25,530 --> 00:25:29,490
listening means<font color="#E5E5E5"> also listening to</font>

639
00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:33,750
silence waiting for them to<font color="#E5E5E5"> fill the</font>

640
00:25:29,490 --> 00:25:35,340
gaps while you're waiting for<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

641
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:37,140
silence or whilst you're wasting<font color="#E5E5E5"> two at</font>

642
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:39,540
science maintain eye contact as well

643
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:41,310
because if you look down<font color="#E5E5E5"> and start</font>

644
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:43,920
scribbling away or looking away they

645
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:45,629
think the conversation<font color="#E5E5E5"> is over well</font>

646
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:47,790
you're still looking at them you're

647
00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:49,620
maintaining that contact and if they're

648
00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:51,090
breaking that eye contact first chances

649
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:52,889
are they're probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> missing something</font>

650
00:25:51,090 --> 00:25:54,600
out well they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say something else</font>

651
00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:58,410
that may be<font color="#E5E5E5"> the point in which you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

652
00:25:54,600 --> 00:26:01,439
ask further questions listen<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

653
00:25:58,410 --> 00:26:03,750
subtext as well in many cases<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

654
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:05,370
people people do not like being assessed

655
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:07,770
or they<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't like being audited it's a</font>

656
00:26:05,370 --> 00:26:10,770
very personal feeling even<font color="#CCCCCC"> though in</font>

657
00:26:07,770 --> 00:26:12,360
many cases the reason why they might not

658
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:14,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">be doing so well is entirely out of</font>

their hands it's due to you know you

660
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:17,760
know poor resourcing and not enough

661

<font color="#E5E5E5">money and not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> enough but not the wrong</font>

662
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:22,440
skills and all that swing listen to the

subtext that's coming<font color="#CCCCCC"> through and turn</font>

what might be coming across<font color="#CCCCCC"> as hostile</font>

665
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:29,400
into a more positive conversation you

666
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:32,100
know make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they that you</font>

00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:33,630
understand when they're talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

the challenges that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they face you</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">paws</font>

671
00:26:36,450 --> 00:26:40,830
call the management let them know that

672
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:42,570
what you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing is effectively some</font>

673
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:45,679
kind of consultancy for them in effect

674
00:26:42,570 --> 00:26:49,200
right you they could use this report as

675
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:51,510
leverage to get better resources to get

676
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:53,430
you know better training and more you

677
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:54,690
know more money and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know anything</font>

678
00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:57,690
that anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> else that they might need</font>

679
00:26:54,690 --> 00:26:59,850
if it's used properly basically try and

680
00:26:57,690 --> 00:27:01,890
sit on<font color="#E5E5E5"> their side of the story try and</font>

681
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:06,629
see it from their side empathize with

682
00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:08,850
them you know resale as I said<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

683
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:11,640
resell the risk assessment as something

684
00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:13,709
as free consultancy you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> turn</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

685
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:15,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">around and start giving them advice on</font>

686
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:18,360
how they can<font color="#CCCCCC"> improve things as well okay</font>

687
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:21,000
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't have budget you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your your</font>

688
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:22,649
risk table your table of risks sucks

689
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,970
here's why it sucks and<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is what</font>

690
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:25,820
you've got to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it and actually</font>

691
00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:28,200
if you do it right it's really simple

692
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:29,939
watch<font color="#E5E5E5"> them fura see scribble notes</font>

693
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:31,710
you'll see that actually they want this

694
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:33,710
stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> because they want to be able to do</font>

695
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:36,390
better in this certainly the next time

696
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:40,230
and I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in summary on this</font>

697
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:42,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's it's all about you find out more by</font>

698
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:45,030
listening more it sounds<font color="#CCCCCC"> obvious but</font>

699
00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:47,790
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very easy to get carried away in in</font>

700
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:50,520
the activities of a risk assessment you

701
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:52,889
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> very easy to just plow through all</font>

702
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:55,500
the points to be covered or plow through

703
00:27:52,890 --> 00:27:57,840
you know your agenda as it were so try

704
00:27:55,500 --> 00:28:02,850
and try to do more to<font color="#E5E5E5"> listen as much as</font>

705
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:04,949
possible so the mouth I couldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> help</font>

706
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:06,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">noticing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the huge fish hook in the top</font>

and therefore what is they don't know

733
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:13,889
side<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the table is an oddity you try</font>

734
00:29:11,429 --> 00:29:16,020
and schedule the longest lunch in the

737
00:29:18,330 --> 00:29:22,409
first thing you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do as an auditor is I</font>

738
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:27,418
<font color="#E5E5E5">think we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> should just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have sandwiches and</font>

have a working lunch you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> which so</font>

740
00:29:27,419 --> 00:29:33,210
but use that time that downtime<font color="#CCCCCC"> be it in</font>

away mite bite suit your purposes

743
00:29:35,010 --> 00:29:39,480
dependent upon this you know what how

744
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:41,970
you're going on use that time to talk to

745
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:43,520
them talk to them again about their pain

746
00:29:41,970 --> 00:29:46,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">points talk some about their goals</font>

747
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:48,929
outside of necessarily<font color="#E5E5E5"> this risk</font>

748
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:51,209
assessment how about for you know if not

749
00:29:48,929 --> 00:29:53,309
this sub team then how about the team as

750
00:29:51,210 --> 00:29:55,799
a whole or not this particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> office</font>

751
00:29:53,309 --> 00:29:57,178
but the company as a whole try and see

752
00:29:55,799 --> 00:29:59,160
where they go in as a larger

753
00:29:57,179 --> 00:30:00,450
organization find out about their

754
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:02,090
hobbies for goodness sake because it

755
00:30:00,450 --> 00:30:05,130
might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be that you share a love of</font>

philately or fly fishing or anything

00:30:05,130 --> 00:30:10,799
else begin with<font color="#CCCCCC"> fur because that then</font>

758
00:30:08,370 --> 00:30:13,320
immediately identifies you as a human

759
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:14,970
being to them not just some box-ticking

760
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:17,610
ogre who's here to make their life a

761
00:30:14,970 --> 00:30:19,679
misery you start to<font color="#E5E5E5"> create a bond with</font>

762
00:30:17,610 --> 00:30:21,990
those people and they will start to open

763
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:24,000
up a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little bit more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and especially if</font>

764
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:26,720
you go back to these places time and

765
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:29,100
time again you will build up an ongoing

766
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:33,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">relationship with them you know I know</font>

767
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:35,040
we had a order for as an iso 27001

768
00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:37,168
auditor in india he came to<font color="#E5E5E5"> us about</font>

769
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:39,990
seven or eight times i think in total

770
00:30:37,169 --> 00:30:41,580
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and it would half the time we</font>

771
00:30:39,990 --> 00:30:43,020
spent chatting so it was an oddity it

772
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:45,030
was great you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> we use it up these</font>

773
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:46,470
hours that we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do just because he</font>

774
00:30:45,030 --> 00:30:48,840
wants to<font color="#E5E5E5"> chat and find out what's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font>

775
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:51,510
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> of course what he was doing was</font>

776
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:54,470
trying to ensure whether or not security

777
00:30:51,510 --> 00:30:57,660
was inherent in the company as a whole

778
00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:59,610
right not just within the<font color="#E5E5E5"> specific areas</font>

779
00:30:57,660 --> 00:31:00,870
that we were covered within our scope he

780
00:30:59,610 --> 00:31:02,490
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see the bigger picture and</font>

781
00:31:00,870 --> 00:31:03,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">that was what he was doing so we kind of</font>

782
00:31:02,490 --> 00:31:06,149
met both our goal

783
00:31:03,690 --> 00:31:07,889
at the end of the day but we didn't do

784
00:31:06,149 --> 00:31:09,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">that or we wouldn't have done that if we</font>

785
00:31:07,889 --> 00:31:11,519
hadn't trusted each other and understood

786
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:15,629
that we were working<font color="#E5E5E5"> towards those same</font>

787
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:17,580
goals again I mentioned<font color="#E5E5E5"> before about who</font>

788
00:31:15,629 --> 00:31:21,389
you're talking to and who's doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

789
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:24,299
answering speak to everybody focus

790
00:31:21,389 --> 00:31:27,029
direct questions on individuals and if

791
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:28,950
you know that<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Baldy guy</font>

792
00:31:27,029 --> 00:31:31,559
on the left hand side say it starts to

793
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:32,549
dance or<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything all over again so no</font>

794
00:31:31,559 --> 00:31:34,950
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just want to hear from this</font>

795
00:31:32,549 --> 00:31:36,990
perspective it's entirely valid to try

796
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:39,360
and you know elicit a question from

797
00:31:36,990 --> 00:31:40,919
somebody who you know should know

798
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:42,299
something but is not necessarily

799
00:31:40,919 --> 00:31:44,370
volunteering it you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> trying to</font>

800
00:31:42,299 --> 00:31:48,750
ascertain the breadth and depth of that

801
00:31:44,370 --> 00:31:51,299
that person's<font color="#E5E5E5"> knowledge after all you</font>

802
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:54,570
know if that one person has all the

803
00:31:51,299 --> 00:31:58,379
answers there's warning bells should be

804
00:31:54,570 --> 00:31:59,460
ringing out across the<font color="#E5E5E5"> board and the</font>

805
00:31:58,379 --> 00:32:01,980
other thing as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well as you know I</font>

806
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:03,629
mentioned earlier about<font color="#E5E5E5"> understand what</font>

807
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:06,019
the project is is it technically heavy

808
00:32:03,629 --> 00:32:09,149
is it creatively heavy or whatever

809
00:32:06,019 --> 00:32:11,399
identify the individuals within that

810
00:32:09,149 --> 00:32:14,459
assessment for what it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that they do</font>

811
00:32:11,399 --> 00:32:16,199
who's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> techie who's the coder who's</font>

812
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:19,169
the creative genius and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that means that</font>

813
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:20,730
you can bypass when you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> come to those</font>

814
00:32:19,169 --> 00:32:22,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">certain questions all those you know</font>

815
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:24,210
those assumptions that you need to

816
00:32:22,049 --> 00:32:25,500
validate you bypass the guy who<font color="#E5E5E5"> knows</font>

817
00:32:24,210 --> 00:32:27,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">everything because you're talking</font>

818
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:30,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">directly to the individual who really</font>

819
00:32:27,389 --> 00:32:33,449
should know the SME<font color="#CCCCCC"> in in this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> case so</font>

820
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:39,750
understand who who does what in each

821
00:32:33,450 --> 00:32:43,440
environment so the nose I like this one

822
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:46,590
because it's it it brings<font color="#E5E5E5"> out the</font>

823
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:49,440
detective in everybody really you know

824
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:52,439
follow your nose at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the end the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> day when</font>

825
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:54,509
you come across<font color="#E5E5E5"> an environment and there</font>

826
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:56,159
is fabulous documentation and its

827
00:32:54,509 --> 00:32:58,710
pristine and it's beautifully rendered

828
00:32:56,159 --> 00:33:00,419
and it's you know nice logos and all of

829
00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:03,269
all of<font color="#CCCCCC"> these sign off dates are correct</font>

830
00:33:00,419 --> 00:33:04,799
and you've got a perfect evidence trail

831
00:33:03,269 --> 00:33:07,500
of who approved what and when and the

832
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:09,269
change control is in there etc etc and

833
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:10,919
all the procedures map directly and

834
00:33:09,269 --> 00:33:13,259
references<font color="#E5E5E5"> interconnect and all that</font>

835
00:33:10,919 --> 00:33:16,710
sort of thing that's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give you a</font>

836
00:33:13,259 --> 00:33:17,400
fairly good impression of what it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

837
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:20,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you're a set</font>

838
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:22,460
sin chances are<font color="#CCCCCC"> if they take the time</font>

839
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:24,480
and effort to produce quality

840
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:27,720
documentation it's because they care

841
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:29,370
about the processes and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> policies and</font>

842
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:34,290
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> implementation of what they're doing</font>

843
00:33:29,370 --> 00:33:37,080
underneath it you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the obverse of</font>

844
00:33:34,290 --> 00:33:38,940
this of course is if they bring the

845
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:40,350
documentation in a test goes bag and

846
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:42,720
slap it down and it's stapled together

847
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:44,159
and dog-eared and oh yeah we<font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't we</font>

848
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:45,360
haven't quite updated that one yes I

00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:50,340
process of it etc chances are they don't

851
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:51,660
care<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the processes themselves they</font>

852
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:53,909
think it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> all up here it's all tribal</font>

853
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:56,940
knowledge it's fine we can do it you

854
00:33:53,910 --> 00:33:58,890
know we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can make this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> work for us you</font>

855
00:33:56,940 --> 00:34:00,720
know so nothing's really that clear-cut

856
00:33:58,890 --> 00:34:02,730
you know very<font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very rarely but you</font>

857
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:05,850
need to try and pick up some of these

858
00:34:02,730 --> 00:34:07,530
clues that will tell you more about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

organization that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're that you're</font>

00:34:07,530 --> 00:34:14,250
reviewing you know so follow your nose

861
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:17,520
if something doesn't quite add up if you

862
00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:18,870
know if the reference is slightly

863
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:20,690
incorrect off a piece of evidence

864
00:34:18,870 --> 00:34:22,859
doesn't quite add up follow it through

865
00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:25,889
there's no question<font color="#CCCCCC"> about to keep</font>

866
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:27,960
plugging away keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> asking the stupid</font>

867
00:34:25,889 --> 00:34:30,389
questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know in one I had an</font>

868
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:32,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">8-hour assessment to carry out any one</font>

869
00:34:30,389 --> 00:34:34,799
of them I spent nearly three hours on

870
00:34:32,219 --> 00:34:37,350
the second question of God knows how

871
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:39,870
many because this<font color="#E5E5E5"> really does not add up</font>

872
00:34:37,350 --> 00:34:40,949
you know this<font color="#CCCCCC"> this and this it's not</font>

873
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:42,179
quite adding up we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to follow</font>

874
00:34:40,949 --> 00:34:44,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">through about two and a half hours</font>

875
00:34:42,179 --> 00:34:47,550
through I started to sweat a bit you

876
00:34:44,610 --> 00:34:50,909
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I might have made a mistake here I</font>

877
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:54,120
might have you know lost come across

878
00:34:50,909 --> 00:34:55,740
nothing at the expense of about<font color="#E5E5E5"> 20 other</font>

879
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:57,420
risks that we could<font color="#E5E5E5"> have uncovered here</font>

880
00:34:55,739 --> 00:34:59,609
the end 20 other more important risks

881
00:34:57,420 --> 00:35:01,770
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> it did work out in the end</font>

882
00:34:59,610 --> 00:35:03,510
thank goodness but it you know you do

883
00:35:01,770 --> 00:35:06,240
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to follow your nose on this follow</font>

884
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:07,910
the evidence trail you know until you

885
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:10,080
find something or until you're satisfied

886
00:35:07,910 --> 00:35:12,470
that actually there really is nothing

887
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:12,470
there

888
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:19,420
ok let's sharp pinging noise you're

889
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:21,640
hearing is the analogy of an<font color="#E5E5E5"> Anatomy</font>

00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:27,730
over your head there to paraphrase

892
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:29,529
Douglas Adams lungs like reason I chose

893
00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:31,270
you long series sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> you've really</font>

got to<font color="#E5E5E5"> breathe a little bit in an audit</font>

895
00:35:31,270 --> 00:35:36,580
right you're going to take a deep breath

896
00:35:33,010 --> 00:35:37,990
in and<font color="#E5E5E5"> out tell</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yourself you're warm and</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">beach somewhere because you know there</font>

899
00:35:40,090 --> 00:35:45,610
are occasions where you're just butting

900
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:46,990
heads yeah things are not happening

901
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:48,340
you're asking for<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff and it's not</font>

902
00:35:46,990 --> 00:35:50,370
being delivered but they don't think it

903
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:52,690
should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> delivered you know you're</font>

904
00:35:50,370 --> 00:35:54,430
you're requesting documentation they

905
00:35:52,690 --> 00:35:56,260
said oh it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> in our other facility it'll</font>

906
00:35:54,430 --> 00:35:58,000
be here in two or three hours you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

907
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:59,470
probably full well know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that somebody's</font>

908
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,890
probably typing the damn thing up in the

909
00:35:59,470 --> 00:36:04,990
background you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you really need to</font>

910
00:36:02,890 --> 00:36:07,420
kind of take a step back from all this

911
00:36:04,990 --> 00:36:09,819
and sit right what is it<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we are</font>

912
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:13,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">trying to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> achieve here it's let's reset</font>

and basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> try and really engage with</font>

916
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:23,560
start again there's a variety<font color="#E5E5E5"> of reasons</font>

917
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:24,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">which you've already talked about the</font>

919
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:28,990
oddities for instance or maybe you

920
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:30,790
haven't done your homework and you've

921
00:36:28,990 --> 00:36:33,069
miscalculated who it is that you're

922
00:36:30,790 --> 00:36:37,390
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for instance and you you're</font>

923
00:36:33,070 --> 00:36:39,070
you're missing the actual core role or

924
00:36:37,390 --> 00:36:41,950
the core perspective of what that team

925
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:44,290
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to do you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so do if you're</font>

getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> nowhere reset those expectations</font>

927
00:36:44,290 --> 00:36:49,420
think it through again try<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

928
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:51,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">understand where it's going the flip</font>

side to this is always under<font color="#CCCCCC"> Strine</font>

930
00:36:51,790 --> 00:36:55,840
always understand the difference between

931
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:57,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">time wasting and things just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> taking a</font>

00:37:02,530 --> 00:37:05,950
no cabs and you know well perhaps you

936
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:07,780
should<font color="#CCCCCC"> have asked for all that</font>

937
00:37:05,950 --> 00:37:09,910
documentation in the first place anyway

938
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:10,930
right you know next time make sure you

939
00:37:09,910 --> 00:37:15,100
have a meeting at the records department

940
00:37:10,930 --> 00:37:18,009
in a but understand when it's time

941
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:21,160
wasting and try and dragging feet versus

942
00:37:18,010 --> 00:37:23,590
actual issues try<font color="#E5E5E5"> and do as many things</font>

943
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:25,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">in parallel as possible get me these</font>

944
00:37:23,590 --> 00:37:26,770
records it's going to take two hours

945
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,880
okay go<font color="#E5E5E5"> get them we'll move on to the</font>

946
00:37:26,770 --> 00:37:29,559
next<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font>

947
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:30,970
far easier when you've got two<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

948
00:37:29,559 --> 00:37:33,519
doing it because you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can track multiple</font>

949
00:37:30,970 --> 00:37:36,939
activities<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> than you know at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> once</font>

950
00:37:33,519 --> 00:37:38,740
far more easily and if you're doing

951
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:41,500
assessing against<font color="#E5E5E5"> a standard for</font>

952
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:42,788
instance ISO 27001 they work against

953
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:44,259
headcount and therefore the number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

00:37:42,789 --> 00:37:46,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">hours that you should have you know to</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">be assessed don't count down time or</font>

958
00:37:51,130 --> 00:37:55,809
records the clock stops right it's just

959
00:37:53,589 --> 00:37:57,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a game of rugby when some you know</font>

00:37:55,809 --> 00:37:59,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">the clock stops when they're when</font>

961
00:37:57,490 --> 00:38:00,939
they're pulling the half-dead player off

962
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:04,569
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> let's throw any other player on and</font>

963
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:06,039
then you<font color="#E5E5E5"> carry on and of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> course you</font>

964
00:38:04,569 --> 00:38:11,859
should never have a long lunch you know

965
00:38:06,039 --> 00:38:14,789
because that stops the clock as well so

966
00:38:11,859 --> 00:38:16,839
the hands getting your hands dirty

967
00:38:14,789 --> 00:38:19,180
actually getting in and reviewing

968
00:38:16,839 --> 00:38:21,430
documents this is where in a lot of

969
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:24,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">cases cultural differences you know play</font>

970
00:38:21,430 --> 00:38:27,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">it play a big part so if I carry out</font>

971
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:29,920
risk assessment in you know against

972
00:38:27,509 --> 00:38:32,109
American clients for instance it's

973
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:34,480
almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> always electronic documentation</font>

974
00:38:32,109 --> 00:38:36,490
on a screen here you go bump scroll

00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:39,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">through work your way out if I go to</font>

976
00:38:36,490 --> 00:38:42,008
India it's almost always paper

977
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:44,049
documentation you know it's a regular

978
00:38:42,009 --> 00:38:47,349
cratic environment you know they<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

00:38:44,049 --> 00:38:49,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">thank being us the Empire for that very</font>

980
00:38:47,349 --> 00:38:50,829
bureaucratic very paper-based and that's

981
00:38:49,390 --> 00:38:53,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">how it worked and it works there's no</font>

982
00:38:50,829 --> 00:38:57,039
question<font color="#E5E5E5"> about it the downside of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> course</font>

983
00:38:53,710 --> 00:39:00,509
is you will get reams of paper so we

984
00:38:57,039 --> 00:39:03,849
carried out an assessment on a facility

985
00:39:00,509 --> 00:39:05,670
facilities management team<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I don't</font>

986
00:39:03,849 --> 00:39:09,400
know anybody who's worked in India here

987
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:12,730
but good companies out in India will

988
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:15,339
arrange or manage transport for their

989
00:39:12,730 --> 00:39:18,130
employees from home to the office and

990
00:39:15,339 --> 00:39:20,589

activity to get stuff done what you

locked down you know the word has gone

1090
00:42:53,930 --> 00:42:57,379
round they've seen you there walking

1091
00:42:55,790 --> 00:43:00,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">around not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with a clipboard with your</font>

1093
00:43:00,410 --> 00:43:09,890
environment they want to know why so I

1094
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:11,990
think you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know but really bringing your</font>

1095
00:43:09,890 --> 00:43:14,930
presence on to the floor<font color="#E5E5E5"> as well rather</font>

1096
00:43:11,990 --> 00:43:17,509
than just sitting in the office actually

1097
00:43:14,930 --> 00:43:20,299
trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> engage with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people looking</font>

1098
00:43:17,510 --> 00:43:21,950
through things you know you're sticking

1099
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:23,390
your nose kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> wore your hands i</font>

1100
00:43:21,950 --> 00:43:26,210
should say the hands<font color="#E5E5E5"> where you know</font>

1101
00:43:23,390 --> 00:43:28,490
people might not expect they belong is a

1102
00:43:26,210 --> 00:43:35,440
very useful tool for ensuring that you

1103
00:43:28,490 --> 00:43:38,509
can find stuff out so without wishing to

1104
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:40,720
compare your nose to your gut or you're

1105
00:43:38,510 --> 00:43:44,270
in testing this is very similar to

1106
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:46,189
finding something with your nose but<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

1107
00:43:44,270 --> 00:43:47,900
starts in a different place so with your

1108
00:43:46,190 --> 00:43:50,510
nose you kind of smelt something

1109
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:52,910
something's<font color="#E5E5E5"> wrong this doesn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> add up</font>

1110
00:43:50,510 --> 00:43:55,430
here that doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> add up there you know</font>

1111
00:43:52,910 --> 00:43:56,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">in the spirit of all good cop shows you</font>

1112
00:43:55,430 --> 00:43:59,270
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> i got a gut feeling on this</font>

1113
00:43:56,930 --> 00:44:01,310
lieutenant that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is going on nothing</font>

1114
00:43:59,270 --> 00:44:03,590
right and that's what<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is this is</font>

1115
00:44:01,310 --> 00:44:06,350
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> got no evidence to tell you</font>

1116
00:44:03,590 --> 00:44:07,320
that x y&z is wrong really just doesn't

1117
00:44:06,350 --> 00:44:12,240
feel right as it is

1118
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:14,340
you know and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know you have to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1119
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:16,140
should follow it through it's a careful

1120
00:44:14,340 --> 00:44:18,150
one it's a bit careful balance to have

1121
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:19,950
you do need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to think about now there's</font>

1122
00:44:18,150 --> 00:44:23,850
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> necessarily this will backfire but</font>

1123
00:44:19,950 --> 00:44:26,419
you could waste time right and there's

1124
00:44:23,850 --> 00:44:28,650
nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> wrong in keeping asking</font>

questions in the face of good evidence

if it<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't feel</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know it</font>

00:44:37,290 --> 00:44:41,970
they're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> two entirely different</font>

1131
00:44:38,910 --> 00:44:43,620
things you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know this team is doing very</font>

1132
00:44:41,970 --> 00:44:45,270
badly but according<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the evidence this</font>

1133
00:44:43,620 --> 00:44:47,520
team is doing very well and that thus

1134
00:44:45,270 --> 00:44:48,960
just doesn't fit<font color="#CCCCCC"> right you need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

1135
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:51,090
about why that doesn't fit<font color="#CCCCCC"> right and</font>

1136
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:52,350
follow through so just because there's

1137
00:44:51,090 --> 00:44:55,370
good evidence doesn't mean you should

1138
00:44:52,350 --> 00:44:58,950
stop<font color="#E5E5E5"> if it feels the right thing to do</font>

1139
00:44:55,370 --> 00:45:03,690
keep trusting them but also know when to

1140
00:44:58,950 --> 00:45:05,819
<font color="#CCCCCC">stop because don't you don't want to</font>

1141
00:45:03,690 --> 00:45:07,620
take time<font color="#E5E5E5"> away from finding other</font>

1142
00:45:05,820 --> 00:45:11,460
perhaps more important risks especially

1143
00:45:07,620 --> 00:45:14,490
on a gut feel now a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> example of this</font>

00:45:14,490 --> 00:45:19,169
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> a Eureka moment for me was</font>

1146
00:45:16,850 --> 00:45:21,000
assessing an office we had an offshore

1147
00:45:19,170 --> 00:45:23,940
dove delivery<font color="#CCCCCC"> center for this particular</font>

1149
00:45:23,940 --> 00:45:30,480
office and we then have a second set of

1150
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:32,970
security for this particular project

1151
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:36,690
area dual factor authentication rather

1152
00:45:32,970 --> 00:45:38,430
than just no key badging in and things

1153
00:45:36,690 --> 00:45:39,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going well you know expected risks</font>

1154
00:45:38,430 --> 00:45:41,399
here and there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I stood outside you</font>

1155
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:42,330
always observe people going in and out

1156
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:43,740
because you don't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> people to</font>

1157
00:45:42,330 --> 00:45:45,840
tailgate and all that sort of thing and

1158
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:49,140
people walking it no this isn't right I

1159
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:51,000
can't believe this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this perfect</font>

00:45:49,140 --> 00:45:53,310
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> tab in doing their four digit</font>

1161
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:55,050
code doesn't feel right so I asked<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

1162
00:45:53,310 --> 00:45:57,060
somebody's cars<font color="#E5E5E5"> and took it off</font>

1163
00:45:55,050 --> 00:45:58,920
inspected it was it was a hit card you

1164
00:45:57,060 --> 00:46:00,990
know standard access card it's got a

1165
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:02,640
series of numbers on the back I think

1166
00:46:00,990 --> 00:46:05,790
it's a 6-digit number in this case you

1167
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:08,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> two</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> three</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> four</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> five six what</font>

1168
00:46:05,790 --> 00:46:09,840
was happening was that the facilities

1169
00:46:08,310 --> 00:46:11,279
team knew that this was a dual factor

1170
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:13,830
authentication place they had to wish

1171
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:15,990
you a card and a pin number so they were

1172
00:46:13,830 --> 00:46:18,390
issuing the last four digits of the six

1173
00:46:15,990 --> 00:46:21,149
digit number on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> card so your dual</font>

1174
00:46:18,390 --> 00:46:23,970
factor has suddenly become single factor

1175
00:46:21,150 --> 00:46:25,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">and would hang on a minute so we tried</font>

1176
00:46:23,970 --> 00:46:27,200
that three or four times each everybody

1177
00:46:25,470 --> 00:46:30,209
he walked through took their ID badge

1178
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:32,549
type the number in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> door opened that</font>

1179
00:46:30,210 --> 00:46:35,099
was based on nothing a puff the very

1180
00:46:32,549 --> 00:46:37,349
cynical thoughts that<font color="#E5E5E5"> no it's not it's</font>

1181
00:46:35,099 --> 00:46:39,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">perfect you know so the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Gutfeld does</font>

1182
00:46:37,349 --> 00:46:41,549
work you know on occasion you know not

1183
00:46:39,690 --> 00:46:46,200
as reliable as a nose but always worth

1184
00:46:41,549 --> 00:46:48,450
following up<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right this is where I</font>

1185
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:50,098
win a five-pound bet from someone in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1186
00:46:48,450 --> 00:46:51,359
audience you know who you are because I

1187
00:46:50,099 --> 00:46:54,569
managed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get an asshole into my</font>

1188
00:46:51,359 --> 00:46:58,078
presentation not in front of my

1189
00:46:54,569 --> 00:47:00,750
presentation on the presentation so this

1190
00:46:58,079 --> 00:47:03,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">is this is what it is if it smells like</font>

1191
00:47:00,750 --> 00:47:05,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's it's then it really</font>

1192
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:09,299
probably is and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you need to</font>

1193
00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:11,880
follow up on it<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it's it's this is</font>

1194
00:47:09,299 --> 00:47:14,759
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> to people being over specific</font>

1195
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:17,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">in their responses yes we have a</font>

1196
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:20,190
disaster recovery test carried out every

1197
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:22,529
year you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is more than that this</font>

1198
00:47:20,190 --> 00:47:27,180
is saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> that when they actually quite</font>

1199
00:47:22,529 --> 00:47:29,579
blatantly don't it could be verbal it

1200
00:47:27,180 --> 00:47:30,950
could be falsified evidence you know it

1201
00:47:29,579 --> 00:47:34,020
could be evidence that is easily

1202
00:47:30,950 --> 00:47:37,078
falsifiable for instance so a text print

1203
00:47:34,020 --> 00:47:38,910
out of email chains you know with yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1204
00:47:37,079 --> 00:47:40,980
approve this document on this date blah

1205
00:47:38,910 --> 00:47:43,020
blah blah you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> you need to look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

1206
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:46,319
for stuff that is blatantly not true or

1207
00:47:43,020 --> 00:47:48,630
not supportable the other thing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

1208
00:47:46,319 --> 00:47:50,730
the exchanging of looks between people

1209
00:47:48,630 --> 00:47:55,170
you know when you ask a<font color="#CCCCCC"> question or</font>

1210
00:47:50,730 --> 00:47:57,660
something yes we do that that's going to

1211
00:47:55,170 --> 00:48:00,450
tell you something that that's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1212
00:47:57,660 --> 00:48:02,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">whole truth that you're listening</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

1213
00:48:00,450 --> 00:48:05,189
other thing here is body language as

1214
00:48:02,250 --> 00:48:07,230
well you know the<font color="#E5E5E5"> UM</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the neuro</font>

1215
00:48:05,190 --> 00:48:10,349
linguistic programming says that if

1216
00:48:07,230 --> 00:48:11,940
you're right handed and if you're asked

1217
00:48:10,349 --> 00:48:14,000
to recount something and you look up

1218
00:48:11,940 --> 00:48:17,220
until<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're right you are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> visually</font>

1219
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:18,869
reconstructing the images or sorry

1220
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:20,970
visually constructing the images which

1221
00:48:18,869 --> 00:48:22,170
basically means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you're lying you're</font>

1222
00:48:20,970 --> 00:48:24,058
making<font color="#E5E5E5"> it up and if you're looking up</font>

1223
00:48:22,170 --> 00:48:26,490
and to the left is you<font color="#E5E5E5"> recount something</font>

1224
00:48:24,059 --> 00:48:29,579
you're you're basically drawing that

1225
00:48:26,490 --> 00:48:31,439
down from memory now how how real that

1226
00:48:29,579 --> 00:48:33,390
is and how efficient that is and how

1227
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:34,950
accurate that is you know I leave<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1228
00:48:33,390 --> 00:48:36,660
individual folks

1229
00:48:34,950 --> 00:48:38,220
you know we all have<font color="#CCCCCC"> our own you know</font>

1230
00:48:36,660 --> 00:48:40,140
thoughts about NLP and things like that

1231
00:48:38,220 --> 00:48:41,549
I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's a certain you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

1232
00:48:40,140 --> 00:48:43,799
elements of truth in it and when you

1233
00:48:41,550 --> 00:48:46,349
<font color="#CCCCCC">combine it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with other factors I think</font>

1234
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:47,730
it's worth bearing in mind the other

1235
00:48:46,349 --> 00:48:50,099
thing as well as the<font color="#E5E5E5"> change in a body</font>

1236
00:48:47,730 --> 00:48:51,810
position yes turning slightly away

1237
00:48:50,099 --> 00:48:54,180
covering the body things like that

1238
00:48:51,810 --> 00:48:55,770
you're creating<font color="#E5E5E5"> a defensive position I</font>

1239
00:48:54,180 --> 00:48:58,828
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> you to stop I'm shielding myself</font>

1240
00:48:55,770 --> 00:49:02,520
away<font color="#CCCCCC"> from your questions is another been</font>

1241
00:48:58,829 --> 00:49:04,500
a kind of indicator anybody is eager to

1242
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:06,900
follow a change of topic right let's

1243
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:08,700
move on to incident management yes let's

1244
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:10,680
i think it's a really good<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fabio 60</font>

1245
00:49:08,700 --> 00:49:12,629
they're doing that because they're

1246
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:15,598
leaving dangerous ground to safe ground

1247
00:49:12,630 --> 00:49:17,609
right or even<font color="#E5E5E5"> if they're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on the</font>

1248
00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:19,490
defensive a lot to rather than on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1249
00:49:17,609 --> 00:49:22,140
offensive if you will so if somebody's

1250
00:49:19,490 --> 00:49:24,209
very defensive about what they do it's

1251
00:49:22,140 --> 00:49:27,359
because they're struggling to construct

1252
00:49:24,210 --> 00:49:30,089
a feasible and viable argument you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

1253
00:49:27,359 --> 00:49:32,279
on this on the on the move as it were

1254
00:49:30,089 --> 00:49:34,500
whereas if<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on the offensive the</font>

1255
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:36,089
people often feel more aggressive but I

1256
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:38,700
sorry more confidence in what it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1257
00:49:36,089 --> 00:49:41,190
they say<font color="#CCCCCC"> it doesn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mean you know again</font>

1258
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:42,359
as an individual indicator it's it's not

1259
00:49:41,190 --> 00:49:45,960
black or white but these are<font color="#CCCCCC"> all things</font>

1260
00:49:42,359 --> 00:49:48,630
that we can look for you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> always</font>

1261
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:53,819
focus on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the evidence but pick up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> visual</font>

1262
00:49:48,630 --> 00:49:56,010
cues from from other places as well so

1263
00:49:53,819 --> 00:49:59,190
we come to the last slide the

1264
00:49:56,010 --> 00:50:01,109
evisceration<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wrote a book recently</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> oh</font>

1265
00:49:59,190 --> 00:50:02,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">is talking about morgues and bodies and</font>

1266
00:50:01,109 --> 00:50:04,440
things like that an evisceration

1267
00:50:02,670 --> 00:50:06,990
apparently is when they slice you from

1268
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:09,420
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> chin down the throat all the way</font>

1269
00:50:06,990 --> 00:50:11,098
down to<font color="#CCCCCC"> your pubic bone here open you up</font>

1270
00:50:09,420 --> 00:50:13,490
break the ribs<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then all of your</font>

1271
00:50:11,099 --> 00:50:15,569
internal organs come out in one go

1272
00:50:13,490 --> 00:50:17,040
literally you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know because it's</font>

1273
00:50:15,569 --> 00:50:19,109
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> one long pipe effectively</font>

1274
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:20,730
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think all that in one goal is</font>

1275
00:50:19,109 --> 00:50:24,000
called a pluck which other as a

1276
00:50:20,730 --> 00:50:25,440
fascinating term there's nothing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font>

1277
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:28,500
with this<font color="#E5E5E5"> I thought</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I would just tell</font>

1278
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:30,450
you so when you get to the end of it

1279
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:31,800
because it obviously in a you know

1280
00:50:30,450 --> 00:50:33,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">visser a shin you don't put everything</font>

1281
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:36,300
back<font color="#CCCCCC"> and let's say everybody on their</font>

1282
00:50:33,390 --> 00:50:38,730
way you really do at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> end of the day</font>

1283
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:41,220
there's three things in<font color="#E5E5E5"> my opinion that</font>

1284
00:50:38,730 --> 00:50:44,190
needs that a risk<font color="#E5E5E5"> assessment or audit</font>

1285
00:50:41,220 --> 00:50:47,459
need to be in the first one is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

1286
00:50:44,190 --> 00:50:48,680
should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be collaborative educational open</font>

1287
00:50:47,460 --> 00:50:52,470
non-conference I

1288
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:54,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">non-judgmental and constructive you fit</font>

1289
00:50:52,470 --> 00:50:56,609
all of those things into<font color="#CCCCCC"> your assessment</font>

1290
00:50:54,870 --> 00:50:58,290
and you're going to come<font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with a</font>

1291
00:50:56,610 --> 00:51:01,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">positive experience that's from both</font>

1292
00:50:58,290 --> 00:51:04,800
sides of the fence here the second thing

1293
00:51:01,860 --> 00:51:07,320
is understand your role as an actor in

1294
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:10,620
the play but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're about to embark on</font>

1295
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:13,200
right and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason I say that is you</font>

1296
00:51:10,620 --> 00:51:15,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">know it could be that as an assess or as</font>

1297
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:18,359
an oddity or your your role is as a

1298
00:51:15,150 --> 00:51:20,460
mentor almost you're there to<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

1299
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:21,960
ask the<font color="#E5E5E5"> questions get the responses</font>

1300
00:51:20,460 --> 00:51:25,560
measure their risk and then help them

1301
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:26,850
out you know it's you any oddity or

1302
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:28,860
anybody<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the other side of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the table</font>

1303
00:51:26,850 --> 00:51:30,450
can learn a vast amount from people who

1304
00:51:28,860 --> 00:51:32,850
do this sort of thing for a living if

1305
00:51:30,450 --> 00:51:35,310
you will<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know and so it could be</font>

1306
00:51:32,850 --> 00:51:37,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's part of your role it could</font>

1307
00:51:35,310 --> 00:51:39,150
also be that<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you try and play that</font>

1308
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:41,220
role with everybody you're just going to

1309
00:51:39,150 --> 00:51:43,050
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> patch on eyes and offend you</font>

1310
00:51:41,220 --> 00:51:44,819
know certain people other organizations

1311
00:51:43,050 --> 00:51:47,160
you know perhaps very much more mature

1312
00:51:44,820 --> 00:51:49,470
in these spaces they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take</font>

1313
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:51,000
that the wrong way<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't patronize us</font>

1314
00:51:49,470 --> 00:51:52,709
don't tell us<font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do this just mark</font>

1315
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:55,280
we've got them you know risk assessment

1316
00:51:52,710 --> 00:51:57,600
and tell me it's right you know so

1317
00:51:55,280 --> 00:52:01,260
understand the role<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1318
00:51:57,600 --> 00:52:04,560
play in it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> finally how can you as an</font>

1319
00:52:01,260 --> 00:52:07,470
assess or an assessee improve without

1320
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:11,279
feedback the end of every single

1321
00:52:07,470 --> 00:52:13,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">assessment you need to exchange you know</font>

1322
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:16,110
constructive open and honest feedback

1323
00:52:13,940 --> 00:52:18,360
tell each other what worked and what

1324
00:52:16,110 --> 00:52:19,950
didn't work it's a painful experience at

1325
00:52:18,360 --> 00:52:22,200
times there's no question<font color="#E5E5E5"> about that but</font>

1326
00:52:19,950 --> 00:52:25,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can learn it doesn't matter you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

1327
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:27,779
how many gray hairs that you've got you

1328
00:52:25,020 --> 00:52:30,960
know as an auditor you can still learn

1329
00:52:27,780 --> 00:52:32,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">from people as to what expectations were</font>

1330
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:35,250
perhaps you did something<font color="#E5E5E5"> wrong you get</font>

1331
00:52:32,220 --> 00:52:36,899
very blase about how you do things you

1332
00:52:35,250 --> 00:52:39,150
know so as a closing question here I

1333
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:41,400
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a very quick one I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lost all</font>

1334
00:52:39,150 --> 00:52:42,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you who at the end of an assessment</font>

1335
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:44,340
all of you put your hand up at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

those three of you

00:52:58,789 --> 00:53:04,489
um try you<font color="#CCCCCC"> might be surprised i could</font>

1343
00:53:01,699 --> 00:53:08,029
say it can be a painful can be a painful

1344
00:53:04,489 --> 00:53:09,259
process<font color="#E5E5E5"> i am going to close their we're</font>

1345
00:53:08,029 --> 00:53:10,849
obviously have a few months<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

1346
00:53:09,259 --> 00:53:13,609
questions i believe i think we're

1347
00:53:10,849 --> 00:53:16,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">running it very tight further</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> discussion</font>

1348
00:53:13,609 --> 00:53:19,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">i'm available that these addresses that</font>

1349
00:53:16,130 --> 00:53:21,829
are very blurry from where i am and i

1350
00:53:19,519 --> 00:53:24,019
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> my KPI was pretty good i had one</font>

1351
00:53:21,829 --> 00:53:25,849
person asleep who woke up<font color="#CCCCCC"> half way</font>

1352
00:53:24,019 --> 00:53:27,529
through<font color="#CCCCCC"> i had somebody twittering all</font>

1353
00:53:25,849 --> 00:53:30,199
the way through it and i think i lost

1354
00:53:27,529 --> 00:53:32,839
two but gained one so i think overall i

1355
00:53:30,199 --> 00:53:42,049
think it quite it went quite well thank

1356
00:53:32,839 --> 00:53:43,189
you thanks Tom yeah we've got time<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

1357
00:53:42,049 --> 00:53:47,929
prolly a couple of questions if anyone

1358
00:53:43,189 --> 00:53:59,118
wants to ask a question<font color="#CCCCCC"> of Tommy no ok</font>

1359
00:53:47,929 --> 00:54:01,039
I've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> one then oh there's one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I just</font>

1360
00:53:59,119 --> 00:54:03,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">had a question our last year I did a</font>

1361
00:54:01,039 --> 00:54:05,419
couple of audits and they're a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font>

1362
00:54:03,409 --> 00:54:07,699
the times the<font color="#E5E5E5"> staff for bitching about</font>

1363
00:54:05,419 --> 00:54:09,288
each other and I just and they spent

1364
00:54:07,699 --> 00:54:10,729
hours and hours saying but this isn't it

1365
00:54:09,289 --> 00:54:12,799
doesn't do this this<font color="#E5E5E5"> person doesn't do</font>

1366
00:54:10,729 --> 00:54:14,689
that is that is that do you have you had

1367
00:54:12,799 --> 00:54:16,969
that experience or is that kind of semi

1368
00:54:14,689 --> 00:54:18,618
normal or<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wouldn't say it's fairly</font>

1369
00:54:16,969 --> 00:54:19,999
normal i have had that experience and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

1370
00:54:18,619 --> 00:54:21,349
think that's part of actually trying to

1371
00:54:19,999 --> 00:54:23,448
<font color="#E5E5E5">get under the skin of what's actually</font>

1372
00:54:21,349 --> 00:54:24,619
causing their problems if they're

1373
00:54:23,449 --> 00:54:26,179
bitching at each other chance to have

1374
00:54:24,619 --> 00:54:29,839
their bitching at each other<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're in</font>

1375
00:54:26,179 --> 00:54:31,429
my opinion and without sort of seeing a

1376
00:54:29,839 --> 00:54:34,609
situation that they're probably

1377
00:54:31,429 --> 00:54:36,380
frustrated by external factors that they

1378
00:54:34,609 --> 00:54:38,419
can't deal with and so they kind of turn

1379
00:54:36,380 --> 00:54:40,789
on themselves you know injured animals

1380
00:54:38,419 --> 00:54:43,009
as it were you know so and that's when

1381
00:54:40,789 --> 00:54:45,229
you need to come in as that sort of

1382
00:54:43,009 --> 00:54:47,269
mentor role as well and try and pick

1383
00:54:45,229 --> 00:54:49,669
apart what<font color="#CCCCCC"> it what it is that's causing</font>

1384
00:54:47,269 --> 00:54:52,368
these problems you know because the more

1385
00:54:49,669 --> 00:54:54,408
you the more you're able to again

1386
00:54:52,369 --> 00:54:55,609
empathize with them the more they

1387
00:54:54,409 --> 00:54:57,199
actually might tell you what the real

1388
00:54:55,609 --> 00:54:58,578
problem is rather than just what he

1389
00:54:57,199 --> 00:54:59,869
didn't do this anywhere in these crap at

1390
00:54:58,579 --> 00:55:02,419
risk<font color="#E5E5E5"> assessments</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't know why he's</font>

1391
00:54:59,869 --> 00:55:05,029
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the first place you know it</font>

1392
00:55:02,419 --> 00:55:07,339
trying to get<font color="#CCCCCC"> out the playground and you</font>

1393
00:55:05,029 --> 00:55:15,169
know into into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the staff room a little</font>

1394
00:55:07,339 --> 00:55:19,659
bit more any others<font color="#CCCCCC"> yet I've just got</font>

1395
00:55:15,169 --> 00:55:21,739
one time it was interesting that I think

1396
00:55:19,659 --> 00:55:23,299
you know a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of Packers will talk</font>

1397
00:55:21,739 --> 00:55:25,519
about social engineering techniques and

1398
00:55:23,299 --> 00:55:27,019
I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> was really interesting to get</font>

1399
00:55:25,519 --> 00:55:29,178
a slightly different take on that and

1400
00:55:27,019 --> 00:55:31,908
how those soft skills you know can

1401
00:55:29,179 --> 00:55:34,429
really be a skill that you know we can

1402
00:55:31,909 --> 00:55:37,819
all learn on in your<font color="#E5E5E5"> experience speaking</font>

1403
00:55:34,429 --> 00:55:40,789
to other Assessors how much do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you think</font>

1404
00:55:37,819 --> 00:55:43,640
that's something that's understood or do

1405
00:55:40,789 --> 00:55:45,739
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think you you know you've you</font>

1406
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:47,959
understand that<font color="#E5E5E5"> but there's still a long</font>

1407
00:55:45,739 --> 00:55:49,579
way to go yeah i think it's it's a good

1408
00:55:47,959 --> 00:55:51,529
point i<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that's one of the reasons</font>

1409
00:55:49,579 --> 00:55:53,659
why i put this together in this way and

1410
00:55:51,529 --> 00:55:56,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">i think there's an awful lot of people</font>

1411
00:55:53,659 --> 00:55:59,869
<font color="#CCCCCC">who go out and wave their</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> iso27001 lead</font>

1412
00:55:56,630 --> 00:56:03,109
order to a piece of paper around and say

1413
00:55:59,869 --> 00:56:05,850
I'm an auditor<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can do this and it's</font>

1414
00:56:03,109 --> 00:56:07,799
it's effectively they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> box ticking</font>

1415
00:56:05,850 --> 00:56:09,600
at the end of the day<font color="#E5E5E5"> nothing</font>

1416
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:12,750
necessarily wrong with that in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the right</font>

1417
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:15,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">place my my approach on this is that you</font>

1418
00:56:12,750 --> 00:56:17,940
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> more you get far more you get a more</font>

1419
00:56:15,420 --> 00:56:21,240
holistic view of what it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you're</font>

1420
00:56:17,940 --> 00:56:23,340
assessing and also with the standard and

1421
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:24,750
if you g<font color="#E5E5E5"> scone as a box ticker the</font>

1422
00:56:23,340 --> 00:56:27,240
people on the other side of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> table</font>

1423
00:56:24,750 --> 00:56:31,050
know what boxes you need to tick and

1424
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:32,160
we'll play<font color="#CCCCCC"> that game against you if you</font>

1425
00:56:31,050 --> 00:56:34,740
see what I<font color="#CCCCCC"> mean whereas if you're</font>

1426
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:37,020
looking at things from different areas

1427
00:56:34,740 --> 00:56:38,819
you're going to find out things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1428
00:56:37,020 --> 00:56:40,710
they might not necessarily want you to

1429
00:56:38,820 --> 00:56:42,030
find<font color="#E5E5E5"> out you know because as soon as you</font>

1430
00:56:40,710 --> 00:56:43,230
ask for the risk assessment I'll slap

1431
00:56:42,030 --> 00:56:44,910
the risk assessment down so you asked

1432
00:56:43,230 --> 00:56:46,860
for this stuff slap that down rather

1433
00:56:44,910 --> 00:56:48,810
than actually how do you<font color="#CCCCCC"> do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your risk</font>

1434
00:56:46,860 --> 00:56:51,000
assessments and watch them squirm you

1435
00:56:48,810 --> 00:56:52,350
know that sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of thing yeah there was</font>

1436
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:55,140
one sorry did that answer your question

1437
00:56:52,350 --> 00:56:58,380
I think there's one<font color="#E5E5E5"> more up there and I</font>

1438
00:56:55,140 --> 00:57:01,350
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> see Brian's itching to get on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

1439
00:56:58,380 --> 00:57:02,640
found with<font color="#E5E5E5"> them with a box-ticking most</font>

1440
00:57:01,350 --> 00:57:04,830
of the orders<font color="#CCCCCC"> that come and do that</font>

1441
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:07,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">anyways and it's the odd saying of</font>

1442
00:57:04,830 --> 00:57:10,920
kittens<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't cats and we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you as</font>

1444
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:15,870
<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bethel's brains yes</font>

1445
00:57:13,470 --> 00:57:17,730
and you they don't you don't get a

1446
00:57:15,870 --> 00:57:22,319
comeback from them you know when you do

1447
00:57:17,730 --> 00:57:26,640
that how how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get around it as an</font>

1448
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:28,320
auditor by bit by<font color="#E5E5E5"> plain dumb sorry I</font>

1449
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:31,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't stand that can you explain answer</font>

1450
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:34,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">me again so yeah that's what that's what</font>

1451
00:57:31,020 --> 00:57:37,080
you said yeah so it worked didn't it

1452
00:57:34,230 --> 00:57:38,730
yeah look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I thank you of course</font>

1453
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:41,549
because most of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them come from the</font>

1454
00:57:38,730 --> 00:57:43,770
finance services yeah and as long as you

1455
00:57:41,550 --> 00:57:46,740
can prove with the other finance system

1456
00:57:43,770 --> 00:57:49,380
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the the the logins you know for</font>

1457
00:57:46,740 --> 00:57:51,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">the last sort of year on the finance</font>

1458
00:57:49,380 --> 00:57:52,980
system that usually happy and they<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font>

1459
00:57:51,450 --> 00:57:54,990
really care<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the race just taking</font>

1460
00:57:52,980 --> 00:57:56,940
the rest<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the boxes yeah absolutely</font>

1461
00:57:54,990 --> 00:57:59,040
and again to reiterate I think it's

1462
00:57:56,940 --> 00:58:00,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">asking those dumb questions and say I'm</font>

1463
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:02,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">sorry I don't understand can you can you</font>

1464
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:04,140
say that again in words of one syllable

1465
00:58:02,100 --> 00:58:05,790
I'm just I'm just a dumb auditor you

1466
00:58:04,140 --> 00:58:08,100
know work<font color="#CCCCCC"> with me here you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cuz</font>

1467
00:58:05,790 --> 00:58:10,140
unless I understand it I can't write<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

1468
00:58:08,100 --> 00:58:13,350
up as a pass do you not i mean it's it's

1469
00:58:10,140 --> 00:58:14,759
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> I say keep asking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the questions at</font>

1470
00:58:13,350 --> 00:58:16,890
the maximum from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the minimum they'll</font>

1471
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:18,450
give you<font color="#CCCCCC"> the minimum with as many tier</font>

1472
00:58:16,890 --> 00:58:19,049
ladies and as wrapped up and as much

1473
00:58:18,450 --> 00:58:20,490
confusing

1474
00:58:19,050 --> 00:58:22,860
 as possible just to try and<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

1475
00:58:20,490 --> 00:58:25,649
you to<font color="#E5E5E5"> move on where is it your job as</font>

1476
00:58:22,860 --> 00:58:27,270
an auditor or an Assessor to really pick

1477
00:58:25,650 --> 00:58:30,630
them up let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me get this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> straight are you</font>

1478
00:58:27,270 --> 00:58:33,180
saying that XYZ no no no right do it

1479
00:58:30,630 --> 00:58:35,730
again try using a different word you

1480
00:58:33,180 --> 00:58:39,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">know rather than an experienced order to</font>

1481
00:58:35,730 --> 00:58:41,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">won't get put off with that really you</font>

1482
00:58:39,120 --> 00:58:43,740
know they are this is this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not me</font>

1483
00:58:41,550 --> 00:58:45,810
saying that<font color="#E5E5E5"> any</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all auditors are wrong</font>

1484
00:58:43,740 --> 00:58:47,580
and we have to do it this way these are

1485
00:58:45,810 --> 00:58:49,200
just separate sets of tools an

1486
00:58:47,580 --> 00:58:50,640
experience in order to will pick up on

1487
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:52,410
that straightaway you know they'll pick

1488
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:55,440
up on the fact that somebody's you know

1489
00:58:52,410 --> 00:58:59,850
well somebody's waving their rectum at

1490
00:58:55,440 --> 00:59:02,280
them to<font color="#CCCCCC"> try and put them off does that</font>

1491
00:58:59,850 --> 00:59:05,970
answer<font color="#E5E5E5"> there was one at the back as well</font>

1492
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:11,300
sorry Brian if it's very quick<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

1493
00:59:05,970 --> 00:59:13,620
joining<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am troubles i seem to have is</font>

1494
00:59:11,300 --> 00:59:15,030
anything that people find difficult and

1495
00:59:13,620 --> 00:59:17,549
barely falls under the<font color="#E5E5E5"> banner of</font>

1496
00:59:15,030 --> 00:59:20,250
security and you'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> get to an audit and</font>

1497
00:59:17,550 --> 00:59:21,840
they'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> throw absolutely anything they</font>

1498
00:59:20,250 --> 00:59:23,790
think you might be able to help<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

1499
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:26,520
that I can't find an acceptable way of

1500
00:59:23,790 --> 00:59:29,160
saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not the bin I'm not here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1501
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:32,630
do everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you can't be asked to</font>

1502
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:35,549
do basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> you mean as an auditor yeah</font>

1503
00:59:32,630 --> 00:59:36,810
yeah I think it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a challenging one</font>

1504
00:59:35,550 --> 00:59:38,640
you're actually right part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that is</font>

1505
00:59:36,810 --> 00:59:41,040
identifying that scope in the first

1506
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:42,150
place<font color="#E5E5E5"> and know what's going on I'm kind</font>

1507
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:44,400
of thinking that's probably more from an

1508
00:59:42,150 --> 00:59:47,400
internal perspective looking at internal

1509
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:49,850
teams so you do the key to that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

1510
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:51,720
knowing the games that people play

1511
00:59:49,850 --> 00:59:53,310
understanding the environment<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1512
00:59:51,720 --> 00:59:55,169
they're working in and therefore why

1513
00:59:53,310 --> 00:59:57,750
they're pulling in everything else and

1514
00:59:55,170 --> 01:00:00,390
making<font color="#E5E5E5"> it your problem</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and also trying</font>

1515
00:59:57,750 --> 01:00:02,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">to say that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this this isn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a security</font>

1516
01:00:00,390 --> 01:00:04,170
problem i can write<font color="#CCCCCC"> that up in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1517
01:00:02,490 --> 01:00:06,930
report and if your reports are not being

1518
01:00:04,170 --> 01:00:11,820
taken seriously then change jobs<font color="#E5E5E5"> change</font>

1519
01:00:06,930 --> 01:00:14,220
companies<font color="#E5E5E5"> right but and letting them go</font>

1520
01:00:11,820 --> 01:00:16,670
back with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> report as leverage and I</font>

1521
01:00:14,220 --> 01:00:19,709
use that term a couple of times<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it in</font>

1522
01:00:16,670 --> 01:00:22,380
just recently as leverage to say look

1523
01:00:19,710 --> 01:00:24,120
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not our problem you know you're</font>

1524
01:00:22,380 --> 01:00:26,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">making it my problem and I'm trying to</font>

1525
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:28,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">make it the auditors problem it's not</font>

1526
01:00:26,250 --> 01:00:30,930
our problem it's yours or its Jeff so

1527
01:00:28,920 --> 01:00:31,559
it's you know Marjorie and finances or

1528
01:00:30,930 --> 01:00:34,038
what

1529
01:00:31,559 --> 01:00:36,239
so it's yeah you're absolutely

1530
01:00:34,039 --> 01:00:39,089
challenging it's trying to understand

1531
01:00:36,239 --> 01:00:41,489
and pick out and understand that scope

1532
01:00:39,089 --> 01:00:43,439
your universe as it were in the first

1533
01:00:41,489 --> 01:00:45,029
place so<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't try and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> shut it down mid</font>

1534
01:00:43,439 --> 01:00:47,399
audit just rest it in the report

1535
01:00:45,029 --> 01:00:49,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">absolutely absolutely i mean there's</font>

1536
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:51,390
shutting it down is two ways<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1537
01:00:49,890 --> 01:00:52,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">shut it down because actually you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

1538
01:00:51,390 --> 01:00:56,129
don't want to waste too much time on it

1539
01:00:52,650 --> 01:00:58,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">but if these are genuine grievances and</font>

1540
01:00:56,130 --> 01:01:00,869
