00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,830
my name is Jimmy Blake and I'm one of

2
00:00:03,179 --> 00:00:06,298
<font color="#CCCCCC">the organizers of security be sized</font>

3
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:08,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">London things I mean I've been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> involved</font>

4
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:10,139
in the information security industry for

5
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:12,540
a couple of decades now in various

6
00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:14,700
different positions and<font color="#E5E5E5"> besides is the</font>

7
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:16,650
first time I've really<font color="#CCCCCC"> seen an effort to</font>

8
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:18,869
build a community that embraces all

9
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:22,528
sides of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the information security</font>

10
00:00:18,869 --> 00:00:23,880
spectrum so both risk<font color="#CCCCCC"> people and you</font>

11
00:00:22,529 --> 00:00:27,420
know the people that like to break stuff

12
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:28,859
as well well I mean last year you know

13
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:31,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">there were a lot of lessons learned it</font>

14
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:33,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">was an absolutely amazing event and you</font>

15
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:35,460
know we really<font color="#E5E5E5"> pulled a rabbit out of</font>

16
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,989
the hat but this year you know we're

17
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:39,059
moving forward<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the lessons that we</font>

18
00:00:36,989 --> 00:00:41,578
learned from<font color="#E5E5E5"> last year too much bigger</font>

19
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:43,890
venue it's a much more<font color="#E5E5E5"> impressive venue</font>

20
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:46,620
there's been real efforts to bridge the

21
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:49,289
<font color="#CCCCCC">gap between the risk people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and the</font>

22
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:51,030
security people and you know reaching

23
00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:53,190
out to other organizations and things

24
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:55,379
like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> so this year you know the year</font>

25
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:56,940
the Olympics the year of London this is

26
00:00:55,379 --> 00:01:00,210
really going to be the b-sides<font color="#CCCCCC"> it sets</font>

27
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:02,370
the standard I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think well</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean when</font>

28
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:05,489
this building first one happened the the

29
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:08,130
1960s it represented us bold new vision

30
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:09,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">of London which was very divisive at the</font>

31
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:12,089
time you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people didn't like</font>

32
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:13,798
modern architecture but it stood the

33
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:16,530
test of time there's an absolutely

34
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:18,000
iconic building and and it's the same

35
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:21,509
<font color="#CCCCCC">thing with b-sides yeah there's a lot of</font>

36
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">people pushing back against yo did the</font>

37
00:01:21,509 --> 00:01:25,890
new tide of the voice that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's giving</font>

38
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:27,869
the community and things like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I</font>

39
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:30,119
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is absolutely the right venue</font>

40
00:01:27,869 --> 00:01:32,400
to have plus we're supporting the City

41
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:35,100
of London supporting an iconic building

42
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,350
in London is really important to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do that</font>

43
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:41,699
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think now I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really looking forward</font>

44
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:43,320
to this<font color="#E5E5E5"> year you know more on the risk</font>

45
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:44,850
side I mean that that's the side of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

46
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:48,869
business that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I come from now you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

47
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:51,149
as an X<font color="#E5E5E5"> C so I'm really interested in</font>

48
00:01:48,869 --> 00:01:54,180
the fact that there's a balance of risk

49
00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:56,850
management<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you know you can't always</font>

50
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:59,969
do everything that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're being told to</font>

51
00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:01,469
fix by the people at breaking stuff so

52
00:01:59,969 --> 00:02:04,110
I'm really<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking forward to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this year</font>

53
00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:06,600
who's trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get the what are often</font>

54
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:08,818
very polarized sides of information

55
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:10,649
security to talk to<font color="#E5E5E5"> each other and start</font>

56
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:12,629
to understand the issues that each other

57
00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:13,630
have so the wrist size the business the

58
00:02:12,629 --> 00:02:16,060
people that have

59
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:18,390
to keep systems up and running but

60
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:21,370
manage risk is a part of an overall

61
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:22,630
business strategy along<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the people</font>

62
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:24,550
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are actually you know on the</font>

63
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:26,079
cutting edge of finding threats and

64
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:27,550
vulnerabilities and things like that

65
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,230
getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> these two people to work</font>

66
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:30,820
together in a way that should really

67
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:33,970
benefit information security community

68
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:36,519
as a whole so<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> find out more about</font>
