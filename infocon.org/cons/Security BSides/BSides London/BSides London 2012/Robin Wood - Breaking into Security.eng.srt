tools blog basically anything to do with

12
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:43,580
hacking a lot of Wi-Fi stuff and a fair

13
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:47,720
bit of web app as well and so what's

14
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:50,510
this project about well<font color="#E5E5E5"> I get a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

15
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:53,660
these emails either two lists or in

16
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:55,820
forums or send directly to me I'd like

17
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:59,599
<font color="#CCCCCC">to get a job insecurity how do I get</font>

18
00:00:55,820 --> 00:01:01,730
started or what programming language do

19
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:04,040
I need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to learn to be a pen tester or</font>

20
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:07,070
the other on what certification should<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

21
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:09,909
get and generally these questions are

22
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:11,990
sent to me directly I try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> answer them</font>

23
00:01:09,909 --> 00:01:15,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">but obviously it gets quite inefficient</font>

24
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:17,869
and answer the same thing sort of once a

25
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:22,250
month or so in some fashion or another

26
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:23,690
so can I put well it's inefficient what

27
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:25,370
about sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of trying to put some actual</font>

28
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:28,490
stats together it's also quite biased

29
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:31,360
I'm a pen tester I've got a<font color="#CCCCCC"> background</font>

30
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:34,250
in web app security or in web apps I

31
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:36,590
generally program in Ruby so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask</font>

32
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:39,770
me how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> I get in security I'll tell</font>

33
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:41,990
you start off<font color="#E5E5E5"> in programming learn Ruby</font>

34
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:47,030
and do some web app stuff maybe bit

35
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:50,119
Wi-Fi completely biased so so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> time</font>

36
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:53,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">consuming inefficient so I figured let's</font>

37
00:01:50,119 --> 00:01:56,270
ask community and try and get some kind

38
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:58,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">of definitive answer um because that way</font>

39
00:01:56,270 --> 00:02:01,369
people can't sort of flame when I say

40
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:03,799
yeah learn Ruby you'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> get dozen other</font>

41
00:02:01,369 --> 00:02:06,140
people going Ruby why learn Ruby no no

42
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:08,360
you want to learn Python you want to

43
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:10,580
learn bash you won't learn whatever so I

44
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:14,810
figured<font color="#CCCCCC"> if a lot of people answer it and</font>

45
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:16,459
we get majority opinion then people

46
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:17,120
can't really turn around and complain or

47
00:02:16,459 --> 00:02:18,799
the calendar

48
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,840
but at least you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can say well that's</font>

49
00:02:18,799 --> 00:02:27,560
what people in general think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not</font>

50
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:31,099
just my opinion this time so I set<font color="#CCCCCC"> up a</font>

51
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:33,890
survey and started offering to play with

52
00:02:31,099 --> 00:02:35,298
SurveyMonkey and the free version but I

53
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:37,279
quickly<font color="#E5E5E5"> found it is actually quite</font>

54
00:02:35,299 --> 00:02:41,329
limited on the free version capped at<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10</font>

55
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:44,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">questions and it's a bit tricky</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> setup so</font>

56
00:02:41,329 --> 00:02:48,910
i went to google google forms google

57
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:53,200
docs<font color="#CCCCCC"> i I set up the breaking security</font>

58
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:57,980
survey<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I spam this out on every list</font>

59
00:02:53,200 --> 00:03:03,099
every podcast I could get on which ones

60
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:05,738
<font color="#E5E5E5">I do an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Eurotrash secure a bit I</font>

61
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:07,909
mentioned on risky business few others I

62
00:03:05,739 --> 00:03:10,519
like I kind of put it out to as many

63
00:03:07,909 --> 00:03:14,298
people as I could and as of last night

64
00:03:10,519 --> 00:03:17,900
I'd had about three hundred and five or

65
00:03:14,299 --> 00:03:20,840
so results so i figured that that's a

66
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:22,760
reasonable set of stats to to do some

67
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:26,950
kind of statistics from and to to

68
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:29,510
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> give some answers from and</font>

69
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:31,399
before<font color="#CCCCCC"> we get started now hopefully</font>

70
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:34,179
these videos will play if not them up to

71
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:34,180
do a bit of alts having

72
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:49,750
is it<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to work is it going to work</font>

73
00:03:52,390 --> 00:04:02,649
anything could happen oh right again

74
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:22,270
nope it doesn't look like almost to

75
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:24,130
death in Le team of high-tech thief who

76
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:26,169
infiltrated some of the most secure

77

you to the new world

00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:53,830
hackers so if you thought the second

134
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:56,710
video was what hacking is all about

135
00:07:53,830 --> 00:08:00,849
you're definitely in the wrong place I'm

136
00:07:56,710 --> 00:08:06,489
the first one yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> slightly but not very</font>

137
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:09,660
often I reality is more like<font color="#E5E5E5"> this you</font>

spend a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of time sat at a desk</font>

139
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:18,539
hopefully at your desk quite often in

<font color="#E5E5E5">datacenters freezing cold air con on and</font>

cardboard boxes in a sort of footstool

that they use to reach the high shelves

144
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:30,430
because the the server room doesn't have

145

00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:39,779
you're going to end up as you're also

148
00:08:37,779 --> 00:08:44,130
probably going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> spend a lot of time</font>

149
00:08:39,779 --> 00:08:46,959
hotel rooms unless you're really lucky

150
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:50,260
pen testing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of thing tends to</font>

151
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:52,209
be on the road on client site starts<font color="#E5E5E5"> off</font>

152
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:54,520
quite glamorous and quite nice<font color="#CCCCCC"> anything</font>

153
00:08:52,209 --> 00:08:55,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">ya get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to see the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> country and maybe get</font>

to the world different hotels on

155
00:08:55,930 --> 00:09:02,770
expenses it very soon gets stale and ask

156
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:05,020
anybody who's done it I did what four

157
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:07,540
months I'm from Sheffield<font color="#CCCCCC"> four months at</font>

158
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:09,610
Canary Wharf and<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah the first couple</font>

159
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:12,550
of weeks on full expenses brilliant and

160
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:13,959
then after that gets<font color="#E5E5E5"> annoying I would</font>

161
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:15,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">have put quite a quite a downer on the</font>

162
00:09:13,959 --> 00:09:17,380
start of this just<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that everybody</font>

163
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:20,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">gets the right idea and then sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

164
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:23,370
bring it<font color="#E5E5E5"> up a bit also quite a bit of</font>

165
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:26,380
time<font color="#E5E5E5"> in meetings and that could be</font>

166
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:28,000
meetings with clients so such things up

167
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:31,750
working out what the jobs are working

168
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,490
out what spec is you've got to<font color="#CCCCCC"> do</font>

169
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:36,070
debriefings you've got to do you've got

170
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:37,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">to work out what's gone wrong you're</font>

171
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:38,620
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to go in and occasionally</font>

172
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:41,260
apologize when you've knocked over the

173
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:43,060
wrong machine or<font color="#CCCCCC"> tech things going that</font>

174
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:46,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">you shouldn't have done so that you do</font>

175
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:49,689
tend to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a lot of time in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> meetings</font>

176
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:51,180
still interested nobody's left so that's

177
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:56,130
good

178
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:58,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so the way I did</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the survey was</font>

179
00:09:56,130 --> 00:10:00,490
first bunch of questions were kind of

180
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:03,099
like never in which we're own<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

181
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:05,829
qualitative or quantitative first bunch

182
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:08,740
got raw stats percentages that I can

183
00:10:05,829 --> 00:10:11,380
show second set were more to give your

184
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:15,810
opinion so what we're going to do is

185
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:18,790
start off with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> actual raw stats so</font>

186
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:20,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">this was I did these numbers a little</font>

187
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:22,029
bit before<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things about a weeks of</font>

188
00:10:20,649 --> 00:10:24,310
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fully up to date</font>

189
00:10:22,029 --> 00:10:25,389
believed it close enough but first

190
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:28,479
question is how long have you been in

191
00:10:25,389 --> 00:10:30,310
the industry so as you can see majority

192
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:32,470
of the people who answer the survey have

193
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:33,880
been in seven years plus so the people

194
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:37,060
are answering it are the people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who know</font>

195
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:39,160
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're talking about there we've</font>

196
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:41,619
also got a few people who just got into

197
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:44,469
it which is brilliant<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you need</font>

198
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:46,029
an overall opinion you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> just want</font>

199
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:48,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pinion</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of people have been in it</font>

200
00:10:46,029 --> 00:10:50,769
years and in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit we're going to</font>

201
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:52,449
get been up and he's just<font color="#CCCCCC"> got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

202
00:10:50,769 --> 00:10:54,449
security he's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give a quick</font>

203
00:10:52,449 --> 00:10:58,510
overview<font color="#E5E5E5"> of how he got into it and and</font>

204
00:10:54,449 --> 00:11:01,769
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of what he found and then sort of a</font>

205
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:03,670
mix of people in the middle job types

206
00:11:01,769 --> 00:11:05,230
yes these don't add up to one hundred

207
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:08,709
percent that's because you could choose

208
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:11,500
multiple options but even<font color="#E5E5E5"> though i said</font>

209
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:14,109
i<font color="#E5E5E5"> was trying it with a bios when i've</font>

210
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:16,800
set the questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm a pen tester I</font>

211
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:19,630
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of came up with more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> penta story</font>

212
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:22,990
technical kind of questions and job

213
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:27,490
roles and and that's the kind of list

214
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:28,839
site i sent it out to but as you can see

215
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:30,579
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> really get answers from a lot of</font>

216
00:11:28,839 --> 00:11:34,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">people a lot of different sectors sort</font>

217
00:11:30,579 --> 00:11:35,680
of pen testers and auditors if you don't

218
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:37,269
know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> the difference is</font>

219
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:40,000
unfortunately quite a lot the industry

220
00:11:37,269 --> 00:11:43,360
don't know either good fuses admins

221
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:45,339
policy writers quite a<font color="#E5E5E5"> few</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of those all</font>

222
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:50,230
the way down to sort of help desk people

223
00:11:45,339 --> 00:11:51,699
pci people<font color="#E5E5E5"> i also get a good split so if</font>

224
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:56,380
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> interested in any of these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> areas</font>

225
00:11:51,699 --> 00:11:57,939
hopeful of data in there for<font color="#E5E5E5"> you and the</font>

226
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:59,350
first<font color="#CCCCCC"> dash will sort of technical</font>

227
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:02,740
question do you need to be able to

228
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:04,480
program to be a pen tester I this is a

229
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:07,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">question that comes up a lot</font>

230
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:10,360
and obviously the majority<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> say no</font>

231
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:13,750
but it helps<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to somebody</font>

232
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:15,820
about this and sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> said well I most</font>

233
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:17,470
people probably think yes you do need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

234
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:19,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">be able to program so why have a lot of</font>

235
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:21,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">people said no but it helps I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think the</font>

236
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:23,320
answer<font color="#CCCCCC"> to that is a lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people in the</font>

237
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:25,660
industry can't program but they wish

238
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:27,639
they could and<font color="#E5E5E5"> those people who can't</font>

239
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:29,050
are obviously doing well they've got

240
00:12:27,639 --> 00:12:32,459
<font color="#CCCCCC">there they've got the jobs they're doing</font>

241
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:35,050
the testing but they wish they could so

242
00:12:32,459 --> 00:12:39,518
first off from these stats the answer<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

243
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:41,560
do I need to build a program is yes I do

244
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:42,519
you need to be able to program well do

245
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:45,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">you need to be able to get a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> job as a</font>

246
00:12:42,519 --> 00:12:48,190
software developer no you bit you

247
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:52,420
basically in my opinion you need to be

248
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:55,120
able to do enough to knock up a dozen

249
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:58,540
line script to maybe automate running

250
00:12:55,120 --> 00:13:04,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">something or to loop through using curly</font>

251
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:08,980
to web page 50 times or generate a set

252
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:10,540
of a to z<font color="#CCCCCC"> six times or something you</font>

253
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:13,000
basically need to be able to do basic

254
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:16,540
tasks because good thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that computers</font>

255
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,949
are at is automation everybody likes

256
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:19,569
automate things we compute if you can't

257
00:13:17,949 --> 00:13:20,800
program you can't really automate those

258
00:13:19,569 --> 00:13:26,079
casts you could do a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of things by</font>

259
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:28,959
hand so yes it does help so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next</font>

260
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:31,359
question what language surprised me a

261
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:34,149
little bit but<font color="#E5E5E5"> Python came out top</font>

262
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:36,639
followed by<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bosch and then I thought</font>

263
00:13:34,149 --> 00:13:38,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">about as well bash scripting is exactly</font>

264
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:44,639
what I've just<font color="#E5E5E5"> been talking about you</font>

265
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:47,260
short script to automate things and I

266
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:51,430
said that bash scripting is perfect for

267
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:53,980
that a Python blew away Ruby see

268
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:57,660
anything else really where I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

269
00:13:53,980 --> 00:14:03,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">would be more even split I'm Ruby biased</font>

270
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:05,889
however a quick plug security tube guy

271
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:08,050
called<font color="#CCCCCC"> Vivec he's just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> written a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> python</font>

272
00:14:05,889 --> 00:14:10,269
training course selling that online or

273
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:13,959
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get it free he's releasing it on</font>

274
00:14:10,269 --> 00:14:16,029
the next year I've signed up for it I

275
00:14:13,959 --> 00:14:17,199
can program already but I think it

276
00:14:16,029 --> 00:14:18,400
should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> really good so if you want to</font>

277
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:19,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">get into Python if you want</font>

278
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:21,819
learn to program he's<font color="#CCCCCC"> taking you</font>

279
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:24,310
completely from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the beginning upwards</font>

280
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:27,370
and that's in<font color="#CCCCCC"> pie that everybody records</font>

281
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:31,420
pythons the language to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use so very big</font>

282
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:34,180
plug for that it's about 200<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe 250</font>

283
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:36,550
dollars but I've seen his wife I course

284
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:38,949
and his other<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff the content for that</font>

285
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:41,469
was amazing I expect the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same from this</font>

286
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:42,910
so if you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> put hand in your</font>

287
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:45,040
pocket if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you don't he's releasing I</font>

288
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:46,719
think it's a video<font color="#CCCCCC"> a week or the next 52</font>

289
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:49,650
weeks so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> will get it all to take a</font>

290
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:51,820
while or the<font color="#CCCCCC"> language is in there</font>

291
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:54,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">powershell is pretty</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> handy if you're</font>

292
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:56,740
playing on windows boxes<font color="#E5E5E5"> I see the other</font>

293
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:58,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing I should just say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> um yes you need</font>

294
00:14:56,740 --> 00:15:00,850
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> build program it also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really helps be</font>

295
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:05,079
able to read programming to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

296
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:07,270
read different languages so i can't

297
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:09,430
really code in C++ I kind of know a

298
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:11,829
little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it but if I cone with some</font>

299
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:13,150
some source code I can read<font color="#E5E5E5"> through it</font>

300
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:16,690
and get a general idea of what's<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font>

301
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:18,340
on and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's really good when you turn</font>

302
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:20,470
a web app test you manage to get source

303
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:21,520
code disclosure and you get the full

304
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:23,590
source code for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the back end of the</font>

305
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:25,630
application if you can sit down with

306
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:26,920
that code and go through<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and go yet</font>

307
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:30,370
there's a back door there's an issue

308
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:32,050
there's a problem then it really helps

309
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:34,540
you might not be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to write a line of</font>

310
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:35,890
PHP but if you can read that code and go

311
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:38,610
that's where the back door is that's

312
00:15:35,890 --> 00:15:44,080
where the hole is great you're in I'm

313
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:48,130
all go down to lure and C sharp and

314
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:49,510
certifications are they useful yes and

315
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:52,540
yes to get through HR about<font color="#E5E5E5"> and even</font>

316
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:54,640
split I realized after<font color="#CCCCCC"> i did this</font>

317
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:59,469
question<font color="#E5E5E5"> i could have messed it up a</font>

318
00:15:54,640 --> 00:16:03,240
little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> um reason being a lot of</font>

319
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:05,860
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> said some of these answers yes to</font>

320
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:09,790
get through HR but some of these certs

321
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:11,070
yes in general so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how I</font>

322
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:13,810
could<font color="#E5E5E5"> have split it down a bit better</font>

323
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:18,550
but the general answer is yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> and these</font>

324
00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:20,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">are the certs so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sands and jack I think</font>

325
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:22,359
sons have got a booth here today have a

326
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:24,730
chat with them very expensive courses

327
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:26,320
but very good I've done a couple of

328
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:28,240
theirs and I know the guys who write the

329
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,560
course is really good if you can afford

330
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,690
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get on them if you can get your</font>

331
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:37,290
employers pay even<font color="#CCCCCC"> better</font>

332
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:37,290
I'm sip winds around somewhere today

333
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:43,199
from what I've heard sis peed more is

334
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:46,209
better for getting in through HR

335
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:48,430
offensive security again that's a very

336
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:51,160
good technical course most HR department

337
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:54,339
have never heard of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it but you take that</font>

338
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:56,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">to the team leaders and the the</font>

339
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:58,150
technical side<font color="#E5E5E5"> who are hiring they will</font>

340
00:16:56,770 --> 00:17:00,850
know about it if you've got the

341
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:03,699
offensive security certs you'll go up in

342
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:05,230
there their estimations and then all

343
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:07,180
those going to check team leader and

344
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:09,010
check team member I didn't expect<font color="#CCCCCC"> those</font>

345
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:11,620
to do to write very well because they're

346
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:13,300
mainly UK sorts they are moving<font color="#E5E5E5"> out to</font>

347
00:17:11,619 --> 00:17:15,520
Australia and check stock to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

348
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:19,209
American people<font color="#CCCCCC"> as well so they will</font>

349
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:21,849
become a bit more worldwide but at the

350
00:17:19,209 --> 00:17:24,370
moment they're in the UK if you can get

351
00:17:21,849 --> 00:17:27,639
your employer's put you through check

352
00:17:24,369 --> 00:17:30,389
the even team member he does help team

353
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:33,100
leader just it<font color="#E5E5E5"> really pushes up your</font>

354
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:38,620
employability on the job you could

355
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:41,949
actually do all the search yet the was

356
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:43,840
erm another there came out at 55 twenty

357
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:45,790
percent dated some others were asked

358
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:54,270
people to do a kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of free entry of</font>

359
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:57,990
what what they thought was useful and a

360
00:17:54,270 --> 00:18:01,210
lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people sort of mentioned not just</font>

361
00:17:57,990 --> 00:18:05,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">pentesting certs are useful and a</font>

362
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:07,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">certain like how to administer Microsoft</font>

363
00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:09,700
Active Directory is very handy thing to

364
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:11,860
have and I can agree with that because

365
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:15,160
if you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> add me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an active directory</font>

366
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:16,330
and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> you come to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Penn test it it's</font>

367
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:18,790
easy you know what you know where to

368
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:23,050
click in a way to look for things so any

369
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:24,700
side search you can get I did the CCNA

370
00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:26,379
never actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> owned second exam but I</font>

371
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:28,300
did that when stuff picked up on the

372
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:30,970
course and that was good something<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

373
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:32,500
also learn is particularly<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff like</font>

374
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:34,600
CCNA where they're teaching from the

375
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:37,120
book and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the not load to deviate if this</font>

376
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:39,790
was saying right this is how you do this

377
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:42,040
and you listen and you think I know

378
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:45,610
that's wrong I know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that creates this</font>

379
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:48,700
vulnerability but that course is being

380
00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:51,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">to hundreds thousands of people every</font>

381
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:52,750
day all those thousands of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

382
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:55,120
going to be making that<font color="#E5E5E5"> same mistake</font>

383
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:58,690
leaving that same hole on every machine

384
00:18:55,120 --> 00:19:00,129
they administer so if you've done<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

385
00:18:58,690 --> 00:19:02,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">course you've seen exactly where the</font>

386
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:06,490
holes are supposed to be it gives you

387
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:10,150
another way in and our conference is

388
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:13,960
worth attending yes no other yes it's

389
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:15,280
the big thing from that a lot of people

390
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:17,200
agree<font color="#CCCCCC"> with that you guys are all here</font>

391
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,549
today so if you obviously agree with it

392
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,010
but hopefully<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll do it by the end of</font>

393
00:19:18,549 --> 00:19:23,740
today if this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is your first one I</font>

394
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:25,299
definitely agree with this on what

395
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:27,730
you'll tend<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find that you first come</font>

396
00:19:25,299 --> 00:19:28,990
you'll go to a torque in every slot and

397
00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:31,299
you'll sit<font color="#E5E5E5"> there diligently and you'll</font>

after you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been to two or three khans</font>

400
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:36,160
you might go to one or two talks and you

401
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:38,980
spend<font color="#E5E5E5"> the rest of time sitting in the</font>

402
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:41,650
bar or sitting in the foyer and chatting

403
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:43,240
to people and you may get talks after on

404
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:47,049

483
00:23:26,519 --> 00:23:31,230
discriminates people who can't code so i

484
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:32,940
take that because<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a coder but I</font>

it and also the offensively yeah also

497
00:24:04,049 --> 00:24:09,869
the offensive security one highly highly

498
00:24:06,330 --> 00:24:13,230
recommend but before<font color="#CCCCCC"> I got into the</font>

499
00:24:09,869 --> 00:24:15,449
industry<font color="#E5E5E5"> of security I was a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> third line</font>

506
00:24:26,669 --> 00:24:32,690
again the more background you have the

507
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:36,720
better I how did<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get your start yeah</font>

508
00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:42,029
I used to be a pretty much left school

512
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:51,149
thing and people just<font color="#E5E5E5"> either stupid so I</font>

513
00:24:48,869 --> 00:24:53,120
dropped out of school no GCSEs I worked

514
00:24:51,149 --> 00:24:56,909
in a factory for seven years

515
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:59,429
but I used to be a software pirate so I

516
00:24:56,910 --> 00:25:01,440
added BBS<font color="#CCCCCC"> my people on the internet</font>

517
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:03,720
people used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to phone up but I had to</font>

518
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:05,820
have a front end so to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it cool I</font>

519
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:07,290
had like<font color="#E5E5E5"> text files and stuff so as to</font>

520
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:09,929
research these<font color="#E5E5E5"> text files and do stuff</font>

521
00:25:07,290 --> 00:25:12,240
and then I got<font color="#CCCCCC"> into like war dialing and</font>

522
00:25:09,930 --> 00:25:17,970
messing around nothing illegal but

523
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:19,770
touching the legal side and then one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

524
00:25:17,970 --> 00:25:21,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">my friends got busted so I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just picked</font>

526
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:27,000
so I don't get<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the video at the start</font>

527
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:29,070
yeah so I dumped all my video all my

528
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:33,540
stuff but I don't investigate the

529
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:36,929
security side so I then moved out from

530
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:38,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">Wigan move back down south and I still</font>

532
00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:41,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">helpdesk support engineer so I applied</font>

533
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:45,419
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the job pretty</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good with computers</font>

534
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:47,790
and my IT career started off then it

535
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:49,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">build up going from going into</font>

537
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:54,180
moving up up and up but because I<font color="#CCCCCC"> mess</font>

538
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:56,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">around</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> security helping a customer</font>

539
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:59,610
security I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to do different</font>

540
00:25:56,460 --> 00:26:01,560
things but there luckily this opened up

541
00:25:59,610 --> 00:26:03,449
for help desk person support person

542
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:05,520
supported security products so I got on

543
00:26:03,450 --> 00:26:08,550
there so<font color="#E5E5E5"> but using my background as a</font>

544
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:10,470
security researcher I was able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take</font>

545
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:12,990
my security skills and help improve the

546
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:14,460
products<font color="#E5E5E5"> and finding exploits and</font>

00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:17,250
finding ways to defend the exploits with

548
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:18,840
the products right that what you'll find

549
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:21,930
is a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people who've been in the</font>

550
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:24,750

551
00:26:21,930 --> 00:26:27,660
years tend to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it that way it's</font>

552
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:30,300
stuff that they firm they've<font color="#E5E5E5"> had an</font>

553
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:34,260
interest they've generally been sit out

554
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:36,780
means or some other kind of in other

555
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:40,770
part of IT on this slowly moved across

556
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:42,180
they've used their interests and people

557
00:26:40,770 --> 00:26:44,820
have recognized it or the base which

558
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:46,590
force themselves into roles and that's

559
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:48,120
good where to move in there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

560
00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:49,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">people now I find coming through</font>

there are people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who are so saying well</font>

564
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:58,470
you've not really got the background you

565
00:26:56,700 --> 00:27:00,480
don't know how to admin a network or<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

566
00:26:58,470 --> 00:27:03,600
machine if you can't do that how can you

567
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:04,980
actually do a proper pen test so it's

568
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,540
kind of it's a bit up in the air as to

569
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:08,130
how it will work out

570
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:09,720
the university courses are only just

571
00:27:08,130 --> 00:27:11,670
starting to spit people out we'll see

572
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:14,960
how if you go in the industry because i

573
00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:17,160
did have 15 years<font color="#CCCCCC"> of is the tities a</font>

574
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:21,030
consultancy before i go into security

575
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:22,170
yeah I am that old yes I what one piece

576
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:26,570
of advice<font color="#E5E5E5"> would you give to somebody</font>

577
00:27:22,170 --> 00:27:29,550
starting out my bump advice would be to

578
00:27:26,570 --> 00:27:32,399
speak to people get onto<font color="#E5E5E5"> Twitter go to</font>

579
00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:35,790
conferences if you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually live in</font>

580
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:40,800
experience I to security I think it's a

581
00:27:35,790 --> 00:27:43,020
great great job to do but it's not as

582
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:44,460
easy as<font color="#E5E5E5"> and exciting as Robin</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> has said</font>

583
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:46,710
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> trying to meet people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and get</font>

584
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:48,270
information from them with actually help

585
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:51,450
you get and know what such out there

586
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:54,270
yeah generally there's two ways you can

587
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:58,410
look at some sort of security as a job

588
00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:59,940
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> can either be a job 925</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you go in you</font>

589
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:04,160

590
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:06,870
that's it or it can<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a passion and</font>

591
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:11,550
other than<font color="#E5E5E5"> about you probably is but I</font>

603
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:41,700

609
00:28:55,440 --> 00:29:03,390
systems that aren't your own definitely

610
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:06,180
no no<font color="#E5E5E5"> i don't know if i should carry on</font>

611
00:29:03,390 --> 00:29:07,320
and say that's nothing yeah we've got

612
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:11,850
some other<font color="#E5E5E5"> people's answers to that</font>

614
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:17,760
whenever that was all time you could get

615
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:18,790
away with it now<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't think you can't</font>

616
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:22,390
no I

617
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:24,639
one I actually have an experience if you

618
00:29:22,390 --> 00:29:25,750
actually see my website and follow me on

619
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:28,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">Twitter you might have heard somebody</font>

620
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:31,690
asking<font color="#E5E5E5"> though sort of somebody</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> say what</font>

621
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:34,959
me reply and that I didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

622
00:29:31,690 --> 00:29:37,660
permissions but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> paid my tax I actually</font>

623
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:41,520
found a<font color="#E5E5E5"> phone bility in westpark shins</font>

624
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:45,100
website and it's an SQL injection I

625
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:47,250
didn't test it<font color="#E5E5E5"> I found it by accident so</font>

626
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:49,719
I think if you're using a website or

627
00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:52,750
you're like me let's pay my council tax

628
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:54,820
it logged on and it gave me<font color="#CCCCCC"> an SQL</font>

629
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:57,130
injection error I wasn't testing the

630
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:59,230
website but<font color="#E5E5E5"> then I did inform him so I</font>

631
00:29:57,130 --> 00:30:02,410
believe it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're actually using a</font>

632
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:04,870
site there's no<font color="#E5E5E5"> harm yeah looking and it</font>

633
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:08,110
depends on who you informed yeah as the

634
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:12,010
big<font color="#CCCCCC"> caissons in Australia recently some</font>

635
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:14,590
guy against pension company the URL<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

636
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:17,470
I ID equals one two three four and he

637
00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:19,030
went what if I go on to 350 that's the

638
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:21,370
next person's pension and the next

639
00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:23,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">person's pension and he reported it and</font>

640
00:30:21,370 --> 00:30:26,500
they got the federal police<font color="#E5E5E5"> on him a</font>

641
00:30:23,710 --> 00:30:28,360
look the federal police went yes stupid

642
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:30,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can't do that and then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you'd up</font>

643
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:33,699
doing the pension company instead of him

644
00:30:30,810 --> 00:30:35,260
so all the companies are really good at

645
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:37,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">it I reports of vulnerability in</font>

646
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:39,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">spideroak recently and they've worked</font>

647
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:40,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">really well they've sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of come back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

648
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:42,360
miss a gear we're looking at it we take

649
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:45,250
it seriously they're quite happy to take

650
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:47,830
issues so if you do find things be

651
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:50,190
careful who you report it to maybe get a

652
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:57,760
bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a background on them first yes</font>

653
00:30:50,190 --> 00:31:00,430
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> I like that so I'm going through</font>

654
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:01,750
the color of the the more<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can which</font>

655
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:04,720
whereas the quality of<font color="#E5E5E5"> quantity of</font>

656
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:05,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">whichever answers now so the first</font>

657
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:07,270
question with what do you know now that

658
00:31:05,890 --> 00:31:12,330
you wish you'd know when you're starting

659
00:31:07,270 --> 00:31:15,430
out and people skills managing clients

660
00:31:12,330 --> 00:31:17,260
managing managment I that quote

661
00:31:15,430 --> 00:31:19,930
underneath it are like you read the

662
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:21,760
quotes<font color="#CCCCCC"> and but something that kind of</font>

663
00:31:19,930 --> 00:31:23,680
knew about but didn't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> think too</font>

664
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:25,960
much about and the start was when I

665
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:27,490
started doing this was you're going to

666
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:29,950
be spending a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of time talk to</font>

667
00:31:27,490 --> 00:31:32,200
clients talking to management and you've

668
00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:34,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to know how to be able to do it</font>

669
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:37,630
I if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can't sit down</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and talk to</font>

670
00:31:34,990 --> 00:31:39,460
management at their level then you're

671
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:41,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">not going to get riffer because you've</font>

672
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:43,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">got if you find an amazing vulnerability</font>

673
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:45,219
in a system then you've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be able</font>

674
00:31:43,419 --> 00:31:46,659
to tell people about it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you've got</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">to tell them in a way that they'll</font>

676
00:31:46,659 --> 00:31:52,210
understand so make sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're not just</font>

00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:05,678
get used to talking to people it's a

684
00:32:03,669 --> 00:32:07,600
good way most<font color="#CCCCCC"> people in the room are</font>

685
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:09,490
like you they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of a bytch I'd</font>

686
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:10,990
start off with a bit introverted the

687
00:32:09,490 --> 00:32:12,940
much rather stare at screen and Twitter

688
00:32:10,990 --> 00:32:14,409
than talk to people but once you've been

689
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:18,639
around for a while you'll get chapter

690
00:32:14,409 --> 00:32:20,230
two people I business skills that was

691

one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the quotes the bottom are real</font>

00:32:22,870 --> 00:32:25,870
business skills more important technical

694

something you've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to</font>

695
00:32:25,870 --> 00:32:29,620
realize is that you'll never<font color="#E5E5E5"> come out I</font>

696

think it's one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the next</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ones that's</font>

00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:37,419
tends to trump technical business says

700
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:40,658
we haven't got money to<font color="#E5E5E5"> pay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

703
00:32:42,039 --> 00:32:47,230

something rather than nothing give

into that so you've asked how do they

start in that feedback loop and you're

984
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:13,450
showing that you actually put interest

985
00:45:09,490 --> 00:45:17,859
in um maybe do a blog on it later or

986
00:45:13,450 --> 00:45:19,120
something when you do ask questions sure

987
00:45:17,860 --> 00:45:21,190

988
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:24,250
first so that really annoys me<font color="#E5E5E5"> and a lot</font>

1030
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:33,019
depends on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the company and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the risks</font>

1031
00:47:30,329 --> 00:47:37,140
that they're willing to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take there was a</font>

1040
00:47:50,339 --> 00:47:54,328
they're going to take but you may as

1041
00:47:52,380 --> 00:47:56,549
well try even if you have been done in

1042
00:47:54,329 --> 00:48:08,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">the past try first thing that says no</font>

1043
00:47:56,549 --> 00:48:08,180
yeah yep yeah

1044
00:48:27,270 --> 00:48:33,580
yeah so<font color="#CCCCCC"> just for the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> recording the quick</font>

1045
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:35,560
some of the answer is government

1046
00:48:33,580 --> 00:48:40,330
suppliers probably not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to take you</font>

1047
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:42,849
on because<font color="#E5E5E5"> the high risk yeah if you</font>

1048
00:48:40,330 --> 00:48:44,080
want to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> your SC clearance apparently</font>

1049
00:48:42,849 --> 00:48:45,130
for DV clearance they don't care what

1050
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:49,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">you've done in the past as long as you</font>

1051
00:48:45,130 --> 00:49:11,230
tell them about it yeah any other

1052
00:48:49,869 --> 00:49:12,940
questions I the question is do you do an

1053
00:49:11,230 --> 00:49:14,580
ethical hacking degree or a computer

1054
00:49:12,940 --> 00:49:17,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">science degree which is better to hire</font>

1055
00:49:14,580 --> 00:49:20,799
at the moment I haven't seen enough

1056
00:49:17,380 --> 00:49:22,900
ethical hacking degree<font color="#E5E5E5"> applicants to be</font>

1057
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:24,280
a one way or the other most people

1058
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:27,940
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ethical hacking degrees are</font>

1059
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:29,080
fairly new I think it<font color="#E5E5E5"> will take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a few</font>

1060
00:49:27,940 --> 00:49:30,760
years for them to start filtering

1061
00:49:29,080 --> 00:49:32,710
through and see how they<font color="#CCCCCC"> are actually</font>

1062
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:36,849
working out in the industry it's

1063
00:49:32,710 --> 00:49:37,869
definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a bad thing but you talk</font>

1064
00:49:36,849 --> 00:49:41,020
to people have been in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the industry for</font>

1065
00:49:37,869 --> 00:49:43,210
a while the general<font color="#CCCCCC"> consensus</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is coming</font>

1066
00:49:41,020 --> 00:49:44,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">to security through some other area beer</font>

1067
00:49:43,210 --> 00:49:47,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">developer first beer sysadmin first be</font>

1068
00:49:44,950 --> 00:49:48,520
whatever first but they've never seen

1069
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:49,480
the degrees they don't know what they

1070
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:51,580
teach and they<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know what the</font>

1071
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:54,210
caliber of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming out is so I</font>

1072
00:49:51,580 --> 00:49:56,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">think my opinion is yes do the degree</font>

1073
00:49:54,210 --> 00:50:00,339
but show some effort that you've looked

1074
00:49:56,830 --> 00:50:04,680
outside the<font color="#E5E5E5"> degree do some like a CCNA</font>

1075
00:50:00,339 --> 00:50:04,680
or something on the side yep

1076
00:50:26,070 --> 00:50:30,580
so again some of the answer is cross

1077
00:50:29,050 --> 00:50:32,740
train if you've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> computer science</font>

1078
00:50:30,580 --> 00:50:34,270
degree show interest<font color="#E5E5E5"> and security to ask</font>

1079
00:50:32,740 --> 00:51:14,350
you agree show interesting commuted

1080
00:50:34,270 --> 00:51:32,290
computer science<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay one last very</font>

1081
00:51:14,350 --> 00:51:37,569
quick question if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you call come if you</font>

1082
00:51:32,290 --> 00:51:39,370
find the reason to<font color="#E5E5E5"> community I've been</font>

1083
00:51:37,570 --> 00:51:40,900
involved<font color="#E5E5E5"> with as well if there's no</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font>

1084
00:51:39,370 --> 00:51:43,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about the first one to</font>

1085
00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:45,880
organize it and you'll be amazed at the

1086
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:48,009
the kind of people you find that are

1087
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:51,820
interested<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your area that just</font>

1088
00:51:48,010 --> 00:51:55,550
haven't been having

1089
00:51:51,820 --> 00:52:00,700
yeah so again summary or wasp is good

1090
00:51:55,550 --> 00:52:03,080
I've ever yet go off horse bleeds um

1091
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:05,180
yeah and<font color="#E5E5E5"> if there isn't a no wasp or a</font>

1092
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:07,819
group in your area start one get people

1093
00:52:05,180 --> 00:52:09,109
together with the Twitter and whatever

1094
00:52:07,820 --> 00:52:10,940
now you should be able to find other

1095
00:52:09,110 --> 00:52:12,680
interested people even if it's two of

1096

1102
00:52:34,070 --> 00:52:37,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">people tend to move up into management</font>
