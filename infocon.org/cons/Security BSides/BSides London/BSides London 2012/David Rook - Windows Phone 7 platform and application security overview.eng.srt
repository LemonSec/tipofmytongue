1
00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:06,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay well that's good starter done so</font>

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:09,700
today I'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

3
00:00:06,459 --> 00:00:11,410
windows phone<font color="#CCCCCC"> 7 security mainly because</font>

4
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:13,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's something i just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> found interesting</font>

5
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:15,460
and i<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought i'd share it with others</font>

6
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:17,439
it's obviously not the dominant platform

7
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:20,290
out there but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i still find it quite</font>

8
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:22,870
interesting myself<font color="#E5E5E5"> so just to quickly</font>

9
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:25,150
introduce myself as probably you already

10
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:27,310
know from you know a program and the

11
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:29,259
first slide my name is<font color="#CCCCCC"> David rook most</font>

12
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:31,720
people tend to know me better a security

13
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:34,179
ninja though so I the security ninja

14
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:36,190
website or security ninja on Twitter so

15
00:00:34,179 --> 00:00:37,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">always interested in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a conference when</font>

16
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:39,608
he introduced<font color="#E5E5E5"> myself as David</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Rock</font>

17
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:41,649
people have<font color="#E5E5E5"> this blank look on their</font>

18
00:00:39,609 --> 00:00:43,570
face<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I say oh yeah I'm security</font>

19
00:00:41,649 --> 00:00:45,910
ninja and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you see complete different</font>

20
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:47,260
reaction from people I do lots of other

21
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:49,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">things I'm not going to bore you with</font>

22
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:51,849
now so got lots of<font color="#CCCCCC"> things to cover by</font>

23
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:55,269
released to<font color="#E5E5E5"> open-source security tools</font>

24
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:56,379
one specifically for windows phone so

25
00:00:55,269 --> 00:00:58,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm going to cover that one later</font>

26
00:00:56,379 --> 00:01:03,399
hopefully both of them if I get enough

27
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:04,900
time<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do the two demos so here's the</font>

28
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:08,320
agenda so I'm starting<font color="#E5E5E5"> off with I</font>

29
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:10,240
suppose a nice easy introduction looking

30
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:13,809
at smartphone and a kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of smartphone</font>

31
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:15,369
app security for you consultants out

32
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:18,340
there you can kind of think that as my

33
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:20,560
executive summary for my presentation

34
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:22,240
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's also to make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure everyone's</font>

35
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:25,210
awake at this time the<font color="#E5E5E5"> morning before we</font>

36
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:26,500
dig<font color="#CCCCCC"> into the more technical details then</font>

37
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:29,350
we'll have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a quick look at what Windows</font>

38
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:31,150
Phone 7 is and then we'll look at the

39
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:32,470
platform<font color="#CCCCCC"> and application security and</font>

40
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:34,600
there is a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> crossover there</font>

41
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:36,610
because some of these security features

42
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:38,919
within the operating system are designed

43
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:40,870
help secure your apps and your data so

44
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:43,060
it isn't quite as black and white as you

45
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:45,010
see it<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the agenda there and then</font>

46
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:47,560
lastly you know depend on how much<font color="#E5E5E5"> time</font>

47
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:49,570
and how for demos will look at both open

48
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:52,660
source tools and how you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> use those</font>

49
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:56,410
to analyze your own apps or I suppose

50
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:58,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">other people's apps so a nice simple big</font>

51
00:01:56,410 --> 00:02:01,300
pie chart on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the first slide keeping it</font>

52
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:04,270
nice and simple what<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> shows is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

53
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:06,820
total mobile device sales worldwide for

54
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:09,519
2011's there around about 1.8 billion

55
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:11,769
mobile devices sold around the world

56
00:02:09,519 --> 00:02:14,019
last year and what might surprise some

57
00:02:11,769 --> 00:02:15,610
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> us particularly you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know in this room</font>

58
00:02:14,019 --> 00:02:18,370
is that smartphones world

59
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:19,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">i distill the minority and you can see</font>

60
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:22,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">that that's pretty clear</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on that screen</font>

61
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:26,440
narrow out of 1.8 billion less than half

62
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:28,690
a billion were smartphones and I say you

63
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:30,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">know they're a minority it's still half</font>

64
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:33,609
a billion devices were sold last year

65
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:35,290
and I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably depending on the</font>

66
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:36,850
community or<font color="#CCCCCC"> the group you're in</font>

67
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:39,370
probably maybe everyone in this room has

68
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:41,019
some form of smartphone you might go

69
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:43,030
down the road or into one of the other

70
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:44,890
conference rooms here and maybe no one

71
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:47,470
has a smartphone or<font color="#E5E5E5"> less people have a</font>

72
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:50,079
smartphone but<font color="#E5E5E5"> ultimately as security</font>

73
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:52,630
people what it means to us is there's

74
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,820
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> people doing you know sensitive</font>

75
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:58,390
things on potentially while something

76
00:02:54,820 --> 00:03:01,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's basically a pocket pc so you have</font>

77
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:03,760
CEOs access in emails and so on and so

78
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:05,410
on so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we need to do with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that security</font>

79
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:08,739
problem but for me as an application

80
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:12,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">security person what I find more I</font>

81
00:03:08,739 --> 00:03:14,410
suppose more troublesome is the app side

82
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:16,000
of things you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> by the end of last</font>

83
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:18,340
year there are over a million apps

84
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,830
available in across all the major app

85
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:22,450
stores now in the real world that means

86
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:25,209
there are over a million available from

87
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:27,100
Apple and Google but I don't want to

88
00:03:25,209 --> 00:03:29,350
beat up on the others too much at the

89
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:31,239
moment but what one thing you have to

90
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:34,359
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about is a security person is</font>

91
00:03:31,239 --> 00:03:36,040
there are a million apps there how<font color="#E5E5E5"> many</font>

92
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:38,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">of them were designed and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> develop with</font>

93
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:40,540
security in mind our security people

94
00:03:38,769 --> 00:03:42,670
would probably immediately think none<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

95
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:44,048
them and I don't quite<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's none</font>

96
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:47,980
of them but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's many of</font>

97
00:03:44,049 --> 00:03:50,650
them either and that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> really my generic</font>

98
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:52,450
smartphone mobile app security content

99
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:54,700
for this talk done just two<font color="#E5E5E5"> things to</font>

100
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:56,950
think about there around obviously the

101
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:59,260
increased use of smartphones and the

102
00:03:56,950 --> 00:04:00,579
fact that what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I found from my personal</font>

103
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:04,149
experiences you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can lock down</font>

104
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:06,250
smartphones for staff but the second you

105
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:08,410
try and restrict access<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the apps they</font>

106
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:10,780
can access<font color="#CCCCCC"> from the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> app store that's</font>

107
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:13,690
when I've seen people you know kick up a

108
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:15,400
fuss about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so you leaving yourself</font>

109
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:18,880
open that you allow them<font color="#E5E5E5"> to essentially</font>

110
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:22,180
install anyone's software so half a

111
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:25,000
billion devices sold last year 51

112
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:28,030
percent of those half a billion were

113
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,130
Android and we have iOS symbian trim and

114
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:32,260
we have this tiny green slice for

115
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:34,659
Microsoft at the top there at two

116
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:36,190
percent<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I've actually been a bit</font>

117
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:38,260
too generous there because Microsoft had

118
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:40,270
one point nine percent other sales last

119
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:41,440
year and what I found was doing this

120
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:43,359
research was<font color="#CCCCCC"> that meant they had a</font>

121
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:45,040
smaller market share that's something

122
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,440
called<font color="#CCCCCC"> badder now I'd never heard of</font>

123
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:49,660
this for all I start do this research so

124
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:52,060
this is a a<font color="#CCCCCC"> know where Samsung developed</font>

125
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:53,800
and you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get this on some Samsung</font>

126
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:56,230
devices that actually has a bigger

127
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:58,300
market share at least up based on last

128
00:04:56,230 --> 00:05:00,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">year's sales than the Microsoft have at</font>

129
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:02,560
the moment which may raise a question of

130
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:06,070
why<font color="#CCCCCC"> should I even continue talking about</font>

131
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:07,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">windows phone seven today and whilst in</font>

132
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:10,120
one where it'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> be funny if I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just walked</font>

133
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:12,580
off the stage and went now I'm not going

134
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:15,100
to do that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> wouldn't want to give you a</font>

135
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:16,570
heart attack plus I put a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time</font>

136
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:19,630
and research into this so I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

137
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:21,840
continue with it mainly<font color="#CCCCCC"> because I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

138
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:24,669
the market share<font color="#E5E5E5"> is going to increase</font>

139
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:25,570
because what they seem to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have done</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

140
00:05:24,669 --> 00:05:27,159
looked at the things that have worked

141
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:28,090
for Google with<font color="#E5E5E5"> Android and looked at</font>

142
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">some of the things that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have worked for</font>

143
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:32,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">apple with the iphone and try to you</font>

144
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:35,080
know apply some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of those same things to</font>

145
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:37,870
Windows Phone 7 so<font color="#E5E5E5"> they have the same</font>

146
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:40,570
concept of not providing the hardware

147
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:43,150
itself they're having<font color="#E5E5E5"> other device</font>

148
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:46,180
manufacturers put Windows Phone 7 on

149
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:48,370
their device so LG samsung nokia<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font>

150
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:50,950
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> about 15 different manufacturers</font>

151
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:54,070
who are putting windows phone 7<font color="#E5E5E5"> onto</font>

152
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:57,729
their device now there was an analyst

153
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:59,140
firm IDC last year i think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was they</font>

154
00:05:57,729 --> 00:06:04,000
predicted that<font color="#CCCCCC"> microsoft would have</font>

155
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:06,240
twenty percent of that<font color="#CCCCCC"> pie by 2015 not</font>

156
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:10,030
obviously makes some people very happy

157
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:13,210
but in<font color="#E5E5E5"> my opinion that that estimate</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

158
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:14,799
very unrealistic you know initially it's

159
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:16,299
unrealistic because it required them to

160
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,919
get five and a half<font color="#E5E5E5"> percent of the</font>

161
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:20,650
market last year we know already they

162
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:22,930
didn't even<font color="#E5E5E5"> get half of that but in my</font>

163
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:26,020
opinion<font color="#E5E5E5"> boss i think twenty percent is</font>

164
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:28,419
unlikely<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think ten percent plus is</font>

165
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:30,609
probably realistic for a few<font color="#CCCCCC"> different</font>

166
00:06:28,419 --> 00:06:33,130
reasons I mean the<font color="#CCCCCC"> nokia deal probably</font>

167
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:35,320
been the one that jumps to mind but when

168
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:37,870
you look at that 1.8 billion mobile

169
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:40,270
device sales last year in total over

170
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:41,860
fifty percent of them were samsung and

171
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:44,198
nokia so both

172
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:46,629
tsonga naki<font color="#E5E5E5"> was some over 400 million</font>

173
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:49,150
devices each last year and both of them

174
00:06:46,629 --> 00:06:52,990
now provide devices that run Windows

175
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:54,638
Phone 7 i'm not al analyst so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm not</font>

176
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:57,129
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to start</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> making crazy predictions</font>

177
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:58,659
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think realistically it won't</font>

178
00:06:57,129 --> 00:07:01,150
remain at two percent but it won't get

179
00:06:58,659 --> 00:07:04,870
to twenty percent in what two and a half

180
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:06,969
years in my opinion so windows phone

181
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:08,530
seven it's the smartphone from<font color="#CCCCCC"> microsoft</font>

182
00:07:06,969 --> 00:07:10,719
and we probably all know that this isn't

183
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:12,698
milksops first attempt at having a

184

called a pocket pc back then and it ran

188
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:23,799
a microsoft OS which if it was released

189
00:07:21,939 --> 00:07:27,939
nowadays<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> probably called a smartphone</font>

know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the right kind of product at the</font>

192
00:07:29,169 --> 00:07:35,080
wrong time I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a Microsoft salesman</font>

193
00:07:33,189 --> 00:07:37,000
and I'll tell you later<font color="#E5E5E5"> on if you</font>

looking at deploying windows phone<font color="#E5E5E5"> 7</font>

195
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,590
into the enterprise don't do it so I'll

196
00:07:40,029 --> 00:07:43,210
tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> you that now before you might think</font>

197
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:46,539
as I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going I'm a salesman for</font>

198
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:48,279
Microsoft I'm really not so windows

199
00:07:46,539 --> 00:07:50,199
phone 7 the OS were looking at today

200
00:07:48,279 --> 00:07:52,629
that was first<font color="#E5E5E5"> released in 8 2010</font>

201
00:07:50,199 --> 00:07:55,060
they've been 7 update since then there's

202
00:07:52,629 --> 00:07:57,490
an update coming in june and then

203
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:59,889
Windows Phone 8 is probably going to

204
00:07:57,490 --> 00:08:01,690
become in quarter for later this year

205
00:07:59,889 --> 00:08:04,479
now from a security point of view

206
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:06,129
windows phone 8 brings in some security

207
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:07,990
functionality that Windows Phone 7 is

208
00:08:06,129 --> 00:08:09,940
missing so a couple of things<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going</font>

209
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:12,550
to point out as being missing today

210
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:16,210
windows phone<font color="#E5E5E5"> 7 and likely to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be brought</font>

211
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:18,069
in by the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the year so windows</font>

212
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:20,378
phone 7 the OS itself is based on

213
00:08:18,069 --> 00:08:21,909
Windows Embedded compact so that's a

214
00:08:20,379 --> 00:08:25,120
combination<font color="#E5E5E5"> of Windows Embedded compact</font>

215
00:08:21,909 --> 00:08:27,580
6 release<font color="#E5E5E5"> 3 and some functionality from</font>

216
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:29,860
release seven so Windows Embedded

217
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:31,990
compact isn't just a scaled-down version

218
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:33,459
of Windows it's actually a separate OS

219
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:35,860
and a separate<font color="#CCCCCC"> colonel that's been</font>

220
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:38,198
around for about 20 years and it's it

221
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:40,120
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> designed to run on resource</font>

222
00:08:38,198 --> 00:08:43,000
constraint devices that's why it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font>

223
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:44,260
used for the phone here and and once

224
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,730
they said they<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have they don't</font>

225
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:47,740
provide the hardware they're quite

226
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:49,420
strict with the manufacturers we're

227
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:52,029
going to deploy windows phone 7 so they

228
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:54,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">have what they call the minimum tough</font>

229
00:08:52,029 --> 00:08:55,660
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> fair requirement so you know every</font>

230
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">Windows Phone</font>

231
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:59,889
to have at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> four gig of flash</font>

232
00:08:56,980 --> 00:09:02,050
storage for example um and one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

233
00:08:59,889 --> 00:09:03,639
other<font color="#CCCCCC"> things i think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but i almost</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> said</font>

234
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:07,258
copied down but obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> microsoft</font>

235
00:09:03,639 --> 00:09:10,779
doesn't copy other people's things

236
00:09:07,259 --> 00:09:13,269
they'd like what Apple did I say I

237
00:09:10,779 --> 00:09:16,240
suppose in terms of having the central

238
00:09:13,269 --> 00:09:18,069
control over apps so you don't have the

239
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:20,800
ability<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and go and get apps from</font>

240
00:09:18,069 --> 00:09:23,199
multiple places it's either via<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the</font>

241
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:25,089
central<font color="#CCCCCC"> Microsoft marketplace or you</font>

242
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:29,199
deploy them to a developer<font color="#CCCCCC"> unlock phone</font>

243
00:09:25,089 --> 00:09:30,370
through visual studio um I should<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

244
00:09:29,199 --> 00:09:32,439
mentioned the bottom air that what

245
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:34,839
Mike's up to dumb here is actually

246
00:09:32,439 --> 00:09:37,269
targeted the consumer market<font color="#CCCCCC"> and if</font>

247
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:39,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">anyone has worked with Microsoft mobile</font>

248
00:09:37,269 --> 00:09:41,709
OS is in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> past you would realize that</font>

249
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:42,910
that's quite a significant shift because

250
00:09:41,709 --> 00:09:44,758
in the past they would have been very

251
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:47,019
heavily focused on the enterprise market

252
00:09:44,759 --> 00:09:48,579
but they've specifically taken the

253
00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:51,220
stance of Windows Phone 7 that they're

254
00:09:48,579 --> 00:09:53,109
targeting the consumer market<font color="#E5E5E5"> now for us</font>

255
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:55,870
as security people that means this

256
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:57,759
functionality missing which in my

257
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:59,050
opinion would or should stop be

258
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:01,060
deploying that in an enterprise

259
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:03,399
environment and I'll cover some of those

260
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:05,888
things a bit later on so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> jumped to</font>

261
00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:08,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">this image a little bit too quickly but</font>

262
00:10:05,889 --> 00:10:10,389
if you at all familiar with<font color="#E5E5E5"> dark net</font>

263
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:12,699
development ignore Windows Phone

specifically for a second if you're in

265
00:10:12,699 --> 00:10:16,300
any way familiar with dark net almost

everything on<font color="#E5E5E5"> that screen has gone look</font>

Silverlight developer and can do<font color="#CCCCCC"> see</font>

272
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:33,579
are a windows phone 7 developer now I

273
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:35,529
said to Microsoft about a week before

274
00:10:33,579 --> 00:10:37,870
Christmas marks of snow and I said I

275
00:10:35,529 --> 00:10:39,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">think that's just marketing speak I'd</font>

276
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:43,630
say I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's that simple and</font>

277
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:46,689
so they gave<font color="#E5E5E5"> me a developer account and</font>

278
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:48,970
said well try it then and i'll be honest

279
00:10:46,689 --> 00:10:52,329
by just after New Year's Day<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> had two</font>

280
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:53,949
apps published in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the marketplace it's</font>

281
00:10:52,329 --> 00:10:56,800
very smart and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Microsoft to do that</font>

282
00:10:53,949 --> 00:10:58,508
because every dot net developer is now

283
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:00,430
potentially windows phone developer

284
00:10:58,509 --> 00:11:03,069
without needing to<font color="#CCCCCC"> know additional tools</font>

285
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:05,410
because you use<font color="#E5E5E5"> Visual Studio use Visual</font>

286
00:11:03,069 --> 00:11:07,689
Studio straight to develop debug and

00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:09,490
deploy your applications you know

00:11:07,689 --> 00:11:12,130
everything on there in terms of

289
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:13,660
frameworks that are used<font color="#CCCCCC"> Silverlight you</font>

290
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:16,600
know if you're a Silverlight developer

291
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:19,000
you're definitely a the exact skill set

292
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:21,100
for windows phone developer so there's a

293
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,020
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things that are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> familiar and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

294
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:25,510
good<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing is for security people is</font>

295
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:28,420
that if you were<font color="#E5E5E5"> familiar with reviewing</font>

296
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:30,010
maybe c sharp code and you have keywords

297
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:32,170
that you might look for<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the source</font>

298
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:34,600
code<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> apply almost everything you</font>

299
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:36,040
already have and or and<font color="#E5E5E5"> well everything</font>

300
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:39,070
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> must already have in terms of</font>

301
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:41,050
secured artnet development into Windows

302
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:44,170
Phone 7 development which again is

303
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:46,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">something I like so I mentioned dotnet</font>

304
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:47,770
there and obviously this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the full</font>

305
00:11:46,089 --> 00:11:49,480
version of dark net that they're running

306
00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:51,850
on the family they use the<font color="#E5E5E5"> dark net</font>

307
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:54,510
compact framework and again like Windows

308
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:57,160
Embedded compact it's a scaled-down

309
00:11:54,510 --> 00:12:00,189
version of dark net for resource

310
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:02,020
constraint devices so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at the</font>

311
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:03,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">classes you have available to you might</font>

312
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:06,279
think well it's the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> as normal</font>

313
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:07,829
dotnet but it isn't they'll have some of

314
00:12:06,279 --> 00:12:10,689
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same class names but they're</font>

315
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:13,209
stripped out a lot of functionality so

316
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:15,100
like the cryptography class that people

317
00:12:13,209 --> 00:12:17,349
might be familiar with you don't get

318
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:19,000
everything that you would get if you

319
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:21,279
were doing like a windows form

320
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,770
development for example and obviously

321
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:25,570
have mobile specific classes in there as

322
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:27,250
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm just going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> jump to the</font>

323
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:29,050
bottom point there for a second<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

324
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:30,850
what Microsoft's have tried to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do here</font>

325
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:33,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">is try to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure that you only used</font>

326
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:36,760
managed code so code that's executed

327
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:40,860
within the dotnet clr which is like the

328
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:43,899
vm in<font color="#E5E5E5"> java but that's not strictly true</font>

329
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:48,250
because there are ways to access native

330
00:12:43,899 --> 00:12:51,070
code from your applications but for

331
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:53,020
average<font color="#CCCCCC"> joe developer like maybe you and</font>

332
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:54,610
me we can't do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you try and</font>

333
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:57,459
submit an application that does that

334
00:12:54,610 --> 00:13:00,070
it'll be rejected but the likes of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Adobe</font>

335
00:12:57,459 --> 00:13:01,719
they can have access to native code now

336
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:04,329
I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's crazy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I can't access</font>

337
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:05,860
native code but adobe<font color="#CCCCCC"> can who's more</font>

338
00:13:04,329 --> 00:13:08,770
likely to introduce the security issue

339
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:10,480
to me or Adobe and but rather than go

340
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:12,550
through those bullet points I don't know

341
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,050
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know who's familiar with dark net or</font>

342
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:17,109
who isn't so I want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> just explain to</font>

343
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:19,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">you in in the.net</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> world and this applies</font>

344
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:21,550
to dotnet in general as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well as Windows</font>

345
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:25,000
Phone 7 how your source code

346
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:27,490
goes from your IDE to being executed and

347
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,690
it's important because there's a step in

348
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:31,269
here I'm going to explain in a minute

349
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:33,160
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I touch on very briefly much</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> later</font>

350
00:13:31,269 --> 00:13:36,010
in the presentation of how Microsoft

351
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:37,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">analyze your code so you can see it's</font>

352
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:39,189
very piece you know simple piece of<font color="#E5E5E5"> code</font>

353
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:40,599
at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the top there all that's going to</font>

354
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:43,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">happen is user clicks a button it</font>

355
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:45,550
displays a message so you got to compile

356
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:47,740
that source code and in this case<font color="#CCCCCC"> C</font>

357
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:51,010
sharps a visual<font color="#E5E5E5"> studio uses its c-sharp</font>

358
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:54,190
compiler and in terms of Windows Phone

359
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:56,319
it's C sharp or vb.net so why anyone

360
00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:58,630
would write it in vb.net I don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

361
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:01,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">C sharp really is your only option in my</font>

362
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:04,050
opinion and in the.net world the

363
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:06,969
compiler has to produce an output that's

364
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:08,469
compliant with the clr so the clr is the

365
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:10,209
common language<font color="#CCCCCC"> runtime and as I</font>

366
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:13,060
mentioned<font color="#CCCCCC"> before you can think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of that</font>

367
00:14:10,209 --> 00:14:16,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">as kind of like the vm in java now</font>

368
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:18,359
that's why you can use<font color="#E5E5E5"> Java and.net</font>

369
00:14:16,149 --> 00:14:21,010
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> why you can use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> COBOL in.net</font>

370
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:23,290
providing you have a compiler that turns

371
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:25,060
out into the right format technically

372
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:28,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can use any language you want and</font>

373
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:31,630
run it in dark net so the job of running

374
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:34,089
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the dark net clr I think maybe send</font>

375
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:35,950
some people's brains crazy but there's

376
00:14:34,089 --> 00:14:37,720
something like 35 languages you can

377
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:39,490
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> run within dark net because</font>

378
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:41,380
it's all about the compiler not the

379
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:44,200
framework itself because what the

380
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:47,320
compiler has to do is produce a managed

381
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:51,220
module which is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> windows PE file that</font>

382
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:52,839
needs the the clr to execute but what in

383
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:55,420
what it does there is it turns your

384
00:14:52,839 --> 00:14:57,459
source code into Microsoft intermediate

385
00:14:55,420 --> 00:15:00,339
language or the intermediate language

386
00:14:57,459 --> 00:15:02,619
it's in it's a I think it's a global

387
00:15:00,339 --> 00:15:04,209
standard<font color="#E5E5E5"> now but that's basically a set</font>

388
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:06,279
of instructions and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll show you some</font>

389
00:15:04,209 --> 00:15:07,899
of this in a second and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then what</font>

390
00:15:06,279 --> 00:15:09,820
happens when you go to execute your

391
00:15:07,899 --> 00:15:11,320
application so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to run it in the</font>

392
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:14,260
dark net clr there's a just-in-time

393
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:16,480
compiler it<font color="#CCCCCC"> turns those instructions</font>

394
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:18,579
into native code for whatever platform

395
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:21,339
you're running that on so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just want to</font>

396
00:15:18,579 --> 00:15:23,709
quickly show you an example of that so

397
00:15:21,339 --> 00:15:25,540
you can see at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the top here we have that</font>

398
00:15:23,709 --> 00:15:28,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">same bit of source code it's going to</font>

399
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:30,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">display that message and then we use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

400
00:15:28,029 --> 00:15:32,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">the intermediate language disassembled</font>

401
00:15:30,579 --> 00:15:34,300
at all from Microsoft it's free it's

402
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:35,080
actually pretty handy and you can see by

403
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,370
the design of it

404
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:38,650
it's certainly not a new tool that's

405
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:40,260
been around for a while so we just want

406
00:15:38,650 --> 00:15:42,939
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at that that button click event</font>

407
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:44,620
and you can see these are<font color="#E5E5E5"> the the</font>

408
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:46,720
intermediate language instructions

behind<font color="#E5E5E5"> that button click event and</font>

410
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:51,610
display a message and you can see that

411
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:53,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">these two lines here whilst we not might</font>

412
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:55,930
not understand exactly what's going on

413
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:57,280
sorry in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> two at the top there we can</font>

414
00:15:55,930 --> 00:15:59,650
see that this is doing something<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

415
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:01,030
our message box and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is the string</font>

416
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:03,340
that we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to display</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the message</font>

417
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:06,160
box okay so by themselves they're pretty

418
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:10,260
useless but the clr takes that in turns

419
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:13,000
into native code and execute it<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and</font>

420
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:14,290
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> il stuff there it's important to</font>

421
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">remember because we're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to touch on</font>

422
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:18,819
that a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit later on because</font>

423
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:22,360
that's important in the app<font color="#E5E5E5"> review and</font>

424
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:24,310
submission process so let's dig a little

425
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:26,440
bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> deeper into Windows Phone 7 and then</font>

426
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:29,109
we'll focus completely on the security

427
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:30,780
side of things<font color="#CCCCCC"> so it's a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 32-bit OS and</font>

428
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:33,610
runs in a four gig virtual address space

429
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:36,310
so that four gig is split into two two

430
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:38,980
gig allocations one is for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the kernel</font>

431
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:42,219
space and one is<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the process space</font>

432
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:44,110
so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> processor is executing won't get</font>

433
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:46,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">two gig to itself the process itself</font>

434
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:48,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">gets one gig and then there are common</font>

435
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:51,010
components associated with any process

436
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,540
essay executing and that gets another

437
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:55,330
gig and we'll look at it a little bit

438
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:57,640
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> detail in a minute and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just to show</font>

439
00:16:55,330 --> 00:16:59,170
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> a supposed high-level from apps at</font>

440
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:02,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">the top down to hardware at the bottom</font>

441
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:05,079
some of the important things involved

442
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:06,399
here in in that architecture so we

443
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:07,839
obviously have our appt at the top and

444
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm not going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to bore you by going</font>

445
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:11,139
through<font color="#E5E5E5"> every single one of things on</font>

446
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:13,449
that screen i<font color="#CCCCCC"> can after if some of your</font>

447
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:14,770
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> that interested but you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

448
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:15,820
there are important things there so up

449
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:17,709
at the top there we have this thing

450
00:17:15,819 --> 00:17:19,869
<font color="#CCCCCC">called see projects see that's the thing</font>

451
00:17:17,709 --> 00:17:22,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">that will intercept an incoming phone</font>

452
00:17:19,869 --> 00:17:24,250
call and display the relevant UI

453
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:26,619
components so the user can answer or not

454
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:27,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">phone call and then down in the kernel</font>

455
00:17:26,619 --> 00:17:31,270
space at the bottom we obviously have

456
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:32,470
the kernel itself we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a cake or dll</font>

457
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:33,940
which basically allows all those

458
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:36,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">components down there to talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to each</font>

459
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:39,550
other you have the network in file

460
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:41,350
system management and you have OLX it

461
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:43,419
down in the bottom<font color="#CCCCCC"> corner there which</font>

462
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:45,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically allows the OS and apps to talk</font>

463
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:48,070
to the hardware<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so that's obviously</font>

464
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:48,700
a very high level view of it but<font color="#E5E5E5"> um you</font>

465
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:50,530
can see this

466
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:51,970
it there between user space and kernel

467
00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:53,860
space and again just<font color="#CCCCCC"> to show that</font>

468
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:56,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">slightly differently the split to two</font>

469
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:57,820
gig to each one down the bottom in

470
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:59,890
kernel space Java<font color="#E5E5E5"> serves the colonel</font>

471
00:17:57,820 --> 00:18:01,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">file system</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and so on and in the process</font>

472
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:03,760
space you<font color="#CCCCCC"> obviously have the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> code and</font>

473
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:07,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">the data at sex cute and a few other</font>

474
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:09,490
things as well I just again to dig a bit

475
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:11,439
deeper into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the process space as i said</font>

476
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:13,030
the process sets executing doesn't get

477
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">to gig to itself</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so it gets one gig</font>

478
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:16,420
there at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bottom and i'm not the top</font>

479
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:18,850
there there's things that you said that

480
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:21,160
are needed for all processes as they get

481
00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:26,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">a share of the other one gig of memory</font>

482
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:29,410
space so security you know now we've had

483
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:30,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">i suppose an overview why why I'm even</font>

484
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:34,240
talking about<font color="#CCCCCC"> something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with less than</font>

485
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:36,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">two percent market share a bit more</font>

486
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,900
information<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the OS itself so now</font>

487
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:40,389
it's time to start looking at the

488
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:42,220
security as I said I<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of split it</font>

489
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:44,770
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> platform and application security</font>

490
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:46,450
but there is a lot of crossover and it

491
00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:48,430
might<font color="#CCCCCC"> not be completely clear when we go</font>

492
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:52,240
from one to the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> because they do</font>

493
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:54,130
merge they are interlinked so the

494
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:56,470
security model in Windows Phone 7 is

495
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:59,620
based on a chambers concept and

496
00:18:56,470 --> 00:19:01,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically what happens is a code is</font>

497
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:03,639
going to run within one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these</font>

498
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:05,920
chambers so each chamber has a different

499
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:07,600
permission set right the way from you

500
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:09,370
know where our code is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to run in</font>

501
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:11,080
the most restrictive<font color="#E5E5E5"> chamber what the</font>

502
00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:14,080
way to the chamber at the top which can

503
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:16,419
literally do anything it wants and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll</font>

504
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:18,520
explain each one a bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> short in a minute</font>

505
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:21,190
but basically the Chamber's there to

506
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:22,510
enforce isolation so apps can't can't

507
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:24,700
even speak to each other they can't

508
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:26,440
share data between each<font color="#E5E5E5"> other if you're</font>

509
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:28,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">coming from an Android development world</font>

510
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:30,580
where you've seen things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like in 10</font>

511
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:33,220
messages being used between applications

512
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:35,350
you don't get that<font color="#CCCCCC"> in Windows Phone 7 I</font>

513
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:37,600
supposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be coming in Windows Phone 8</font>

514
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:39,850
but from a security<font color="#E5E5E5"> person i'm a bit</font>

515
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:42,129
torn on that because right now apps

516
00:19:39,850 --> 00:19:43,719
can't access each other's data they

517
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:45,520
can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> even speak to each other which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

518
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:46,720
like from a security point of view but

519
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:48,490
i'm sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a limitation for</font>

520
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:51,210
developers and<font color="#E5E5E5"> microsoft they're going</font>

521
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:53,680
to reverse that later this year<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think</font>

522
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:56,230
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically there are four chambers</font>

523
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:58,390
and we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at one in more</font>

524
00:19:56,230 --> 00:20:00,040
detail but there are three gems that

525
00:19:58,390 --> 00:20:02,360
have what they call a fixed permission

526
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:04,670
set so you know things like<font color="#E5E5E5"> whether</font>

527
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:07,010
onal runs its chamber has a fixed

528
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:09,860
permission set it can do X amount of

529
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:11,990
things fine we'll touch on those briefly

530
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:14,330
but the one that I find most interesting

531
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:16,670
because this is where most of our code

532
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:19,220
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to run is that the fourth</font>

533
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:21,980
chamber which<font color="#CCCCCC"> Microsoft say is</font>

534
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:23,570
capabilities based now<font color="#E5E5E5"> again if you've</font>

535
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:25,820
done any Android development a

536
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:27,620
capability is exactly the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

537
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:30,020
permission in the Android world that's

538
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:31,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">all it really is that you say you need</font>

539
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:35,090
the capability to access network and

540
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:37,430
functionality or read SMS and we'll take

541
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:40,340
a better look at capability shortly so I

542
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:41,900
won't spend too much time on it now so

543
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:43,850
you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> these four chambers the trusted</font>

544
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:46,640
computing base at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> top that's where</font>

545
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:48,949
your kernel everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> security</font>

546
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:50,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">sensitive is going to run which is</font>

547
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:52,220
obviously the place where well depends

548
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:53,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">on which side of the fence you are the</font>

549
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:56,050
place you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep secure or the</font>

550
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:58,520
place you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get your code running</font>

551
00:20:56,050 --> 00:21:00,290
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your code running in</font>

552
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:02,660
there you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can literally do whatever you</font>

553
00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:05,960
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> even modify the security policy on</font>

554
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:07,040
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> device for the majority of us we're</font>

555
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:10,010
going to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> running in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the least</font>

556
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:11,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">privileged chamber at the bottom which</font>

557
00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:13,370
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the one that I said this capabilities</font>

558
00:21:11,930 --> 00:21:15,350
based so you can think<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it as the</font>

559
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:17,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">others have a fixed permission set that</font>

560
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:19,459
has a dynamic permission set because

561
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:22,850
that's going to change for every app

562
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:24,230
that we execute so I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to touch on</font>

563
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:27,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">the others very briefly and then we'll</font>

564
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:28,940
look at capabilities in more detail so

565
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:31,250
the trusted computing basis said that's

566
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:33,590
where the colonel<font color="#E5E5E5"> kernel mode drivers</font>

567
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:35,960
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to run and like I said if</font>

568
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:38,090
you're a malicious code developer or a

569
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:39,680
homebrew developer that's where you want

570
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:42,230

573
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:50,420
phone I suppose in again the good or the

574
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:53,330
bad thing depending on which<font color="#CCCCCC"> side the</font>

575
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:54,950
fence you<font color="#CCCCCC"> sat is so far</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's proved</font>

576
00:21:53,330 --> 00:21:57,350
quite difficult to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get your code run and</font>

577
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:59,390
in there but like any other<font color="#E5E5E5"> security</font>

578
00:21:57,350 --> 00:22:03,620
system it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably only a matter of</font>

579
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:05,660
time before it really gets broken so

580
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:07,370
only Microsoft can add<font color="#CCCCCC"> signed software</font>

581
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:09,350
to that chamber probably for obvious

582
00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:11,199
reasons because you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want everyone</font>

583
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:13,760
being able to put<font color="#CCCCCC"> that code in their</font>

00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:15,650
elevated rights chamber again<font color="#E5E5E5"> in some</font>

585
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:17,570
ways is almost the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same so it</font>

586
00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:21,110
if you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> your code run in here you</font>

587
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:23,720
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> access and read everything apart</font>

588
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:26,179
from the security policy so again it

589
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:27,860
won't give you a<font color="#E5E5E5"> suppose kind of root</font>

590
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:29,360
access like you'd get<font color="#E5E5E5"> in trusted</font>

591
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:30,949
computing base but it's still pretty

592
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:33,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">powerful because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I mentioned before</font>

593
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:35,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're not supposed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to see</font>

00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:40,129
run in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this chamber you could so again</font>

596
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:42,800
only Microsoft can add sign software to

597
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:44,540
this the standard<font color="#CCCCCC"> droids chamber there</font>

598
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:46,190
isn't too much to say about that<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

599
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:48,920
apart from if you have pre installed

microsoft or OEM applications they're

601

605
00:22:57,470 --> 00:23:01,850
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> one most interesting is because any</font>

606
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:04,250
app you get from the windows farm market

607
00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:05,810
place<font color="#E5E5E5"> and probably any app that if any</font>

608
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:07,730
of us in this room are going to write

609
00:23:05,810 --> 00:23:10,669
code<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Windows Phone or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> review an app</font>

610
00:23:07,730 --> 00:23:11,960
for Windows Phone it's very<font color="#E5E5E5"> likely that</font>

611
00:23:10,670 --> 00:23:15,440
it's code that's going to run in this

612
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:18,260
chamber so for any non<font color="#E5E5E5"> locus of tap</font>

613
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:20,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">occasions this is the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> default chamber</font>

614
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:22,460
for them so like so if you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> it from</font>

615
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:25,610
the marketplace it's runnin in this

616
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:27,230
chamber so it's it's based on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

617
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:29,209
principle least privilege and it has

618
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:31,820
that dynamic permission set based on the

619
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:34,130
capabilities so when you create a

620
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:36,770
Windows Phone app you have this WM app

621
00:23:34,130 --> 00:23:39,320
manifest file that includes a list of

622
00:23:36,770 --> 00:23:41,240
the capabilities that your app wants to

623
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:43,340
use so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you've if you want to use</font>

624
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:44,960
networking you do need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to declare it in</font>

625
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:46,669
there if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to read user's</font>

626
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:51,380
contacts you need to declare that as a

627
00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:53,360
capability which brings us are nicely to

628
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:55,700
capabilities and digging into them and a

629
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:57,169
little bit more detail so the first

630
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:58,910
couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> of points I've probably</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> already</font>

631
00:23:57,170 --> 00:24:00,950
covered really that if you want to

632
00:23:58,910 --> 00:24:02,660
access certain functionality not all

633
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:05,090
functionality do you don't need to

634
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:06,830
declare capability for everything so

635
00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:09,230
things like isolated storage where you

636
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:10,730
can write to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the device and read from</font>

637
00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:12,980
the device you don't need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to declare</font>

638
00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:15,050
that as capability but for things like

639
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:17,810
readin SMS and use network and you do

640
00:24:15,050 --> 00:24:19,780
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to declare them so when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you create</font>

641
00:24:17,810 --> 00:24:22,250
a Windows Phone app you get this

642
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:24,139
manifest file by default that<font color="#CCCCCC"> hire has</font>

643
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:26,480
all the capabilities in it by default

644
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:27,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">now as a security person I look at the</font>

645
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:30,040
other thing ah

646
00:24:27,610 --> 00:24:32,020
that is a right pain in the backside it

647
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:34,299
has everything in there to start off

648
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:36,670
with and<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually there's no incentive</font>

649
00:24:34,299 --> 00:24:39,040
or no need for developer to modify that

650
00:24:36,670 --> 00:24:41,020
because you submit that to Microsoft

651
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:43,480
they analyze the intermediate language

652
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:45,790
of the code you submitted and rewrite

653
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:47,400
the manifest fall so the capabilities

654
00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:49,690
matter what the code is going to do and

655
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:51,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> show you how I address that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as a</font>

00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:54,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">security person in a minute because if</font>

657
00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:56,200
you're maybe consultants or an

658
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:58,928
application security person has to

659
00:24:56,200 --> 00:25:00,640
review<font color="#E5E5E5"> a nap the capability should be a</font>

660
00:24:58,929 --> 00:25:02,080
good starting point you can go and<font color="#CCCCCC"> look</font>

661
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:03,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that and have at least at a high</font>

662
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:06,070
level a good understanding of what<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

663
00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:08,919
it app is going to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> before you even</font>

664
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:12,100
look at source code but not in the way

665
00:25:08,919 --> 00:25:14,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">that Microsoft of done capabilities in a</font>

666
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:15,580
way to help developers and there are few

667
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:17,950
points like that that will come across

668
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:20,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">in this talk where Microsoft I thought I</font>

669
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:22,450
suppose made a security<font color="#CCCCCC"> trade-off to</font>

670
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:24,490
make security easier for developers and

671
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:26,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's a tough one for me it's a bit of</font>

672
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:28,390
a conflict<font color="#E5E5E5"> for me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> internally on that</font>

673
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:30,970
because we always want the best security

674
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:33,190
but we should also<font color="#CCCCCC"> be striving to make</font>

675
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:36,100
application security easier for

676
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:37,840
developers and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll cover that a little</font>

677
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:40,840
bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> more in a second and there's a</font>

678
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:42,580
couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of aspects on there because they</font>

679
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:44,350
give you a default list of capabilities

680
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:46,659
but it isn't all of the capabilities

681
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:48,159
they're undocumented capabilities the

682
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:51,190
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of capabilities that allow you to</font>

683
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:52,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">use native code you and me don't get</font>

684
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:54,970
them by default and<font color="#E5E5E5"> if we add them in</font>

685
00:25:52,990 --> 00:25:57,250
and submit it to Microsoft our app will

686
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:59,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">be rejected I did that a couple of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> times</font>

687
00:25:57,250 --> 00:26:00,880
and I was worried that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they might block</font>

688
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:04,390
my developer account so I didn't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

689
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:06,190
push it<font color="#E5E5E5"> too hard because they they take</font>

690
00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:09,309
the analysis back to the intermediate

691
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:11,770
language and you have to include another

692
00:26:09,309 --> 00:26:13,600
manifest for specifically<font color="#CCCCCC"> for native</font>

693
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:15,340
code access I think it would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be very</font>

694
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:18,428
<font color="#E5E5E5">difficult to get something into the</font>

00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:20,620
marketplace using native code and

00:26:18,429 --> 00:26:23,100
getting it<font color="#E5E5E5"> past Microsoft I say</font>

697
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:26,139
difficult because nothing is impossible

698
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:27,909
and then the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> point I'd said that</font>

699
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:29,559
the Windows Phone app will give the

700
00:26:27,910 --> 00:26:31,480
permissions based on your manifest<font color="#E5E5E5"> file</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">I briefly mentioned before Microsoft</font>

702
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:34,900
potentially going to rewrite your

how

00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:59,740
if your code has functionality in it

714
00:26:58,210 --> 00:27:02,410
there doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a capability for</font>

715
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:04,900
it'll still run fine and you can do

716
00:27:02,410 --> 00:27:07,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">everything else the app offers until you</font>

717
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:09,640
try and<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that one thing that you don't</font>

718
00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:12,340
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a capability for then you get an</font>

719
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:13,960
unauthorized asset access exception so

720
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:16,449
you know you might want to access a web

721
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:18,130
browser component to show a web page<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

722
00:27:16,450 --> 00:27:20,590
if you don't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> that capability the</font>

723
00:27:18,130 --> 00:27:22,570
user will<font color="#CCCCCC"> see an error now I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> remember</font>

724
00:27:20,590 --> 00:27:25,000
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to figure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out how do i show you</font>

725
00:27:22,570 --> 00:27:26,860
demos from a<font color="#E5E5E5"> font and I couldn't figure</font>

726
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,510
out a nice way to do it I was wanting to

727
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:31,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">show you live from a phone but in the</font>

728
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:33,190
end I ended up recording a demo so I can

729
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:34,900
show you that in a second basically

730
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:38,260
what's going to happen is i launched a

731
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:40,510
basic b-sides<font color="#CCCCCC"> London app there's a</font>

732
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:41,860
button for capability and what that

733
00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:44,260
tries to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do is use the web browser</font>

734
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:46,389
component I've not given it that

735
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:48,490
capability that's manifest for so you'll

736
00:27:46,390 --> 00:27:51,330
see the exception here in a second it's

737
00:27:48,490 --> 00:27:51,330
a short enough video

738
00:27:56,470 --> 00:28:01,240
obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd encourage you to handle</font>

739
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:04,780
your exceptions a bit better<font color="#E5E5E5"> than that</font>

740
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:06,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">in the real world but you can see there</font>

741
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:07,600
we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got that unauthorized access</font>

742
00:28:06,039 --> 00:28:09,700
exception because we've tried to<font color="#E5E5E5"> access</font>

743
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:12,820
functionality that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have</font>

744
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:16,480
permissions for and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> show you</font>

745
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:18,760
the capabilities in that manifest file

746
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:20,140
now so by default as I<font color="#E5E5E5"> said you have</font>

747
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:22,419
this manifest file you can see<font color="#E5E5E5"> all those</font>

748
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:24,070
capabilities in there by default<font color="#E5E5E5"> now the</font>

749
00:28:22,419 --> 00:28:26,200
one we were trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use there was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

750
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:28,059
web browser component so we were<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying</font>

751
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:30,789
to browse to the security ninja website

752
00:28:28,059 --> 00:28:32,678
but you can see here that that's been

753
00:28:30,789 --> 00:28:36,158
commented out right so we didn't have

754
00:28:32,679 --> 00:28:38,350
that capability<font color="#CCCCCC"> now one of the things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

755
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:40,299
mentioned before was how the

756
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:44,980
capabilities fall for your application

757
00:28:40,299 --> 00:28:46,570
has<font color="#CCCCCC"> everything in it by default now as a</font>

758
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:48,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">security person what you really want to</font>

759
00:28:46,570 --> 00:28:50,620
find out is<font color="#E5E5E5"> well what is it using</font>

760
00:28:48,850 --> 00:28:52,330
because it's likely if you're doing a

761
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:53,469
security review I suppose you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

762
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:55,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do a review in one or two</font>

763
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:57,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">places maybe if you're a consultant</font>

764
00:28:55,450 --> 00:28:59,559
you're pulling it down<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the App</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">Store and trying to get the source code</font>

766
00:28:59,559 --> 00:29:03,428
back and do a review and I'll show you

767
00:29:01,330 --> 00:29:04,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">how to do that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> later or you'd be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in my</font>

768
00:29:03,429 --> 00:29:06,880
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of position where you're doing the</font>

769
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:09,309
review internally prior to being

770
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:12,580
submitted to an app store so what I have

771
00:29:09,309 --> 00:29:15,158
here is basic application<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> develop code</font>

772
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:18,370
Windows Phone app analyzer so by default

773
00:29:15,159 --> 00:29:20,470
you can use the app analyzer to run a

774
00:29:18,370 --> 00:29:22,510
couple of automated tools so there's the

775
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:23,980
capabilities detection tool which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

776
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:25,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the tools</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Microsoft actually use</font>

777
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:27,850
during that submission and review

778
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:30,520
process this will launch that for you

779
00:29:27,850 --> 00:29:33,459
<font color="#CCCCCC">and analyze your cone it can also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> launch</font>

780
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:35,500
cap net which is a microsoft security

781
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:37,150
static<font color="#E5E5E5"> analysis tool against its code</font>

782
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:38,950
and again that was what i<font color="#E5E5E5"> mentioned</font>

783
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:41,080
before reusing those technologies is

784
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:42,549
good for a security people what I'll

785
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:44,770
also do and I'll try<font color="#CCCCCC"> and show you in the</font>

786
00:29:42,549 --> 00:29:46,480
demo is later if you get the windows<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

787
00:29:44,770 --> 00:29:48,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">an apple or decompile it for you so you</font>

788
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:51,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">can review the source code as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> well so</font>

789
00:29:48,789 --> 00:29:52,840
this one here this is the app that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

790
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:54,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">just showed you now if we click scan</font>

791
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:57,220
here it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to run the capabilities</font>

792
00:29:54,789 --> 00:29:59,049
detection scan and rather than<font color="#E5E5E5"> telling</font>

793
00:29:57,220 --> 00:30:00,820
us what<font color="#E5E5E5"> was in the manifest file its</font>

794
00:29:59,049 --> 00:30:02,679
going to look at the source code<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

795
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:05,230
it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to tell us what capabilities</font>

796
00:30:02,679 --> 00:30:06,520
are used so you can see all we were

797
00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:08,350
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use we were using silverlight</font>

798
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:10,300
and then we were just using the

799
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:13,840
networking and the web browser component

800
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:15,760
that's all we were using<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

801
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:17,770
found was useful<font color="#CCCCCC"> to me anyway because it</font>

802
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:19,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cuts out trying to figure out while</font>

803
00:30:17,770 --> 00:30:22,840
you've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> fifteen capabilities there</font>

804
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:24,399
are you using the more<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and we'll</font>

805
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:31,360
come<font color="#CCCCCC"> back to that tool a little bit</font>

806
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:35,680
later on yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm not not sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what it</font>

807
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:37,870
is so yeah application signed<font color="#E5E5E5"> i touched</font>

808
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:39,580
on it briefly early around microsoft

809
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:42,159
sign and code to go into certain

810
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:45,429
chambers but<font color="#E5E5E5"> ultimately unless you're</font>

811
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:47,380
deploying your source code to a

812
00:30:45,430 --> 00:30:49,660
developer<font color="#E5E5E5"> unlocked device from visual</font>

813
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:52,000
studio all applications have to be

814
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:53,710
signed by Microsoft so again they take

815
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,020
care<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that automatically for you so</font>

816
00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:58,090
during the app submission and review

817
00:30:56,020 --> 00:31:00,040
process the very final point before they

818
00:30:58,090 --> 00:31:02,620
put it into the market store is they

819
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:04,389
sign the application and that needs to

820
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:10,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">be signed before you can install</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it on</font>

821
00:31:04,390 --> 00:31:14,650
the device unless yep<font color="#CCCCCC"> it when I</font>

822
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:16,390
submitted it was four to five<font color="#CCCCCC"> days by no</font>

823
00:31:14,650 --> 00:31:18,160
they announced recently that it's gone

824
00:31:16,390 --> 00:31:19,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">up because they get more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and more people</font>

825
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:23,340
writing code and they haven't staffed up

826
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:23,340
in that<font color="#CCCCCC"> area so on</font>

827
00:31:28,530 --> 00:31:34,149
as far as I know at the moment it goes

828
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:36,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">through all of that before</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it can go</font>

829
00:31:34,150 --> 00:31:37,720
into the marketplace so at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

830
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:39,100
what they're saying that<font color="#E5E5E5"> has to be</font>

831
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:40,770
signed<font color="#E5E5E5"> before they deployed into the</font>

832
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:43,540
marketplace and<font color="#E5E5E5"> from my experience</font>

833
00:31:40,770 --> 00:31:45,429
that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> longest part of the process I</font>

834
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:48,100
found what I think happens in those

835
00:31:45,429 --> 00:31:50,559
first few steps is that that's all man

836
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:53,110
automated pretty sure there's just

837
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:55,270
static analysis tools of some kind doing

838
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:57,129
all the validation up to that point it

839
00:31:55,270 --> 00:31:58,450
was when I got to the certification test

840
00:31:57,130 --> 00:32:01,270
him that that took like three or four

841
00:31:58,450 --> 00:32:03,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">days rest of it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was like hours so I'm</font>

842
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:04,720
assuming they are doing that manually

843
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:09,040
and before it goes into the marketplace

844
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:12,250
but as it continues to<font color="#E5E5E5"> grow yeah exactly</font>

845
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:14,860
it'll get sloppy so application

846
00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:16,120
sandboxing we have actually kind of

847
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:19,000
covered this already because we've

848
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:21,850
talked about how our apps run in these

849
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:23,590
restricted chambers so our apps execute

850
00:32:21,850 --> 00:32:25,990
and run within least<font color="#CCCCCC"> privileged chamber</font>

851
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:28,659
has a restricted permission set based on

852
00:32:25,990 --> 00:32:30,250
our capabilities now what that means<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

853
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:33,610
us and I've mentioned a couple of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

854
00:32:30,250 --> 00:32:35,980
already is that that means every app is

855
00:32:33,610 --> 00:32:38,169
completely sandboxed in that it can't

856
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:40,720
speak<font color="#CCCCCC"> to other applications it can't</font>

857
00:32:38,170 --> 00:32:42,700
access data from<font color="#CCCCCC"> other applications and</font>

858
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:46,960
think about that for a minute that<font color="#E5E5E5"> means</font>

859
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:49,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you actually can't access data that</font>

860
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:52,390
other applications store on a device if

861
00:32:49,690 --> 00:32:55,720
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to share data between two apps</font>

862
00:32:52,390 --> 00:32:58,000
you need to store that off device so in

863
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:59,800
the cloud or as well i like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say the</font>

864
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,050
clouds of fancy name for the internet

865
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:05,830
but ultimately it has to be somewhere

866
00:33:02,050 --> 00:33:07,809
off the<font color="#E5E5E5"> device</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay which is a little</font>

867
00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:09,070
bit strange in a way I'm you know they

868
00:33:07,809 --> 00:33:10,960
can't speak<font color="#CCCCCC"> to each other they can't</font>

869
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:13,330
share data and you might be<font color="#CCCCCC"> thinking</font>

870
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:15,780
well you have the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ability to read SMS</font>

871
00:33:13,330 --> 00:33:19,149
and read user context that can't be true

872
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:20,980
well there are special api's on the

873
00:33:19,150 --> 00:33:22,300
phone to allow that kind of access they

874
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:25,510
have these things called<font color="#E5E5E5"> launchers and</font>

875
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:27,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">choosers so launcher is basically an API</font>

876
00:33:25,510 --> 00:33:30,820
call to do something where<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get no</font>

877
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:33,820
data back so a launcher could be send an

878
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:36,220
SMS whereas the chooser is call to an

879
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:40,030
API that returns data so show me the

880
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:40,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">users SMS messages but that you can't</font>

881
00:33:40,030 --> 00:33:43,510
use those<font color="#E5E5E5"> two</font>

882
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:46,570
access another application<font color="#E5E5E5"> state it's</font>

883
00:33:43,510 --> 00:33:48,070
very<font color="#CCCCCC"> restricted in terms of data storage</font>

884
00:33:46,570 --> 00:33:50,050
they use something called isolated

885
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:51,629
storage which again if any of you are

886
00:33:50,050 --> 00:33:53,649
familiar with silverlight development

887
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:55,750
you'll be somewhat familiar with

888
00:33:53,650 --> 00:33:58,990
isolated storage because that's where

889
00:33:55,750 --> 00:34:00,580
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea comes from so every app has its</font>

890
00:33:58,990 --> 00:34:03,670
own bit of isolated stores and it's

891
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:05,800
supposed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to keep the data private as I</font>

892
00:34:03,670 --> 00:34:07,120
said before is very similar to isolated

893
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:09,310
storage and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Silverlight because that's</font>

894
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:11,168
where they got the idea from and what

895
00:34:09,310 --> 00:34:14,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">that ultimately means is that you can</font>

896
00:34:11,168 --> 00:34:16,929
read<font color="#CCCCCC"> and write data to the phone without</font>

897
00:34:14,290 --> 00:34:20,830
having access to the file system

898
00:34:16,929 --> 00:34:22,960
directly you don't get that access you

899
00:34:20,830 --> 00:34:26,350
can only write to your apps isolated

900
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:28,000
storage area and there are three ways of

901
00:34:26,350 --> 00:34:30,580
doing that so there's real basic kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

902
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:33,550
key value pair storage with isolated

903
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:35,679
storage settings at the top the next<font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font>

904
00:34:33,550 --> 00:34:38,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">delam is isolated storage file where you</font>

905
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:42,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">can create directories folder structures</font>

906
00:34:38,590 --> 00:34:43,750
store text buying your<font color="#CCCCCC"> XML files and at</font>

907
00:34:42,129 --> 00:34:45,879
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> bottom you have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the ability</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to use</font>

908
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:47,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">the sequel database so that's sequel</font>

909
00:34:45,879 --> 00:34:50,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">siiii</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think quite recently there was a</font>

910
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:53,550
lie be bought out to use sequel light

911
00:34:50,790 --> 00:34:58,120
but by default you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can use sequel see</font>

912
00:34:53,550 --> 00:35:00,550
and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> now that brings us may be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> onto</font>

913
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:03,279
application security because those are

914
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:05,980
what i see is the key platform security

915
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:09,610
features now<font color="#CCCCCC"> i want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at how you</font>

916
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:11,440
write secure code for<font color="#E5E5E5"> that platform now</font>

917
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:13,090
what I'm going to do though is take a

918
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:15,910
little bit of a detour for maybe five

919
00:35:13,090 --> 00:35:17,980
minutes away<font color="#CCCCCC"> from windows phone and onto</font>

920
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:19,779
mobile application security in general

921
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:21,820
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually I probably should have</font>

922
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:23,590
submitted a talk on<font color="#CCCCCC"> that but it's too</font>

923
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:26,980
late now so I'm going to shoehorn it a

924
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:30,280
little bit into here and because in my

925
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:32,860
eyes a mobile application<font color="#CCCCCC"> security</font>

926
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:35,650
introduces no new issues for<font color="#CCCCCC"> us as</font>

927
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:37,480
application security people now some

928
00:35:35,650 --> 00:35:39,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">people some people have certainly</font>

929
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:42,970
disagree to me saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> that in the past</font>

930
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:45,520
but I think when you really look<font color="#CCCCCC"> at the</font>

931
00:35:42,970 --> 00:35:48,640
problems we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen and carry on scene</font>

932
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:50,050
in mobile apps out there I don't think

933
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:51,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's anything new there's nothing</font>

934
00:35:50,050 --> 00:35:53,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we didn't already know about</font>

935
00:35:51,790 --> 00:35:55,750
there's nothing<font color="#CCCCCC"> out there that we don't</font>

936
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:57,520
already know how to review for and tests

937
00:35:55,750 --> 00:35:59,350
for and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to give you some</font>

938
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:00,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">specific examples of that later so you</font>

939
00:35:59,350 --> 00:36:03,370
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> just have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to take my word for it</font>

940
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:05,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">but what I encourage people to do is not</font>

941
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:07,540
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> on mobile app security but app</font>

942
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:09,640
security in general is take a step away

943
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:11,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">from the vulnerabilities for a second</font>

944
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:13,210
because if you get bogged down and all

945
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:14,830
the intricate details of sequel

946
00:36:13,210 --> 00:36:16,840
injection or cross-site scripting or

947
00:36:14,830 --> 00:36:18,700
whatever it might be I think sometimes

948
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:21,610
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> lose sight of what you're actually</font>

949
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:23,140
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to achieve and specifically when</font>

950
00:36:21,610 --> 00:36:25,060
you're talking to<font color="#E5E5E5"> developers do you need</font>

951
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:26,740
to tell them about all these fancy ways

952
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:28,299
of exploits and secretly injection do

953
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:31,600
you need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell them how to write code</font>

954
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:32,710
to prevent sequel injection so I try<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

955
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:35,020
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> people to think about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the root</font>

956
00:36:32,710 --> 00:36:38,620
causes behind common vulnerabilities and

957
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:41,890
my root causes or I<font color="#E5E5E5"> suppose the way to</font>

958
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:43,960
prevent those root causes it's the

959
00:36:41,890 --> 00:36:45,549
principles of secure development so I

960
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:47,440
have this list so doing things that

961
00:36:45,550 --> 00:36:48,910
input validation output validation

962
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:50,830
arahan doing all those things right

963
00:36:48,910 --> 00:36:53,290
should prevent all those issues

964
00:36:50,830 --> 00:36:56,080
happening in your coat now what I want

965
00:36:53,290 --> 00:36:58,990
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do is take a look at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that list</font>

966
00:36:56,080 --> 00:37:00,940
and think about three from that list the

967
00:36:58,990 --> 00:37:02,859
three<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you might think are the most</font>

968
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:05,160
important things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we need to deal</font>

969
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:08,620
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> in mobile app security right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now</font>

970
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:10,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay does anyone want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to shout out what</font>

971
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:20,470
they think any of that top three might

972
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:22,480
be okay privacy session Hamlin stolen

973
00:37:20,470 --> 00:37:24,700
secrets yes so there's two<font color="#CCCCCC"> of those are</font>

974
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:26,230
on my top three I don't have input

975
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:27,759
validation I don't have session

976
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:30,820
management on my tattoo<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I'll explain</font>

977
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:33,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">why in a minute but privacy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and secure</font>

978
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:35,820
storage in general are two of my top

979
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:37,930
three so my top three is secure storage

980
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:40,900
authentication<font color="#CCCCCC"> and authorization and</font>

981
00:37:37,930 --> 00:37:42,640
secure resource access / privacy and

982
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:44,350
I'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> explain these a bit more in a</font>

983
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:47,529
minute so i'll explain boy i've picked

984
00:37:44,350 --> 00:37:48,640
those three so what<font color="#CCCCCC"> i want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do is to</font>

985
00:37:47,530 --> 00:37:50,680
make<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure that I'm not just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> making this</font>

986
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:52,990
up by myself<font color="#CCCCCC"> or when we compared their</font>

987
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:55,000
top three<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the OS top</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 mobile</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> risks</font>

988
00:37:52,990 --> 00:37:56,919
and found that fifty percent of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that top</font>

989
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:59,290
10 were related to secure storage and

990
00:37:56,920 --> 00:38:00,280
secure communications twenty percent to

991
00:37:59,290 --> 00:38:04,270
authentication and authorization

992
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:05,740
actually zero percent privacy<font color="#E5E5E5"> I put an</font>

993
00:38:04,270 --> 00:38:07,600
asterisk there because when I saw<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

994
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:09,220
it raised a question that

995
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:12,819
I probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> not asked myself in the past</font>

996
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:14,770
around whether violations of privacy and

997
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:17,260
privacy concerns our application

998
00:38:14,770 --> 00:38:19,480
securities problem now we're probably in

999
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:21,220
the best position to spot them in that

1000
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:24,100
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at the app we're looking</font>

1001
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:26,470
at the source code but we don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> normally</font>

1002
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:28,569
write if you think about accessing user

1003
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:30,759
contacts and send them<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a web service</font>

1004
00:38:28,570 --> 00:38:32,920
and we looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at from a privacy point</font>

1005
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:35,170
of view or are we just bothered about it

1006
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:37,360
using SSL or not when it sends them I

1007
00:38:35,170 --> 00:38:39,370
don't know the<font color="#CCCCCC"> answer to that it was</font>

1008
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:41,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">just a question i had when i saw none of</font>

1010

1011
00:38:43,390 --> 00:38:48,790
mobile app security so what I also<font color="#E5E5E5"> did</font>

1012
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:50,650
them<font color="#CCCCCC"> they took that top three in compare</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to the OS mobile controls project</font>

1014
00:38:50,650 --> 00:38:53,890
which i actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> think is one of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1015
00:38:51,910 --> 00:38:56,170
best things<font color="#E5E5E5"> to come out of our spin the</font>

1016
00:38:53,890 --> 00:38:59,770
last<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of years that's a list of I</font>

1017
00:38:56,170 --> 00:39:02,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">think 70 basically a list of 70 things</font>

1018
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:04,630
you should do right to produce a secure

1019
00:39:02,230 --> 00:39:06,670
mobile app and back end web services for

1020
00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:08,200
that so I compared it to that and again

1021
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:10,630
secure storage at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the top and then</font>

1022
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:12,759
sixteen percent rounding up round and

1023
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:14,530
down for secure communications

1024
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:17,230
authentication and authorization and

1025
00:39:14,530 --> 00:39:18,910
secure resource access another astrix

1026
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:21,850
there for secure resource access because

1027
00:39:18,910 --> 00:39:23,200
my definition of privacy and secure

1028
00:39:21,850 --> 00:39:26,380
resource access start<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get a little</font>

1030

1031
00:39:30,430 --> 00:39:35,740
them was go and look at this was the big

1032
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:36,940
mobile issues that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have seen</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> probably</font>

1033
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:39,069
the ones that we've read<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the news</font>

1034
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:41,770
we've tweeted about we've laughed about

1035
00:39:39,070 --> 00:39:44,380
maybe at times and try to look at the

1036
00:39:41,770 --> 00:39:46,540
root cause there and while<font color="#CCCCCC"> I started</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1037
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:49,600
find was that<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah you know what we've</font>

1038
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:52,509
seen so<font color="#E5E5E5"> far is kind of supporting my top</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">and authorization i want to spend a tiny</font>

1051
00:40:19,270 --> 00:40:23,800
to explain it<font color="#CCCCCC"> was a bit about</font>

1052
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:25,510
why or what I think they are so

1053
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:27,120
authentication and authorization I see

1054
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:29,200
that it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of three</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> different areas</font>

1055
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:31,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">authentication and authorization in</font>

1056
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:33,879
terms of user login on to a nap or

1057
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:35,950
putting in the pin you know

1058
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:37,930
authentication<font color="#E5E5E5"> authorization to web</font>

1059
00:40:35,950 --> 00:40:40,149
services and then I think more

1060
00:40:37,930 --> 00:40:42,430
importantly authentication and

1061
00:40:40,150 --> 00:40:45,940
authorization when you want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> access</font>

1062
00:40:42,430 --> 00:40:47,410
users data on the device and that's

1063
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:48,940
where foods button is the first one I

1064
00:40:47,410 --> 00:40:50,950
put there because they had this piece of

1065
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:52,660
functionality way you could tell them to

1066
00:40:50,950 --> 00:40:55,450
go and find your<font color="#E5E5E5"> friends who use that</font>

1067
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:57,790
service so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you did say yeah I want you</font>

1068
00:40:55,450 --> 00:40:59,319
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> find my friends but I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think it</font>

1069
00:40:57,790 --> 00:41:01,000
was clear what you're actually

1070
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:03,580
authorizing them to do because what they

1071
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:07,060
did was take all your email contacts off

1072
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:08,529
the device and send it over non ssl to

1073
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:10,779
their web service to try and find your

1074
00:41:08,530 --> 00:41:12,130
friends so I haven't got that in there

1075
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:14,740
was a privacy violation because

1076
00:41:12,130 --> 00:41:16,840
technically the user said yeah do that

1077
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:20,169
but I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it was clear and off</font>

1078
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:22,810
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the user Google Wallet the top one</font>

1079
00:41:20,170 --> 00:41:24,310
was because you could brute force a hash

1080
00:41:22,810 --> 00:41:26,410
they had on the advice for their four

1081
00:41:24,310 --> 00:41:27,700
digit<font color="#CCCCCC"> pin but the second one I want to</font>

1082
00:41:26,410 --> 00:41:30,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">tell you about because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I actually found</font>

1083
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:32,950
it quite funny they still use the four

1084
00:41:30,790 --> 00:41:35,050
digit<font color="#E5E5E5"> pin but if you cleared the</font>

1085
00:41:32,950 --> 00:41:36,850
application data on the device it

1086
00:41:35,050 --> 00:41:39,340
cleared the pin and then asked you to

1087
00:41:36,850 --> 00:41:41,380
set a new<font color="#CCCCCC"> pin so if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I pick up your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> phone</font>

1088
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:43,720
off your desk they can clear that up

1089
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:46,000
date and I'll set your new pin for you

1090
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:47,529
and access<font color="#CCCCCC"> your Google Wallet so it</font>

1091
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,880
shows you know we might sometimes think

1092
00:41:47,530 --> 00:41:50,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">of these things as I'll know what makes</font>

1093
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:52,420
those kind of mistakes<font color="#E5E5E5"> but you know</font>

1094
00:41:50,290 --> 00:41:54,550
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are some pretty big names upon the</font>

1095
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:56,650
screen right and if they're making those

1096
00:41:54,550 --> 00:41:58,870
mistakes how many of the rest of those

1097
00:41:56,650 --> 00:42:01,870
million-plus apps have similar mistakes

1098
00:41:58,870 --> 00:42:04,330
in them and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> for secure resource</font>

1099
00:42:01,870 --> 00:42:05,740
access and privacy I'm you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know again</font>

1100
00:42:04,330 --> 00:42:08,049
looking at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this in a few different ways</font>

1101
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:10,959
firstly there's just the blatant privacy

1102
00:42:08,050 --> 00:42:13,780
violation so path and hipster their

1103
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:15,490
default opt-out functionality of grab

1104
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:17,640
and all your user contacts and uploading

1105
00:42:15,490 --> 00:42:20,319
it to their web service by default is

1106
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:23,980
just straight-up violation of privacy

1107
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:25,780
you know Carrier IQ I won't dwell on

1108
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:28,780
that one too much but it was essentially

1109
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:31,270
a OEM rootkit no<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think anyone</font>

1110
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:33,610
ever proved that what it stored on the

1111
00:42:31,270 --> 00:42:34,880
device was sent remotely anywhere what I

1112
00:42:33,610 --> 00:42:36,920
did log things like

1113
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:39,410
your keystrokes and a few other things

1114
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:41,410
but the mobile ad libraries is something

1115
00:42:39,410 --> 00:42:43,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">I want to focus on a bit more because</font>

1116
00:42:41,410 --> 00:42:45,288
they're potentially dangerous

1117
00:42:43,250 --> 00:42:47,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">third-party code you're including now</font>

1118
00:42:45,289 --> 00:42:50,450
people are probably aware your absolute

1119
00:42:47,329 --> 00:42:53,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">Android so apps like angry bird on</font>

1120
00:42:50,450 --> 00:42:55,759
Android the ad supported on iOS you pay

1121
00:42:53,450 --> 00:42:57,348
for them you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know you might have loads</font>

1122
00:42:55,759 --> 00:43:00,950
of different reasons for<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanting to have</font>

1123
00:42:57,349 --> 00:43:02,900
ad within your mobile app what you need

1124
00:43:00,950 --> 00:43:06,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be aware of is some of these mobile</font>

1125
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:08,150
ad libraries a pretty dodgy and so there

1126
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:10,279
was a piece of research published I

1127
00:43:08,150 --> 00:43:11,720
think by a<font color="#CCCCCC"> German university thing in</font>

1128
00:43:10,279 --> 00:43:12,799
December and I can give people<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1129
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:14,538
linker i'll put the link on my blog

1130
00:43:12,799 --> 00:43:17,440
later when<font color="#E5E5E5"> i put the slides up there</font>

1131
00:43:14,539 --> 00:43:20,420
well<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think they analyzed 100,000 apps</font>

1132
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:22,490
in the android marketplace looked at the

1133
00:43:20,420 --> 00:43:23,900
mobile ad library they used and they

1134
00:43:22,490 --> 00:43:25,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">found these libraries we're doing all</font>

1135
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:27,740
kinds of things so you have the really

1143

question that we haven't probably really

1148
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:55,069
because if these libraries are included

1149
00:43:51,890 --> 00:43:55,910
in your app and still the users data who

1150

do you think<font color="#E5E5E5"> is going to get the</font>

1154
00:44:03,470 --> 00:44:07,939
again you<font color="#CCCCCC"> just need to be aware</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of that</font>

1155
00:44:05,450 --> 00:44:09,470
and before and that you might have

still have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to address the rest of them</font>

1164
00:44:23,210 --> 00:44:27,859
but these are the<font color="#E5E5E5"> three that I see is</font>

1165
00:44:25,309 --> 00:44:29,990
the biggest issues right now<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so if</font>

1166
00:44:27,859 --> 00:44:32,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">usually if you got a back end web</font>

1167
00:44:29,990 --> 00:44:33,558
service that other apps talk to well

1168
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:35,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">obviously you need to do input</font>

1169
00:44:33,559 --> 00:44:38,569
validation you know you can't<font color="#CCCCCC"> ignore the</font>

1170
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:40,549
rest of them but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the problems or at</font>

1171
00:44:38,569 --> 00:44:43,160
least the problems we're seeing found

1172
00:44:40,549 --> 00:44:45,349
and talked<font color="#E5E5E5"> about are largely these three</font>

1173
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:47,839
at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> moment well on top of that</font>

1174
00:44:45,349 --> 00:44:48,560
because this is I<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Windows</font>

1175
00:44:47,839 --> 00:44:50,180
Phone 7

1176
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:51,950
we can come back<font color="#E5E5E5"> off that detour now I</font>

1177
00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:54,109
didn't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> have time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to cover all of</font>

1178
00:44:51,950 --> 00:44:55,730
those issues anyway so I tried<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1179
00:44:54,110 --> 00:44:57,680
whittle it down to three and then I

1180
00:44:55,730 --> 00:45:00,110
found<font color="#E5E5E5"> that well three didn't quite cut</font>

1181
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:02,450
it because secure communications is also

1182
00:45:00,110 --> 00:45:04,340
incredibly important because especially

1183
00:45:02,450 --> 00:45:07,129
when you think about Windows Phone 7

1184
00:45:04,340 --> 00:45:08,750
where we're actually saying you need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1185
00:45:07,130 --> 00:45:10,670
store<font color="#E5E5E5"> your data elsewhere if you want to</font>

1186
00:45:08,750 --> 00:45:12,770
share<font color="#CCCCCC"> it with another app so you might</font>

1187
00:45:10,670 --> 00:45:14,540
have to make requests over the web to

1188
00:45:12,770 --> 00:45:17,509
sequel as your for example from

1189
00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:19,279
Microsoft so I kind of came up with new

1190
00:45:17,510 --> 00:45:20,810
top three so it could include secure

1191
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:22,970
communications in<font color="#CCCCCC"> this so just data</font>

1192
00:45:20,810 --> 00:45:25,880
security in general so secure storage

1193
00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:28,129
and secure communications we still have

1194
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:30,140
authentication<font color="#E5E5E5"> authorization and then</font>

1195
00:45:28,130 --> 00:45:34,460
final one I've changed data access and

1196
00:45:30,140 --> 00:45:36,859
privacy I came<font color="#CCCCCC"> some back to Windows</font>

1197
00:45:34,460 --> 00:45:39,350
Phone 7 and how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we address these</font>

1198
00:45:36,860 --> 00:45:41,420
things well the<font color="#CCCCCC"> first thing I always</font>

1199
00:45:39,350 --> 00:45:43,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">tell people is actually understand</font>

1200
00:45:41,420 --> 00:45:46,580
whether you need to store sensitive data

1201
00:45:43,790 --> 00:45:48,710
on the device in the first place<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if</font>

1202
00:45:46,580 --> 00:45:50,360
you do Microsoft give us a couple of

1203
00:45:48,710 --> 00:45:52,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">things to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> help us there so we can</font>

1204
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:56,060
encrypt data or we can encrypt data

1205
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:57,860
bases and windows phone seven so if you

1206
00:45:56,060 --> 00:46:00,170
create a new<font color="#E5E5E5"> database you can encrypt it</font>

1207
00:45:57,860 --> 00:46:02,210
from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> very start you can't retrofit</font>

1208
00:46:00,170 --> 00:46:05,360
encryption to the database if you want

1209
00:46:02,210 --> 00:46:07,760
to encrypt files passwords pins and

1210
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:09,710
notice they said encrypt passwords which

1211
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:12,560
should set off alarm bells and some of

1212
00:46:09,710 --> 00:46:14,660
your minds<font color="#E5E5E5"> hopefully we use the data</font>

1213
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:17,000
protection<font color="#CCCCCC"> ap ice that's been around for</font>

1214
00:46:14,660 --> 00:46:20,089
like 13 years Microsoft first introduced

1215
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:22,520
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Windows 2000 it isn't the full data</font>

1216
00:46:20,090 --> 00:46:25,880
protection API but that's what's used on

1217
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:29,090
Windows Phone for encryption and

1218
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:30,710
decryption of values now this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> where</font>

1219
00:46:29,090 --> 00:46:33,980
we get<font color="#CCCCCC"> into what I mentioned earlier</font>

1220
00:46:30,710 --> 00:46:37,880
around security requirements and making

1221
00:46:33,980 --> 00:46:39,080
application security easy because what

1222
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:41,720
we're saying here is we can encrypt

1223
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:43,819
databases and we can encrypt values but

1224
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:46,580
we can't do<font color="#CCCCCC"> hashim we don't get to</font>

1225
00:46:43,820 --> 00:46:48,980
select algorithms we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get any of</font>

1226
00:46:46,580 --> 00:46:51,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">the nice things security people might</font>

1227
00:46:48,980 --> 00:46:55,370
define as requirements for cryptography

1228
00:46:51,850 --> 00:46:57,710
but cryptography is made incredibly easy

1229
00:46:55,370 --> 00:46:59,480
for developers so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is where you</font>

1230
00:46:57,710 --> 00:47:02,580
start to figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out well which which one</font>

1231
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:03,930
is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> most important to us now I will</font>

1232
00:47:02,580 --> 00:47:07,259
before<font color="#CCCCCC"> I jump forward I will say that</font>

1233
00:47:03,930 --> 00:47:09,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">you can still use the normal system</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> dot</font>

1234
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:12,570
security dark cryptography class but you

1235
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:13,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't get any of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the ease of use and you</font>

1236
00:47:12,570 --> 00:47:14,970
don't get some of the things I'll tell

1237
00:47:13,890 --> 00:47:18,390
you about<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a minute with data</font>

1238
00:47:14,970 --> 00:47:20,220
protection API and to me I think you'd

1239
00:47:18,390 --> 00:47:23,900
actually end up potentially with a lower

1240
00:47:20,220 --> 00:47:25,919
level of security trying to implement a

1241
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:29,400
system that security that cryptography

1242
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:33,120
properly then use one of these that's

1243
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:35,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">open to debate of it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> seem so one of the</font>

1244
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:37,620
drawbacks<font color="#CCCCCC"> red away is the database</font>

1245
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:38,940
encryption is based on password<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that</font>

1246
00:47:37,620 --> 00:47:41,670
means you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to have a password in</font>

1247
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:44,520
your source code<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay which is not great</font>

1248
00:47:41,670 --> 00:47:46,290
but when they encrypt the database it

1249
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:48,450
uses AES hundred and<font color="#E5E5E5"> twenty eight bit</font>

1250
00:47:46,290 --> 00:47:51,509
and they<font color="#CCCCCC"> store the password hash down</font>

1251
00:47:48,450 --> 00:47:53,460
the device using shell 256 but as I said

1252
00:47:51,510 --> 00:47:56,880
that password<font color="#CCCCCC"> salima clear in your</font>

1253
00:47:53,460 --> 00:47:58,830
source code and this this<font color="#E5E5E5"> bullet point</font>

1254
00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:00,300
is supposed at the bottom is a little

1255
00:47:58,830 --> 00:48:02,009
bit of<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lie but not for the reason you</font>

1256
00:48:00,300 --> 00:48:03,540
might think you might think well it must

1257
00:48:02,010 --> 00:48:06,780
be harder than two lines of code but it

1258
00:48:03,540 --> 00:48:09,690
actually isn't now if you're creating a

1259
00:48:06,780 --> 00:48:12,420
database anyway well for a developer the

1260
00:48:09,690 --> 00:48:14,460
only thing they have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do differently d</font>

1261
00:48:12,420 --> 00:48:17,210
an encrypted database is that that

1262
00:48:14,460 --> 00:48:19,410
password parameter on the end that's

1263
00:48:17,210 --> 00:48:22,020
cryptography taken care of for them in

1264
00:48:19,410 --> 00:48:23,970
terms of encrypting a database now again

1265
00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:25,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's a bit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of a conflict for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font>

1266
00:48:23,970 --> 00:48:26,580
because I look at that and I think I

1267
00:48:25,020 --> 00:48:28,770
love that but then on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> flip side I</font>

1268
00:48:26,580 --> 00:48:29,970
think there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of things I don't</font>

do or really high security requirements

1274

that we might never get right I<font color="#E5E5E5"> suppose</font>

1275

it depends on who you are<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what</font>

you're aiming for so what we might want

1277
00:48:47,970 --> 00:48:50,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do though is you might not want to</font>

1278
00:48:48,990 --> 00:48:52,049
encrypt database you might not even use

1279
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:55,020
databases you might want to actually

1280
00:48:52,050 --> 00:48:56,640
encrypt like a file or password you know

1281
00:48:55,020 --> 00:48:58,290
and I keep mentioning encrypting

1282
00:48:56,640 --> 00:49:00,569
passwords because you don't get the

1283
00:48:58,290 --> 00:49:02,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">ability to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do assault and hash mark</font>

1284
00:49:00,570 --> 00:49:04,290
without using the normal cryptography

1285
00:49:02,610 --> 00:49:06,780
class which again brings in a lot of

1286
00:49:04,290 --> 00:49:08,940
difficulties what you're going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> use is</font>

1287
00:49:06,780 --> 00:49:11,430
the protected data class and just two

1288
00:49:08,940 --> 00:49:13,140
methods to protect and<font color="#E5E5E5"> unprotect methods</font>

1289
00:49:11,430 --> 00:49:15,600
and think of those as encrypt and

1290
00:49:13,140 --> 00:49:16,410
decrypt methods and they really really

1291
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:18,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">do make this</font>

1292
00:49:16,410 --> 00:49:21,029
easy for developers and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll show you</font>

1293
00:49:18,350 --> 00:49:23,549
example in code and second and that it

1294
00:49:21,030 --> 00:49:25,290
does encryption with<font color="#CCCCCC"> AES ok so again you</font>

1295
00:49:23,550 --> 00:49:26,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't get to pick it out with them but</font>

1296
00:49:25,290 --> 00:49:28,920
then there are a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> good things</font>

1297
00:49:26,250 --> 00:49:30,780
there as well because what the data

1298
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:33,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">protection API does for you is it takes</font>

1299
00:49:30,780 --> 00:49:35,520
care of key management because you don't

1300
00:49:33,060 --> 00:49:37,049
get anything like the<font color="#E5E5E5"> keychain that you</font>

1301
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:39,780
have an iOS you don't get anything like

1302
00:49:37,050 --> 00:49:42,830
down on windows phone 7 but if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> use</font>

1303
00:49:39,780 --> 00:49:45,240
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> data protection API you kind of do</font>

1304
00:49:42,830 --> 00:49:47,460
because it will generate keys for you

1305
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:49,649
and securely store them and when you're

1306
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:51,780
writing code to do encryption and

1307
00:49:49,650 --> 00:49:53,040
decryption you don't have to know the

1308
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:55,770
key name you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have to know its</font>

1309
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:58,259
location all you call is to protect to

1310
00:49:55,770 --> 00:50:00,600
unprotect method data protection<font color="#CCCCCC"> API</font>

1311
00:49:58,260 --> 00:50:04,080
takes care of calling the right key for

1312
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:06,839
you and it<font color="#E5E5E5"> really is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that simple and</font>

1313
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:10,170
i'll show you literally three lines of

1314
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:13,440
code to store something encrypted and

1315
00:50:10,170 --> 00:50:15,270
then to decrypt it later so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can see</font>

1316
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:17,070
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> three lines of code here in our</font>

1317
00:50:15,270 --> 00:50:20,310
encrypt value method so the first one is

1318
00:50:17,070 --> 00:50:22,500
my super secure password and then down

1319
00:50:20,310 --> 00:50:24,570
on the second line we're using<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1320
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:27,110
protect method here from the protected

1321
00:50:24,570 --> 00:50:30,570
data class who passed the password in

1322
00:50:27,110 --> 00:50:32,490
nats it encrypted<font color="#CCCCCC"> the line below that is</font>

1323
00:50:30,570 --> 00:50:33,930
just calling the right data method lower

1324
00:50:32,490 --> 00:50:37,319
down which allows me<font color="#CCCCCC"> to write to</font>

1325
00:50:33,930 --> 00:50:40,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">isolated storage</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but that's it there's</font>

1326
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:42,180
no no none of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the I suppose normal</font>

1327
00:50:40,020 --> 00:50:44,790
craziness that we might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be used to in</font>

1328
00:50:42,180 --> 00:50:46,919
terms of doing encryption and again you

1329
00:50:44,790 --> 00:50:49,230
have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> consider the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> trade offs but that</font>

1330
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:51,840
does make cryptography incredibly easy

1331
00:50:49,230 --> 00:50:53,700
for a developer right and then you see

1332
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:55,920
here the decrypt value method is just

1333
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:57,810
the opposite we read the password from

1334
00:50:55,920 --> 00:51:00,630
isolated storage and then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> use this</font>

1335
00:50:57,810 --> 00:51:04,290
unprotect method here pass in our

1336
00:51:00,630 --> 00:51:07,230
password value and it's decrypted<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

1337
00:51:04,290 --> 00:51:08,670
so as I said there's trade-offs there

1338
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:11,910
and you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out what what's</font>

1339
00:51:08,670 --> 00:51:13,770
most important to you<font color="#E5E5E5"> now the next you I</font>

1340
00:51:11,910 --> 00:51:15,930
knew I'd be<font color="#E5E5E5"> running out of time so I've</font>

1341
00:51:13,770 --> 00:51:19,050
not gone<font color="#E5E5E5"> into quite as much</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> detail on</font>

1342
00:51:15,930 --> 00:51:21,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">these before you know on top of the time</font>

1343
00:51:19,050 --> 00:51:24,510
issue I actually think the other issues

1344
00:51:21,330 --> 00:51:25,920
are in more ways than the secure sword I

1345
00:51:24,510 --> 00:51:28,230
think they're more about good design

1346
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:30,299
good security code reviews in good test

1347
00:51:28,230 --> 00:51:31,979
and because when you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think about secure</font>

1348
00:51:30,299 --> 00:51:35,249
<font color="#E5E5E5">Communications regardless of the</font>

1349
00:51:31,979 --> 00:51:37,428
platform you need to identify places in

1350
00:51:35,249 --> 00:51:41,428
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> app where you might</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be sending</font>

1351
00:51:37,429 --> 00:51:43,109
sensitive data right so that comes in my

1352
00:51:41,429 --> 00:51:44,759
opinion down to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the design and down to</font>

1353
00:51:43,109 --> 00:51:46,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">your code review and security test and</font>

1354
00:51:44,759 --> 00:51:48,900
analyzing the code<font color="#CCCCCC"> analyze and</font>

1355
00:51:46,469 --> 00:51:52,589
communications data sent from the app

1356
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:54,569
and that's incredibly important windows

1357
00:51:52,589 --> 00:51:56,880
phone<font color="#CCCCCC"> 7 if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to share</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> data</font>

1358
00:51:54,569 --> 00:51:58,709
between apps because<font color="#CCCCCC"> I said before you</font>

1359
00:51:56,880 --> 00:52:01,259
can't do that<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the device you have to</font>

1360
00:51:58,709 --> 00:52:03,779
go off device to do that so it's likely

1361
00:52:01,259 --> 00:52:05,489
that sensitive data will be sent over

1362
00:52:03,779 --> 00:52:07,920
the internet to something like sequel of

1363
00:52:05,489 --> 00:52:09,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">zero so you can store it in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a sequel</font>

1364
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:12,509
database in the cloud so other apps can

1365
00:52:09,689 --> 00:52:13,890
access it then the final point comes

1366
00:52:12,509 --> 00:52:15,660
back to what I said well let's start

1367
00:52:13,890 --> 00:52:18,868
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> this being a consumer not an</font>

1368
00:52:15,660 --> 00:52:20,910
enterprise OS in that you can't use

1369
00:52:18,869 --> 00:52:24,420
client-side ssl cert so you can't do

1370
00:52:20,910 --> 00:52:26,399
mutual SSL authentication and there's no

1371
00:52:24,420 --> 00:52:28,469
inbuilt VPN functionality either in

1372
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:30,319
Windows Phone 7 which again for an

1373
00:52:28,469 --> 00:52:35,369
enterprise to me those are two pretty

1374
00:52:30,319 --> 00:52:37,529
significant drawbacks in my opinion so

1375
00:52:35,369 --> 00:52:39,809
again authentication authorization I

1376
00:52:37,529 --> 00:52:42,509
think this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is another</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one where it's</font>

1377
00:52:39,809 --> 00:52:44,519
more about good<font color="#E5E5E5"> design and good review</font>

1378
00:52:42,509 --> 00:52:47,160
good test and and understand it actually

1379
00:52:44,519 --> 00:52:49,410
what are you trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do do you need to</font>

1380
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:50,699
authenticate the users to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the device do</font>

1381
00:52:49,410 --> 00:52:52,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">you need to authenticate when you go to</font>

1382
00:52:50,699 --> 00:52:54,689
the web service and more importantly

1383
00:52:52,589 --> 00:52:56,489
when you access users data and it's

1384
00:52:54,689 --> 00:52:59,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">always important to remember that that</font>

1385
00:52:56,489 --> 00:53:03,359
is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> users data not your data that you</font>

1386
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:04,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">ask before</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you do that and I know and</font>

1387
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:07,288
this final point says it that

1388
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:09,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">technically we already did asked to do</font>

1389
00:53:07,289 --> 00:53:11,429
some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the things that users might not</font>

1390
00:53:09,660 --> 00:53:12,629
be happy about so in<font color="#E5E5E5"> our capabilities</font>

1391
00:53:11,429 --> 00:53:15,209
we've already told them<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we're going</font>

1392
00:53:12,630 --> 00:53:16,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">to read SMS but think about it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font>

1393
00:53:15,209 --> 00:53:18,390
another point of view if you have the

1394
00:53:16,650 --> 00:53:20,640
capability in there to say you read SMS

1395
00:53:18,390 --> 00:53:23,479
but then you write your codes read their

1396
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:26,009
SMS and upload them to a web service

1397
00:53:23,479 --> 00:53:28,169
we've got members of the security press

1398
00:53:26,009 --> 00:53:29,400
here who you know what kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of spin do</font>

1399
00:53:28,170 --> 00:53:31,949
you think they're going to put on that

1400
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:34,019
do you think they'll say and the two of

1401
00:53:31,949 --> 00:53:35,759
their you'd shrugging I think you know I

1402
00:53:34,019 --> 00:53:37,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">know what kind of spin your put on that</font>

1403
00:53:35,759 --> 00:53:39,059
I don't think you'll say it's fine

1404
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:41,609
because they asked<font color="#CCCCCC"> for permission for it</font>

1405
00:53:39,059 --> 00:53:43,980
you'll say XYZ company was uploading SMS

1406
00:53:41,609 --> 00:53:45,779
messages right so

1407
00:53:43,980 --> 00:53:47,490
again just because you have it as a

1408
00:53:45,780 --> 00:53:49,590
capability or as a permission you should

1409
00:53:47,490 --> 00:53:52,410
still make sure at least once that you

1410
00:53:49,590 --> 00:53:55,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">say look I'm going to access your SMS</font>

1411
00:53:52,410 --> 00:53:57,180
but this is what i'm going to do because

1412
00:53:55,230 --> 00:53:59,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">yeah technically we already did ask but</font>

1413
00:53:57,180 --> 00:54:02,180
I I wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> recommend that as your only</font>

1414
00:53:59,220 --> 00:54:05,310
defense and then data access and privacy

1415
00:54:02,180 --> 00:54:08,009
again I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is one actually which</font>

1416
00:54:05,310 --> 00:54:10,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">IMI's and even so he</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> isn't even</font>

1417
00:54:08,010 --> 00:54:13,500
application security specific let alone

1418
00:54:10,230 --> 00:54:15,900
mobile app security specific because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1419
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:18,060
should already understand the types of

1420
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:20,520
data you use an access in your business

1421
00:54:18,060 --> 00:54:22,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">but where it becomes a bit different is</font>

1422
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:24,690
if you already have kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of data access</font>

1423
00:54:22,710 --> 00:54:26,490
policies around what you can can't

1424
00:54:24,690 --> 00:54:28,619
access where you store<font color="#E5E5E5"> it how you store</font>

1425
00:54:26,490 --> 00:54:31,529
how you destroy<font color="#CCCCCC"> it you might not have</font>

1426
00:54:28,619 --> 00:54:34,440
included mobile specific data in it yet

1427
00:54:31,530 --> 00:54:36,600
so make sure that you have these data

1428
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:38,520
policies a privacy policy around all

1429
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:40,890
that all the things we should<font color="#CCCCCC"> have for</font>

1430
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:42,900
other data make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure they include the</font>

1431
00:54:40,890 --> 00:54:45,359
mobile data and make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that when you</font>

1432
00:54:42,900 --> 00:54:47,340
design develop review these applications

1433
00:54:45,359 --> 00:54:49,830
that you consider those things as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well</font>

1434
00:54:47,340 --> 00:54:52,230
and lastly one of the things I've seen

1435
00:54:49,830 --> 00:54:54,750
lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of people miss is not looking at</font>

1436
00:54:52,230 --> 00:54:57,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">the data</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the app sends their focus too</font>

1437
00:54:54,750 --> 00:54:58,740
much on looking at it from a static

1438
00:54:57,150 --> 00:55:01,200
analysis point of you just looking at

1439
00:54:58,740 --> 00:55:02,700
the source<font color="#CCCCCC"> code you need to look at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

1440
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:04,080
is the absent and are they leaking

1441
00:55:02,700 --> 00:55:05,939
anything that might tie those

1442
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:09,480
communications back to a specific device

1443
00:55:05,940 --> 00:55:11,030
we've seen cases that happening so again

1444
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:13,109
don't just look at the source code

1445
00:55:11,030 --> 00:55:16,470
consider looking at what it's actually

1446
00:55:13,109 --> 00:55:18,029
sending as well and then I've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

1447
00:55:16,470 --> 00:55:21,259
literally a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of minutes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to show</font>

1448
00:55:18,030 --> 00:55:24,119
you a couple of demonstrations now so

1449
00:55:21,260 --> 00:55:25,920
what I said<font color="#CCCCCC"> is on this Windows Phone app</font>

1450
00:55:24,119 --> 00:55:28,350
analyze what it will actually do for you

1451
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:30,750
is if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the Windows Phone app</font>

1452
00:55:28,350 --> 00:55:32,460
file a decompile that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> turn it back</font>

1453
00:55:30,750 --> 00:55:34,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">into the original source code for you</font>

1454
00:55:32,460 --> 00:55:36,660
and then do<font color="#CCCCCC"> some kind of keyword</font>

1455
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:38,790
highlighting in there so it'll draw your

1456
00:55:36,660 --> 00:55:40,830
attention to parts of the code where you

1457
00:55:38,790 --> 00:55:43,680
might be writing things to isolated

1458
00:55:40,830 --> 00:55:45,540
storage so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is open source on</font>

1459
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:47,700
sourceforge and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I know not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone will</font>

1460
00:55:45,540 --> 00:55:50,250
have access to Windows Phone apps test

1461
00:55:47,700 --> 00:55:53,759
this with some<font color="#CCCCCC"> I to Windows Phone apps</font>

1462
00:55:50,250 --> 00:55:55,830
are also part of that project in

1463
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:57,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">sourceforge so you can download</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it you</font>

1464
00:55:55,830 --> 00:55:57,779
can look at my code and<font color="#E5E5E5"> see if I've made</font>

1465
00:55:57,359 --> 00:56:00,930
in

1466
00:55:57,780 --> 00:56:02,910
security mistakes<font color="#CCCCCC"> / base if you if you</font>

1467
00:56:00,930 --> 00:56:05,339
browse<font color="#E5E5E5"> through Windows Phone app file</font>

1468
00:56:02,910 --> 00:56:07,890
here so this is my security dashboard

1469
00:56:05,340 --> 00:56:09,920
app so it's a dot zap fire which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1470
00:56:07,890 --> 00:56:13,529
format use for these apps and click scan

1471
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:14,910
what it'll try to do is it'll unzip the

1472
00:56:13,530 --> 00:56:18,390
zap because it's basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a zap</font>

1473
00:56:14,910 --> 00:56:21,299
zip file<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then show us the contents</font>

1474
00:56:18,390 --> 00:56:24,060
here so what we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking for is</font>

1475
00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:25,860
security dash or dll and click scan

1476
00:56:24,060 --> 00:56:27,750
again and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> that will decompile the</font>

1477
00:56:25,860 --> 00:56:31,800
dll to give us back the original source

1478
00:56:27,750 --> 00:56:34,530
code so that'll just take a minute or

1479
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:36,660
two<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do that and then what we can do</font>

1480
00:56:34,530 --> 00:56:41,570
then is if we pick whatever source code

1481
00:56:36,660 --> 00:56:44,250
we want so within here apt CS quick scan

1482
00:56:41,570 --> 00:56:46,890
it'll show us sorry in this other tab

1483
00:56:44,250 --> 00:56:48,480
here it'll show us our source code with

1484
00:56:46,890 --> 00:56:50,879
certain things highlighted so here we're

1485
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:52,170
right into isolated storage settings so

1486
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:53,730
you can click on that and it tells you a

1487
00:56:52,170 --> 00:56:55,350
bit more<font color="#E5E5E5"> information about why that's</font>

1488
00:56:53,730 --> 00:56:56,730
being highlighted them the<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

1489
00:56:55,350 --> 00:56:59,009
things you<font color="#CCCCCC"> should consider when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

1490
00:56:56,730 --> 00:57:01,470
looking at that and then the other tool

1491
00:56:59,010 --> 00:57:03,600
that i have is<font color="#CCCCCC"> Agni</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> show which you can</font>

1492
00:57:01,470 --> 00:57:05,430
kind of use in partnership with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

1493
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:06,870
because you might look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at that thing</font>

1494
00:57:05,430 --> 00:57:08,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's highlighted but you might</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

1495
00:57:06,870 --> 00:57:10,920
know the specific questions to ask about

1496
00:57:08,910 --> 00:57:13,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">that and this is where you can use egg</font>

1497
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:14,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">nishio now I don't have time to tell</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

1498
00:57:13,530 --> 00:57:17,640
everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> about ignition later but</font>

1499
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:19,770
myself and<font color="#CCCCCC"> thiago are doing workshops</font>

1500
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:21,990
afternoon<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think at three o'clock so if</font>

1501
00:57:19,770 --> 00:57:22,950
you wanna know more about this<font color="#E5E5E5"> and come</font>

1502
00:57:21,990 --> 00:57:24,899
along to that but it's but it's

1503
00:57:22,950 --> 00:57:27,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">basically a tool to help you as a</font>

1504
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:29,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">security code of you help you ask the</font>

1505
00:57:27,090 --> 00:57:31,140
right questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> during</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a review it does</font>

1506
00:57:29,250 --> 00:57:34,290
that kind of keyword highlighting again

1507
00:57:31,140 --> 00:57:37,609
for iOS apps android apps Windows Phone

1508
00:57:34,290 --> 00:57:39,750
apps and anything in Java and C sharp XE

1509
00:57:37,610 --> 00:57:42,720
and on top<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that it does all the</font>

1510
00:57:39,750 --> 00:57:44,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">things I someone once said it was like a</font>

1511
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:46,890
mr. muscle tool because it<font color="#E5E5E5"> does all the</font>

1512
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:48,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">jobs that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I hated I didn't like doing</font>

1513
00:57:46,890 --> 00:57:50,310
audit trails and like do metrics and

1514
00:57:48,930 --> 00:57:52,500
reporting so this does all that

1515
00:57:50,310 --> 00:57:55,590
automatically for me<font color="#E5E5E5"> mainly because I</font>

1516
00:57:52,500 --> 00:57:58,710
didn't like doing them and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

1517
00:57:55,590 --> 00:58:00,390
everything for me um what I have is for

1518
00:57:58,710 --> 00:58:03,360
anyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> who has</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the best question I've</font>

1519
00:58:00,390 --> 00:58:05,129
got a free<font color="#CCCCCC"> Yubikey and actually goes</font>

1520
00:58:03,360 --> 00:58:07,530
from you Becky said before to me that if

1521
00:58:05,130 --> 00:58:08,940
you fill in the speaker evaluation form

1522
00:58:07,530 --> 00:58:10,890
give batam you get a free<font color="#CCCCCC"> one from them</font>

1523
00:58:08,940 --> 00:58:11,220
as well so whoever<font color="#CCCCCC"> asked me the best</font>

1524
00:58:10,890 --> 00:58:12,690
quest

1525
00:58:11,220 --> 00:58:15,000
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll give</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you on if you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want to</font>

1526
00:58:12,690 --> 00:58:16,619
another just<font color="#E5E5E5"> fill in forms and they'll</font>

1527
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:19,590
give your free one for every form you

1528
00:58:16,619 --> 00:58:21,630
give them<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so if anyone has any</font>

1529
00:58:19,590 --> 00:58:30,240
questions far away or I'm around<font color="#E5E5E5"> all day</font>

1530
00:58:21,630 --> 00:58:32,369
anyway hello so you were so advocating

1531
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:34,618
encrypting with datum device but if your

1532
00:58:32,369 --> 00:58:36,930
storm the password in the application

1533
00:58:34,619 --> 00:58:38,820
are you not just two or obscuring the

1534
00:58:36,930 --> 00:58:40,440
data rather than securing it because you

1535
00:58:38,820 --> 00:58:43,080
could just<font color="#E5E5E5"> get password for me yeah oh</font>

1536
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:44,849
yeah I can't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> say anything other</font>

1537
00:58:43,080 --> 00:58:47,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">than agree with you on that are you</font>

1538
00:58:44,849 --> 00:58:51,210
saying it's adding something or is it

1539
00:58:47,869 --> 00:58:53,460
having the password there I don't well I

1540
00:58:51,210 --> 00:58:56,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">think you're right and call obscure in</font>

1541
00:58:53,460 --> 00:58:58,349
it it it makes what it means is if you

1542
00:58:56,880 --> 00:59:01,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">take the database off the phone by</font>

1543
00:58:58,349 --> 00:59:02,430
itself you can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> access it but I've just</font>

1544
00:59:01,260 --> 00:59:04,200
shown you an app that's going to give

1545
00:59:02,430 --> 00:59:05,399
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> the source code of any Windows Phone</font>

1546
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:07,830
app and you'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> just get the password</font>

1547
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:09,990
from there yeah so it's not not idea by

1548
00:59:07,830 --> 00:59:11,790
by any stretch now I<font color="#CCCCCC"> imagine what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1549
00:59:09,990 --> 00:59:15,629
could do is actually retrieve that

1550
00:59:11,790 --> 00:59:18,150
password from a remote location when you

1551
00:59:15,630 --> 00:59:19,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">launch the app and then include that and</font>

1552
00:59:18,150 --> 00:59:22,170
use that within the code when it's

1553
00:59:19,980 --> 00:59:23,760
running rather than<font color="#CCCCCC"> hard-code nip I've</font>

1554
00:59:22,170 --> 00:59:25,950
not tested that but I can't see why it

1555
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:29,040
wouldn't work<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay but otherwise</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

1556
00:59:25,950 --> 00:59:30,868
stored in the cold down<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's to a degree</font>
