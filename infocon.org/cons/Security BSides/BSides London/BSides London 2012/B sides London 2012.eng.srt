1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,040
oh I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to attend the last year but</font>

2
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:14,009
the tickets went like and<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> were gone</font>

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:15,928
<font color="#E5E5E5">I mean we got my lucky this year for the</font>

4
00:00:14,009 --> 00:00:17,670
b-sides this year it was was about 1am

5
00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:21,000
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> random twitter feed up and I</font>

6
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:24,420
was like odds to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a great book that</font>

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:28,080
literally pressing the f5 button to when

8
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:30,240
they release the tickets so yeah

9
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:34,070
basically seeing that you know the

10
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:36,510
tickets were sold out that's enough

11
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:39,030
advertisement what I can make out it's

12
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:41,730
it's it's a younger than me crowd on the

13
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:44,340
whole I think I mentioned in my

14
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:47,489
presentation there's a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> gray hairs</font>

15
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:48,510
and no errors out there like myself so

16
00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:52,169
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the first conference I've been</font>

17
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:54,089
to menu because besides is first of all

18
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:57,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's free to get into a little area for</font>

19
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:58,710
us and I mean wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> too bad a lot of</font>

20
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">these conferences especially for</font>

21
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:01,980
students can be quite hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get to so</font>

22
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:05,489
it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a really opportunity for us</font>

23
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:09,539
besides long you get to actually talk to

24
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:11,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">the people these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kegs it is a funny fun</font>

25
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:13,380
way to to meet people<font color="#E5E5E5"> all about a</font>

26
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:14,790
community<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's that's what it's all</font>

27
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:16,679
about and it's the fact that<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of</font>

28
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:18,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">main I for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the people by the people and</font>

29
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:20,100
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that makes a really really big</font>

30
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:21,900
difference<font color="#E5E5E5"> is certainly i don't think</font>

31
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:24,000
i'd probably go to<font color="#CCCCCC"> infosec again life's</font>

32
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:26,250
going yesterday was awful whereas I've

33
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,960
been looking towards this for ages I

34
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:29,970
think the value of conferences is

35
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:31,320
meeting people in personal the talks are

36
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:33,630
great but you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> also get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> those online</font>

37
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:36,149
upwards attending these<font color="#CCCCCC"> grants teaches</font>

38
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:38,610
you some humility there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> always</font>

39
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:41,369
someone better and with more experience

40
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:43,140
than you think you'll ever have or had

41
00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:45,329
or will get<font color="#CCCCCC"> its there's a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font>

42
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:46,799
friendly people<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of information</font>

43
00:01:45,329 --> 00:01:50,189
sharing which is what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I like really like</font>

44
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:53,460
about it<font color="#E5E5E5"> well the mood and atmosphere is</font>

45
00:01:50,189 --> 00:01:56,949
very laid-back relaxed and

46
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:59,139
everybody just mingles and I'm talk to

47
00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:01,360
each other so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know great atmosphere</font>

48
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:02,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing I'd say is the QB duty aspect of</font>

49
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:05,140
it besides feels like a community-driven

50
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:06,580
event it doesn't feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> like someone's you</font>

51
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:08,470
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> some big company created this</font>

52
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:10,810
conference and then create content you

53
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:11,770
go longer assume it's more interactive

54
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:13,540
you're going to go a little bit the

55
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:15,340
challenges I thought were brilliant you

56
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:17,079
got devising engaging with different

57
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:18,760
period of months<font color="#CCCCCC"> rose</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and one with a</font>

58
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:21,160
whole day<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> away you actually got</font>

59
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:24,160
much more sense of occasion it's not

60
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:25,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for business</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people as opposed to</font>

61
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:28,150
an event which may<font color="#CCCCCC"> be happening the</font>

62
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:30,400
other side of<font color="#E5E5E5"> London it's not just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

63
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:32,530
pen testers it's not just about software

64
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,480
quality assurance people is about

65
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:38,260
everyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> people starting experience</font>

66
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:39,820
people and everyone in between there's

67
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:43,630
also the personal side I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think which is</font>

68
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:46,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">also you know getting getting your name</font>

69
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:49,239
out there stands up getting your own

70
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:52,060
unique and individual ideas out there

71
00:02:49,239 --> 00:02:56,380
rather than having to spouts that the

72
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:58,540
corporate draw can<font color="#CCCCCC"> offer happen very</font>

73
00:02:56,380 --> 00:03:00,280
often so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> being able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

74
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:03,040
go out<font color="#CCCCCC"> there and you know put your own</font>

75
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:05,799
ideas across in your formatting and in

76
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:07,810
your way using your humor I think it's

77
00:03:05,799 --> 00:03:10,090
quite<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool I made the mistake my first</font>

78
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:11,500
conference was<font color="#CCCCCC"> b-sides last year and I'm</font>

79
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:13,239
here the mistake I diligently went

80
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:15,549
through all of this talks I want that

81
00:03:13,239 --> 00:03:16,959
one that one that one that one and it

82
00:03:15,549 --> 00:03:18,910
turned out afterwards I missed a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of</font>

83
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:20,140
what was the best side<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the conference</font>

84
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:22,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">was talking with people in the hallway</font>

85
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:23,829
of the lobbies or the extra stuff yeah

86
00:03:22,209 --> 00:03:26,350
it's quite a long trip<font color="#CCCCCC"> to me down from</font>

87
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:27,670
Scotland and but it's definitely worth

88
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:30,640
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> because some of the talks are going</font>

89
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:34,510
on there seem to be very interest and so

90
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:35,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">cutting edge tossed and just definitely</font>

91
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:38,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">what</font>

92
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:40,730
five six hours to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> Devon</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

93
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:43,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">definitely worth it well the biggest</font>

94
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:46,420
value is that you get to know a lot of

95
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:49,700
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> streams in terms of security</font>

96
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:53,089
as in my<font color="#E5E5E5"> regular job I don't think there</font>

97
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:55,310
is as much where ideas you get from the

98
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:57,319
whole information<font color="#E5E5E5"> security screen so in</font>

99
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:59,780
these conferences and besides specially

100
00:03:57,319 --> 00:04:01,280
you get to meet different<font color="#E5E5E5"> people from</font>

101
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:05,660
different streams working on surveys

102
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:07,489
application security the other security

103
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:11,150
scheme so that's something which adds

104
00:04:07,489 --> 00:04:13,070
value<font color="#CCCCCC"> D on to yourself you get to a lot</font>

105
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:17,720
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things there is lots of information</font>

106
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:23,810
here at base odds for not Iron Lady the

107
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:28,130
high temp people but a lot of people<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

108
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:30,080
security a lot of techies are<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font>

109
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:32,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">online before the first baseman people</font>

110
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:34,210
and they're a bit shy of activity you

111
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:36,590
put them in<font color="#CCCCCC"> a group like this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

112
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:39,138
<font color="#E5E5E5">hopefully get people to the shells and</font>

113
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:41,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">talking at networking and when you do go</font>

114
00:04:39,139 --> 00:04:43,010
back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the day jobs there will know</font>

115
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:45,350
people and they'll be able to ask the

116
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:47,120
questions online but the bill to ask the

117
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:49,610
people they know<font color="#E5E5E5"> rather than just</font>

118
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,960
general kinetically help don't know the

119
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:53,900
person who wrote<font color="#CCCCCC"> 20 lakhs bill</font>

120
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:55,669

121
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:56,960

124
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:02,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">really connect with them but then there</font>

125
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:05,270
were people who didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know what we're</font>

126
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:07,070
interested so they those the guys<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've</font>

127
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:08,930
got<font color="#E5E5E5"> one guy who's a ringer he knows</font>

128
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:10,729
every question I'm am asking but he's

129
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:12,169
laughing at my jokes cuz he gets it and

130
00:05:10,729 --> 00:05:14,900

<font color="#CCCCCC">that treats the talks with security</font>

136
00:05:26,419 --> 00:05:30,740
professionals rather than vendors

137
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:33,229
following besides that will be

138
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:34,350
definitely coming more definitely bad

139
00:05:33,229 --> 00:05:37,640
