1
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:08,109
and what I'm here today to talk to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

2
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:11,500
about is html5 so hopefully<font color="#CCCCCC"> I came up on</font>

3
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:14,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">the screen</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay good so html5 is a whole</font>

4
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:15,519
bunch of new web standards which are

5
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:17,560
going to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> the web a much more</font>

6
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:21,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting and interactive and fun</font>

7
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:23,560
place<font color="#E5E5E5"> especially for web developers it's</font>

8
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:25,510
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a new set of standards or sorry it's</font>

9
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:27,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">not a new version in the way you might</font>

10
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:29,500
be familiar with software for example

11
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:31,509
moving from<font color="#E5E5E5"> version 4 to version 5 is a</font>

12
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:33,129
whole bunch of<font color="#E5E5E5"> different</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> features some</font>

13
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:35,530
browsers implement lots of them little

14
00:00:33,129 --> 00:00:37,089
browsers of<font color="#CCCCCC"> poor support</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so it's kind of</font>

15
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:39,040
you know if you were actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> building</font>

16
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:40,090
an application that makes use of some of

17
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,589
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> features you have to actually</font>

18
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:44,860
check the browser support<font color="#CCCCCC"> before you do</font>

19
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:46,450
anything but just<font color="#CCCCCC"> like everything else</font>

20
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:47,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's got some good sides and bad sides</font>

21
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:49,840
that's what I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk a bit</font>

22
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:51,699
about today so<font color="#E5E5E5"> three topics three parts</font>

23
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,170
that is convert or if this talk the

24
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:54,520
first thing you want to do is talk about

25
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:56,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">the good side you know what I'm just</font>

26
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:58,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to zoom that out a bit so the good</font>

27
00:00:56,649 --> 00:01:00,489
side of<font color="#E5E5E5"> html5 and there's a lot of</font>

28
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:02,529
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> cool good features in there that</font>

29
00:01:00,489 --> 00:01:05,229
make you know websites a lot more

30
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:07,060
interactive just like any other ability

31
00:01:05,229 --> 00:01:09,700
of course these can also be used for bad

32
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:12,009
so quick show of hands who here has ever

33
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:14,499
watched like a superhero movie right

34
00:01:12,009 --> 00:01:16,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay x-men that sort of thing so some</font>

35
00:01:14,499 --> 00:01:18,009
kid gets the power of invisibility he

36
00:01:16,659 --> 00:01:20,200
could spend<font color="#E5E5E5"> the rest of his life you</font>

37
00:01:18,009 --> 00:01:21,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">know you know infiltrating terrorist</font>

38
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:23,319
cells or doing something useful before

39
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:25,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">he does daddy go straight to the girls</font>

40
00:01:23,319 --> 00:01:26,950
changing rooms right so exact same

41
00:01:25,149 --> 00:01:28,689
ability but<font color="#E5E5E5"> can be used in a good way</font>

42
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:31,329
and a bad way so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> talked about the bad</font>

43
00:01:28,689 --> 00:01:33,130
side of html5<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then the third topic</font>

44
00:01:31,329 --> 00:01:34,568
i'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about well we come to</font>

45
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:37,119
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> little bit later on come down at</font>

46
00:01:34,569 --> 00:01:38,679
the end so there's a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font>

47
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:40,899
features in<font color="#E5E5E5"> html5 and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm going to</font>

48
00:01:38,679 --> 00:01:42,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">feature just five which i think are the</font>

49
00:01:40,899 --> 00:01:45,399
coolest and I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make a biggest</font>

50
00:01:42,729 --> 00:01:47,619
influence so we show some<font color="#E5E5E5"> examples the</font>

51
00:01:45,399 --> 00:01:49,509
first is something called canvas so

52
00:01:47,619 --> 00:01:52,599
there's two new graphics libraries in

53
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:55,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">html5 canvas deals with all the 2d stuff</font>

54
00:01:52,599 --> 00:01:58,389
and WebGL does all the treaty stuff so

55
00:01:55,630 --> 00:02:00,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">deadia here is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that they want to make it</font>

56
00:01:58,389 --> 00:02:02,259
a lot easier<font color="#E5E5E5"> to develop animations and</font>

57
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:03,818
drawings and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of stuff that you</font>

58
00:02:02,259 --> 00:02:06,189
would have historically used flash for

59
00:02:03,819 --> 00:02:08,500
you can oh just do an HTML so it's some

60
00:02:06,189 --> 00:02:10,869
simple code like this which is not

61
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:12,849
horribly complicated code you write a

62
00:02:10,869 --> 00:02:15,189
better HTML and JavaScript like that and

63
00:02:12,849 --> 00:02:15,519
you end up<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a red rectangle and a</font>

64
00:02:15,189 --> 00:02:18,190
blue ball

65
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:20,500
in front of it<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay not terribly</font>

66
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:22,000
exciting but hope you appreciate<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

67
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:24,250
pretty simple to do this right the cold

68
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,570
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not exactly hard so of course there's</font>

69
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:28,060
cooter things you can do using the

70
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:30,340
canvas library<font color="#CCCCCC"> in this one of the things</font>

71
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:32,080
people use the web alot fur is uploading

72
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:34,390
pictures interacting with them you know

73
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,950
giving your pictures to friends doing

74
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:39,790
all sorts of modifications that and so

75
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:41,739
on so here's another canvas example this

76
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:43,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">time we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have three different</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> images we</font>

77
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:45,370
just have the the newbie slides logo I

78
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:47,830
can do stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> like and drag it around</font>

79
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:49,780
like Anne<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of resize it I can you</font>

80
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:51,850
know make it look like a Polaroid for

81
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:54,460
example there's the old besides they'll

82
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:55,989
go identify the corners a whole bunch of

83
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:57,550
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can this is just using the</font>

84
00:02:55,990 --> 00:03:00,040
canvas libraries you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> interact with</font>

85
00:02:57,550 --> 00:03:02,560
stuff a lot more now I'm a freely admit

86
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:03,760
I am a terrible web developer so if I

87
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,690
can come<font color="#CCCCCC"> up with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff like this you</font>

88
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,130
know people who actually know what

89
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:10,510
they're doing can do a much much better

90
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:12,609
job than I can so that's that to me is

91
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:15,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">better than a bunch of blue balls or red</font>

92
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:19,750
rectangles on screen pun<font color="#CCCCCC"> intended on the</font>

93
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:22,300
blue balls but for the WebGL then<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort</font>

94
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:23,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> treaty side what tree engineers</font>

95
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:25,540
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Google did an excellent job of</font>

96
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,160
showing us off so under twenty percent

97
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:29,140
project time they came<font color="#E5E5E5"> up with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a project</font>

98
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:30,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">where they wanted</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to see what they could</font>

99
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:32,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">do with the new treaty graphics</font>

100
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:36,190
libraries so who here has played do more

101
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:38,080
quick right everybody right so quick to

102
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:39,730
in particular was I used to play it

103
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,410
extensively in college the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first time I</font>

104
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:43,090
ever actually upgraded the machine<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

105
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:45,370
to play a game<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my old machine</font>

106
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:48,160
was crap and what they<font color="#E5E5E5"> did was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

107
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:50,320
poured it the entire quake 2 engine into

108
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:53,109
html5 so everything's written in

109
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:55,209
JavaScript and so on<font color="#CCCCCC"> so I have a demo of</font>

110
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:58,900
that here it's like we just<font color="#E5E5E5"> go on to the</font>

111
00:03:55,209 --> 00:04:00,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">next slide so you can see the demo here</font>

112
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:03,130
running this is just a<font color="#E5E5E5"> YouTube video of</font>

113
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:04,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">it running so for anybody who's familiar</font>

114
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:06,700
with quake 2 that's exactly<font color="#CCCCCC"> what quake</font>

115
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:09,459
tier looks like bear in mind<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is all</font>

116
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:10,899
done<font color="#CCCCCC"> in HTML and JavaScript as it says</font>

117
00:04:09,459 --> 00:04:12,670
in the screen they<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually pointed out</font>

118
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:14,530
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a browser right this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

119
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:16,870
running in the browser the<font color="#E5E5E5"> graphics you</font>

120
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:18,700
see in there the 3d graphics are done

121
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:21,040
the WebGL library and then all the kind

122
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:22,870
of walls and<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff that's all day canvas</font>

123
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:25,720
that the thing i<font color="#CCCCCC"> just used for the</font>

124
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:28,479
images<font color="#E5E5E5"> a while ago it's also got all the</font>

125
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:29,360
original audio from the game using<font color="#E5E5E5"> html5</font>

126
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:33,020
audio if you

127
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:34,550
believe me you get the<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea right</font>

128
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:37,039
everybody knows<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> quake</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two sounds like</font>

129
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:38,900
all the networking here is done with

130
00:04:37,039 --> 00:04:40,759
WebSockets which is essentially

131
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:43,008
real-time networking communication so

132
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:45,050
forget about all that Ajax style polling

133
00:04:43,009 --> 00:04:47,840
this is proper<font color="#E5E5E5"> sockets all implemented</font>

134
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:49,580
in JavaScript it's pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> good frame</font>

135
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,169
rate as you can see all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the actual</font>

136
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:53,960
saved games are saved locally in the

137
00:04:51,169 --> 00:04:55,789
browser and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can see the regardless</font>

138
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:57,590
of whether you actually are a fan of the

139
00:04:55,789 --> 00:04:59,628
game like quake which seems like most of

140
00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:01,128
the room are this type of graphics

141
00:04:59,629 --> 00:05:03,590
libraries really does change how people

142
00:05:01,129 --> 00:05:05,120
can use the internet even you can see

143
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:06,888
consoles that are running essentially

144
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,300
you have a thin client console and all

145
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:10,129
the hard work is done the server summer

146
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:11,689
and then just like in real life some

147
00:05:10,129 --> 00:05:14,509
sneaky get comes up and shoots you at

148
00:05:11,689 --> 00:05:15,860
the end so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first feature of</font>

149
00:05:14,509 --> 00:05:17,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">html5 I think is going to make a big</font>

150
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:19,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">difference these two new graphics</font>

151
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:21,560
libraries the second feature I've

152
00:05:19,879 --> 00:05:24,889
already kind of sneaked it in which is

153
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:26,870
video so a lot of what we do on the

154
00:05:24,889 --> 00:05:28,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">internet involves either audio or video</font>

155
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:30,319
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> YouTube is probably one of the most</font>

156
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:33,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">popular sites outside of Google or</font>

157
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:35,990
Facebook and open<font color="#E5E5E5"> till know if anybody's</font>

158
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:37,550
ever put a<font color="#E5E5E5"> video in a website before I</font>

159
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:39,319
leave either uploaded something to

160
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:40,669
youtube and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then just linked it in or if</font>

161
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:42,289
you've gone then the flash<font color="#CCCCCC"> roots you</font>

162
00:05:40,669 --> 00:05:44,599
<font color="#CCCCCC">have all those horrible object tags and</font>

163
00:05:42,289 --> 00:05:46,818
embed and it just doesn't seem<font color="#E5E5E5"> very nice</font>

164
00:05:44,599 --> 00:05:48,440
I mean considering<font color="#E5E5E5"> the amount of time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

165
00:05:46,819 --> 00:05:50,240
spend putting videos and stuff online it

166
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:52,279
should be a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot easier so nowadays you</font>

167
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,110
in five it is a lot easier there's

168
00:05:52,279 --> 00:05:55,849
simply a video tag you just put the

169
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:58,159
source in of whatever video you want and

170
00:05:55,849 --> 00:05:59,389
that's pretty much it that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> browser</font>

171
00:05:58,159 --> 00:06:01,550
will<font color="#E5E5E5"> take care of everything else for</font>

172
00:05:59,389 --> 00:06:03,589
you that's way way nicer than all the

173
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:05,960
flash stuff so you can start saying why

174
00:06:03,589 --> 00:06:08,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">Adobe are very very interested in how</font>

175
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:11,150
html5 does because kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it does away</font>

176
00:06:08,569 --> 00:06:12,800
with need for flash also because it's

177
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:14,179
much better supported you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> interact</font>

178
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,949
with the videos more with<font color="#E5E5E5"> JavaScript</font>

179
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:17,990
because it's all part of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Dom so</font>

180
00:06:15,949 --> 00:06:19,879
let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> take the same video we had earlier</font>

181
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:21,680
on from quake so I've got a button

182
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:23,539
outside<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the video but I can cause it</font>

183
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,159
to play because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just using you know</font>

184
00:06:23,539 --> 00:06:27,289
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just calling that object in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

185
00:06:25,159 --> 00:06:29,509
page<font color="#CCCCCC"> I knew a nice funky stuff like you</font>

186
00:06:27,289 --> 00:06:30,949
<font color="#CCCCCC">know add CSS effects and properly</font>

187
00:06:29,509 --> 00:06:33,819
interact with videos as if<font color="#E5E5E5"> there were</font>

188
00:06:30,949 --> 00:06:38,060
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> a real part of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> web page</font>

189
00:06:33,819 --> 00:06:39,800
that's two features a third feature is a

190
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:41,870
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the time now it is when you go</font>

191
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,770
online you're not using your certainly

192
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:44,870
not using read

193
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:46,039
stop to go online anymore in fact a lot

194
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:49,520
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> time you're not even using a laptop</font>

195
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:53,270
you're using something like an iPad or

196
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:56,539
an iPhone some sort of mobile device so

197
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:58,159
that opens up a whole new area that you

198
00:06:56,539 --> 00:07:00,620
can interact with people in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the whole</font>

199
00:06:58,159 --> 00:07:01,819
<font color="#CCCCCC">area geolocation an to your location is</font>

200
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:04,009
literally about tree lines of JavaScript

201
00:07:01,819 --> 00:07:07,190
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> html5 to find somebody's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> GPS</font>

202
00:07:04,009 --> 00:07:09,110
coordinates so to give a quick demo if I

203
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:11,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> click and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go show position let's</font>

204
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:14,090
see how<font color="#CCCCCC"> accurate this gets so that's not</font>

205
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:15,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">too bad</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so I'm within</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but 91</font>

206
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:18,138
metres of where that red dot is which

207
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:20,030
looks pretty occurs now this is based on

208
00:07:18,139 --> 00:07:22,130
my IP address because we just connecting

209
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:23,630
to the Wi-Fi here if I do this from<font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

210
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:24,620
phone it's going to use the GPS<font color="#E5E5E5"> cell</font>

211
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:26,659
phone so it's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be even more</font>

212
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:28,759
accurate and you can also track<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

213
00:07:26,659 --> 00:07:30,319
so you can you can get their location

214
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:32,180
one time or you can ask for updates

215
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:33,969
every second or two seconds so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font>

216
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:36,169
can track them moving around weird world

217
00:07:33,969 --> 00:07:38,419
that opens up a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you know</font>

218
00:07:36,169 --> 00:07:40,008
interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> uses like advertisers can</font>

219
00:07:38,419 --> 00:07:41,210
use this to give you really targeted

220
00:07:40,009 --> 00:07:42,919
advertising like when you're walking

221
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:44,568
down<font color="#E5E5E5"> the road the mcdonalds down the</font>

222
00:07:42,919 --> 00:07:47,599
road gives you<font color="#E5E5E5"> an ad for the nearby</font>

223
00:07:44,569 --> 00:07:49,819
<font color="#CCCCCC">McDonald's there's also some funky games</font>

224
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:51,919
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who built this I've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> seen one demo</font>

225
00:07:49,819 --> 00:07:54,169
somebody who's implemented pac-man in

226
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:56,180
the real world using<font color="#CCCCCC"> html5 geolocation</font>

227
00:07:54,169 --> 00:07:57,770
so you walk around<font color="#E5E5E5"> the streets which our</font>

228
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:59,270
iPad and you you know one person's

229
00:07:57,770 --> 00:08:00,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">pac-man the other guys</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are ghosts and</font>

230
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:04,039
they as they're walking around on the

231
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:05,719
<font color="#CCCCCC">actual map things get updated I haven't</font>

232
00:08:04,039 --> 00:08:07,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">heard</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of any fatalities yet from people</font>

233
00:08:05,719 --> 00:08:10,360
crossing a road win an ipad like this

234
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:12,409
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know these things can happen you</font>

235
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:14,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">might</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have noticed as well that actually</font>

236
00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:16,009
a lot of these demos like this i'm not

237
00:08:14,389 --> 00:08:18,020
using powerpoint here for example or

238
00:08:16,009 --> 00:08:20,810
keynote all of the actual<font color="#E5E5E5"> slideshow here</font>

239
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:21,979
is just all written<font color="#E5E5E5"> in HTML 5 so the</font>

240
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:24,469
whole slide shows actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

241
00:08:21,979 --> 00:08:27,560
JavaScript and CSS which makes it real

242
00:08:24,469 --> 00:08:29,449
easy to embed all these demos into it so

243
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:30,860
that's three features<font color="#CCCCCC"> fourth cool</font>

244
00:08:29,449 --> 00:08:32,390
feature and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to get onto</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

245
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:34,729
bad stuff later on but this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the cool</font>

246
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:37,189
new stuff is something called drag and

247
00:08:34,729 --> 00:08:39,289
drop so dragon drop is very very<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple</font>

248
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:41,060
the idea is you can drag content from

249
00:08:39,289 --> 00:08:42,860
the web onto your computer or you can

250
00:08:41,059 --> 00:08:44,229
drag content from your computer onto the

251
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:45,980
web so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it doesn't seem that</font>

252
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:48,680
revolutionary but what it actually does

253
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:50,570
is a really blurs the line between where

254
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:53,270
the web application stops on where your

255
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:55,550
actual system starts which is pretty

256
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:57,139
cool so to give an example I'll just

257
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:59,118
minimize my window

258
00:08:57,139 --> 00:09:02,509
so like in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> past if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you wanted to</font>

259
00:08:59,119 --> 00:09:04,459
download<font color="#E5E5E5"> this PDF for this mp3 normally</font>

260
00:09:02,509 --> 00:09:05,959
you'd you know right click save as save

261
00:09:04,459 --> 00:09:08,628
to desktop or click on<font color="#E5E5E5"> it in the little</font>

262
00:09:05,959 --> 00:09:10,608
file download icon thing comes up to me

263
00:09:08,629 --> 00:09:12,920
both of those are a bit you know they're

264
00:09:10,609 --> 00:09:15,919
<font color="#CCCCCC">not great at it could be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> better so just</font>

265
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:18,169
to show if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just use drag-and-drop I</font>

266
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:21,079
can simply grab the PDF drop it onto<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

267
00:09:18,169 --> 00:09:22,999
desktop just downloads it this should

268
00:09:21,079 --> 00:09:25,399
work hopefully I should probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> check</font>

269
00:09:22,999 --> 00:09:27,679
it's about<font color="#CCCCCC"> four and a half make PDF so</font>

270
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:30,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">it takes a second to download but and</font>

271
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:31,399
there we go so it starts<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> user</font>

272
00:09:30,019 --> 00:09:32,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">friendly to me you just grab stuff in</font>

273
00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:34,519
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> website</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you toss them onto your</font>

274
00:09:32,509 --> 00:09:35,929
desktop and you have them likewise in

275
00:09:34,519 --> 00:09:38,959
the opposite direction so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can upload</font>

276
00:09:35,929 --> 00:09:40,579
stuff so I just have here's a bunch of

277
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:42,819
the twitter icons from the people

278
00:09:40,579 --> 00:09:45,378
presenting<font color="#CCCCCC"> IP sides so just grab them</font>

279
00:09:42,819 --> 00:09:47,299
drop them into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the website and now i can</font>

280
00:09:45,379 --> 00:09:49,790
do you know fully interact with them and

281
00:09:47,299 --> 00:09:51,709

282
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:53,809
and if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that means</font>

283
00:09:51,709 --> 00:09:55,939

camera camera phone you put them onto

287

them into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the browser window and now you</font>

00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:05,059
can start sharing them with people or do

whatever the hell you want it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font>

291
00:10:05,059 --> 00:10:08,988
nicer<font color="#E5E5E5"> than some sort of upload tool or a</font>

00:10:07,249 --> 00:10:12,499
whole load of different file boxes that

00:10:08,989 --> 00:10:14,569
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to click such covered forward</font>

294

297
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:22,579
it is to put video and audio in there's

298
00:10:21,199 --> 00:10:23,839
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> other feature</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I wanted to talk about</font>

299
00:10:22,579 --> 00:10:25,910
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> something called web</font>

300
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:29,089
notifications and these are little

301
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:30,079
pop-ups to look like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> one right so</font>

302
00:10:29,089 --> 00:10:32,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't forget to tell them but babe</font>

303
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:33,799
notifications they<font color="#E5E5E5"> exist outside of the</font>

304
00:10:32,119 --> 00:10:37,429
browser so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I minimize my brother you</font>

305
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:39,259
can see it's still there what these do

306
00:10:37,429 --> 00:10:40,879
is they allow a web application to

307
00:10:39,259 --> 00:10:42,739
essentially create these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are perfect for</font>

308
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:44,720
something like<font color="#CCCCCC"> web mail or an instant</font>

309
00:10:42,739 --> 00:10:46,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">message client or any social network</font>

310
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:49,279
that gives you kind of an update<font color="#E5E5E5"> when</font>

311
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:51,019
something happens and this is a nice way

312
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:53,329
to segue into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of bad side of</font>

313
00:10:51,019 --> 00:10:55,699
html5<font color="#E5E5E5"> because you can also use them for</font>

314
00:10:53,329 --> 00:10:57,258
evil purposes so imagine<font color="#E5E5E5"> you were</font>

315
00:10:55,699 --> 00:10:58,608
anybody here from might actually nobody

316
00:10:57,259 --> 00:11:00,319
wants to admit they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> from Microsoft so</font>

317
00:10:58,609 --> 00:11:03,009
I won't<font color="#CCCCCC"> ask people put up your hands but</font>

318
00:11:00,319 --> 00:11:05,689
imagine Microsoft<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're doing an online</font>

319
00:11:03,009 --> 00:11:07,399
you know like Google ordered their

320
00:11:05,689 --> 00:11:08,569
version of microsoft online office well

321
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:10,760
they could bring back this little guy

322
00:11:08,569 --> 00:11:12,319
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

323
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:13,670
you can use this for a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very evil</font>

324
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,320
purposes or you can use<font color="#CCCCCC"> it for very</font>

325
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:16,969
useful purposes depending on what you

326
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:20,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">want to do with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the actual web</font>

327
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:22,700
notifications so on the bad side there's

328
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:24,800
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> features can be used for</font>

329
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:28,040
criminal purposes or for you know

330
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:29,990
hacking purposes and a lot of T bad

331
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:31,699
features<font color="#CCCCCC"> are best kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of illustrators</font>

332
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:33,710
by actually looking at some code

333
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:35,300
examples and so on so I've written a

334
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:36,440
paper in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll send the link there's</font>

335
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:39,410
a link at the end of anybody wants to

336
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:41,900
read it but those bad examples are

337
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:43,699
better done by looking at the code<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

338
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:45,050
that doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really look very good go</font>

339
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:46,340
well with a presentation so what I'm

340
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:47,540
going to do in the presentation<font color="#E5E5E5"> instead</font>

341
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:49,640
it's put<font color="#E5E5E5"> together a whole attack</font>

342
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:51,050
scenario using some of these different

343
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:53,270
attacks that you can do not all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

344
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:56,209
and to give you<font color="#E5E5E5"> a feel for what you can</font>

345
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:57,590
do with<font color="#E5E5E5"> html5 so we start off with in</font>

346
00:11:56,210 --> 00:11:58,940
our scenario we've got a hacker we're

347
00:11:57,590 --> 00:12:01,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to use the anonymous mask because</font>

348
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:03,200
you know why not so let's imagine this

349
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:04,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">hacker is trying to break into some</font>

350
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:07,430
company we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to call Bravo</font>

351
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:09,290
limited<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so the first</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing he does</font>

352
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:12,109
is he starts doing some reconnaissance

353
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:13,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">under network he checks you know all the</font>

354
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:14,960
various different sites like Facebook

355
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:16,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">LinkedIn so on to try and build up</font>

356
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:19,040
profiles on each of the employees and

357
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:20,540
obviously he does scans in a network and

358
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,310
so on but he finds<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the network's</font>

359
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:23,540
actually pretty locked down so<font color="#CCCCCC"> he's</font>

360
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:25,310
going after the weakest link which is

361
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:27,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">normally the actual humans who work in</font>

362
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:29,750
this imaginary company or inventor and

363
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:31,850
from doing that and from seeing some

364
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:34,010
forum posts and so on he figures out the

365
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:35,750
actual companies targeting use a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

366
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:37,460
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> operating systems so they use</font>

367
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:39,170
there's a lot of guys using macs and

368
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:41,900
Windows and Linux a lot of people

369
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:43,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">especially execs use iPads almost</font>

370
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:45,140
exclusively to actually access the

371
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:46,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">network so he decides on using</font>

372
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:48,290
javascript as the one language that

373
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:51,440
should work on every<font color="#E5E5E5"> single one of those</font>

374
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:53,540
machines also<font color="#CCCCCC"> as part of his research he</font>

375
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:55,820
finds<font color="#E5E5E5"> out that can of the employees are</font>

376
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:58,130
big fans of vintage cars they restore

377
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:59,900
them the whole time<font color="#E5E5E5"> right and they go to</font>

378
00:12:58,130 --> 00:13:02,390
a vintage car forum every single<font color="#CCCCCC"> day</font>

379
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:04,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">from work to take holster so while the</font>

380
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:06,410
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> sights of the actual company are</font>

381
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:08,000
pretty locked and secured this vintage

382
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:10,189
car site has a cross-site scripting

383
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,390
vulnerability so he knows<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

384
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:13,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to go to that from the company so</font>

385
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:15,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">he decides that's the beachhead that's</font>

386
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:16,520
how he's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> start and get in so he</font>

387
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:17,810
verifies this cross-site scripting the

388
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:21,710
way did you<font color="#E5E5E5"> always verify cross-site</font>

389
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:23,359
scripting with alert box right of course

390
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:24,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">that means that he can run any</font>

391
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:27,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">JavaScript that he feels</font>

392
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:29,960
like now even if this size had taken

393
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:33,290
steps to actually stop cross-site

394
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:35,120
scripting so don't you sure you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys are</font>

395
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:37,699
all familiar a lot of sites will have

396
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:39,530
black lists for things like scripts and

397
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:40,430
image and those sort of tags that are

398
00:13:39,530 --> 00:13:42,560
associated with cross-site scripting

399
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:43,910
that's a really bad way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to stop</font>

400
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:45,709
cross-site scripting there's much better

401
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:48,230
ways but I love sites implemented sort

402
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:49,850
of checks and a problem is if you

403
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:51,920
haven't updated your site with new black

404
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:54,170
lists there's new tags and new

405
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,849
attributes in<font color="#E5E5E5"> html5 that can also be</font>

406
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:56,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">used for cross-site scripting attacks so</font>

407
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:58,940
if you're still relying on<font color="#E5E5E5"> your own</font>

408
00:13:56,900 --> 00:14:00,680
filters from half a year ago they're not

409
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:04,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to work anymore so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to give an</font>

410
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:06,920
example<font color="#CCCCCC"> is some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of them so some of them</font>

411
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:09,950
are based on new tags so the video tag

412
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:12,140
for example has an on error in the

413
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:14,000
source that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can use to execute</font>

414
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:16,430
JavaScript so if you were<font color="#E5E5E5"> just blocking</font>

415
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,980
scripts an image or whatever other ones

416
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:20,479
this new tag comes along the browsers

417
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:22,640
will still render it and cross-site

418
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:24,170
scripting is going to work then on the

419
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:26,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">attribute side there's some nice stuff</font>

420
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:28,729
you can do where there's a new feature

421
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:31,880
called autofocus which just brings focus

422
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:33,920
to you know whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> input elements you</font>

423
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:36,050
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the page so this simple little</font>

424
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:38,329
ones just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a piece of JavaScript it says</font>

425
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:40,729
when focus is placed on this impulse

426
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:43,190
then run some code and then use auto

427
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:45,410
focus to focus on it so again nother

428
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:47,330
cross-site scripting attack but your old

429
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:48,770
filters might can work for and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

430
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:51,110
this one's quite nice actually like this

431
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:52,699
one a lot so this is using<font color="#E5E5E5"> on scroll and</font>

432
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:54,200
then a whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> bunch of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> brakes and then</font>

433
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:55,730
you have an<font color="#CCCCCC"> input field and the very</font>

434
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:57,140
bottom of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the page did you give focus to</font>

435
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:59,720
which causes the page to scroll and

436
00:14:57,140 --> 00:15:00,980
kicks off the<font color="#E5E5E5"> JavaScript so these are</font>

437
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:04,490
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> these and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a whole bunch of other</font>

438
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:06,650
ones are up on html5 sec org which is

439
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:08,390
Mario Heydrich slice so he's really good

440
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:10,610
resource on all things cross-site

441
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:12,080
scripting not just html5 ones but all

442
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:16,760
the ones before hand as well so really

443
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:18,230
good cheat sheet up there so this so the

444
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:21,800
attacker has used cross-site scripting

445
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:23,330
he's managed in a run JavaScript on each

446
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:25,459
of these<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten employees remember who</font>

447
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:26,930
visited this vintage car sighs of course

448
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:28,100
he wants<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do more than a simple alert</font>

449
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:29,540
he wants to actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> take complete</font>

450
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:33,050
control of the machines as best as<font color="#E5E5E5"> he</font>

451
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:35,180
possibly<font color="#E5E5E5"> can so being lazy he decides to</font>

452
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:37,130
use an off-the-shelf toolkit there's a

453
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:38,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">very nice one called shell of the future</font>

454
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:39,960
which comes from

455
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:42,930
some researchers in<font color="#E5E5E5"> India call attack</font>

456
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:46,650
and defense labs the site is and labs a

and<font color="#E5E5E5"> D labs org I think and this is an</font>

458
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:50,939
entirely java-based sorry

459
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:51,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">javascript-based toolkit that you can</font>

460
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:54,840
inject with a cross-site scripting

461
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:57,330
vulnerability into a site and what it

462
00:15:54,840 --> 00:16:00,000
allows the attacker do is to connect to

463
00:15:57,330 --> 00:16:02,310
any of those infected users and browse

464
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,890
the web session as if you were that user

465
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:07,859
so any sites that the victim can go to

466
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:10,050
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to in the context of the</font>

467
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:11,520
user so if the user<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know if the user</font>

468
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:13,469
automatically is logged into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the webmail</font>

469
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:15,270
account with a cookie then<font color="#E5E5E5"> the attacker</font>

470
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:18,480
can go to the webmail account and see

471
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:22,530
all that sort of stuff so uses this

472
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:25,950
after shelf to<font color="#CCCCCC"> and input side up onto</font>

473
00:16:22,530 --> 00:16:28,230
the vintage car forum now these<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten</font>

474
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:29,670
people get owned<font color="#E5E5E5"> by</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that particular tool</font>

475
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:31,140
and the attacker can no issue one

476
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:33,599
command and all<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will actually</font>

477
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:35,939
carry that for him<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay very nice very</font>

478
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:38,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">elegant so the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> next thing he wants to do</font>

479
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:40,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">obviously is get a full detailed map off</font>

480
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:42,360
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network that he's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just compromised</font>

481
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:46,110
know as much about the network layer and

482
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:49,080
so on as possible and using actually two

483
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:50,790
new features<font color="#E5E5E5"> of html5 for networking</font>

484
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:53,250
communication he can carry<font color="#E5E5E5"> out a full</font>

485
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:56,730
port scan of the network<font color="#E5E5E5"> just from</font>

486
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:58,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">JavaScript so one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of these is everyone</font>

487
00:16:56,730 --> 00:17:01,260
here is familiar with xml httprequest

488
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:04,610
right simply<font color="#E5E5E5"> just JavaScript lets you</font>

489
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:07,829
create<font color="#E5E5E5"> HTTP connection to another site</font>

490
00:17:04,609 --> 00:17:10,679
up until now<font color="#E5E5E5"> in version</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 1 of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

491
00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:13,349
particular API it's been subject to the

492
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:15,660
same origin policy so site a can send a

493
00:17:13,349 --> 00:17:17,969
request to cite a website a cannot<font color="#E5E5E5"> send</font>

494
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:20,250
a request to slightly not allowed right

495
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:22,020
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> security concerns but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there's</font>

496
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:23,700
a lot of reasons why developers will

497
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:25,650
sometimes want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to actually get content</font>

498
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:27,120
from another site so maybe it's your

499
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:28,410
personal blog but you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pull down</font>

500
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:31,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">your last couple of social network</font>

501
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:33,780
updates or whatever the<font color="#E5E5E5"> case may be so</font>

502
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:36,090
in in the new standard page 25 and all

503
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:38,490
the new browsers support this they

504
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:41,610
changed it so the site a can make a

505
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:43,470
request to site B but only read<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

506
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:46,050
content bank if site be specifically

507
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:48,830
Eliza and the way you do that as site B

508
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:51,129
is you return back a header<font color="#CCCCCC"> call access</font>

509
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:52,540
control hello

510
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:54,070
origin which basically says the

511
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:55,720
following sites are allowed request

512
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:58,270
content from me and I'll server back up

513
00:17:55,720 --> 00:18:00,100
to them so now so i can press site B

514
00:17:58,270 --> 00:18:02,379
it's in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the list of allowed sites and</font>

515
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:03,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">soy de gets the content</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> back and can do</font>

516
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:05,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">whatever the hell</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it wants with it right</font>

517
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:08,950
now that opens up a bunch of new

518
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:10,390
definite acts and the first one is you

519
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:11,890
might have<font color="#CCCCCC"> seen</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sites before that looks</font>

520
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:13,780
something like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> where you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have an</font>

521
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:15,760
index page and every time<font color="#E5E5E5"> you click a</font>

522
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:17,560
link essentially<font color="#E5E5E5"> what the index page is</font>

523
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:19,420
doing is fetching some other PHP page

524
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:21,010
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the server and embedding it may be</font>

525
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:22,240
in the main part<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the page so you're</font>

526
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:23,710
all it looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> like you're always kind of</font>

527
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,660
staying on the same page but it's

528
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:27,330
actually using xml httprequest in the

529
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:30,640
background to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> these requests right</font>

530
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:32,169
now in the past<font color="#E5E5E5"> doles type of sites were</font>

531
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:34,510
vulnerable to a kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of local file</font>

532
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:37,660
inclusion attack so if you were a bad

533
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:40,240
guy you<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> change the the PHP page</font>

534
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:42,070
here that's requesting to something like

535
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,810
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know the password file or try to get</font>

536
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:45,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">something local off the system there</font>

537
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:47,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">will be there it will make the request</font>

538
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:51,100
grab that file and hopefully display it

539
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:53,830
to de<font color="#E5E5E5"> tacker but now because this API</font>

540
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:55,330
allows it to access and notre site the

541
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:57,760
attacker can set up their own evil web

542
00:18:55,330 --> 00:19:00,669
server change it to something like<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

543
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:03,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">and now the vulnerable sites will</font>

544
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:05,800
request c99 shell in this case is any

545
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:07,780
PHP shell from Newt a corsage<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

546
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:10,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">attacker site replies back with the</font>

547
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:12,820
access control you know yes anybody is

548
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:15,070
allowed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to grab my you know PHP shell</font>

549
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:17,409
and that'll get<font color="#E5E5E5"> up BB abroad in the</font>

550
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:20,200
context of the original site so it's

551
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:23,200
vulnerable to an attack<font color="#E5E5E5"> also what you</font>

552
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:25,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do these XML HTTP requests and web</font>

553
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:28,090
sockets also is that you can connect to

554
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:29,860
any site or sent you any machine on any

555
00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:33,429
port well almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> any ports some of them</font>

556
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:35,530
are filtered and because of that and

557
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:37,540
based on the timings involves you can

558
00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:40,330
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> do a port scan and this is</font>

559
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:42,430
implemented in actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> havia is over</font>

560
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:44,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">air have you implemented this in the</font>

561
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:47,620
beef project so if anybody's familiar

562
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:49,510
with beef hmm go team beef<font color="#E5E5E5"> beef is</font>

563
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:50,770
awesome by the way normally I show demo

564
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:54,280
of beef in my talk it is don't have

565
00:19:50,770 --> 00:19:56,379
enough time right now<font color="#CCCCCC"> so apologies but</font>

566
00:19:54,280 --> 00:20:00,240
another thing that's very interesting

567
00:19:56,380 --> 00:20:03,130
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> xml httprequest is that only</font>

568
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:04,960
reading of the response is limited so

569
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:06,970
site a can now all the send

570
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:09,309
request aside be it just<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't read the</font>

571
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:11,380
response and there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of bad things</font>

572
00:20:09,309 --> 00:20:13,120
you can do with<font color="#CCCCCC"> JavaScript just by</font>

573
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:15,100
requesting a site where you don't care

574
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:17,379
about the response so you know you

575
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:19,120
requested say some gambling site and you

576
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:22,000
request to place a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of money</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on some</font>

577
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:23,289
horse and if the person that who's you

00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,419
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> whose machine that you're running</font>

00:20:23,289 --> 00:20:26,770
that JavaScript on is automatically

00:20:25,419 --> 00:20:27,970
authenticated with that site that's

581
00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:29,500
going to work you're not going to be

582
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:31,570
able to read the<font color="#E5E5E5"> response back but you</font>

00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:33,340
don't care<font color="#E5E5E5"> as an attacker you can also</font>

00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:34,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">use that perfect for something like a</font>

586
00:20:34,809 --> 00:20:37,899

a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> slower and less reliable than</font>

entirely in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the browser so it's a lot</font>

601
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:10,840
stealthier and harder to see because

602
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:13,600
this is all just web traffic going

603
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:15,220
around the network as part of his scan

604
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:17,110
he figures out that there's a bunch of

605
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:19,360
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> web servers there and you know</font>

606

some ftp servers and you figures this

<font color="#E5E5E5">sort of thing out and he notices that</font>

622
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:55,179
he can do is see orders one of those

they're really easy to clean up so all

the to make this go away all the company

641

has to do is tell everybody in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:41,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">like a normal botnet that has root kits</font>

even closing the browser tab is enough

to actually you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know stop the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> JavaScript</font>

rolling and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem goes away so</font>

649

it's useful<font color="#E5E5E5"> for attackers when they're</font>

setting up these type of button it's to

make<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure to have multiple places to</font>

a Java Script all over again they also

00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:01,429
need to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff like tab nabbing</font>

656
00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:02,899
or some clickjacking and so on to try

657
00:23:01,429 --> 00:23:04,669
and keep you on that tab as long as

658
00:23:02,899 --> 00:23:05,840
possible or keep that tab running

659
00:23:04,669 --> 00:23:07,520
somewhere in the background for the

660
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:09,350
whole day<font color="#E5E5E5"> and a good way of doing that</font>

661
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:11,360
is even something as simple as a social

662

00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,939
running in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the background the whole day</font>

664
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:15,799
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually interesting for people</font>

665
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:17,600
to play so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that to keep the game open</font>

00:23:15,799 --> 00:23:19,399
all day and just<font color="#E5E5E5"> go back to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it every you</font>

00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,719
<font color="#CCCCCC">know hour or so and then that's perfect</font>

668
00:23:19,399 --> 00:23:25,309
for an attacker because<font color="#CCCCCC"> their</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> JavaScript</font>

669
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:26,840

<font color="#CCCCCC">said that even</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> though there is downsides</font>

671
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:31,789
to using kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these browser-based</font>

672
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:34,610
botnets there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of upsides as well</font>

673
00:23:31,789 --> 00:23:36,169
they're very very stealthy if you if you

674
00:23:34,610 --> 00:23:38,570
code up one of these and I've built a

675
00:23:36,169 --> 00:23:41,390
demo and actually got one of these fully

676
00:23:38,570 --> 00:23:43,610
working because they're running over

677
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:46,190
HTTP Go Go stretcher most firewalls

678
00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:47,779
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is JavaScript and because</font>

679
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:49,549
it's also JavaScript you can obfuscate

680
00:23:47,779 --> 00:23:51,020
the hell out of it and make it a

681
00:23:49,549 --> 00:23:53,510
nightmare<font color="#CCCCCC"> for any intrusion detection</font>

682
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:54,918
systems to detect and it's also going to

683
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:56,690
get a night work for<font color="#CCCCCC"> an antivirus</font>

684
00:23:54,919 --> 00:23:58,190
company by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way antivirus companies</font>

685
00:23:56,690 --> 00:23:59,779
are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have a major headache with</font>

686
00:23:58,190 --> 00:24:01,399
this because this<font color="#E5E5E5"> barely touches the</font>

687
00:23:59,779 --> 00:24:03,260
disk it's nearly entirely memory

688
00:24:01,399 --> 00:24:04,610
resident an antivirus companies don't

689
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:06,350
like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they prefer when things touch</font>

690
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:07,580
the disk so if it's not touching the

691
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:09,980
risk it makes it a lot harder to

692
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:11,740
actually scan and stop<font color="#E5E5E5"> this not</font>

693
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:14,029
impossible but definitely a lot harder

694
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:17,419
so our attackers taken over the whole

695
00:24:14,029 --> 00:24:19,340
network great he wants to do before he

696

starts extracting data off<font color="#CCCCCC"> the off the</font>

698
00:24:20,539 --> 00:24:24,529
things you can do so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can use the same</font>

699
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:26,630
geolocation that we showed earlier on to

700
00:24:24,529 --> 00:24:28,640
not only know what all the servers are

701
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:29,899
and all the machines and what ports are

702

706
00:24:35,170 --> 00:24:39,250
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the CEO of the company is down</font>

707
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:40,690
the road at starbucks getting the coffee

708
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:43,480
but his laptop still in the office

709
00:24:40,690 --> 00:24:45,370
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> his iphone which is infected is</font>

710
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:46,780
saying hey em down<font color="#E5E5E5"> in starbucks but his</font>

711
00:24:45,370 --> 00:24:48,428
laptop which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> still in the office is</font>

712
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:50,020
reporting that's where it is so you can

713
00:24:48,429 --> 00:24:52,090
actually track the user's with the

714
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:53,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">mobile app or especially like ipad users</font>

715
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:56,350
and so on you can track them in real

716
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:59,559
time as they walk around and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i did</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

717
00:24:56,350 --> 00:25:01,059
tests of this what my I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have a</font>

718
00:24:59,559 --> 00:25:02,710
much of a budget for like you know doing

719
00:25:01,059 --> 00:25:04,480
big surveys and stuff so I always test

720
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:08,080
nasty stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> like this is my family and</font>

721
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:09,610
it worked so it was very interesting to

722
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:14,559
follow my sister not going to college

723
00:25:09,610 --> 00:25:15,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">for a day on the right pad so the last</font>

724
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:17,889
thing yutaka wants to do obviously<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

725
00:25:15,970 --> 00:25:20,290
extracted much data as you can from the

726
00:25:17,890 --> 00:25:22,240
network<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then disappear so extracting</font>

727
00:25:20,290 --> 00:25:23,649
data you can do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a lot of ways as</font>

728
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:26,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">I mentioned he's running in the browser</font>

729
00:25:23,650 --> 00:25:28,870
of each of these these victims so he has

730
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:30,550
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> option to you know surf to anything</font>

731
00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:32,080
they could surf so the obvious choices

732
00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:34,809
there are things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the internal</font>

733
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:36,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">webmail any internal kind of web-based</font>

734
00:25:34,809 --> 00:25:38,050
file servers and so on so<font color="#CCCCCC"> he</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> should be</font>

735
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:39,940
able to browse them start downloading

736
00:25:38,050 --> 00:25:41,919
dumping all the email databases and so

737
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:44,200
on but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> traditional stuff</font>

738
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:46,150
you can do that before html5 came along

739
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:49,510
so here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> my five ads in a couple of</font>

741
00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:53,080
know the autocomplete feature so when

742
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:54,820
you go to a forum and you start typing

743
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:56,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">it gives you whatever you entered before</font>

744
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:58,720
there's a few nice tricks you can do

745
00:25:56,920 --> 00:26:00,760
javascript<font color="#E5E5E5"> narrow to actually get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

747

748
00:26:02,290 --> 00:26:05,020
various stages in the past and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it got</font>

749
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:06,699
fixed<font color="#E5E5E5"> by various browsers but nowadays</font>

from<font color="#CCCCCC"> five-door some nice new tricks to</font>

751
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:11,290
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this so an attacker can simply create</font>

752
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:12,520
a whole bunch of hidden form fields that

753
00:26:11,290 --> 00:26:14,860
you won't see either in the background

754
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:17,889
for like goodnight<font color="#CCCCCC"> ids like you know</font>

755
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:19,870
name<font color="#E5E5E5"> email credit card</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> even password</font>

756
00:26:17,890 --> 00:26:21,640
whatever and start iterating go and put

757
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:23,469
it put in a into the box with<font color="#E5E5E5"> javascript</font>

758
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:25,660
and get all the results for a get a B

759
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:26,650
and so on and start actually mine intro

760
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:29,500
whatever you've entered in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the past</font>

761
00:26:26,650 --> 00:26:31,000
which could be interesting stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font>

762
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:32,400
you remember the web notification those

763
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:35,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">little pop-ups I showed before the</font>

764
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:37,600
content of them is just HTML so you can

765
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:39,600
make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> look like just about anything so</font>

766
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:41,830
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> example</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you make it look like this</font>

767
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:43,899
saying you've been logged at a gmail

768
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:44,129
please enter<font color="#CCCCCC"> your password</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in to you</font>

00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:48,750
to log back in now it always does show

771
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:50,340
the actual real site this is coming from

772
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:52,020
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can see here in the corner j/s</font>

773
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:54,750
pin just one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those sites that let you</font>

774
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:56,129
run JavaScript to testings there but you

775
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:58,080
won't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really notice that you're going to</font>

776
00:26:56,130 --> 00:26:58,950
see the gmail logo and so on and of

777
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,360
course you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can make this look like</font>

778
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:01,890
anything you're making you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can make it</font>

779
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:03,240
look like a Microsoft Active Directory

780
00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:06,450
you know you've been logged out of

781

<font color="#E5E5E5">whatever please login and again I tried</font>

782
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:11,160
this using my you know pet guinea pigs

00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:12,180
otherwise known as my family and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

784
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:14,130
were nice enough to do things like

upload files<font color="#E5E5E5"> and send them</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to me so I</font>

said like<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know could</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you please</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> send</font>

00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:20,510
a file from your machine<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do blah and</font>

00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:22,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">Microsoft needed and they sent it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font>

00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:25,020
which<font color="#E5E5E5"> Peter says something about the</font>

790
00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:26,490
smartness of my sister or that you know

791
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:28,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">people will fall</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for this but</font>

792
00:27:26,490 --> 00:27:30,570
essentially with<font color="#E5E5E5"> html5 or sorry with</font>

793
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:32,550
HTML and just whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> social</font>

794
00:27:30,570 --> 00:27:33,960
engineering you can come up with you can

795
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:35,310
get people<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of stuff with</font>

796
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:37,080
these pop-ups because they appear

797
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:38,190
outside of the browser windows so people

798
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:39,929
assume they're part of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the operating</font>

799
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:42,900
system and not anything to do with the

800
00:27:39,930 --> 00:27:45,030
actual site and another nice thing you

801
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:46,770
can do to steal some information it's a

802
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:48,960
bit trickier to pull off is actually

803
00:27:46,770 --> 00:27:51,690
record people's voices so you can

804
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:54,390
literally try to record what is going on

805
00:27:51,690 --> 00:27:56,190
in the room just<font color="#E5E5E5"> using javascript it</font>

806
00:27:54,390 --> 00:27:58,140
will always by the standards have

807
00:27:56,190 --> 00:27:59,670
something like<font color="#CCCCCC"> this I kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of you have</font>

808
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:01,260
to tell the person you are recording

809
00:27:59,670 --> 00:28:03,870
them at the time that's that's in<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

810
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:05,250
the browsers will do this I haven't yet

811
00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:06,929
figured out a way to actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

812
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:09,270
like put something over this you know

813
00:28:06,930 --> 00:28:11,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">using CSS or something to display an</font>

814
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:12,780
image so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can't see it but I'm sure</font>

815
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:14,730
you can come up with a plausible reason

816
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:16,139
for so you know social engineering

817
00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:17,730
reason why you might have<font color="#E5E5E5"> something like</font>

818
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:19,770
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the screen and if you do that</font>

819
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:21,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you can actually literally listen</font>

820
00:28:19,770 --> 00:28:22,980
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> what the person the same what happens</font>

821
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:25,080
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the case of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Chrome as anything they</font>

822
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:27,000
say gets sent to google servers<font color="#CCCCCC"> Google</font>

823
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:28,560
then actually did a nice job of taking

824
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,450
what they say then turning it into text

825
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:32,520
for you and then you can use<font color="#CCCCCC"> JavaScript</font>

826
00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:36,000
to grab that text and send it<font color="#E5E5E5"> off to</font>

827
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:37,290
yourself so nice little tack but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get</font>

828
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:42,600
the idea of kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what you can do with</font>

829
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:43,860
this you should be able to put on a

830
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:45,840
frame of it I haven't managed to<font color="#CCCCCC"> get the</font>

831
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:47,040
work yet it's because this isn't this

832
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:48,300
isn't accessible at all from the

833
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:50,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">dominator this seems to be like the</font>

834
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:52,680
browser itself so and it nearly always

835
00:28:50,370 --> 00:28:55,260
is you know a top of everything you put

836
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:56,760
there but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not saying you can't get</font>

837
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:57,720
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> in front of it I said</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> am a</font>

838
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:59,550
pretty crappy web

839
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:03,810
programmer so I am sure people smarter

840
00:28:59,550 --> 00:29:06,510
than me can<font color="#E5E5E5"> do this so that's some of</font>

841
00:29:03,810 --> 00:29:07,770
the bad details for html5<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to talk</font>

842
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:10,110
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> one other thing which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is the</font>

843
00:29:07,770 --> 00:29:11,220
really really ugly side and to be honest

844
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:14,639
I've kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of cheated because I've</font>

845
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:17,820
actually talked about this before for me

846
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:20,340
the most scary feature of all of html5

847
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:22,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the fact that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it for first time lets</font>

848
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:23,939
you realistically create something I

849
00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:26,100
called Pippi because everything needs an

850
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:28,350
acronym d is this right<font color="#CCCCCC"> apt and so on</font>

851
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:31,350
and bit p stands<font color="#E5E5E5"> for botnets in the</font>

852
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:32,790
browser so up until now you've been able

853
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:35,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do this in a limited way but with</font>

854
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:36,960
stuff like web sockets and web workers

855
00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:39,660
and all of these new features you really

856
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:41,250
genuinely can build proper botnets

857
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:43,050
running entirely in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> browser and</font>

858
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:44,970
those botnets as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said they're very</font>

859
00:29:43,050 --> 00:29:46,230
stealthy<font color="#CCCCCC"> the barely touched a disk day</font>

860
00:29:44,970 --> 00:29:48,180
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> easily get around intrusion</font>

861
00:29:46,230 --> 00:29:50,490
detection systems and so on but it also

862
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:52,350
means in an attacker for probably the

863
00:29:50,490 --> 00:29:54,600
first time in a long time can write one

864
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:56,730
piece of code that should run on any

865
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:58,350
device in any location anywhere in the

866
00:29:56,730 --> 00:30:00,960
plan so as a matter of<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're running</font>

867
00:29:58,350 --> 00:30:02,760
Windows Mac Linux I have an Android

868
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:04,530
tablet you have an iPad it should work

869
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:07,770
on absolutely everything exact same

870
00:30:04,530 --> 00:30:09,540
piece of<font color="#E5E5E5"> code so IE as part of the paper</font>

871
00:30:07,770 --> 00:30:11,310
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I wrote</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I came up with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a demo for</font>

872
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:13,740
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll actually show you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a part of</font>

873
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:15,570
the demo now in this case I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just had the</font>

874
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:17,400
client<font color="#E5E5E5"> and server running on both on my</font>

875
00:30:15,570 --> 00:30:19,200
own laptop but in the actual lab I had

876
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:21,210
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know multiple machines being</font>

877
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:23,670
controlled from one classic command and

878
00:30:21,210 --> 00:30:25,050
control system you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could also use a</font>

879
00:30:23,670 --> 00:30:26,610
peer-to-peer base command and control

880
00:30:25,050 --> 00:30:27,870
system which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm working on at the</font>

881
00:30:26,610 --> 00:30:29,070
moment but this just gives you an idea

882
00:30:27,870 --> 00:30:32,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the stuff you can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do with this</font>

883
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:33,659
so obviously you can do stuff like you

884
00:30:32,370 --> 00:30:34,949
know finding out information about the

885
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:37,020
host so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can get the geolocation</font>

886
00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:39,990
information so on that's important for

887
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:41,570
any botnet you have the social

888
00:30:39,990 --> 00:30:44,790
engineering stuff that we showed before

889
00:30:41,570 --> 00:30:46,830
so let me<font color="#E5E5E5"> see here so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just out of the</font>

890
00:30:44,790 --> 00:30:48,480
pop-up<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I talked about so this case</font>

891
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:50,100
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a de gmail one you know I</font>

892
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:52,730
program that in you can change<font color="#CCCCCC"> this to</font>

893
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:55,740
anything that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to so close that</font>

894
00:30:52,730 --> 00:30:57,420
because it's dom be<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have to give it</font>

895
00:30:55,740 --> 00:31:00,620
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ability eat brains which is very</font>

896
00:30:57,420 --> 00:31:00,620
important so

897
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:06,059
now imagine what happens when 10,000

898
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:08,279
people whose like iPhones and stuff

899
00:31:06,059 --> 00:31:11,340
you've hacked suddenly all get<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

900
00:31:08,279 --> 00:31:12,840
simultaneously but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me is in that</font>

901
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:16,500
in its own is a good enough reason to do

902
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:20,490
a proof of concept partner so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font>

903
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:23,130
have let me see here we have spam so I'm

904
00:31:20,490 --> 00:31:25,350
just going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go to to give you an</font>

905
00:31:23,130 --> 00:31:26,610
example of<font color="#E5E5E5"> how i can send spam from</font>

906
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:27,959
about net which is you know pretty

907
00:31:26,610 --> 00:31:31,168
important because people like doing that

908
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:34,559
so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just open up gmail and also</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> d-does</font>

909
00:31:31,169 --> 00:31:36,390
so just show<font color="#CCCCCC"> details working so here i</font>

910
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:38,399
have just a virtual machine just running

911
00:31:36,390 --> 00:31:40,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can see the amount of packets that</font>

912
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:41,520
are go into my virtual machine<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

913
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:44,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> holst only so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's just on network</font>

914
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:47,789
and now i'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use web workers to</font>

915
00:31:44,490 --> 00:31:50,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">daughter so we start</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to us and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

916
00:31:47,789 --> 00:31:52,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">should see so the package jump up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

917
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:55,918
about 250 an average<font color="#E5E5E5"> i normally get from</font>

918
00:31:52,830 --> 00:31:57,539
one infected machine so again multiply

919
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:58,919
that by ten thousand people all<font color="#CCCCCC"> running</font>

920
00:31:57,539 --> 00:32:02,309
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> JavaScript and you have a proper</font>

921
00:31:58,919 --> 00:32:05,270
DDoS attack I also benchmark tests

922
00:32:02,309 --> 00:32:08,549
against GS Lloyd to from I'm from

923
00:32:05,270 --> 00:32:11,460
anonymous and material works slightly

924
00:32:08,549 --> 00:32:12,658
faster dinners because the web workers

925
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:14,909
web workers are essentially like

926
00:32:12,659 --> 00:32:16,440
background<font color="#E5E5E5"> threads so you can run a</font>

927
00:32:14,909 --> 00:32:17,789
JavaScript packer and tread that is just

928
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:19,710
generating these requests over and over

929
00:32:17,789 --> 00:32:22,350
again so it's perfect for something like

930
00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:24,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">Dida's and also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because people will be</font>

931
00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:26,039
going up and you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> online and offline</font>

932
00:32:24,090 --> 00:32:28,020
the whole time because as the close tabs

933
00:32:26,039 --> 00:32:29,158
adi da spot net is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty good</font>

934
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:30,570
business model for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this because you</font>

935
00:32:29,159 --> 00:32:31,799
don't care<font color="#CCCCCC"> if the person's online the</font>

936
00:32:30,570 --> 00:32:33,809
whole time just as long<font color="#CCCCCC"> as you come</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> back</font>

937
00:32:31,799 --> 00:32:35,549
every couple of hours a day and

938
00:32:33,809 --> 00:32:38,370
generates on d dodge traffic for you and

939
00:32:35,549 --> 00:32:40,080
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the actual spam itself so i</font>

940
00:32:38,370 --> 00:32:43,229
just i have a test account<font color="#CCCCCC"> set up here</font>

941
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:45,539
i'm just<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to mark them as read so</font>

942
00:32:43,230 --> 00:32:47,970
you can see so the way I've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> spammed</font>

943
00:32:45,539 --> 00:32:49,649
work locally they they haven't been

944
00:32:47,970 --> 00:32:52,409
stupid enough in this standard to

945
00:32:49,649 --> 00:32:54,299
actually you know give you in<font color="#E5E5E5"> JavaScript</font>

946
00:32:52,409 --> 00:32:55,860
the ability to send email<font color="#E5E5E5"> directly</font>

947
00:32:54,299 --> 00:32:59,399
because that would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a really really</font>

948
00:32:55,860 --> 00:33:01,740
bad idea but your guys are all familiar

949
00:32:59,399 --> 00:33:03,299
with like contact those pages so what I

950
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:05,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">did here was I simply phone so old</font>

951
00:33:03,299 --> 00:33:07,440
contact us pages where it had the email

952
00:33:05,429 --> 00:33:09,240
as a hidden field change that to

953
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:10,919
whatever email address i want to send

954
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:13,620
spam to and use those<font color="#CCCCCC"> as essentially</font>

955
00:33:10,919 --> 00:33:17,430
open mail realest so like incense Pam

956
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:18,959
so we just started<font color="#E5E5E5"> in spam so give this</font>

957
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:19,980
a couple of seconds I don't want to send

958
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:21,660
too much because they don't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

959
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:23,940
annoy google so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to click stop</font>

960
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:25,620
spam and hopefully now when i go to my

961
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:28,770
gmail account we should have some new

962
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:30,059
messages so<font color="#E5E5E5"> inbox and you can see so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

963
00:33:28,770 --> 00:33:31,680
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> put a unique number at the end of</font>

964
00:33:30,059 --> 00:33:33,540
each one<font color="#E5E5E5"> based in the timestamp so it</font>

965
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:35,100
shows up more visually but so you can

966
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:36,629
send spam you can do denial of service

967
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:38,429
attacks<font color="#E5E5E5"> even social engineer you can do</font>

968
00:33:36,630 --> 00:33:42,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">all that sort of stuff all from just</font>

969
00:33:38,430 --> 00:33:45,480
browser-based botnet so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

970
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:48,000
this stuff is going to be used more and

971
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:49,320
more at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> moment not many I haven't</font>

972
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,850
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> come across any criminal gangs</font>

973
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:51,990
particularly using this technique I

974
00:33:50,850 --> 00:33:54,120
think it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> perfect for something like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

975
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:55,590
pen test as well and normally this would

976
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:57,239
<font color="#CCCCCC">be where I'd actually show off the beef</font>

977
00:33:55,590 --> 00:33:59,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">too as well</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because beef is awesome for</font>

978
00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:01,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">for this sort of stuff unfortunately</font>

979
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:03,210
don't at the time so just<font color="#E5E5E5"> to finish up</font>

980
00:34:01,650 --> 00:34:04,470
i'd like to say if you're interested at

981
00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:05,760
all in any of this stuff or you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

982
00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:09,300
read the paper where i go into much more

983
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:10,860
details html5 security org not my size
