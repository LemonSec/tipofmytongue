1
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:09,550
so this next talk is called escalating

2
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:13,549
privileges on common web applications

3
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:16,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'll start by introducing myself i'm a</font>

4
00:00:13,549 --> 00:00:20,480
freelance<font color="#E5E5E5"> pentester / security</font>

5
00:00:16,939 --> 00:00:22,759
researcher and apart from pen testing

6
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:25,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">I've published some tools as well in the</font>

7
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:30,310
voice over IP security area so service

8
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:34,519
uses voice over IP scanner and void<font color="#CCCCCC"> pack</font>

9
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:36,260
is an add-on for canvas for tools for

10
00:00:34,519 --> 00:00:39,799
penetration testing voice over IP

11
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:41,839
networks and also I've published stuff

12
00:00:39,799 --> 00:00:45,650
when<font color="#CCCCCC"> it comes to web application</font>

13
00:00:41,839 --> 00:00:47,900
security such as web wolf which tries to

14
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:50,600
detect web application firewalls and

15
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:55,460
serve jack which deimos some security

16
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:58,040
issues to do with cookies so let's start

17
00:00:55,460 --> 00:01:03,549
by talking what this presentation is

18
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:06,229
about I decided to focus on just

19
00:01:03,549 --> 00:01:09,560
penetration testing when it comes to web

20
00:01:06,229 --> 00:01:11,539
application client side issues things

21
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:16,250
like cross-site scripting which we're

22
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:18,740
all I guess familiar with and I decided

23
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:21,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">to talk also about you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know what our job</font>

24
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:26,929
involves as pen testers and and what the

25
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:30,020
clients<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe expect as well so the idea</font>

26
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:31,760
is as a pen tester the idea is that you

27
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:35,800
know you're meant to find as many

28
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:39,710
security issues as possible sometimes

29
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:41,990
another<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea is to show the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> impact of</font>

30
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:44,750
the security issues so you're supposed

31
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:47,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">to find as many issues as possible but</font>

32
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:53,720
you're also supposed to show how bad it

33
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:57,200
can be and I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you know finding</font>

34
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:58,880
some traditional web application

35
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,880
security issues can be pretty

36
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:04,190
straightforward as the speaker before me

37
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:07,670
so showed some of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things can be</font>

38
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:10,399
found rather easily through passive

39
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:13,190
means you know your posse you're using

40
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:15,319
your<font color="#CCCCCC"> browser with some proxy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Burt or</font>

41
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:15,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">something like that it's going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to tell</font>

42
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:19,519
you that

43
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:23,440
resume that<font color="#CCCCCC"> XML is very permissive for</font>

44
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:26,390
example it's very straightforward but

45
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:29,920
demonstrating these issues might not be

46
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:35,540
so straightforward in a number of cases

47
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:38,839
so so that's that's what I'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> be talking</font>

48
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:42,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">about here but demonstrating these</font>

49
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:44,120
issues is kind of important because I

50
00:02:42,019 --> 00:02:48,980
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's what you're getting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> paid to</font>

51
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:52,569
do if if you just show that you found

52
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:56,540
five vulnerabilities<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2030 whatever and</font>

53
00:02:52,569 --> 00:02:59,450
you don't show how bad it can be then

54
00:02:56,540 --> 00:03:02,239
your client doesn't really know why

55
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:03,980
you're reporting them possibly depends

56
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:08,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">on the client of course it depends on</font>

57
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:10,970
what they are expecting but in some

58
00:03:08,329 --> 00:03:13,700
cases if you don't demonstrate the

59
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:16,250
actual the<font color="#CCCCCC"> actual impact of these</font>

60
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:19,399
vulnerabilities you might do the same

61
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:22,940
pen test next year same scope same thing

62
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:26,720
and it's very very<font color="#CCCCCC"> common to find the</font>

63
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:28,459
same issues if you don't show hey these

64
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:33,620
vulnerabilities are really bad you

65
00:03:28,459 --> 00:03:36,530
should really fix them however obviously

66
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:39,590
as a penetration tester you have you

67
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:42,530
don't have much time it's it's very

68
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:47,180
likely that some pentas take just three

69
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:50,209
days<font color="#E5E5E5"> I like to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> give myself one week but</font>

70
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:53,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's just me I here three days quite</font>

71
00:03:50,209 --> 00:03:56,450
often and I I think you in the Thursday

72
00:03:53,780 --> 00:04:00,829
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know you you might</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be getting</font>

73
00:03:56,450 --> 00:04:02,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">started if your scope is huge and then</font>

74
00:04:00,829 --> 00:04:05,150
you realize hey I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> time to</font>

75
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:10,340
demonstrate all these security issues

76
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:12,349
that I found and apart from that if you

77
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:15,200
be going to be demonstrating these

78
00:04:12,349 --> 00:04:16,969
issues you probably want you know the

79
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:21,700
code your code as a penetration tester

80
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:26,300
to work so perfecting the exploit is

81
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:27,490
obviously part of the task though it

82
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:29,540
doesn't have to be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> hundred percent</font>

83
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:31,370
perfect but it it has

84
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:33,380
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> definitely work and not embarrass you</font>

85
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:39,560
while you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing a presentation in</font>

86
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:41,810
front of your client so this

87
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:44,180
presentation in this presentation I will

88
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:48,560
publish some some pedals to help you<font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font>

89
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:50,330
with with these demos basically note

90
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,820
that i'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> not going to be saying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> anything</font>

91
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:55,400
new all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this stuff has been</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> published</font>

92
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:57,590
before and frankly<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mean people have</font>

93
00:04:55,400 --> 00:05:00,979
done a much better job then<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm going to</font>

94
00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:07,190
do in the next few minutes when it<font color="#E5E5E5"> comes</font>

95
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:09,080
to exploitation and so on and obviously

96
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:11,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">the key word here is since we're talking</font>

97
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:13,789
about client-side security issues when

98
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:15,380
it comes to web applications a very

99
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:19,130
important key where the same origin

100
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:22,370
policy<font color="#E5E5E5"> I expect you guys to be very</font>

101
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:25,460
familiar<font color="#CCCCCC"> with this so what we'll be</font>

102
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:27,860
talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is not really a bug</font>

103
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:32,000
not not really<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the bugs but about</font>

104
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:35,600
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> features will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be showing how once</font>

105
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:39,770
you find a<font color="#E5E5E5"> way to upload HTML files a</font>

106
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:43,870
way to inject your<font color="#E5E5E5"> JavaScript or some</font>

107
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:48,650
cross domain issue how to exploit it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

108
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:51,740
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know show something proper so if</font>

109
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:56,830
your report you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know under impact over</font>

110
00:05:51,740 --> 00:06:00,500
there shows a pop-up with an alert box

111
00:05:56,830 --> 00:06:02,690
explaining cross-site scripting then I

112
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:05,870
think you're doing something<font color="#E5E5E5"> wrong it's</font>

113
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:08,360
it's I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's enough you</font>

114
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:10,760
should<font color="#CCCCCC"> show you know if it's painful</font>

115
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:13,250
then you should show<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you can</font>

116
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:15,380
transfer money out of that you could you

117
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:18,470
should chose something interesting which

118
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:22,460
your client will you know prioritize on

119
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:26,810
you want your<font color="#E5E5E5"> client to realize that</font>

120
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:30,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">this particular bug is more important</font>

121
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:33,230
than some maybe usability issues that

122
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:36,020
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to be fixed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or up in the</font>

123
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:39,530
priority list depends<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the case</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

124
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:41,960
course so I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it should look a bit</font>

125
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:43,219
<font color="#CCCCCC">more like this and I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mean</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to you</font>

126
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:46,520
know create

127
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:50,030
it's scaremongering it makes sense to

128
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:53,299
obviously explain the actual impact but

129
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:55,909
if it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you're cross-site</font>

130
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:58,870
scripting is on a useless<font color="#E5E5E5"> website then</font>

131
00:06:55,910 --> 00:07:02,090
why the hell are you testing it anyway

132
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:06,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">so I'm going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be talking about some</font>

133
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:09,650
some basic experiences from been testing

134
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:12,289
weak passwords so passwords are you know

135
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:16,010
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> number one security solution and</font>

136
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:19,760
also the<font color="#CCCCCC"> number one security issue in</font>

137
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:21,289
many cases because people when they get

138
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:24,110
to choose their passwords they choose

139
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:26,660
stuff that they can remember<font color="#CCCCCC"> so they're</font>

140
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:29,110
going to choose stupid passwords like

141
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:32,870
you know password<font color="#CCCCCC"> with a capital P and</font>

142
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:35,510
one at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> end it passes some complexity</font>

143
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:41,540
rules but it really doesn't pass the pen

144
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:44,870
test so in this case I found one user on

145
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:46,520
WordPress on a wordpress site that also

146
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:50,450
happens to have other websites on the

147
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:55,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">same domain name that had this sort of</font>

148
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:58,490
password and obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> I thought</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

149
00:07:55,400 --> 00:08:03,650
cool game over but that doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> mean</font>

150
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:05,930
much sometimes in this case it was a

151
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:10,460
user with limited privileges on

152
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:13,790
WordPress<font color="#CCCCCC"> wasn't water and up there you</font>

153
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:15,799
have the super admins so when it<font color="#E5E5E5"> comes</font>

154
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:19,160
to permissions in<font color="#E5E5E5"> WordPress you have</font>

155
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:23,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">different types of users and in my case</font>

156
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:26,630
it wasn't it was one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the top one of</font>

157
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:30,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">the bottom</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> three so it was an water who</font>

158
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:33,469
cannot do much they can boast blog posts

159
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:38,200
that's fine<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I really didn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want to</font>

160
00:08:33,469 --> 00:08:40,669
you know piss off my client by posting

161
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:42,620
some something<font color="#E5E5E5"> embarrassing on their</font>

162
00:08:40,669 --> 00:08:45,319
main site because I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get paid it</font>

163
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:50,510
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the end of the day so I looked</font>

164
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:55,339
further and authors in WordPress are

165
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:57,050
allowed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to upload files and it's if you</font>

166
00:08:55,339 --> 00:08:59,959
look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the WordPress help it</font>

167
00:08:57,050 --> 00:09:01,729
doesn't really do this justice but

168
00:08:59,959 --> 00:09:04,369
looking at the source code<font color="#CCCCCC"> of course you</font>

169
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:09,940
see what what types of files are

170
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:13,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">applauded to be uploaded and HTML files</font>

171
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:16,579
can be uploaded using author permissions

172
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:19,459
by default and some other file types

173
00:09:16,579 --> 00:09:24,790
like swf PDF which could be interesting

174
00:09:19,459 --> 00:09:28,160
as well and so this might be<font color="#CCCCCC"> one way to</font>

175
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:31,910
you know turn your author privileges

176
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:36,860
into admin so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be showing a</font>

177
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:39,829
short demo of how to do this basically

178
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:43,880
I'm going to upload an HTML file which

179
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:46,519
then is you know the link is sent to the

180
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:51,130
administrator and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the administrator once</font>

181
00:09:46,519 --> 00:10:01,640
he accesses this gets to execute some

182
00:09:51,130 --> 00:10:04,550
commands which create a new user so I

183
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:06,560
have the administrator who like who

184
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:09,109
likes to be logged in all the time

185
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:11,119
because he gots lots of supports

186
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:15,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">requests maybe or for some reason or</font>

187
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:17,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">another it's just convenient and on</font>

188
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:21,800
wordpress there are these three users

189
00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:26,180
right now and there's admin some author

190
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:32,930
who has a weak password and just yet

191
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:34,880
another<font color="#E5E5E5"> user and then there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is the</font>

192
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:36,890
attackers machine<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm using VMware in</font>

193
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:42,290
this case for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the demo but it's a</font>

194
00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:45,529
separate machine and the attacker the

195
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:51,709
pen tester in this case can<font color="#CCCCCC"> login</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

196
00:10:45,529 --> 00:10:59,149
some author and as you can see he has

197
00:10:51,709 --> 00:11:02,660
limited privileges but<font color="#E5E5E5"> he can upload</font>

198
00:10:59,149 --> 00:11:05,570
files so I've prepared some HTML and

199
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:09,040
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> JavaScript new Edmond ojs which is</font>

200
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:09,040
the interesting part

201
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:23,859
and then once uploaded to the wordpress

202
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:26,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">site you can copy the URL make sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

203
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:26,550
it works of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course</font>

204
00:11:29,459 --> 00:11:36,508
<font color="#E5E5E5">i'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> using jquery a lot because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> makes</font>

205
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:41,639
code a bit cleaner and frankly it makes

206
00:11:36,509 --> 00:11:45,179
it easier as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well to code and in this</font>

207
00:11:41,639 --> 00:11:47,429
case the depend tester is really nice

208
00:11:45,179 --> 00:11:50,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">and really cozy with with the</font>

209
00:11:47,429 --> 00:11:53,939
administrator so he gives him the link

210
00:11:50,009 --> 00:11:56,009
to check out and but in reality it might

211
00:11:53,939 --> 00:12:00,269
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know this might happen over email</font>

212
00:11:56,009 --> 00:12:03,360
over anything else<font color="#E5E5E5"> and clicking on that</font>

213
00:12:00,269 --> 00:12:05,519
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> should have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> probably put some nice</font>

214
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,230
images so that the administrator doesn't

215
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:09,629
check out what the what's what's

216
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:13,499
happening but clicking<font color="#E5E5E5"> on that creates</font>

217
00:12:09,629 --> 00:12:16,730
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> back door the back door user which</font>

218
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:16,730
is an administrator

219
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:32,640
so we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to log in from the</font>

220
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:40,740
attackers web browser login as the

221
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:46,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">backdoor admin and then we could upload</font>

222
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:49,130
some so show that that year we have

223
00:12:46,649 --> 00:12:49,130
access

224
00:12:53,939 --> 00:13:00,709
and from<font color="#CCCCCC"> here the attacker can upload</font>

225
00:12:56,939 --> 00:13:03,709
plugin that happens to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be named backdoor</font>

226
00:13:00,709 --> 00:13:03,709
plugin

227
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:12,990
you know install<font color="#E5E5E5"> it you have a nice</font>

228
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:12,990
interface

229
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:28,930
and there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> no need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be logged in as</font>

230
00:13:26,589 --> 00:13:31,720
admin anymore you just have you know

231
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:38,500
these PHP scripts that are ending up in

232
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:41,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">the on the web server which means that</font>

233
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:44,740
you can obviously<font color="#CCCCCC"> run your own PHP code</font>

234
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:49,660
which in this case it's using pass

235
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:58,300
through and in this case we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can just run</font>

236
00:13:49,660 --> 00:14:00,279
LS<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so those are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously so i</font>

237
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:18,339
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's that's a bit more effective</font>

238
00:14:00,279 --> 00:14:20,529
than just having a<font color="#CCCCCC"> another</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> papa sorry no</font>

239
00:14:18,339 --> 00:14:26,860
no<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm going to explain that soon ya</font>

240
00:14:20,529 --> 00:14:30,250
know it so how did<font color="#E5E5E5"> that work</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i suppose</font>

241
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:37,269
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> urine yeah you're interested in and</font>

242
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:40,000
that of course and and yet the idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

243
00:14:37,269 --> 00:14:43,029
that from that HTML file which

244
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:46,930
references new admin<font color="#E5E5E5"> jas and which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font>

245
00:14:43,029 --> 00:14:50,199
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to show soon you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get to read the</font>

246
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:53,500
new admin page which ex actually has a

247
00:14:50,199 --> 00:14:55,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">CSRF token that is unique to that</font>

248
00:14:53,500 --> 00:15:00,189
function so you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to actually call</font>

249
00:14:55,990 --> 00:15:02,050
the new admin page first read the token

250
00:15:00,189 --> 00:15:05,199
because if you read any<font color="#CCCCCC"> other token is</font>

251
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:08,529
not going to work and then submit the

252
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:10,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">form force the administrators browser to</font>

253
00:15:08,529 --> 00:15:13,839
submit the form through<font color="#E5E5E5"> javascript</font>

254
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:18,029
because javascript is on the same domain

255
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:20,500
so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is allowed as a feature and and</font>

256
00:15:18,029 --> 00:15:23,529
there's obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> defeats defeats</font>

257
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:25,689
cross-site request forgery so that's why

258
00:15:23,529 --> 00:15:28,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> need you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know the JavaScript and the</font>

259
00:15:25,689 --> 00:15:33,069
more more importantly the HTML file to

260
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:37,000
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the victims website so let's look</font>

261
00:15:33,069 --> 00:15:38,180
at the code quickly jquery makes it you

262
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:43,279
know quite quite easy

263
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:45,770
to you have the URL which any pen tester

264
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:47,630
can configure user name password and

265
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:50,449
email address those those are the main

266
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:54,320
things that are required and once you

267
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:57,110
know once you<font color="#E5E5E5"> configure those you get</font>

268
00:15:54,320 --> 00:16:02,209
the admin to click on that on the HTML

269
00:15:57,110 --> 00:16:05,899
which caused this and so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

270
00:16:02,209 --> 00:16:08,689
get request here and then we read the

271
00:16:05,899 --> 00:16:13,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">notes and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the referrer which is</font>

272
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:15,440
predictable anyway and then send a post

273
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:18,380
request which creates the user so this

274
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:23,149
is forcing the admins web browser to do

275
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:25,339
this same<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing with joomla and and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

276
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:27,770
suppose<font color="#CCCCCC"> any other web application out</font>

277
00:16:25,339 --> 00:16:30,290
there once you have these privileges you

278
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:32,750
can do<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things and you should as I</font>

279
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:35,689
spent testers you should and disclaims

280
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:38,180
you should expect you know such such

281
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:43,100
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be shown in at least in the</font>

282
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:46,760
report so same thing your first reading

283
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:51,580
the page and then posting to find out

284
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:55,819
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> CSF token something a bit different</font>

285
00:16:51,580 --> 00:17:00,620
so Abraham before me spoke about cross

286
00:16:55,820 --> 00:17:05,350
cross domain<font color="#E5E5E5"> at XML and he explained how</font>

287
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:12,829
it might have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been a very massive</font>

288
00:17:05,349 --> 00:17:16,280
policies so in this case it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> very easy</font>

289
00:17:12,829 --> 00:17:18,319
to find this issue and it's it's it's

290
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:21,559
quite likely<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you find it especially</font>

291
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:24,438
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> your your target as pen tester your</font>

292
00:17:21,559 --> 00:17:28,459
target is is running a flash heavy site

293
00:17:24,439 --> 00:17:32,540
so we're talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know websites</font>

294
00:17:28,459 --> 00:17:36,130
that have online gaming sites or stuff

295
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:36,129
like this that is very fleshy and

296
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:42,770
however demonstrating this issue you

297
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:48,470
know might might not be so

298
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:50,120
straightforward sometimes so we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

299
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:52,400
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same thing</font>

300
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:55,459
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to have flesh in this case</font>

301
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:57,890
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have flesh do the same</font>

302
00:17:55,460 --> 00:18:02,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">things that we did previously I create a</font>

303
00:17:57,890 --> 00:18:04,930
new user but without any without any

304
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:10,370
access without any you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know upload</font>

305
00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:15,950
privileges on the victim website so in

306
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:19,790
this case we have the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the admin who's</font>

307
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:22,340
logged in as usual and we have the

308
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:25,460
attacker who doesn't have any access to

309
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:28,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">the website but the attacker this time</font>

310
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:33,740
knows that you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> cross domain dot XML</font>

311
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:37,580
has a nice asterisk in there which is

312
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:39,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">quite useful to the attacker so the</font>

313
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:45,530
attacker has his own web server

314
00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:49,610
obviously and he created<font color="#E5E5E5"> an HTML page</font>

315
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:51,889
that loads a flash file that can then

316
00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:54,860
receive commands from<font color="#CCCCCC"> JavaScript which</font>

317
00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:58,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">makes it quite easy to configure rather</font>

318
00:18:54,860 --> 00:19:04,879
than having to have flash files for each

319
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:07,899
target so if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> send this link to this</font>

320
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:12,670
web server which is totally different

321
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:12,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">and the administrator clicks on that</font>

322
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:27,919
then it starts reading the page so flesh

323
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:32,890
through<font color="#E5E5E5"> JavaScript tells flesh to read</font>

324
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:35,929
the page of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the of the victim and then</font>

325
00:19:32,890 --> 00:19:38,530
send a post request with the CSF token

326
00:19:35,929 --> 00:19:42,049
and with the new username and password

327
00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:46,370
and then we can obviously again<font color="#E5E5E5"> login as</font>

328
00:19:42,049 --> 00:19:55,158
in this case begged or two and the

329
00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:57,739
password so there's no no no cross-site

330
00:19:55,159 --> 00:19:59,750
scripting there's no no upload

331
00:19:57,740 --> 00:20:03,890
privileges in this case but it's the

332
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:07,130
same concept you showing you know that

333
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:13,600
you can gain administrator privileges

334
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:17,390
through something different so I

335
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:19,100
explained how this works the code<font color="#CCCCCC"> looks</font>

336
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:21,380
something like this so it's all

337
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:23,389
JavaScript code which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> really easy to</font>

338
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:27,730
configure and it really easy to you know

339
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:32,750
rewrite depending<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your needs and so</font>

340
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:37,159
<font color="#CCCCCC">you have make a call which reads the the</font>

341
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:39,110
HTML page for the new admin dot PHP or

342
00:20:37,159 --> 00:20:41,950
something like that and then you have

343
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:45,740
the display response which actually

344
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:48,640
parses that HTML page and then sends the

345
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:56,690
form with the username<font color="#E5E5E5"> and password</font>

346
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:58,909
creating the<font color="#CCCCCC"> new administrator so I only</font>

347
00:20:56,690 --> 00:21:02,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">show to now I only showed you know how</font>

348
00:20:58,909 --> 00:21:04,970
to abuse these sort of issues to create

349
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:08,120
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> new administrator and that's this I</font>

350
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:13,070
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that sometimes that's enough but</font>

351
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:15,709
it would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be great to you know target</font>

352
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:18,740
specifically target your your clients

353
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:20,600
applications so let's say you found a

354
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:23,510
cross-site scripting vulnerability in

355
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:25,789
one application and on the same domain

356
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:27,350
name doesn't have to be the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> server</font>

357
00:21:25,789 --> 00:21:29,620
behind you might have some load

358
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:32,719
balancing your you might have some some

359
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:34,250
interesting setup but as long as<font color="#E5E5E5"> its own</font>

360
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:38,380
the same domain name say you have

361
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:42,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">squirrelmail or owa outlook web access</font>

362
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:45,039
then you might<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to create</font>

363
00:21:42,789 --> 00:21:47,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">JavaScript</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> code that reads the last</font>

364
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:49,908
hundred emails thousand emails and

365
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:53,209
forwards them somewhere else<font color="#E5E5E5"> or searches</font>

366
00:21:49,909 --> 00:21:55,490
through<font color="#E5E5E5"> creates a new filter and and</font>

367
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:57,020
forwards everything found in that filter

368
00:21:55,490 --> 00:21:59,990
and that filter might have you<font color="#CCCCCC"> no</font>

369
00:21:57,020 --> 00:22:02,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">password you know lots of lots of people</font>

370
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:04,640
receive passwords by email and some of

371
00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:08,059
these passwords might give you further

372
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:13,460
access anyway so that's that's always

373
00:22:08,059 --> 00:22:16,610
interesting and obviously interesting

374
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:20,539
for discussion is creating something

375
00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:22,879
generic something that works across many

376
00:22:20,539 --> 00:22:25,580
different web applications automatically

377
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:28,010
without you know having<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the attacker</font>

378
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:30,220
having to be awake at that hour where

379
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:35,450
the victim is clicking on the link that

380
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:42,440
that would be<font color="#CCCCCC"> great but I'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

381
00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:44,990
showing the mo of precise scripting so

382
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:47,150
in this case it's not worth<font color="#E5E5E5"> press</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

383
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:49,909
has cross-site scripting I mean this

384
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:52,490
version actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> has a cross-site</font>

385
00:22:49,909 --> 00:22:56,360
scripting vulnerability<font color="#E5E5E5"> but on the same</font>

386
00:22:52,490 --> 00:22:57,980
server and this is quite common you have

387
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:59,928
on the same server you might have

388
00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:03,980
different applications but people

389
00:22:59,929 --> 00:23:07,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">decided to have / blog with WordPress</font>

390
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:11,890
and in this case we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very simple</font>

391
00:23:07,370 --> 00:23:17,408
process scripting vulnerability<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

392
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:17,409
sample web application called simple XSS

393
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:35,200
and obviously I mean it's just an extra

394
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:39,639
but you might not<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to have script</font>

395
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:45,270
tags in your<font color="#CCCCCC"> URL so that's one way it's</font>

396
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:45,270
quite lame but it I suppose it works

397
00:23:50,369 --> 00:23:55,509
again<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm using skype but obviously you</font>

398
00:23:53,919 --> 00:24:01,929
could use any other method to

399
00:23:55,509 --> 00:24:07,239
communicate with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the target and once the</font>

400
00:24:01,929 --> 00:24:11,109
target so the target is logged in as

401
00:24:07,239 --> 00:24:19,179
usual the administrator once he clicks

402
00:24:11,109 --> 00:24:23,379
on the link no users are created<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this</font>

403
00:24:19,179 --> 00:24:28,659
case we take a different approach and

404
00:24:23,379 --> 00:24:33,248
begged or the things which so we add at

405
00:24:28,659 --> 00:24:36,909
the end of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the of the team the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> WordPress</font>

406
00:24:33,249 --> 00:24:39,519
team we had some PHP code if it<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't</font>

407
00:24:36,909 --> 00:24:41,529
exist already so that we don't end up

408
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:47,499
with her with too much like too<font color="#E5E5E5"> many</font>

409
00:24:41,529 --> 00:24:50,769
lies and then through this the attacker

410
00:24:47,499 --> 00:24:53,049
can access the PHP<font color="#E5E5E5"> backdoor that he just</font>

411
00:24:50,769 --> 00:24:56,109
created so in this case we're back

412
00:24:53,049 --> 00:25:00,279
doored 404 so we have to trigger<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

413
00:24:56,109 --> 00:25:04,210
404 dot PHP somehow and one way<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font>

414
00:25:00,279 --> 00:25:09,009
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is by going to a blog post that</font>

415
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:12,340
doesn't exist yet and in this case the

416
00:25:09,009 --> 00:25:15,789
parameter was worked so root equals a

417
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:19,149
less and we get our directory listing at

418
00:25:15,789 --> 00:25:21,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">the end of the non-existent page so</font>

419
00:25:19,149 --> 00:25:23,498
that's that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> pretty cool and it's a bit</font>

420
00:25:21,129 --> 00:25:26,889
more stealthy than creating an

421
00:25:23,499 --> 00:25:29,919
administrator it depends on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the case</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font>

422
00:25:26,889 --> 00:25:32,949
<font color="#CCCCCC">pentester you might be required to be</font>

423
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:37,720
more stealthy or sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's okay to</font>

424
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:41,919
just you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know show up with not lots of</font>

425
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:44,190
new users on the system so in which case

426
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:47,499
is this sort of neat thing needed

427
00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:49,629
obviously we<font color="#CCCCCC"> covered the first three so</font>

428
00:25:47,499 --> 00:25:52,869
cross-site scripting flesh cross domain

429
00:25:49,629 --> 00:25:55,029
and upload<font color="#CCCCCC"> top certain file types HTML</font>

430
00:25:52,869 --> 00:25:59,349
especially but you know if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font>

431
00:25:55,029 --> 00:26:03,340
upload some other file types then you

432
00:25:59,349 --> 00:26:09,490
might also be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to run your code</font>

433
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:12,490
within that domain privileges but html5

434
00:26:09,490 --> 00:26:14,620
is also interesting because you have

435
00:26:12,490 --> 00:26:18,970
something very similar to two flashes

436
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:21,909
across the meadow<font color="#E5E5E5"> XML and other cross</font>

437
00:26:18,970 --> 00:26:23,830
domain methods of course and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

438
00:26:21,910 --> 00:26:26,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">discuss this more maybe you guys have</font>

439
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:31,659
some more ideas where these sort of

440
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:33,820
payloads could be useful yeah originally

441
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:36,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">I thought it would be cool to provide</font>

442
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:39,389
some mitigation and solution because it

443
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:42,700
sounds nice when I'm submitting a

444
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:45,220
presentation to the CFP committee so I

445
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:50,020
have one slide<font color="#E5E5E5"> about you know solutions</font>

446
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:51,880
and stuff I think I think we we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

447
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:55,800
problem fixing these things because

448
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:58,690
there are features and not bugs so your

449
00:26:55,800 --> 00:27:01,960
your solution your web application

450
00:26:58,690 --> 00:27:05,440
firewall is probably not going to fix

451
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:09,280
your upload because that's a feature you

452
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:13,030
want your authors to upload files so

453
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:15,879
it's very likely that you know you need

454
00:27:13,030 --> 00:27:17,889
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need you won't be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able to fix this</font>

455
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:21,640
easily however there are different

456
00:27:17,890 --> 00:27:23,560
solutions depending on the case so for

457
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:25,300
example<font color="#E5E5E5"> if we look at what gmail does</font>

458
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:28,360
you know on gmail you receive

459
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:31,090
attachments right the attachments don't

460
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:33,699
end up even even though Google try to

461
00:27:31,090 --> 00:27:36,730
scrub scrub some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the ages some of the</font>

462
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:42,010
files but still the attachments don't

463
00:27:36,730 --> 00:27:45,400
end up on mail google<font color="#CCCCCC"> com because if</font>

464
00:27:42,010 --> 00:27:48,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">someone finds a way to bypass this these</font>

465
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:51,430
scrubbing and these HTML sanitization

466
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:53,290
methods then that attachment might be

467
00:27:51,430 --> 00:27:56,620
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to read your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> emails might be able</font>

468
00:27:53,290 --> 00:27:59,860
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> allow forward your emails and and and</font>

469
00:27:56,620 --> 00:28:07,540
stuff like that so<font color="#CCCCCC"> they host them on a</font>

470
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:11,590
different domain name so clearly hosting

471
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:15,610
your blog or your web applications on a

472
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:16,480
different domain name then across

473
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:19,360
different

474
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:23,350
applications has security benefits

475
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:25,209
although<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> totally understand</font>

476
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:29,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">that the marketing department might not</font>

477
00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:31,870
agree the<font color="#E5E5E5"> SEO guys might not agree so</font>

478
00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:35,980
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously from a security point</font>

479
00:28:31,870 --> 00:28:38,020
of point of view and obviously when it

480
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:40,750
comes to cross domain policy so cross

481
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:43,418
domain dot XML and the equivalent

482
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:48,970
another technology Silverlight and<font color="#E5E5E5"> html5</font>

483
00:28:43,419 --> 00:28:51,280
five then that's relatively easy to to

484
00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:54,580
solve you don't use an asterisk of

485
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:57,940
course but there is a good reason why

486
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:59,790
they use asterisks and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

487
00:28:57,940 --> 00:29:04,809
it's quite a pain in the ass for

488
00:28:59,790 --> 00:29:07,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">developers to decide which domains have</font>

489
00:29:04,809 --> 00:29:14,950
to read content from their web

490
00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:17,799
applications so with<font color="#CCCCCC"> this presentation I</font>

491
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:21,309
I will publish some code the code<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

492
00:29:17,799 --> 00:29:25,030
we saw here there's only these few

493
00:29:21,309 --> 00:29:27,389
examples but it's rather easy to add

494
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:32,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">more and I hope that you guys will</font>

495
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:36,370
submit your own and contribute so go

496
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:39,520
forth and test and give me feedback it's

497
00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:46,780
over here and I think we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> some few</font>

498
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:49,860
seconds for questions oh so we were

499
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:53,559
<font color="#CCCCCC">talking about this already or about</font>

500
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:57,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">stuffing beef</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok pick about a generic</font>

501
00:29:53,559 --> 00:29:59,500
approach I'm thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about like the</font>

502
00:29:57,250 --> 00:30:02,080
approach we used to detect internal

503
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:04,780
network without resources having like

504
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:07,389
the image files of like<font color="#CCCCCC"> Cisco Reuters</font>

505
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:09,520
netgear Reuters right we can do the same

506
00:30:07,390 --> 00:30:11,830
like adding<font color="#E5E5E5"> Drupal and this kind of</font>

507
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:14,400
stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> so like you select the delivery</font>

508
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:16,750
method and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then you try to add users</font>

509
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:18,250
blindly obviously yeah or maybe even

510
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:21,250
detecting if you are in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same time</font>

511
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:23,679
yeah at that<font color="#E5E5E5"> stage you don't have to do</font>

512
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:24,940
it blindly as well because in the same

513
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:27,340
time<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean you still have some brute</font>

514
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:29,690
force techniques of course but yeah you

515
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:34,639
have much more<font color="#E5E5E5"> access than just</font>

516
00:30:29,690 --> 00:30:43,820
cross-site request forgery style any

517
00:30:34,639 --> 00:30:46,668
more questions yeah hi I really really

518
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:49,759
cool stuff thank you i well it's not

519
00:30:46,669 --> 00:30:54,350
there are questions just as us for<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

520
00:30:49,759 --> 00:30:58,460
input<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at two years ago priate</font>

521
00:30:54,350 --> 00:31:01,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">x campo Bradley's ended up somewhere I</font>

522
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:06,549
don't remember not actually do that is a

523
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:10,039
web form where you feel some data like a

524
00:31:06,549 --> 00:31:14,090
URL for image URL where you want to

525
00:31:10,039 --> 00:31:16,669
submit your your details and it's going

526
00:31:14,090 --> 00:31:18,918
<font color="#E5E5E5">to generate JavaScript to use in a</font>

527
00:31:16,669 --> 00:31:20,990
payload it's going to generate like a

528
00:31:18,919 --> 00:31:23,149
fake login page it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to generate</font>

529
00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:25,370
different payloads to do this<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

530
00:31:23,149 --> 00:31:27,199
stuff so<font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe you can help well I don't</font>

531
00:31:25,370 --> 00:31:30,469
know it to cover your email on so that's

532
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:33,740

534
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:45,290
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> should discuss some some of these</font>

535
00:31:35,570 --> 00:31:46,939
ideas beer yeah

536
