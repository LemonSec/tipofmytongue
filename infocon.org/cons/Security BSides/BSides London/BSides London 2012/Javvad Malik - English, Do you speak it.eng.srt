11
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:45,360
I work for whoever pays me<font color="#CCCCCC"> the most</font>

12
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:48,750
money sorry sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> so what am I here</font>

13
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:51,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">to talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about I'm here to converse with</font>

14
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:54,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">you about the imageable benefits of</font>

15
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:58,910
devolve ndon complexities of common

16
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:58,910
communication in information security

17
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:05,970
yeah okay in simpler language<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm here</font>

18
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:07,890
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about simple use of the English</font>

19
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:10,289
language how it can benefit us as

20
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:15,210
individuals and the industry<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a large</font>

21
00:01:10,289 --> 00:01:17,549
in information security now I suppose

22
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:19,559
before I go into that is quite important

23
00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:21,810
i<font color="#CCCCCC"> explained one concept that came across</font>

24
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:24,259
by a guy called simon Sinek no

25
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:26,609
relationship about how we actually

26
00:01:24,259 --> 00:01:31,259
communicate with each other and he came

27
00:01:26,609 --> 00:01:34,109
up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this rather complex model so</font>

28
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:37,560
this model I'll talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> you through how it</font>

29
00:01:34,109 --> 00:01:40,530
works this is the three layers as to how

30
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:42,270
we communicate and so what am i doing

31
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:45,119
what am i doing here right now i'm here

32
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:47,100
to talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you about simple english yeah</font>

33
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:50,340
which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a pretty good statement of</font>

34
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:52,559
intent but sounds pretty dull so then

35
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:53,429
how am I going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that how much</font>

36
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,439
you're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk to you about</font>

37
00:01:53,429 --> 00:01:58,619
English where I'm going to use a bit of

38
00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:01,829
PowerPoint some examples maybe throw in

39
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:03,959
a few bad jokes but there's something

40
00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:06,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">really that's in the back of everyone's</font>

41
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:09,360
mind and that's why why is this short

42
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:12,420
fat bearded brown guy standing on stage

43
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:14,910
talking to me about using simple English

44
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:15,929
and how that's going to help<font color="#E5E5E5"> information</font>

45
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:17,370
security

46
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:22,319
because it<font color="#CCCCCC"> doesn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really work like that</font>

47
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:24,239
I supposed to explain that part we have

48
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:31,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> back in time to when I was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

49
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:35,280
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> boy no now before</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i actually got</font>

50
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:37,138
a spare tire and filled<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i was</font>

51
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:41,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually quite a skinny nerdy looking</font>

52
00:02:37,139 --> 00:02:42,359
bloke and as a result<font color="#E5E5E5"> i don't know if</font>

53
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:45,209
any of you actually look like that when

54
00:02:42,359 --> 00:02:47,639
you were young but you just tend to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

55
00:02:45,209 --> 00:02:49,019
bullied a bit it wasn't too bad it

56
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:51,900
wasn't too bad so don't feel too sorry

57
00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:53,370
for me and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i found it got a lot better</font>

58
00:02:51,900 --> 00:03:00,950
once<font color="#E5E5E5"> i started hanging around with</font>

59
00:02:53,370 --> 00:03:03,120
smaller kids which was a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fun</font>

60
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:06,000
however when<font color="#E5E5E5"> i entered the the sort of</font>

61
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,859
corporate world I realize that size

62
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,319
doesn't really matter it doesn't matter

63
00:03:07,859 --> 00:03:14,730
how strong you are because it's all

64
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:18,439
about your intellect what do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

65
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:20,190
and how do you use that<font color="#E5E5E5"> information</font>

66
00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:22,019
that's why we're in this industry

67
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:26,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">because we understand the value</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of that</font>

68
00:03:22,019 --> 00:03:28,829
information there are a few crossovers

69
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:30,569
of course so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up a pursuit</font>

70
00:03:28,829 --> 00:03:32,340
like chess boxing it's real<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can look</font>

71
00:03:30,569 --> 00:03:34,409
it up you play a round of chess and

72
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:35,939
around<font color="#CCCCCC"> a boxing and the winner is of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

73
00:03:34,409 --> 00:03:38,010
you can either knock someone out or you

74
00:03:35,939 --> 00:03:42,750
can give them checkmate really

75
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:44,759
interesting anyway so we get back to the

76
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:47,699
<font color="#CCCCCC">model and so how does</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this apply to</font>

77
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:50,970
information security and a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> us are</font>

78
00:03:47,699 --> 00:03:52,799
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> good at explaining what we do or</font>

79
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:55,349
we have a rough inkling as to what we do

80
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:57,629
so what do we do we stop<font color="#CCCCCC"> bad guys</font>

81
00:03:55,349 --> 00:04:00,599
getting access to information we like

82
00:03:57,629 --> 00:04:04,018
breaking things we stop insiders from

83
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:06,509
attacking us how do we do that well we

84
00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:09,720
either use our favorite backtrack

85
00:04:06,509 --> 00:04:11,720
installation or node 0 or samurai or or

86
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:14,579
we write reports or we conduct an audit

87
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:16,199
actions or risk assessments or all this

88
00:04:14,579 --> 00:04:19,650
kind of stuff these are our tools of how

89
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:21,269
we go about it but why why do we do this

90
00:04:19,649 --> 00:04:24,239
and why is information security

91
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:28,969
important and generally as a whole we're

92
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:31,110
pretty crap<font color="#CCCCCC"> at explaining</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this to others</font>

93
00:04:28,969 --> 00:04:33,240
when you look at information security

94
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:37,169
department<font color="#E5E5E5"> with an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> organization why do</font>

95
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:39,419
they exist and people generally can't

96
00:04:37,169 --> 00:04:41,609
give you a very clear answer project

97
00:04:39,419 --> 00:04:44,068
managers will say we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to engage them</font>

98
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:46,409
because they are key and getting our

99
00:04:44,069 --> 00:04:48,599
project signed off<font color="#E5E5E5"> and go live the CEO</font>

100
00:04:46,409 --> 00:04:50,909
says well I heard<font color="#E5E5E5"> this some legislation</font>

101
00:04:48,599 --> 00:04:53,430
that requires me to other nite ize

102
00:04:50,909 --> 00:04:55,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">Department so I've got an is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> department</font>

103
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:58,590
and I pay for these bunch of overpaid

104
00:04:55,379 --> 00:04:59,939
consultants and they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not very clear</font>

105
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:03,179
our customers aren't very clear because

106
00:04:59,939 --> 00:05:06,870
we aren't very clear ourselves as to why

107
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:09,300
we do it a lot of you<font color="#E5E5E5"> might say ya gotta</font>

108
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:10,800
do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the lulz or you know I do it</font>

109
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:13,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">for the money but these aren't real the</font>

110
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:15,330
real reason the real drivers and and

111
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:17,610
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> something that because we fail</font>

112
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:20,370
to articulate clearly we fail to get

113
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:22,080
buy-in from others<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this is something</font>

114
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:24,029
like I look at myself as well and I

115
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:26,068
think well you know someone says to<font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font>

116
00:05:24,029 --> 00:05:27,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">and this is on conversation I have my</font>

117
00:05:26,069 --> 00:05:30,300
children quite a lot my daughter says

118
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:32,039
who what do you do oh I I'm a<font color="#E5E5E5"> security</font>

119
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:36,569
guard on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the internet think of it like</font>

120
00:05:32,039 --> 00:05:39,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">that why well because there are bad</font>

121
00:05:36,569 --> 00:05:41,430
people on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet why well they</font>

122
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:44,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to take stuff that doesn't belong</font>

123
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:46,379
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> them why</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and you you can go mad in</font>

124
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:48,240
this sort of thing and you have to get

125
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:52,379
to a point we say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay okay sit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> down I</font>

126
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:54,960
do it because when you grow up I want

127
00:05:52,379 --> 00:05:56,460
your information<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be secure not just</font>

128
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,250
yours<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I want other children your age</font>

129
00:05:56,460 --> 00:06:01,138
I want their information to be secure

130
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:02,460
well how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do that aha now we're</font>

131
00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:04,349
<font color="#CCCCCC">getting to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the hell you understood the y</font>

132
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:06,930
now we get to the half how do i do that

133
00:06:04,349 --> 00:06:08,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">i work for companies I help them get</font>

134
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:10,379
secure and they can secure your

135
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:13,349
information your mum's information

136
00:06:10,379 --> 00:06:15,180
everybody's information and we can we

137
00:06:13,349 --> 00:06:17,729
can start transacting it in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a safe</font>

138
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:22,189
way so that when you grow up you still

139
00:06:17,729 --> 00:06:22,188
have some privacy left in your life

140
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:38,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'll give you a good example of I think</font>

141
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:41,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's good</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I was once reviewing a pin</font>

142
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:43,510
mailer system for a bank and the pin

143
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:44,650
mailer system is one where the pin

144
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:47,590
numbers are generated for your credit

145
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:49,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">card or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> debit card they get encrypted</font>

146
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:50,859
into a pin block so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you've got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a pin</font>

147
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:52,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">number there's a couple of different</font>

148
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:53,860
ways but you've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> the pin number and</font>

149
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:56,080
only the pan number and the user's name

150
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:58,300
and address it gets encrypted into a

151
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:01,479
block sent along the wire to the

152
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:03,790
wherever<font color="#E5E5E5"> the printer is and the printer</font>

153
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:06,010
normally has a HSN built into it so it

154
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:08,710
decrypts the information internally it

155
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:12,250
prints it<font color="#CCCCCC"> onto that tamper proof paper</font>

156
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:15,070
and print it out so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that no one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> has ever</font>

157
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:17,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">seen your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pin number that's the general</font>

158
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:19,360
principle of how a pin mailer works so

159
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:21,490
no one sees a pin<font color="#CCCCCC"> number if anyone</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tries</font>

160
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,980
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see it gets exposed as like void</font>

161
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:24,910
tampered with and they post it off to

162
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:27,070
the address that's printed on the

163
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:31,000
outside I was looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of these</font>

164
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:32,590
systems<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the printer that they had</font>

165
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,650
used was an old printer so it didn't

166
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:37,659
have a HSN built into it so soon<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

167
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:40,900
network into the data center there's a

00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:43,120
hater sim there the data got decrypted

169
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:46,859
and across the data centers internal

174
00:07:54,520 --> 00:08:00,400
data and they've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> the pin number pan</font>

175
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:01,680
number name and address so you know they

176
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:04,719
could siphon it all off send it abroad

money out cash point this had been

179
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:13,599
recognized and raised as a risk two

181
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:23,850

business<font color="#E5E5E5"> stupid do they not care about</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">you know a few pin numbers going missing</font>

184
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:32,439
or some users losing their money<font color="#E5E5E5"> was it</font>

185
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:36,939
too expensive and one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the reasons</font>

186
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:39,070
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> is we don't get to the why why is</font>

187
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:41,770
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> really important</font>

188
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:45,370
to make sure that pin block is encrypted

all the way to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end we ourselves</font>

sometimes are lazy in the sense that we

191
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:52,120
don't dig into the business reasons

192
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:57,370
behind why do we even use a pin number

193
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:59,050
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first place and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> because we can't</font>

194
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:02,080
articulate it clearly the business<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

195
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:05,079
understand it and all they hear is blah

196
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:07,810
blah<font color="#CCCCCC"> blah is going to cost 10,000 pounds</font>

197
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:10,090
to buy a new printer and blah blah blah

198
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:13,000
would someone might not be able to get

199
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:14,530
the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> pin numbers from the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> internal</font>

200
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,560
data center which they've already spent

201
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:20,770
millions on to build secure anyway so it

202
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:22,739
doesn't make<font color="#CCCCCC"> any sense but when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you look</font>

203
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:25,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">into that actual business process around</font>

204
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:26,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">why do we have a pin</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> number and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> why do</font>

205
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:29,050
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> want it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be secure from the point</font>

00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:32,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">of generation to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the point it reaches</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">the customers hand business-wise you</font>

208
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:37,780
need to be able to prove<font color="#CCCCCC"> that from the</font>

209
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:40,360
time is generated to the time it reaches

<font color="#CCCCCC">the customer and they open it it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hasn't</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">been tampered with if you cannot prove</font>

212
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:48,790
that and it goes<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a quarter floor if</font>

213
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:54,280
you cannot prove that or this reasonable

214
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:58,420
doubt your hole card security comes

215
00:09:54,280 --> 00:10:00,790
under question because you can't prove

216
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:03,400
it and then anyone with a credit card

217
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:06,250
can go to court and say<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have a bank</font>

218
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:07,480
card with that<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bank I want my money back</font>

219
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:10,750
because I didn't make<font color="#CCCCCC"> any of these</font>

220
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:13,330
transactions<font color="#CCCCCC"> whew all of a sudden that</font>

221
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:15,280
becomes a real problem that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

222
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:19,150
that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> business can understand that's</font>

223
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:23,560
in their language I'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say they</font>

224
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:25,420
went<font color="#E5E5E5"> and fixed it they sort of thing so</font>

225
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:28,150
they move the hsm closer to the printer

226
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:30,430
and they they shorten the cable between

227
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:33,540
it and they segregate did it a bit so it

228
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:36,579
was pretty good but that's the power of

229
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:39,040
speaking<font color="#CCCCCC"> the language people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> won't do</font>

230
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:41,830
what we want them to<font color="#CCCCCC"> do just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because we</font>

231
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:44,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">tell them to do it and it's not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just on</font>

232
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:45,910
risk acceptance it's at the business

233
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:48,190
level project managers won't engage yes

234
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:50,140
we have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> speak in their language that</font>

235
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:52,390
they understand and<font color="#CCCCCC"> when they understand</font>

236
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:54,030
it they<font color="#E5E5E5"> will take it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on as their own</font>

237
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:56,620
belief

238
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:59,770
this is the problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> with compliance</font>

239
00:10:56,620 --> 00:11:01,420
issues so PCI DSS people only do it

240
00:10:59,770 --> 00:11:05,290
because they feel they<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to do it and</font>

241
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:07,089
they'll only do what they have to do but

242
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:10,719
if you can get them to understand in

243
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:13,090
language that they understand why they

244
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:15,520
have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> do it then you won't need to</font>

245
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:17,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">continue poke and prod them they'll</font>

246
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:18,939
probably generally do it themselves if

247
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:24,700
it makes business sense if it's in their

248
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:29,080
language I'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to introduce you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

many people<font color="#CCCCCC"> know who she is good</font>

251
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:40,210
for people living in the UK at least

252
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:46,180
she's probably had one of the biggest

253
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:50,070
impacts on all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our lives and she was</font>

00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:53,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">born long before most of us were born</font>

255
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:55,770
and this was probably back in while she

256
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:59,280
was born or longer than that but<font color="#E5E5E5"> back in</font>

00:11:55,770 --> 00:12:07,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">1971 when I think Brian was a little boy</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">and John was a teenager she was sitting</font>

259
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:12,490
out trying to fill out a government form

260
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:14,290
from a local<font color="#E5E5E5"> council in Liverpool and</font>

261
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:15,700
she couldn't really understand how to

00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:17,079
fill out the form correctly she was

263
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:20,320
looking to see what benefits she could

264
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:25,030
claim on housing benefits and stuff like

265
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:26,440
that she just<font color="#E5E5E5"> didn't make any sense it</font>

266
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:27,640
made no<font color="#CCCCCC"> sense</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to her what so and she</font>

267
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:29,440
thought well maybe I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not really that</font>

268
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:31,720
educated and my english isn't that good

269
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:33,220
maybe it's just me maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> I need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

270
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:35,860
understand better<font color="#E5E5E5"> so she went to ask one</font>

271
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:37,630
of her friends and she was more educated

272
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:40,060
and she said well you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I really</font>

273
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:41,350
struggle with these forms myself so she

274
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:43,290
went to someone else and she done a bit

275
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:47,380
of research as much as you could in a

276
00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:49,480
Liverpool area and<font color="#CCCCCC"> she found wow you</font>

277
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:51,130
know nearly everyone I know struggles

278
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:53,920
with these flippin forms they just take

279
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:55,240
whatever seems appropriate they send it

280
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,900
off and they hope that they will get

281
00:12:55,240 --> 00:13:01,030
some you know benefit money or they'll

282
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:04,300
whatever you know council rates I'll

283
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:06,699
solid out properly and what have you so

284
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:08,560
she started a movement she said you know

285
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:09,910
what it's not my fault<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I</font>

286
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,739
countenance and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's the government's</font>

287
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:15,790
fault they should<font color="#CCCCCC"> provide forms that are</font>

288
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:17,590
easy to understand easy to implement so

289
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:20,199
this was the days before Twitter so she

290
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:22,420
couldn't do a hashtag campaign you know

291
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:25,000
simple<font color="#E5E5E5"> English for Chrissy and Liverpool</font>

292
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:27,310
so she started campaigning and

293
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,860
campaigning and she worked hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> and she</font>

294
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:32,920
worked hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> for about eight years and</font>

295
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:34,780

00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:36,729
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> houses of parliament set up a little</font>

298
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:40,690
government forms and so I shredding them

299
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:42,850
in front of the government she said

300
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:45,010
solid this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is my protest these</font>

301
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:46,930
governments aren't worth these platforms

302
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:48,610
on worth the paper they're printed on

303
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:52,630
I'm shredding them all they're useless

304
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:54,280
and there was a few you know journalists

305
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:58,420

432
00:19:52,790 --> 00:20:02,139

00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:05,330
somebody but what else is trust now a

434
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:07,820
few<font color="#CCCCCC"> weeks ago one of my neighbors kids</font>

435
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:09,560

436
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:12,080

437
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:16,220

different isn't it how many of<font color="#E5E5E5"> us are</font>

us some charts they give us some metrics

481
00:22:04,909 --> 00:22:09,789
they talk about risks but it<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't</font>

00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:09,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">really make much sense</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">Trust isn't</font>

484
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:23,669
Trust isn't something you can buy other

485
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:25,860
at the box and it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that</font>

00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:43,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know what yeah let's work with it</font>

492
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:48,620
are we isolating ourselves possibly does

493
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:48,620
insulting our<font color="#E5E5E5"> user base do us any favors</font>

00:22:53,220 --> 00:23:01,320
managers don't get it work no nine times

496
00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:03,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">out of ten when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you look at information</font>

497
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:05,850
okay we've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> these really effective</font>

498
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:07,470
hacks and high-tech things but when you

499
00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:09,209
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> over the trends they're not the</font>

500
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:11,280
ones that are<font color="#CCCCCC"> successful they're not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

501
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:13,020
ones that really talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> people time and</font>

502
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:14,670
time again they form a smaller

503
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:17,720
percentage and the majority<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> time</font>

504
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:20,370
this Oh sequel injection still up there

505
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:25,370
users clicking on links sent to them

506
00:23:20,370 --> 00:23:25,370
still up there so you know

507
00:23:26,890 --> 00:23:32,300
we're not really<font color="#E5E5E5"> there to explain stuff</font>

508
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:34,850
that's revolutionary different to them

509
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:37,310
it's simple things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

510
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:42,139
understand we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to explain able to</font>

511
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:45,850
explain in simple language and we need

512
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:49,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">to be able to clearly articulate why</font>

513
00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:51,500
don't click<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a link that's simple yeah</font>

514
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:53,630
so rather<font color="#E5E5E5"> than saying either you know if</font>

515
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:56,410
if your email client just delivers I

516
00:23:53,630 --> 00:24:00,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">HTML form another don't click on a link</font>

517
00:23:56,410 --> 00:24:03,200
simple why why shouldn't you click on a

518
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:07,189
link and it's more than it's bad for you

519
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:08,840
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay get into you know you when you</font>

520
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:10,280
build<font color="#CCCCCC"> that relationship and your trust</font>

521
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:12,199
with your users you'll get<font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

522
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:17,570

<font color="#E5E5E5">message better simple language get to</font>

the heart of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the problem and you know</font>

525
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:23,360
what users<font color="#CCCCCC"> will start trusting us and</font>

526
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:25,510
our message will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be more clearly</font>

528
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:33,430
departmental level and at an industrial

529

level thank you
