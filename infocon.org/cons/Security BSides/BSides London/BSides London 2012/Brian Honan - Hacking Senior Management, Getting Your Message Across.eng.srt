36
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:29,169
lived with background on me there so if

37
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:31,960
you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the past</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 12 months there's</font>

38
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:33,640
been a lot of mainstream media attention

39
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:36,809
given<font color="#E5E5E5"> to security breaches like if you</font>

take five years<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago a few years</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ago</font>

41
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:42,490
breaches were very much covered by a lot

42
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:44,470
of the our own industry media so SE

43
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:46,059
magazine the register or whatever would

44
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:47,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">have covered a lot of the stories</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

45
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:49,960
will be familiar<font color="#CCCCCC"> with but there wouldn't</font>

46
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:52,000
be anything in the in the telegraph from

47
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:53,619
BBC News or any other mainstream media a

48
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">lot of these stories</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would never make it</font>

49
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:57,850
but we're seeing that that change in now

50
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:00,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">you know we've had a lot of very high</font>

51
00:01:57,850 --> 00:02:04,298
public breaches the have dotted into

52
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:05,979
those areas so obviously because our

53
00:02:04,299 --> 00:02:08,799
board members on our senior management

54
00:02:05,979 --> 00:02:11,230
are watching those news channels or

55
00:02:08,799 --> 00:02:13,090
reading those papers they're aware of

56
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:15,269
those security breaches too so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

57
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:17,010
just ourselves anymore who<font color="#CCCCCC"> wear</font>

00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:26,850
were facing has changed over the years

62
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:31,950
so when I first started<font color="#CCCCCC"> off in IT as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:35,850
to worry about was mainframes everything

65
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,140
was located in one big central area with

66

these dumb term<font color="#E5E5E5"> and spread all over the</font>

67
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:41,579
place and that's all we had to<font color="#E5E5E5"> secure</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">pcs and unix and other machine started</font>

to come come our universities in into

70
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:46,560
mainstream and people start to play with

71
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:48,300
them and half of them but was very<font color="#E5E5E5"> much</font>

72
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,460
curiosity it was the true hacker term

73
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:52,560
that we had back<font color="#E5E5E5"> then was breaking the</font>

74
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:55,380
systems to fix them I'm that kind of

75
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:57,930
state steady until the late 80s Early

76
00:02:55,380 --> 00:03:00,210
90s and then we had still that the

77
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:02,040
hackers there to break fixed type

78
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:03,960
scenario but he also had<font color="#CCCCCC"> dogs doing for</font>

79
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:06,410
personal Fame so wordy face and websites

80
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:08,820
we're looking to become<font color="#E5E5E5"> well-known and</font>

81
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:10,710
again<font color="#CCCCCC"> through the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 90s that kept frame</font>

82
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:12,829
with the same but<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we've seen in</font>

83
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:15,780
this century in the past decade<font color="#CCCCCC"> or so</font>

84
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:18,030
organized crime<font color="#CCCCCC"> is getting more and more</font>

85
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:19,470
involved and they've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> money</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to troll</font>

86
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:21,630
behind this stuff so<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're try</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

88
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:27,950
seeing industrial and national espionage

89
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:30,660
taking place as well so even more

90
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:33,810
resources behind that and bigger trust

91
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:35,730
that we have to face yeah of course

92
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:38,400
can't do a presentation nowadays without

93
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:41,130
talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> anonymous but they have again</font>

94
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:43,110
raised the profile of security and you

95
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:44,340
can argue for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the good or the bad but</font>

96
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:47,040
they have done<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and it's something</font>

97
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:49,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do to accept it a lot of</font>

98
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:52,500
their attacks have hit the media and you

99
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:55,950
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> just was it last week to hear some</font>

100
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:59,910
UK government sites so and they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite</font>

101
00:03:55,950 --> 00:04:02,399
hidden quite a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of places users bring</font>

102
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:04,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">your own devices USB keys Dropbox the</font>

social media information<font color="#E5E5E5"> leak just</font>

104
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:08,459
happen a lot more in our environments

105
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:09,690
because of users now use it<font color="#E5E5E5"> there may</font>

106
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:12,030
not be doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> this stuff maliciously</font>

107
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:14,430
they're trying to do a<font color="#CCCCCC"> job there they're</font>

108
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:16,200
trying to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> work home they can do it</font>

109
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:17,549
at the weekend or they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to share</font>

110
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:20,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">information with a colleague or a</font>

111
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:22,048
<font color="#E5E5E5">business partner partner and because our</font>

112
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:23,790
IT security is so strict we don't allow

113
00:04:22,048 --> 00:04:26,070
large attachments in our email or we

114
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:28,800
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> allow FTP or the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> environment well</font>

115
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:32,129
we'll use Dropbox instead I will you

116
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:34,080
is an attachment on gmail or so my shape

117
00:04:32,129 --> 00:04:36,539
or form and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that information then comes</font>

118
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:39,620
goes outside our control and it's a trap

119
00:04:36,539 --> 00:04:41,818
but so so users are becoming a problem

120
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:43,050
we have a lot of business drivers as

121
00:04:41,819 --> 00:04:44,370
well so in the UK you've got the

122
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:46,379
information commissioner's office and

123
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:48,629
within other<font color="#E5E5E5"> European countries you've</font>

124
00:04:46,379 --> 00:04:51,569
got similar data protection requirements

125
00:04:48,629 --> 00:04:54,090
as well pci DSS is a big requirement as

126
00:04:51,569 --> 00:04:56,129
well for any companies that are doing

127
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:57,840
any sort of work<font color="#CCCCCC"> with credit card</font>

128
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:59,849
payments depending on what industry

manually so you know I t really is

151
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:55,860
becoming critical to how business

152
00:05:51,659 --> 00:05:57,750

know we all hate that word compliance

158
00:06:07,889 --> 00:06:13,319
but it is a business driver management's

159
00:06:11,129 --> 00:06:16,050
we actually should be get this done go

160
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:19,409
and fix this make us secure they should

161

is very<font color="#E5E5E5"> often what we get</font>

172
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:46,888
which means we're stuck there with the

173
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:49,139
problem with the headaches we're

174
00:06:46,889 --> 00:06:51,620
constantly shouting my god this word

175
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:53,880
we're going to be hacker are going to be

176
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:55,410
compromised and you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not listening to</font>

we have no budget no resources you know

179
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:01,888
we wear our hands are tied we're not

180
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:03,690
allowed to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to our peers in the</font>

181
00:07:01,889 --> 00:07:06,360
industry because we don't want to admit

182
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:09,240
we've got problems in our security so

183
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:10,889
we're very much you know we're likely I

184
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:12,330
often like them to being in a fight

185
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:14,669
against a prize fighter but one hand

186

tied behind your back we're struggling

187

00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:30,380
part is the problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> and is the problem</font>

192
00:07:27,389 --> 00:07:32,699
with management and senior management or

197
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:46,530
is where we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> through this</font>

198
00:07:41,849 --> 00:07:49,320
and ya hands up anybody in this room<font color="#CCCCCC"> who</font>

00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:55,080
can hack a windows box oh come on<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

200
00:07:49,320 --> 00:08:00,210
hoping a few more than their linux<font color="#CCCCCC"> Apple</font>

yeah easy application security<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I</font>

202
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:03,299
won't put my hand to put that<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

203
00:08:01,289 --> 00:08:05,159
because I couldn't last time<font color="#E5E5E5"> I caught it</font>

204
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:09,270
was indeed base free and that's a long

205
00:08:05,159 --> 00:08:11,460
time<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago but quite a few of you could</font>

206
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:14,820
hack your way to it cold quite easily no

207
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:17,340
problem come to this guy though we face

208
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:18,810
a stone wall we have a problem we have

209
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:20,638
social engineers in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> audience here</font>

who can social engineer<font color="#E5E5E5"> their way into</font>

211
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:25,139
an organization but what can't be social

00:08:25,139 --> 00:08:30,389
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who should know better and no</font>

214
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:34,890
best on the reaction i often guess is we

215
00:08:30,389 --> 00:08:37,620
think management are stupid they<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

216
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:41,429
understand the problem is why are they

217
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:43,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing is there you know they are stupid</font>

built that in the past they're the ones

248
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:57,870
insult them and think that they don't

249
00:09:55,410 --> 00:10:02,519
understand technology they do they made

250
00:09:57,870 --> 00:10:04,500
their focus under their main lines of

251
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:06,029
business have moved on they've changed

252
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:08,070
and they've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> different drivers that</font>

253
00:10:06,029 --> 00:10:09,810
they have to look so you're the nasty

254
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:12,300
but they are quite into any don't become

255
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:16,290
a senior management manager or CEO or

256
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:18,979
CTO or CFO by not having some where with

257
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:21,050
all about you you have to be you know

258
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:25,100
have a bit of brain power to do that

259
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:27,240
there are also very busy people right

260
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:29,010
particularly in the senior board level

261
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:31,800
our senior management level they

262
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:33,930
probably have<font color="#CCCCCC"> 20 30</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people reporting to</font>

263
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:36,750
them each with business each with

264
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:39,449
different business lines that that

265
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:41,250
they're responsible for they don't have

266
00:10:39,449 --> 00:10:43,829
the time<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into the nitty-gritty</font>

267
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:45,800
about everything that we know those they

268
00:10:43,829 --> 00:10:50,279
can't they can't be experts in finance

269
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:52,979
expert in industry law experts in

270
00:10:50,279 --> 00:10:55,920
copyright law experts in human

271
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:57,480
relationships experts in IT they just

272
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:59,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't have the time they depend on us to</font>

273
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:01,829
be those experts in our different fields

274
00:10:59,339 --> 00:11:04,740
and to be able to present them in a very

275
00:11:01,829 --> 00:11:06,660
concise way what it is we're trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

276
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:08,640
do so that they can make<font color="#CCCCCC"> the decisions</font>

277
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:08,910
or if they can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> make the decisions they</font>

278
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,580
can

279
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:13,829
then present what our issues are to the

280
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:17,130
board they in effect<font color="#CCCCCC"> has become our</font>

281
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:19,110
salespeople up higher so it's important

282
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:20,189
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> remember that they are very busy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

283
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:22,140
only have a certain amount of<font color="#E5E5E5"> time to do</font>

284
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:23,610
things so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to try to see how do</font>

285
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:27,030
we solve this how do we get around this

286
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:29,940
particular problem one thing you have to

have careers that they have to be

303

00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:22,560
get the blame and then it comes down

308
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:24,600
very often somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> says gathers</font>

00:13:56,490 --> 00:14:01,350
this is not what they hear the date they

server and the operating system what you

353
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:21,470

355
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:26,670
it's a sin to be one bill after another

356
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:29,189
bill that that we have to pay and that

357
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:31,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">is the problem and we forget all the</font>

presenting cases business cases to

pounds or whatever that's an expensive

365
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:52,830
part of 5,000 pounds or whatever the

366
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:54,540
price is going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be we just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> say the</font>

367
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:56,880
fire was going to cause this we forget

368
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:58,560
about installation costs it's going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

369
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:00,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">take an engineer two days to come in on</font>

00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:02,339
a daily rate you forget about the

371
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:04,500
training around that we forget<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

372
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:06,960
maintenance and sport cars that we might

<font color="#CCCCCC">have to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to ensure we forget that we may</font>

on the network that might depend on it

376
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:16,110
so the build grows and grows and grows I

377
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:17,820
mean forgetful or other indirect costs

378
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:19,680
what about our own<font color="#E5E5E5"> time that we are now</font>

379
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:21,750
spending on configure and imagine that

380
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:24,140
device that's time that we're not doing

381
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:27,210
the job you've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> paid for previously</font>

382
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:30,990
and we forget about the opportunity cost

383
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:34,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the organization as a whole if our</font>

00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:36,449
firewall cost<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10,000 pounds that's</font>

385
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:38,309
10,000 pounds less

386
00:15:36,449 --> 00:15:42,449
then the business has to spend on

387
00:15:38,309 --> 00:15:44,069
something else say marketing and as

388
00:15:42,449 --> 00:15:46,258
business person looking goes ten

more money and<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe more revenue and</font>

393
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,540
that's what we<font color="#CCCCCC"> often forget so we often</font>

source we may say it's free but think

401
00:16:14,249 --> 00:16:17,249
about all the other costs we just talked

402
00:16:15,449 --> 00:16:20,040
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> their the training the maintenance</font>

410
00:16:32,579 --> 00:16:37,618
this and maybe more secure now so that

411
00:16:34,859 --> 00:16:41,730
confusion comes in and management don't

environment<font color="#CCCCCC"> that still treat that as a</font>

443
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:03,330
business because they still have to get

444
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:06,620
students that are<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pay for fees and</font>

445
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:10,020

458
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:40,200
need and security so go and find out

459
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:42,919
what the business drivers are and then

460
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:46,890
try and<font color="#E5E5E5"> align your goals with that</font>

decisions bad decisions are made in

00:18:56,540 --> 00:19:01,110
knee-jerk reactions to situations and if

467
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:02,460
we keep running as<font color="#CCCCCC"> Chicken Little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

468
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:03,870
senior management saying here's another

00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:11,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">give the wrong reactions as well let's</font>

472
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:13,889
focus on the benefits of what we're

473
00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:15,720
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so come</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> back to the</font>

474
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:19,620
cost we said our<font color="#E5E5E5"> ear on about how we've</font>

475
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:21,800
added in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Carson solutions we're all so</font>

476
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:26,820
bad<font color="#CCCCCC"> i given the benefits for solutions</font>

477
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:28,620
so if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a problem in our</font>

478
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:31,230
organization for example say with

479
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:33,389
password management that users are

480
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:35,580
constantly resetting passwords are

481
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:39,030
looking for new passwords do a bit of

482
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:41,399
analysis and figure out how does that

483
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:44,580
impact the organization so go to the

484
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:47,160
help desk ask them how many password

485
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:49,679
reset cause they have in a month<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

486
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:53,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">then analyze that and see well if we had</font>

487
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:55,290
a self-help password management system

488
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:57,540
that for the user could reset the

489
00:19:55,290 --> 00:20:00,360
passwords themselves that potentially

490
00:19:57,540 --> 00:20:02,280
could save the organization money or if

491
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:03,270
we suffered X amount of breaches last

492
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:06,360
year

493
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:08,070
because of a particular application or<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

494
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:09,860
vulnerability that that we still haven't

495
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:12,210
dealt with our approach we haven't taken

496
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:14,639
try and<font color="#CCCCCC"> cost what that is to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

497
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:18,540
organization and then whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> solution</font>

498
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:19,980
you presenting present the benefits now

499
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:22,200
it may not there you know let's be

500
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:25,410
careful there may not be a direct cost

501
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:27,210
benefit ratio here where you know the

502
00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:29,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">problem caused this and our solution</font>

503
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:32,430
cause that so therefore you're saving a

504
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:33,810
huge chunk<font color="#E5E5E5"> of money there may know there</font>

505
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:35,880
may be no savings but what we actually

506
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:37,409
might be<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing is getting other benefits</font>

507
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:40,170
maybe we're making a process more smoke

508
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:41,970
more streamlined performs the system

509
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:43,620
might be better or whatever so try and

510
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:45,420
figure out what are the benefits of what

511
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:46,790
we're doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> or what we're proposing when</font>

512
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:51,780
it brings the business and it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

513
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:53,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're going to be more secure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's there</font>

514
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:55,950
can be other business benefits there as

515
00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:59,010
well and understand that security does

516
00:20:55,950 --> 00:21:02,310
have trade-offs you know the more secure

517
00:20:59,010 --> 00:21:04,560
an environment is sometimes it can<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

518
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:07,470
more difficult<font color="#E5E5E5"> for user to use so what</font>

519
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:10,110
he'll what other bands of that the more

520
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:11,280
security put on your network maybe the

521
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:13,860
more impact you might be having on

522
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:15,420
network performance so think about the

523
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:18,330
trade-offs I want to identify those

524
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:20,010
traders think of maybe ways to to tackle

525
00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:21,149
them or at least be aware of them so

526
00:21:20,010 --> 00:21:23,940
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talking to</font>

527
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:26,520
management you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> give them the full</font>

528
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:29,160
information to make their decisions and

529
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:30,750
we have to act professionally this is

530
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:32,220
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm probably going to ruffle a</font>

531
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:38,070
few feathers with when i talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about it</font>

532
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:39,150
but won't you know there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are we do think</font>

533
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:42,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">of ourselves as a bit of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Anneliese</font>

534
00:21:39,150 --> 00:21:46,370
within the organization now we<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font>

535
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:49,650
about people<font color="#CCCCCC"> come into security as noobs</font>

536
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:51,899
you know we were renowned for not being

537
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:55,530
a welcoming community for people want to

538
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:59,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">get into security you know as I resort</font>

539
00:21:55,530 --> 00:22:02,370
we run a conference and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Steven</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and Dale</font>

540
00:21:59,430 --> 00:22:04,110
here spoke at last year and in parallel

541
00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:05,820
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we actually have Ireland's hack</font>

542
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:08,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">error competition which is capital to</font>

543
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:10,290
capture the flag and the amount of

544
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:11,760
people we've invited are trying to

545
00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:14,310
encourage to take part<font color="#E5E5E5"> in that</font>

546
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:16,000
competition that turn on say no we don't

547
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:18,159
i don't want to do it I'm nervous

548
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,080
I'm afraid I'd be seen as a failure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

549
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:22,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">wouldn't be good enough and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I be logged</font>

550
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:24,850
off by the good<font color="#CCCCCC"> the good</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hackers there</font>

551
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:27,129
so we need to act more professionally

552
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:29,169
and stop this listen and be a bit more

553
00:22:27,130 --> 00:22:31,840
welcoming and help people come in

554
00:22:29,170 --> 00:22:33,550
because you know we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a SWAT team</font>

555
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:35,919
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how we view ourselves or do</font>

556
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:37,480
quite a lot of cases but we're not these

557
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:40,360
people this is how we reviewed by

558
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:43,240
business in a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of cases and it's true</font>

559
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:46,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">in fairness</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we're security we</font>

560
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:47,860
are supposed to protect an asset for

561
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:49,179
them for the organization the same way

562
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:51,520
as physical security protect buildings

563
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:53,290
that can be the way we're reviewed and

564
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:55,389
if we can't continue<font color="#E5E5E5"> with our elitism</font>

565
00:22:53,290 --> 00:22:57,540
and and the way we talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about things</font>

566
00:22:55,390 --> 00:23:00,400
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to reinforce this image</font>

567
00:22:57,540 --> 00:23:01,990
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the problem when I have we're</font>

568
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:04,000
also viewed as the known form people oh

00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:14,710
friend was sending to<font color="#E5E5E5"> me because you</font>

574
00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:16,389
guys don't let<font color="#E5E5E5"> it true</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we're view does</font>

575
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:20,350
not be in the form people because we say

576
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:23,380
no you know we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to say yes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> push and</font>

577
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:25,929
always at the put yes we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do that but</font>

578
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:28,300
this is what we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do so instead</font>

579
00:23:25,930 --> 00:23:30,340
turn away<font color="#CCCCCC"> from being</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> dr. no and into dr.</font>

580
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:32,129
yes and sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> say this is what we can</font>

581
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:34,870
do but<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is how we need to do is</font>

582
00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:37,750
speak plainly I can't emphasize that

583
00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:39,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">much don't go to management going oh man</font>

584
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:41,710
we have a zero day in<font color="#E5E5E5"> our application</font>

585
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:43,750
software that's managed in the database

586
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:50,080
and have a hacker pawns the box were

587
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:52,260
screwed the managers gonna go well you

588
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:54,909
know go to management say we have a

589
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:58,690
problem with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a weakness in our system</font>

590
00:23:54,910 --> 00:23:59,890
that if we don't fix it could mean we

591
00:23:58,690 --> 00:24:03,550
could get fined by the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Data Protection</font>

592
00:23:59,890 --> 00:24:04,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">Commissioner because of exposure of</font>

593
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:06,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">records that's a much better</font>

594
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:09,490
conversation to have a business as

595
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:11,230
opposed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> zero days and vulnerabilities</font>

596
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:12,850
and stuff like that so<font color="#E5E5E5"> translate what</font>

597
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:15,280
we're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about into language</font>

598
00:24:12,850 --> 00:24:17,379
they understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> and not that language is</font>

599
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:19,290
a risk management approach so you know

600
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:23,020
if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to take the meat</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

601
00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:24,639
the leopard there maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> take it wait</font>

602
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:27,310
till he's gone over to take a bit more a

603
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:29,710
big risk management approach so you know

604
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:31,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm not going to be futile but risk man</font>

605
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:33,580
but just to reiterate<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's the</font>

606
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:36,279
vulnerability track impact likelihood so

607
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:38,080
you know racher issues like that and

608
00:24:36,279 --> 00:24:40,029
present them to management so they can

609
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:44,020
take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a non-standard and engage with the</font>

610
00:24:40,029 --> 00:24:46,690
business use the<font color="#CCCCCC"> business to help you do</font>

611
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:48,789
what you want to do so if we're trying

612
00:24:46,690 --> 00:24:50,470
to make get better awareness that will

613
00:24:48,789 --> 00:24:54,370
go to the pier on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the American people</font>

614
00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:56,260
they're experts a put and spin and<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

615
00:24:54,370 --> 00:24:57,820
everything on stuff go and talk to them

616
00:24:56,260 --> 00:25:00,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">and ask them how do we present these</font>

617
00:24:57,820 --> 00:25:04,480
things better engage with the community

618
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:06,520
use the newsletters or any social media

619
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:08,350
intern social media you might have to

620
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:11,379
promote security within the organization

621
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:13,570
so that we're seen as a proactive bunch

622
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:15,549
of people are not just a whole bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

623
00:25:13,570 --> 00:25:19,750
geeks stuck in the corner who only come

624
00:25:15,549 --> 00:25:22,450
out like little like Frankenstein when

625
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:24,070
there's a problem you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know let's engage</font>

626
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:26,500
the business and be seen to be visible

627
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:28,928
<font color="#E5E5E5">and working with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> them because we either</font>

628
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:31,840
have to work together we can't you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

629
00:25:28,929 --> 00:25:33,490
it's not art it's not our job alone to

630
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:36,639
secure environments it's the business

631
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:38,169
job to keep the system secure and if we

632
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:40,029
don't engage with the other users<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

633
00:25:38,169 --> 00:25:42,130
other people in business we have a

634
00:25:40,029 --> 00:25:43,240
weakness there and its main up yours

635
00:25:42,130 --> 00:25:44,260
boss or the part of the business so we

636
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:48,100
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get everybody working together</font>

637
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:50,679
to fix that so I know its launch time so

638
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:52,770
I don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> any time for questions but</font>

639
00:25:50,679 --> 00:25:56,399
I'm quite happy to take something yeah

640
00:25:52,770 --> 00:25:56,399
well if<font color="#E5E5E5"> anyone has a question</font>

641
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:05,459
in about<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 years of delivering security</font>

642
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:08,760
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> one for matter another mostly</font>

643
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:13,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">pentesting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I asked my only one of my</font>

644
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:15,419
reports has been read by board members

645
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:18,240
so in my mind that's where the real

646
00:26:15,419 --> 00:26:20,510
firewall is the worst findings the less

647
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:23,070
likely they are to actually hear about

648
00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:24,870
that's probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> crowd I'll turn the</font>

649
00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:27,990
question back is how are the reports

650
00:26:24,870 --> 00:26:30,059
presented to management but they<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

651
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:32,820
enter its basis like here the PDF to the

652
00:26:30,059 --> 00:26:35,190
IT department never gets past the IT

653
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:37,350
department let's see and I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

654
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:39,600
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem we have as well as the ITC</font>

655
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:42,360
information<font color="#CCCCCC"> security in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the latter case</font>

656
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:47,610
of reports to IT I'm very often there is

657
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:49,500
a conflict there as a CIO my job is to

658
00:26:47,610 --> 00:26:51,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">look up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> SL A's and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> keep systems up and</font>

659
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:52,860
running and now you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming with a</font>

660
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:55,049
report saying to me<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I've take my</font>

661
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:57,570
sis was down to patch them you know that

662
00:26:55,049 --> 00:27:00,120
can be conflict so you know we do<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a</font>

663
00:26:57,570 --> 00:27:02,428
challenge there and hopefully something

664
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:04,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">stopped at all today can help maybe talk</font>

665
00:27:02,429 --> 00:27:05,460
to the IT director or the IT people and

666
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:07,530
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of engage with them and figure out</font>

667
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:10,470
how<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can get them to pass that on to</font>

668
00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:13,710
management or coming<font color="#CCCCCC"> back to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Tom's</font>

671
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:21,150
being asked by the IT person to ensure i

672
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:22,860
put certain things in the report because

673
00:27:21,150 --> 00:27:24,900
the heats<font color="#CCCCCC"> heart of it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then not getting</font>
