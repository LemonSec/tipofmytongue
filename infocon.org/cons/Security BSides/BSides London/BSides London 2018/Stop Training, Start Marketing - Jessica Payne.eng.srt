1
00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:06,150
good afternoon everybody I'm Jessica and

2
00:00:03,929 --> 00:00:10,320
I'm the marketing director of twisting

3
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:15,269
sharp media we have created awareness

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:18,750
campaigns using videos ambient media and

5
00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:21,350
the power of comedy so I want to talk to

6
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:25,800
you about doing something different in

7
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:27,330
your training so when I think about the

8
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,550
kind of training I received before I

9
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:31,320
came into the security industry this is

10
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:34,020
going back about five years ago now I

11
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:36,360
thought about what kind of how did that

12
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:38,910
make me feel what did I do

13
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:41,670
and one particular memory really sticks

14
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:42,360
out to me I was working at Volvo

15
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:44,760
now-familiar

16
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:48,030
it was two days before the end of the

17
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:51,329
month very busy time all I'm thinking

18
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:52,770
about I need to hit my target I don't

19
00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:55,800
need to think about anything else but

20
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:57,120
hit mine and my team's target I get that

21
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:59,250
dreaded phone call from my management

22
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:01,919
saying you've got to do your training

23
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:03,629
why have you not done it try and argue

24
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,339
it out can I just give me a couple of

25
00:01:03,629 --> 00:01:08,130
more days I'll do it then it's too late

26
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:09,539
you've got to do it now so I'm forced

27
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:12,839
into doing this annual training that

28
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:16,170
comes around once a year sitting there

29
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:18,720
it's boring straight away I don't want

30
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:19,979
to be doing this right now I'm looking

31
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,189
at all this information

32
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:24,890
I'm skimming through it I'm not actually

33
00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:27,408
engaged with what I'm reading I'm

34
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:31,950
guessing a lot of the questions I'm

35
00:01:27,409 --> 00:01:34,560
thinking about does this really make me

36
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:39,000
engaged am I remembering any of these

37
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:40,560
points no not really I don't remember

38
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,860
anything that I took away from that

39
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,990
training back then so when I started

40
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:47,820
thinking about what are people doing out

41
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:50,039
there to get a message that nobody

42
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:53,398
really wants to listen to what people

43
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:56,210
doing to help get that message across so

44
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:56,210
I came across this

45
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:04,359
300 surely will be winning our way to

46
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:05,649
your next port of call but before we

47
00:02:04,359 --> 00:02:07,359
lift off we'd like to give you what we

48
00:02:05,649 --> 00:02:09,549
call the bare essentials our safety

49
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:11,530
aboard this flight even if you fly with

50
00:02:09,549 --> 00:02:13,330
us quite a lot we'd appreciate it if you

51
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:16,000
take a second look

52
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:19,920
poor baggage shall be tucked away over

53
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,569
here or under the seat in front of you

54
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:24,190
we require all passengers to follow a

55
00:02:22,569 --> 00:02:28,690
crew member instructions in light of

56
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:30,609
science if we happen to switch on the

57
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:32,760
seatbelt sign please return to your seat

58
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:35,200
and fasten your seat belt

59
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:37,060
not so tight as to lose the feeling in

60
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:39,369
your legs but enough to ensure that it's

61
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:40,810
snug and that's low across your hips we

62
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:43,090
recommend you keep your seatbelt

63
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:45,250
fastened throughout the flight but if

64
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:48,819
you do need to get up and do the seat

65
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:50,230
belt by lifting the flip the production

66
00:02:48,819 --> 00:02:52,540
mass does drop down in front of you

67
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:54,518
don't stop to ask why oh boy if you

68
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:56,769
could have fun in another color simply

69
00:02:54,519 --> 00:02:59,079
pull down on the mask face okay noise

70
00:02:56,769 --> 00:03:02,769
and mouth in tighten by pulling on both

71
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:05,260
sides of the elastic now did you all see

72
00:03:02,769 --> 00:03:09,370
what was going on there they were all

73
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:11,019
completely naked so I remember the first

74
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:14,170
time seeing this video you're looking

75
00:03:11,019 --> 00:03:16,599
you're looking again yeah they're naked

76
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:18,970
I'm engaged what's going on what they're

77
00:03:16,599 --> 00:03:20,440
trying to say but you're getting the

78
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:25,359
message as well because you're engaging

79
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:26,829
in it it's something different now the

80
00:03:25,359 --> 00:03:29,079
person behind this for the lady called

81
00:03:26,829 --> 00:03:32,799
Jody Williams she was a person that

82
00:03:29,079 --> 00:03:34,540
launched this big campaign now Air New

83
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:38,069
Zealand were the people that created it

84
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:43,030
it was called bare essentials to safety

85
00:03:38,069 --> 00:03:45,089
that got 7 million views in 2009 for a

86
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:48,310
safety video

87
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:51,069
Berryman New Zealand alone only has

88
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:53,739
under five million in population

89
00:03:51,069 --> 00:03:55,839
it proves this Gwent a global people

90
00:03:53,739 --> 00:03:58,780
went out there looking for something

91
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:01,120
found something different so it wasn't

92
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:04,329
just watching it on a plane it got

93
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:06,700
people engaged I love this quote that

94
00:04:04,329 --> 00:04:11,380
she talks about because it wasn't just

95
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:12,940
about having a video it was about

96
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:16,329
marketing a camp

97
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:18,670
doing something different you know in

98
00:04:16,329 --> 00:04:22,240
your teams you're probably working with

99
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:23,590
internal comms communications people

100
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,240
that are helping bring out your

101
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:26,969
campaigns internally they're the people

102
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:29,290
you want on your side

103
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:31,720
they're the people that already are

104
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:34,030
doing communications all the time so if

105
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:36,010
you're running training make friends

106
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:41,349
with these people they're going to help

107
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:43,000
your training more engaging so when I

108
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:46,960
think about marketing I think why do we

109
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:50,020
do marketing why is it important well

110
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:53,370
it's about changing behavior it's about

111
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:53,370
stopping and getting people's attention

112
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:58,900
it's about trying to do something

113
00:04:56,260 --> 00:05:02,920
different to get the same message across

114
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:05,049
so when I look at this particular

115
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:07,320
picture you've probably seen many of

116
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:10,710
these pictures the recycling pictures

117
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:13,240
they all have changed behavior over time

118
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:15,609
you know now if you've got a plastic

119
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:18,520
bottle and you're thinking and he's go

120
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:20,740
put that in a bin you go to put that in

121
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:22,060
the general waste somebody probably will

122
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:25,590
stop being so old recycling is just

123
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:28,270
there because people have made a choice

124
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:30,070
you want to be part of that culture and

125
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:32,200
it's the same thing with you guys in

126
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:34,780
your training you're trying to get

127
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:40,090
people to make the right choice but it's

128
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:41,440
how you're making that right choice so

129
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:43,260
again when you're asking your employees

130
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:45,430
to do something different

131
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:48,070
for them you're asking them to come away

132
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:49,990
from their day-to-day job the thing that

133
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:54,070
they're paid to do the thing to them

134
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:56,290
that's the most important thing you're

135
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:57,849
asking them to do something different

136
00:05:56,290 --> 00:06:01,330
they don't see the point they don't see

137
00:05:57,850 --> 00:06:04,870
the relevance they don't know why any of

138
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:06,760
this matters to them why security that's

139
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:09,130
not my job that's what I tease therefore

140
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:11,280
I hear that all the time I was one of

141
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:13,990
those naive people that used to say that

142
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:16,109
but going back to my story is because of

143
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:19,570
the kind of training I used to receive I

144
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:22,840
didn't understand it it made no sense to

145
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:26,230
me so when you think thinking about

146
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:28,030
relevance how can we make security

147
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:30,580
relevant to your employees what they

148
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:34,330
really care about well they're thinking

149
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:36,520
about finances family so when you're

150
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:38,039
thinking about their family if you're

151
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:40,299
thinking about keeping their family safe

152
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:41,800
they're more likely to lean in so if

153
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:44,800
you're doing training and things that

154
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:46,000
they can carry on at home for example if

155
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,010
you're trying to find information at

156
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,930
home what you're doing what your family

157
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:52,330
members doing they're looking on YouTube

158
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:55,750
most likely they're not reading a manual

159
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:57,490
of loads of information they're doing in

160
00:06:55,750 --> 00:07:00,370
a very different way if you're teaching

161
00:06:57,490 --> 00:07:03,310
them about how to keep their children

162
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:05,650
safe on social media the likely it is

163
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:06,940
they'll lean into that training but then

164
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:07,960
they also might lean into the other

165
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:10,660
stuff that you're trying to teach them

166
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:12,580
about keeping the company safe it's

167
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:15,040
trying to make that relevance connection

168
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:19,870
as well so they don't just see it as

169
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:22,210
it's just a work thing now when we talk

170
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:24,430
about lots of information you can see

171
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:26,440
that you're skimming through it now just

172
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:28,860
trying to get that information you're

173
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:31,480
taking all of that information in

174
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:36,520
studies show that you only actually take

175
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:39,700
in 20 percent of what you read what

176
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:41,710
about now if you're remembering key

177
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:44,200
points you're not remembering all of

178
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:46,359
that but whatever I told you if you put

179
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:50,140
a visual in front of somebody same

180
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:51,910
information but a visual way the likely

181
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:53,650
it is you're going to remember it

182
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:57,280
because you remember in ninety percent

183
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:59,770
of visual stuff so looking at that

184
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:01,869
marriage taking ten percent away from it

185
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:04,570
you can still work out what that image

186
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:05,740
is Rawdon really reading the content

187
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:09,280
that you've previously seen

188
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:11,260
that's a simpler way of seeing it like

189
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:13,270
your brain will just work it out if he

190
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:14,260
was trying to think of a word and some

191
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:16,479
of the words were looked up in the

192
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:17,980
middle your brain would automatically

193
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:20,470
try and work out what that word is

194
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:23,100
rather than lots of information being

195
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:23,100
shown to you

196
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:31,000
so for me we ran campaigns with lots of

197
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:32,919
different organizations and this is some

198
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,950
of the feedback if it's done well and

199
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:38,348
they lean into the marketing we had

200
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:39,510
companies doing things with large

201
00:08:38,349 --> 00:08:42,180
character k'tau

202
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:44,130
they put posters around the place they

203
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:46,890
showed videos fair enough a huge humor

204
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:48,990
but they did something different and

205
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:51,210
when they did this this is the kind of

206
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:52,920
feedback that our security date team got

207
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:57,510
from their employees they're talking

208
00:08:52,920 --> 00:09:00,209
about fun engagement people have learned

209
00:08:57,510 --> 00:09:01,860
something that's what we're here to do

210
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:03,810
the security people you're there to

211
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:06,600
teach them these things you're the

212
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:08,520
experts that make it fun I know that's

213
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:11,580
hard to say in security but try and make

214
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:13,730
it fun make it relatable to them so

215
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:17,370
three things to take away from today I

216
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:18,060
want you to be brave try something

217
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:20,580
different

218
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:22,739
don't give them a manual to read and

219
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:26,580
expect them to remember everything or to

220
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:27,350
care make friends with you internal

221
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:30,690
comms

222
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:34,530
they already market your team already

223
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:36,120
you want them onside they will help you

224
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:38,160
if you go and speak to them early they

225
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:39,030
will help you get that marketing

226
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:42,390
campaign going

227
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:44,449
and finally just make it relatable think

228
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:48,780
of different ways that you can help them

229
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:51,270
make it relatable and finally if you

230
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:52,980
look at these two images you're saying

231
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:55,079
what would you prefer to do if you're

232
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:57,390
explaining something to somebody in your

233
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:58,920
home life a friend a family and you were

234
00:09:57,390 --> 00:10:01,949
telling them something about security

235
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:03,660
how would you do that would you give

236
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:06,660
them a document with lots of information

237
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:10,790
on or would you give them a visual or

238
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:13,390
maybe a video I know which one I choose

239
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:21,400
thank you

240
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:25,000
[Applause]

241
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:25,000
any questions
