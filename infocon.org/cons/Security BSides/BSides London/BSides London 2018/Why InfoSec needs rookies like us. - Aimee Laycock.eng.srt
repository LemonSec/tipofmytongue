1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:06,859
so I just need to put the clicky in cuz

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:10,620
I forgot thank you very very much for

3
00:00:06,859 --> 00:00:12,360
having me here my goodness really really

4
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:16,230
really been it quite excited about today

5
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:18,000
and if it wasn't for you guys and how

6
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:20,550
supportive and everything that you have

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,198
are to people like me coming into the

8
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:25,170
industry that's just I wouldn't have

9
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:29,310
been here so thank you again information

10
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:31,679
security is an exciting and rapidly

11
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:33,629
expanding industry and so I'm here to

12
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:39,570
talk about and the way in for second

13
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:43,129
needs rookies like us it's not going to

14
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:48,390
work there we go

15
00:00:43,129 --> 00:00:50,510
I'm willing to bet that every one of you

16
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:52,710
probably realized that getting into

17
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:54,860
cybersecurity about round about now

18
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:58,160
means that we are more or less

19
00:00:54,860 --> 00:01:01,829
guaranteed lifetime job security

20
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:04,048
according to John McAfee there are two

21
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:06,240
job openings for every qualified

22
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:08,010
candidate and I read somewhere just

23
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:10,130
recently that within the UK and Ireland

24
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:12,299
that statistic is three to one

25
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:16,110
cybersecurity ventures predicts that

26
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:18,030
there are or there will be 3.5 million

27
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:23,460
unfilled cyber security positions

28
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:26,850
globally by 2021 I should say that I am

29
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:30,298
NOT a careers adviser or a recruiter so

30
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:31,439
I'm not looking for someone who's got

31
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:33,060
five years experience in technology

32
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:38,158
that's when you've been around 24 months

33
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:39,869
and I'm not looking for someone who has

34
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:43,110
experienced working with gdpr for ten

35
00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:46,200
years so that you can hear me out I'm

36
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:48,240
going to pluck out a few of the issues

37
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:50,460
that I do see I think that was one of

38
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,048
them and I'm going to do my best to

39
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:55,020
offer up some food for food-for-thought

40
00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:56,969
on on the subject but I want to start

41
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:59,820
with a question that might Johnson from

42
00:01:56,969 --> 00:02:02,039
lift and asked his LinkedIn Network last

43
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:05,850
week you may have actually seen it was a

44
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:08,310
quite a popular post he asked with the

45
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:10,919
growing amount of automation tools in

46
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:12,319
our industry what do the new entry

47
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:18,018
double entry low

48
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:20,200
or jobs look like where and how do we

49
00:02:18,019 --> 00:02:25,219
get more people into security and

50
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:27,560
increased skills as I said it was very

51
00:02:25,219 --> 00:02:30,129
popular popular post but I'm just going

52
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:32,840
to pick out some of the things that I

53
00:02:30,129 --> 00:02:35,679
some of the key takeaways I got from

54
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:39,019
this a lot of people argued that despite

55
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:41,419
increasing automation roots are unlikely

56
00:02:39,019 --> 00:02:43,639
to change that much sock will continue

57
00:02:41,419 --> 00:02:46,790
to be a popular way in and current IT

58
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:49,669
roles can transition into security roles

59
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:52,730
so a network engineer for example and

60
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:55,790
will become a or could become a network

61
00:02:52,730 --> 00:03:00,349
security engineer and a software

62
00:02:55,790 --> 00:03:02,298
developer a aspect engineer some people

63
00:03:00,349 --> 00:03:05,060
argued that we need to take a less

64
00:03:02,299 --> 00:03:08,959
siloed approach and so every IT position

65
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:11,510
is also a cybersecurity position every

66
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:14,870
IT work or every every technology worker

67
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:18,849
needs to be involved in protecting and

68
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:22,699
defending apps data devices

69
00:03:18,849 --> 00:03:25,189
infrastructure and people I picked out

70
00:03:22,699 --> 00:03:27,169
these two sentences as well from

71
00:03:25,189 --> 00:03:30,439
comments by Timothy share and and

72
00:03:27,169 --> 00:03:33,109
Fernando Soto and they say that we need

73
00:03:30,439 --> 00:03:35,418
to recognize that there isn't any one

74
00:03:33,109 --> 00:03:40,299
way to get into this field and to take a

75
00:03:35,419 --> 00:03:43,099
chance on those that want to and that

76
00:03:40,299 --> 00:03:45,139
curiosity is the main ingredient for a

77
00:03:43,099 --> 00:03:48,379
successful career in security I

78
00:03:45,139 --> 00:03:52,040
absolutely could not agree more

79
00:03:48,379 --> 00:03:56,048
but if Tim and Fernando are right then

80
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:58,159
why do we insist on recruiting only

81
00:03:56,049 --> 00:04:01,729
technically competent and highly

82
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:04,790
experienced people when in fact we need

83
00:04:01,729 --> 00:04:07,699
to bring in and a train up young in

84
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:10,659
bright individuals who can also bring

85
00:04:07,699 --> 00:04:10,659
different skill sets

86
00:04:11,289 --> 00:04:18,019
walking the InfoSec floor yesterday it

87
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:21,949
was obvious to me that our industry

88
00:04:18,019 --> 00:04:25,190
needs considerable help for marketing we

89
00:04:21,949 --> 00:04:27,140
need more diverse skills

90
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:29,210
of course we absolutely need people with

91
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:32,659
technical competencies but we also need

92
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:36,830
people who understand business people

93
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:38,750
who can align security needs with their

94
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:42,590
company's objectives and their industry

95
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:44,990
needs there are others outside of the

96
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:48,500
power bubble of this bubble who

97
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:52,130
understand and care about how other

98
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:54,550
business areas interacts with technology

99
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:58,040
processes and policies

100
00:04:54,550 --> 00:05:01,220
according to burning glass positions

101
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:05,390
calling for financial skills are the

102
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:07,730
hardest to fill cybersecurity jobs or

103
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:11,360
such security roles I should say there

104
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:14,180
is a skills gap for workers who meet

105
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:17,450
these hybrid requirements because

106
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:21,350
finance so such as accounting or

107
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:24,260
knowledge about specific regulations and

108
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:26,900
IT skills are rarely trained for

109
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:30,280
together and like me there are a number

110
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:33,650
of people I can see a few here actually

111
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:35,630
who are working with information

112
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:39,679
security who may not actually be from an

113
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:42,040
IT background because I believe the

114
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:44,600
reason I'm here is because I am able to

115
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:46,700
apply and transfer Mike my commercial

116
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:48,770
experience from before my communication

117
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:51,770
skills my my soft skills if you want to

118
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:57,190
call them that into this new and

119
00:05:51,770 --> 00:06:00,200
expanding market so we have a skills

120
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:02,780
shortage but it's not necessarily or not

121
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:05,750
only a cyber skills that we actually

122
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:07,940
lack and we also have a gender diversity

123
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:10,370
problem as well

124
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:12,620
cyber security is an excellent example

125
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:16,130
of profession that needs to address the

126
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:17,900
gender gap globally men are four times

127
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:19,790
more likely to hold to see in executive

128
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:22,400
level positions and nine times more

129
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:24,740
likely to hold managerial positions than

130
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,060
women are and because in case you

131
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:29,210
haven't noticed there aren't that many

132
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:31,310
of us here eleven only seven percent oh

133
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:33,049
sorry eleven percent of positions are

134
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:35,930
held by women and within Europe that

135
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:37,380
number drops to seventh there is another

136
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:39,360
problem as well

137
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:43,560
the average age of information security

138
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:46,110
profession is 42 the world needs more

139
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:48,240
cybersecurity professionals but not

140
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:52,020
enough young people are getting into the

141
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:54,780
field in fact only 13% of us are aged

142
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:57,560
between 30 and 34 and only four seven

143
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:59,849
percent under the age of 29

144
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:02,910
so other than political and moral

145
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:05,520
reasons there are other excellent

146
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:07,290
arguments for diversity our own studies

147
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,210
at culture show that the strongest

148
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:11,700
security cultures are not necessarily

149
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:14,370
found within existing management or even

150
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:17,849
the IT or security teams male-dominated

151
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:20,430
groups of employees tend to have the

152
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:26,130
have weaker security culture and display

153
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:27,390
far riskier riskier behavior and then

154
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:29,480
those groups were they were the gender

155
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:29,479
balance

156
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:41,240
Prime and I and I drift a little bit

157
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:44,840
because primarily our job as or our role

158
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:47,720
as cybersecurity professionals are to

159
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:50,388
find the ways to minimize risk to advise

160
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:52,129
senior management on what we need to be

161
00:07:50,389 --> 00:07:55,449
able to better do that

162
00:07:52,129 --> 00:07:58,280
if cybersecurity is going to be a

163
00:07:55,449 --> 00:08:01,310
accepted and adopted and by the rest of

164
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:03,080
our business as positively as other

165
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:05,479
departments like sales marketing and

166
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:06,949
payroll are then front we need to find

167
00:08:05,479 --> 00:08:11,030
more effective and better ways to

168
00:08:06,949 --> 00:08:14,150
communicate the business areas need to

169
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:16,818
understand that done right security does

170
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:20,378
not have to be a a hindrance or a hurdle

171
00:08:16,819 --> 00:08:22,639
in fact it is a business opportunity so

172
00:08:20,379 --> 00:08:24,409
stakeholder management is not only

173
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:26,840
essential but it's a skill that is

174
00:08:24,409 --> 00:08:30,169
seriously under recognized as vital

175
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:33,559
within ninety and security the good news

176
00:08:30,169 --> 00:08:37,000
is that the second potential resource

177
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:38,890
pool may already exist internally with

178
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,929
well-developed

179
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:45,110
communication skills specific industry

180
00:08:41,929 --> 00:08:48,560
knowledge and potentially business

181
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:51,050
acumen people from sales marketing HR

182
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:53,630
and just a few examples but these

183
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:55,729
departments can bring qualities and

184
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:58,100
skill sets that can complement those of

185
00:08:55,730 --> 00:09:01,430
the typical IT or security professional

186
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:06,770
as well as improve age and gender

187
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:11,510
diversity so my advice for recruiters

188
00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:13,939
and employers with many existing

189
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:15,680
employee professionals being spoiled for

190
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:19,270
choice when just when deciding to switch

191
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:22,520
jobs how can we attract and retain stars

192
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:23,779
we all need to feel valued and we need

193
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:26,540
to know that a difference that we make

194
00:09:23,779 --> 00:09:29,750
through our work is being noticed and

195
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:33,170
appreciated so as salaries rise to

196
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:35,300
attract new employees also ensure that

197
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:39,560
existing employees receive matching

198
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:41,300
financial compensation create a career

199
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:42,410
advancement pass for qualified

200
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:45,319
candidates

201
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:48,829
and engage employees in decision-making

202
00:09:45,319 --> 00:09:50,800
I mentioned that we need to match job

203
00:09:48,829 --> 00:09:53,959
descriptions to the knowledge skills and

204
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:56,540
abilities the role requires but a is

205
00:09:53,959 --> 00:09:59,508
e-squared study revealed that employees

206
00:09:56,540 --> 00:10:01,759
with higher levels of access to

207
00:09:59,509 --> 00:10:03,800
sponsorship felt the most valued in

208
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:07,850
their organization those that have been

209
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:09,378
mentored sponsored and offered

210
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:12,680
participation in leadership development

211
00:10:09,379 --> 00:10:15,470
programs not only have higher levels of

212
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:17,959
job satisfaction and they're also more

213
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:19,819
likely to be successful so it's worth a

214
00:10:17,959 --> 00:10:23,329
thank you very much my mentors and their

215
00:10:19,819 --> 00:10:25,459
sponsors out there as well but another

216
00:10:23,329 --> 00:10:28,250
point is education so allow people to

217
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:31,550
take courses gain certifications and go

218
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:36,949
to conferences just through 30 percent

219
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:41,449
of employees employer sorry invest in

220
00:10:36,949 --> 00:10:43,910
their educational development by play by

221
00:10:41,449 --> 00:10:46,790
paying for on-the-job training the cyber

222
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:49,490
security field is an evolving rapidly

223
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:51,589
security workers need ongoing training

224
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:54,470
to keep their skills up-to-date and

225
00:10:51,589 --> 00:10:57,620
relevant and let's be honest

226
00:10:54,470 --> 00:11:01,399
candidates are far more likely to stay

227
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:04,009
in a job or get into a job with

228
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:07,310
companies who are willing to invest in

229
00:11:04,009 --> 00:11:09,290
training in education and finally tap

230
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:11,989
those underserved talent pools if if

231
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:13,969
ploy employers are serious about

232
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:16,180
increasing diversity they should be

233
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:18,740
working on expanding the talent pipeline

234
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:23,420
identify candidates from other fields

235
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:26,059
who can quickly a dot adapt to the

236
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:27,769
cybersecurity profession and step step

237
00:11:26,059 --> 00:11:29,269
up recruitment efforts within

238
00:11:27,769 --> 00:11:31,759
demographics that traditionally have

239
00:11:29,269 --> 00:11:33,709
been underserved for this for our

240
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:35,540
industry so Millennials and and women

241
00:11:33,709 --> 00:11:37,279
I'm thinking of right now but tapping

242
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:41,089
into these cybernaut sizeable talent

243
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:43,540
course could help reduce the skill

244
00:11:41,089 --> 00:11:43,540
shortage

245
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:50,360
I'm running out of time but I was going

246
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:52,520
to share lots of stats about how men and

247
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:54,650
women actually are very very similar so

248
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:58,550
they share the same workplace values

249
00:11:54,650 --> 00:12:00,620
priorities and aspirations and and a lot

250
00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:03,699
of their views about what they want from

251
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:06,890
a job in our role are very very similar

252
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:08,600
people who have been mentored sponsored

253
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:11,330
and offered participation in leadership

254
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:15,020
developments have a much higher level of

255
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:17,270
job satisfaction so with with these with

256
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:20,510
this in mind employers looking to

257
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:22,880
recruit cyber security workers needn't

258
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:27,890
have a separate message for men and

259
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:29,540
women since we want the same things but

260
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:32,449
considering the under-representation of

261
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:33,980
female workers in our field employers

262
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:36,380
and recruiters should probably put some

263
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:43,100
more effort into hiring women and making

264
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:45,560
us all feel valued we need to do more to

265
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:48,290
help elevate the priority of our

266
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:50,329
industry and be better at selling the

267
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:51,199
benefits of a career within information

268
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:53,690
security

269
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:57,470
this means that we need to extend our

270
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:59,450
network and influence beyond this and it

271
00:12:57,470 --> 00:13:01,220
is incredibly warm and comfortable and

272
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:03,470
tight-knit community but we need to we

273
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:06,020
need to go out there a bit more and sell

274
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:08,240
the benefits of our career in the short

275
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:10,490
term employers can make progress by

276
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:15,320
adjusting our hiring expectations

277
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:18,470
investing in education because these

278
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:20,330
things help not only keep their skills

279
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:23,870
up to date but they help us to feel

280
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:26,180
motivated and curious and interested and

281
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:29,450
engaged and of course finally we need to

282
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:31,550
tap into those underserved Hana paws one

283
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:37,220
other thought I'd like to leave you with

284
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:39,979
and that is we need to look to companies

285
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:43,430
who are adopting security culture as a

286
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:47,360
business strategy and ask ourselves how

287
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:49,699
can we replicate that success I said

288
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:52,220
earlier that every technology worker

289
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:53,650
needs to be involved in protecting and

290
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:56,440
defending

291
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:58,180
an organization but perhaps what I

292
00:13:56,440 --> 00:14:02,590
should have said is that every worker

293
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:05,739
needs to be involved if we are to create

294
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:08,620
a security culture where every worker is

295
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:10,870
responsible every worker needs to be

296
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:17,800
involved and we need to open our doors

297
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:33,100
to people from other fields thank you

298
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:34,390
very much are there any questions okay

299
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:35,410
you need to speak up I'm really hard of

300
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:38,539
hearing

301
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:38,539
[Music]

302
00:14:55,559 --> 00:15:02,019
yes absolutely and I think that the fact

303
00:15:00,189 --> 00:15:04,299
that you're here at this this event

304
00:15:02,019 --> 00:15:05,439
today and that you I would imagine and

305
00:15:04,299 --> 00:15:07,179
you're talking to me and you're asking

306
00:15:05,439 --> 00:15:12,219
questions and you're getting involved by

307
00:15:07,179 --> 00:15:14,649
by by learning more about and building

308
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:16,749
your network within its security it will

309
00:15:14,649 --> 00:15:20,979
help open up doors so we are as I said

310
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:23,199
incredibly I have been so maybe I should

311
00:15:20,979 --> 00:15:25,269
have mentioned this before but I joined

312
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:28,209
this industry less than eighteen months

313
00:15:25,269 --> 00:15:31,539
ago I've never worked an IT or security

314
00:15:28,209 --> 00:15:33,248
before and I have basically a sales and

315
00:15:31,539 --> 00:15:35,910
development or sorry business

316
00:15:33,249 --> 00:15:38,439
development or marketing background and

317
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:40,419
I'm very I'm very very lucky that

318
00:15:38,439 --> 00:15:42,488
someone recognized that those skills

319
00:15:40,419 --> 00:15:46,689
were that were needed within within that

320
00:15:42,489 --> 00:15:49,389
company and told me that told me that

321
00:15:46,689 --> 00:15:50,978
despite when I started getting nervous

322
00:15:49,389 --> 00:15:52,720
that despite the fact that I that I

323
00:15:50,979 --> 00:15:56,079
don't have the technical skills that a

324
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:57,850
security person might might need don't

325
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:59,618
worry about a ami we can we can I can I

326
00:15:57,850 --> 00:16:01,569
can teach this those skills but what you

327
00:15:59,619 --> 00:16:04,539
what we need you already have in

328
00:16:01,569 --> 00:16:08,559
abundance so someone like yourself if

329
00:16:04,539 --> 00:16:10,720
you can find someone that can recognize

330
00:16:08,559 --> 00:16:13,600
your skills and build that that network

331
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:15,909
up and find yourself a mentor there are

332
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:18,369
so many besides the fantastic place to

333
00:16:15,909 --> 00:16:20,529
define those people and to get that

334
00:16:18,369 --> 00:16:24,549
support and weighs in because it is

335
00:16:20,529 --> 00:16:27,129
absolutely possible thank you I think I

336
00:16:24,549 --> 00:16:29,439
just run out of time but if you would
