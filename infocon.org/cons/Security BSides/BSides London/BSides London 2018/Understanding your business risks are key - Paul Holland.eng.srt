1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:07,890
thank you so good morning everyone

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:09,210
welcome please likes see it's I wanted

3
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:11,340
to talk to you about kind of

4
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:12,929
understanding risk and how it relates to

5
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:15,719
each of your own kind of jobs and

6
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:18,900
businesses but I just thought quick

7
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:20,759
intro into myself so I can't look at his

8
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:22,590
 insurance company join them in

9
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:26,039
September 2015 on their information

10
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:28,529
security leader I've worked in many

11
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:30,929
different industries across my career

12
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:34,260
which is kind of where this information

13
00:00:30,929 --> 00:00:37,530
is born out from I'm a comedy certified

14
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:41,180
sis and if you wish you can either tweet

15
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:44,340
or follow me but all info sick as well

16
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:45,750
so understanding risk so what does it

17
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:50,039
mean why is it important

18
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:51,870
so in security we have the CIA triad

19
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:54,390
so confidentiality integrity and

20
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:56,610
availability essentially systems in your

21
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:58,910
data so making sure it's it's safe and

22
00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:01,559
secure making sure that people can't

23
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:04,110
mess with it so that you know that it is

24
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:05,309
valid it's the correct information and

25
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:06,840
that actually people can access the

26
00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:08,640
information when they need to get to it

27
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:12,090
so that's what we tend to focus on

28
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,619
that's what we concentrate on so

29
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:16,770
different organizations have different

30
00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:19,229
profiles so each different industry will

31
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:22,439
have different kind of focuses in that

32
00:01:19,229 --> 00:01:24,600
CIA try and so for example insurance

33
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:27,479
he's a reasonably even split across the

34
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:29,908
mall but confidentiality of the data

35
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:33,570
insurance seems to be the the kind of

36
00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:36,390
the primary focus banking again very

37
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:38,279
even split between them all if you go

38
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:40,500
back probably five years or so available

39
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:42,750
'ti wasn't quite so important to them

40
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:46,140
but now with internet banking it's

41
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:47,610
becoming much more important oil and gas

42
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:50,250
for them really

43
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:54,299
it's confidentiality of their data they

44
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:56,610
have very very kind of monetary worth of

45
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:58,229
intellectual property if they've got so

46
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:59,460
and it found a new oil field where they

47
00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:01,320
can go and drill it's potentially worth

48
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:04,759
billions of pounds so they need to make

49
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:07,048
sure they keep that data safe and secure

50
00:02:04,759 --> 00:02:09,690
education so they have a very small

51
00:02:07,049 --> 00:02:10,979
footprint on the internet they may just

52
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:13,290
have an informational website it's

53
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:13,800
probably about it so for them it's

54
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:15,720
keeping their

55
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,250
systems up the availability side so that

56
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:19,109
the teachers could teach the lessons

57
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:22,410
that the kids can do they're learning so

58
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:24,060
that's really important to them gambling

59
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:26,850
industry so that's very much about

60
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:28,350
availability of their systems if they

61
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:29,609
lose their systems during the World Cup

62
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:31,170
that's coming up they're going to be

63
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:33,060
using millions of pounds or seconds in

64
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:34,920
bets people will just go somewhere else

65
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:37,980
they need to really focus heavily on

66
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:40,829
keeping their systems up and

67
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:42,179
pharmaceuticals so there's quite a good

68
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:45,720
split there between the confidentiality

69
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:48,360
integrity so again you know they work on

70
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:50,430
when they're working on new drugs that's

71
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:51,990
worth a lot of money to them also the

72
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:53,400
integrity of that data is really

73
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:55,890
important if somebody gets in and

74
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:57,450
changes the middle of the amount of

75
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:59,100
milligrams in one of their new drugs

76
00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:00,959
they could do you know they can

77
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:03,510
potentially kill people so you know to

78
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:06,870
them making sure that data is accurate

79
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:09,600
is vitally important I would like to

80
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:12,420
stress though this is my opinion on the

81
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:13,650
splits you know from from I've worked in

82
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:16,799
all of these industries at different

83
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:19,910
times and this is from what I've seen so

84
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:22,590
there's no actual stats to back this up

85
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:24,989
but what you do get obviously within

86
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:26,550
each industry you will have differences

87
00:03:24,989 --> 00:03:29,489
as well so you'll look at the kind of

88
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:31,650
the company ethos brand and things like

89
00:03:29,489 --> 00:03:33,180
that and we'll make a difference so you

90
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:34,860
know obviously out the insurance run a

91
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:36,630
look at he's got specifically so I'll

92
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:39,540
know quite a bit about that about them

93
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:42,780
as a work there and for us we're not a

94
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:44,459
big retail insurer so we do have us we

95
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:47,070
do have an online presence you can get

96
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:48,480
some small business insurance to us but

97
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:50,489
most of our stuff is done through

98
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,530
brokers and direct with the underwriters

99
00:03:50,489 --> 00:03:54,390
someone like a direct line or Aviva

100
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:57,810
they've got much bigger online presence

101
00:03:54,390 --> 00:04:00,359
so for us the availability is much less

102
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:01,830
of a worry and because of our brand and

103
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:04,590
the type of insurance we do a

104
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:06,330
confidentiality of that data is much

105
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:08,040
more important to us than it probably is

106
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:11,730
so other insurers so we spend a lot more

107
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:13,230
time focusing on those and what those

108
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:15,630
kind of things do when you look at the

109
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:18,930
CIA triad you look at the focus is your

110
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:20,790
industry your actual business it starts

111
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:23,400
to give you and hopes to build a picture

112
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:25,110
of your risk appetite so other things

113
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,039
that you need to kind of think about is

114
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:27,540
its

115
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:31,530
what would your business theme

116
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:33,690
materially damaging what systems and

117
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:35,760
what data could you live without for a

118
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:37,890
while and how long is that what

119
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:39,120
information is vitally important to you

120
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:42,750
a lot companies called it their crown

121
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:44,190
jewels and then also what is it you're

122
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:46,980
going to do to protect that protect that

123
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:48,360
information you use all those factors

124
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:50,100
and put them together and that starts to

125
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:52,710
build you risk appetite statement for

126
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:55,920
your business that is your high-level

127
00:04:52,710 --> 00:05:00,120
statement of the level of risk your

128
00:04:55,920 --> 00:05:02,400
business is willing to take so you start

129
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:06,690
to build up a picture so from your risk

130
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:08,280
risk appetite you look at that you get

131
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:11,340
your high-level statement you build up

132
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:12,989
to your risk tolerances so these will

133
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:16,049
make a difference so it can make a

134
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:17,910
difference because of maybe the money

135
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:20,280
that's available to spend it could be

136
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:21,990
the different systems as well that

137
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:24,119
you're looking at so for example you

138
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:26,400
know we have we have systems where

139
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:27,930
there's medical data so that our risk

140
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,820
tolerance for that will be much lower

141
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:31,380
than one of our brochure where websites

142
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:35,159
where it's just kind of pictures and

143
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:37,350
words so that when you look at that you

144
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:39,300
start to build a picture of where you

145
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:41,820
can go to and again helps build that

146
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:46,170
focus what is important and the things

147
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:47,550
you need to look at protecting that's

148
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:49,170
what you're actually trying to do is

149
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:51,050
once you've got those statements he's

150
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:54,270
actually driving that actual risk down

151
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:55,800
and getting it as close to the risk

152
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:57,659
appetite and within those risk

153
00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:00,300
tolerances that you've set as a business

154
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:02,580
and and what you're trying to manage

155
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:05,850
effectively is that residual risk the

156
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:07,710
difference between the two there are

157
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:09,810
things that can happen you know if you

158
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:11,940
can't get that you wish down anywhere

159
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:14,250
near your risk appetite then the chances

160
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:16,110
are your risk appetite is wrong and you

161
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:18,150
need to go back and revisit it and kind

162
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:19,670
of not literally start again but you

163
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:22,229
need to work through it and work out

164
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:25,250
whether it's resources money or just

165
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:27,930
there's not the appetite to do it

166
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:29,870
the other thing once you set that risk

167
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:32,460
appetite and your risk tolerance ease

168
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:34,770
it's an ongoing process this isn't just

169
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:36,840
a one-shot you can't just do it once and

170
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:38,859
leave it you need to monitor what else

171
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:41,020
is going on so business

172
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:43,629
decisions that are being made every day

173
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:45,520
can affect the different you know where

174
00:06:43,629 --> 00:06:47,080
your behind of risk profile is and means

175
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:50,409
you might need to change the tolerances

176
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:52,810
or your risk appetite so if you have a

177
00:06:50,409 --> 00:06:53,800
changing markets it's quite extreme but

178
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:56,139
you know you start to try and do

179
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:57,460
business in China the Chinese government

180
00:06:56,139 --> 00:07:00,669
are going to be very interested in your

181
00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:02,650
company new business areas so you know

182
00:07:00,669 --> 00:07:05,409
for example in insurance if we started

183
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:07,000
to insure somebody that was maybe seen

184
00:07:05,409 --> 00:07:08,500
as morally wrong you know like animal

185
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,439
testing companies or something like that

186
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:12,969
could again change our risk profile

187
00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:14,830
changing leadership you get a change of

188
00:07:12,969 --> 00:07:17,080
board level could completely change your

189
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:18,250
risk appetite because they've come in

190
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:20,438
they've got a different idea about what

191
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:21,699
they want to do and literally if the

192
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:24,340
board decide they want to change the

193
00:07:21,699 --> 00:07:25,719
risk appetite also moving into new

194
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:27,878
technologies so certainly things like

195
00:07:25,719 --> 00:07:30,789
cloud and DevOps atherton certainly

196
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:33,520
changing the risk appetite in companies

197
00:07:30,789 --> 00:07:36,909
now by pushing that data out into the

198
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:39,188
cloud by with all the DevOps the kind of

199
00:07:36,909 --> 00:07:40,960
the agile the speed of processes you've

200
00:07:39,189 --> 00:07:42,969
got to make sure that you you're ready

201
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:45,669
for it and you can join you can keep

202
00:07:42,969 --> 00:07:47,139
everything joined up the supply chain

203
00:07:45,669 --> 00:07:49,029
risks that come with it you you know you

204
00:07:47,139 --> 00:07:50,409
did most companies will deal with lots

205
00:07:49,029 --> 00:07:53,379
and lots of different third parties

206
00:07:50,409 --> 00:07:55,289
they've always affecting your risk

207
00:07:53,379 --> 00:07:58,659
appetite because the decisions they make

208
00:07:55,289 --> 00:08:00,460
taking on new third parties so it's all

209
00:07:58,659 --> 00:08:01,750
those things you need to monitor within

210
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:03,940
your own business to see whether you

211
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:05,560
need to change what you're doing and

212
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:07,599
then you've got the external factors as

213
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:09,699
well new vulnerabilities that come along

214
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:12,250
so we had spectrum meltdown

215
00:08:09,699 --> 00:08:14,080
not too long ago which completely

216
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:15,400
changed the kind of risk profile that

217
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:17,188
was out there were the different kind of

218
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:19,750
vulnerabilities we could get hit by

219
00:08:17,189 --> 00:08:21,639
political changes so we've brexit coming

220
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:23,409
up Donald Trump making wonderful

221
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:26,349
decisions that he keeps making out in

222
00:08:23,409 --> 00:08:29,199
the u.s. also the poisoning with Russia

223
00:08:26,349 --> 00:08:30,580
recently it changes the whole aspect of

224
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:32,560
what's going on in the world and we need

225
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:34,059
to be mindful of those changes that they

226
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:36,069
could be changing the risk profile and

227
00:08:34,059 --> 00:08:41,140
some of our companies could become more

228
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:44,260
of a target regulatory changes but

229
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:46,449
always interesting so I'm sure everybody

230
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:48,610
in this room has had the four-letter

231
00:08:46,449 --> 00:08:50,520
word of GDP our recently and that's

232
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:52,950
definitely made changes to people

233
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:56,610
attitudes to risk and attitudes to

234
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:58,650
security and also moving forward again

235
00:08:56,610 --> 00:09:00,780
similar to the cloud endeavors all the

236
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:02,459
new technology is coming on AI and all

237
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:04,079
the other things like that that we're

238
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:06,330
coming on we've got a monitor those and

239
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:13,620
look at what risks will be coming from

240
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:17,040
those as well so how are security people

241
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:21,390
can we deal with this how do we make

242
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:23,280
this effective so really my kind of big

243
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:26,340
takeaways here it's about educating the

244
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:29,970
board they've got to live and breathe

245
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:31,410
this and understand it so they need to

246
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:34,260
understand what obvious gap you tities

247
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:35,850
what it really means and the risk

248
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:39,060
appetite they're leaning towards they've

249
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:42,090
got to understand that as well they need

250
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:45,390
to accept responsibility for that risk

251
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:49,500
appetite because it's that top-down

252
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:51,449
approach that's going to come but like

253
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:53,760
I'd just be mentioning they need to be

254
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:55,500
regularly discussing it it needs to come

255
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,880
up at the board meetings because they

256
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:59,100
need to be reviewing it they need to

257
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:01,830
make sure they're still comfortable with

258
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:04,470
the decisions they've made they need to

259
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:06,480
support the risk appetite I need to

260
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:09,750
support business reviews or C's we fund

261
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:11,310
in and that top-down approach you know

262
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:15,360
we can't do it without their support

263
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:17,040
it's not going to work it will fail my

264
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,050
probably one of the most important

265
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,969
things out they need to be consistent

266
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:23,760
you need to make sure the board are

267
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:25,200
understanding it all in the same way to

268
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,819
the same level and that when they're

269
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,380
talking to other people about it they're

270
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:31,230
giving them the same messages about how

271
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:34,010
important these so this does it needs to

272
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:38,870
be led all the way from the top down

273
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:41,790
yeah we can't do it without them so

274
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:44,610
finally and probably the most important

275
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:46,319
part of this whole presentation is you

276
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:50,460
need to educate your board you need to

277
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:52,410
get them bought in so that's it for my

278
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:53,910
presentation so thank you very much for

279
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:56,300
your time and listening and I'm happy to

280
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:56,300
take any questions
