1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:06,660
thank you first things first Who am I

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:09,000
I'm a network security architect

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:12,330
currently currently studying for OCP I'm

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,980
a bit of a IT geek and Carnot you could

5
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:15,900
say I'm the ultimate car hacker because

6
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:18,750
I built that 13 years ago and it's been

7
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:20,340
of gradius numerous times since however

8
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:22,859
it is slightly different from the car

9
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:26,189
I'm going to show you in the only has 3

10
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:27,510
C used tool which I built the one shown

11
00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:30,090
in the top right-hand corner there is a

12
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:32,430
data logger I built for that users can

13
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:33,870
bus to the ECU so that I can know what

14
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:37,160
the hell is going on on the engine

15
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:40,169
itself it's gonna be about car hacking

16
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:42,989
it's the first info SEC related issue

17
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:44,550
I've ever discovered and disclosed this

18
00:00:42,989 --> 00:00:46,860
is not only anything in the league's of

19
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:50,250
Christopher Chris valasek and Charlie

20
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:56,160
Miller's Ford Jeep or co2 hack or Ken

21
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:59,820
Monroe's Mitsubishi hack in July 2015 I

22
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,419
purchased the six of Citroen I've ever

23
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:03,629
had owned

24
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:05,250
ds5 1955 edition it's a limited edition

25
00:01:03,629 --> 00:01:07,619
had all the toys all the bells and

26
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:09,810
whistles and in the middle of the

27
00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:12,210
dashboard had a 7-inch touchscreen you

28
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:14,700
could tell it to your phone and surf the

29
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:16,320
internet on why you'd want to do that

30
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:18,990
when you've got a phone with a perfectly

31
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:22,258
good user interface anyway I don't know

32
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:26,640
but it's there didn't do anything to

33
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:28,140
start with but in 2016 I was working

34
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,090
away from home with quite a lot and you

35
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:32,310
know got a bit bored so I thought I'd

36
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:37,290
tell them earphone to it and map it and

37
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:40,890
see what I could see yeah there was four

38
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:43,530
ports open 23 one one one three three

39
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:45,000
thirty three and twenty thousand the

40
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:48,210
most interesting one there actually is

41
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,920
twenty thousand which is um D mp3 which

42
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:52,199
I believe will give you direct access to

43
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,939
the canvas however I currently can't

44
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,310
find any information on how to craft a

45
00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:57,809
packet to do that but I have been in

46
00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:00,390
communication with someone that actually

47
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:01,369
does industrial control system stuff to

48
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:04,229
actually find out that information

49
00:02:01,369 --> 00:02:08,038
because they write packet generators for

50
00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:10,649
protocol but as a network engineer

51
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:12,200
everyone knows telling it don't think so

52
00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:14,420
telling it under the box and

53
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:18,560
yep straight in shell no authentication

54
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:19,760
no nothing great there's a slightly

55
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:23,720
better view of the wireless

56
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:26,329
configuration and there's the details of

57
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:29,510
the actual operating system itself it's

58
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:33,560
au VxWorks box running on the free scale

59
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:35,600
in x6 solo the Xbox is actually the same

60
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:38,000
stuff that runs on the Mars rover so

61
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:39,100
hopefully I did security slightly better

62
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,550
than that

63
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:46,519
so yeah unless we did this in 2016 and a

64
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:48,260
44 con in 2016 I spoke to care Monro

65
00:02:46,519 --> 00:02:50,540
about their findings and he said well

66
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:53,390
why haven't you disclosed it to anyone

67
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:55,609
so I sort of said well there's nothing

68
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:57,829
actually I've found it's only telling it

69
00:02:55,610 --> 00:03:00,080
but I actually explained I didn't want

70
00:02:57,830 --> 00:03:03,170
to brick my daily driver note to

71
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:06,080
yourself don't try and hack your daily

72
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:08,059
driver twice in the last month I British

73
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,890
my jag with all the lights like a

74
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:12,380
Christmas tree because I put the canvas

75
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:15,768
speed wrong and it just basically

76
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:17,269
bricked itself not fun with a 40 grown

77
00:03:15,769 --> 00:03:21,620
car trying to explain that Judge Aguilar

78
00:03:17,269 --> 00:03:24,680
but however two years ago last year I

79
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:25,880
decided to sell the Citroen so I thought

80
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:27,530
I'd have a look through the command

81
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:29,540
reference guide and see what come ons I

82
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:31,400
could find so I've had another go

83
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:34,239
there's a USB port in the centre console

84
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:38,060
and some of the cons commands were a

85
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:39,769
copy and X copy so you could do an X

86
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:43,690
copy of the file system from the head

87
00:03:39,769 --> 00:03:46,880
unit to your USB Drive which is great

88
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:50,359
onto the contents all that use of the

89
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:51,859
USB Drive in the system data folder

90
00:03:50,359 --> 00:03:53,690
there are a load of sequel like

91
00:03:51,859 --> 00:03:55,609
databases some of them are just

92
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:57,920
placeholders for the user data or to you

93
00:03:55,609 --> 00:04:01,100
in a minute but other ones have things

94
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:02,929
like VIN number and things in so it's to

95
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:05,540
actually set the hid unit up to the core

96
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:07,340
so it knows what core is talking to if

97
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:09,290
you open them some of them would open

98
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:11,959
fine other ones would look like they've

99
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:14,179
got a password it wasn't actually a

100
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:16,488
password it was just she zipped but I

101
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:18,880
didn't found out how to later after I'd

102
00:04:16,488 --> 00:04:21,320
actually finished the disclosure process

103
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:24,020
but more interesting stuff is the user

104
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:24,760
data so you've got some of the same user

105
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:26,450
data

106
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:28,849
sequel like fire

107
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:29,539
and you've got a corresponding INF file

108
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:33,760
with it

109
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:37,370
so these INF files have a CLC check-in

110
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:42,159
that sir just uncompressed see our chief

111
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:42,160
check and there is a fact

112
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:49,039
and there's the compressed CSC check the

113
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,870
interesting files in their agenda that

114
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,490
we call light which just happens to be

115
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:54,710
the entire contents of your phonebook

116
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:57,200
from your phone while we were tethered

117
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:58,549
over bluetooth so if anyone gets onto

118
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:00,430
your head unit they know all your

119
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:03,080
contacts and all their names numbers

120
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:05,930
absolutely everything and the other two

121
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:09,530
interesting ones are navigation SQL

122
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:11,330
light and now desta sq alright we'll

123
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:14,239
show you the contents of navigation and

124
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:16,849
SQL the light there are two tables in

125
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:19,490
their lost destinations which has as it

126
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:22,700
says all the last destinations including

127
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:25,910
any favorites that you have home work

128
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:27,950
etc which is great and it also has

129
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:29,840
waypoints which would be anywhere you

130
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:33,860
visited on the way to any of those day

131
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:37,489
locations so some of the things might be

132
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:39,320
in both tables some might not just going

133
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:41,150
on for the actual data inside the sequel

134
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:43,670
like the eight weeks I have redacted

135
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:44,900
this for my own personal security does

136
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:50,990
anyone know where those three locations

137
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:52,640
off the top one is their building you're

138
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:53,990
in the second one down is a carriage

139
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:56,180
I've bought my new car from and the

140
00:05:53,990 --> 00:06:01,160
third one is steel con if anyone has a

141
00:05:56,180 --> 00:06:02,960
ticket let me know couldn't get one so I

142
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:05,390
had to play with the files itself tried

143
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:07,489
to modify fall managed to swap two

144
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:09,530
characters around and it worked fine

145
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:12,020
because I didn't know how to recreate

146
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:13,609
the CRC check if you did any more than

147
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:16,099
swap two characters around because the

148
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:18,110
CRC check wasn't correct it basically

149
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:20,720
thought it had a blank database so you

150
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:23,990
lost all your history so it's not not

151
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,470
great but actual physical access is a

152
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:27,080
bit boring

153
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:28,550
so had another look through the command

154
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:32,030
reference and you can actually do

155
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:36,200
acceleration over wireless so you have

156
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:39,739
to add your host create a device the one

157
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:42,830
indicates FTP zero would indicate NFS

158
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:44,840
I didn't actually try NFS but as long as

159
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:46,520
you get the 0x0 at the bottom after

160
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:48,919
you've run the command it actually works

161
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:50,539
and is copied your file across the

162
00:06:48,919 --> 00:06:53,359
biggest problem in that is X copy

163
00:06:50,539 --> 00:06:57,318
doesn't work over FTP so it takes a

164
00:06:53,360 --> 00:07:00,530
while so onto the disclosure process

165
00:06:57,319 --> 00:07:05,090
itself first of all I wrote up my

166
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:07,299
findings into a document saying what I'd

167
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:10,880
found how I think the issues are I

168
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:14,000
contacted Kim Munroe to see whether he

169
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:18,020
had any contacts within photo citroen

170
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:20,569
which he did so i sent over a brief

171
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:22,669
outline of what my findings were to them

172
00:07:20,569 --> 00:07:25,880
and they arranged a conference call in

173
00:07:22,669 --> 00:07:28,039
very very strange broken French so they

174
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:30,319
was trying to speak English I can't

175
00:07:28,039 --> 00:07:32,180
speak a word of French so I explained my

176
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:32,599
findings and they were like I don't get

177
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:35,569
it

178
00:07:32,599 --> 00:07:37,159
so okay put it this way you're at my

179
00:07:35,569 --> 00:07:38,900
college if the mobile phone is dead and

180
00:07:37,159 --> 00:07:40,729
you want to get on the Wi-Fi to find

181
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:43,008
that something on you might be doing

182
00:07:40,729 --> 00:07:45,469
later on in the evening so you do join

183
00:07:43,009 --> 00:07:47,659
the McDonald's Wi-Fi and anyone that

184
00:07:45,469 --> 00:07:50,210
just happens to be on the same Wi-Fi if

185
00:07:47,659 --> 00:07:52,639
there doesn't have client isolation that

186
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:54,169
you can get into your box after finding

187
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:55,729
your IP address and tone it and in and

188
00:07:54,169 --> 00:07:57,680
find out where you live etc exception

189
00:07:55,729 --> 00:08:00,650
I've already explained that they sort of

190
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:02,659
got it but then they had to go away and

191
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:03,859
make sure it just wasn't a fluke so we

192
00:08:02,659 --> 00:08:06,530
gave them a couple of weeks to go away

193
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:09,710
and repeat see if they keep find that

194
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:11,989
issue on other vehicles in the meantime

195
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:15,888
I spoke to Ken Munroe again at Steel Con

196
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:19,069
last year and peugeot citroen were

197
00:08:15,889 --> 00:08:21,020
actually under the impression that ken

198
00:08:19,069 --> 00:08:22,430
Munroe was a bug bounty hunter and we

199
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:25,310
were both trying to extort money out of

200
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:26,990
them photo citroen which is quite

201
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:32,270
strange because at the time they were

202
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:35,240
buying over GM motors Europe Vauxhall

203
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:37,399
and Opel and General Motors do actually

204
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:38,719
have a bug bounty program I never

205
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:39,900
actually got anything from Peugeot

206
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:43,529
Citroen

207
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:45,390
so thanks great wonderful eventually I

208
00:08:43,529 --> 00:08:48,210
had a second conference call with the

209
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:50,250
French and they had confirmed that they

210
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:54,600
have seen the issue in other vehicles

211
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:56,250
and their general consensus was it's up

212
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:59,790
to the customer to secure their own

213
00:08:56,250 --> 00:09:01,500
Wi-Fi so we haven't got any

214
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:04,189
authentication but yeah it's up to you

215
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:07,529
if you connect to a crap Wi-Fi good luck

216
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:09,120
they did however say the next generation

217
00:09:07,529 --> 00:09:11,880
of head units of being developed at the

218
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:15,060
time were not going to have Wi-Fi chips

219
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:17,130
s in and any existing chipset any

220
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:20,400
existing head unit would be disabled at

221
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:21,870
a later date okay what if you paid extra

222
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:26,069
to have this and they've now obvious

223
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:27,800
able to eventually published my findings

224
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:30,300
at the weekend of Def Con last year and

225
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:33,000
managed to get a tweet from Charlie

226
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:36,270
Miller himself about my findings which

227
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:40,710
was I get another question

228
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:43,380
does anyone know who this chap is yep

229
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:45,570
it's the French president and he just

230
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:47,880
happens to earn to be driven around in

231
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:50,089
the same type of vehicle so is this not

232
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:53,089
a matter of French national security

233
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:55,680
purrs oh Rijn didn't think it was

234
00:09:53,089 --> 00:09:58,529
I'd sort of disagree with him personally

235
00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:00,890
because I'm sure nation states might be

236
00:09:58,529 --> 00:10:03,360
able to hack the Wi-Fi and the Bluetooth

237
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:04,709
ever since then I've tried to recreate

238
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,770
my findings but off the car

239
00:10:04,709 --> 00:10:09,959
so I purchase a head unit and screen and

240
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:11,839
stuff and know if I don't know it's a

241
00:10:09,959 --> 00:10:14,670
little thing in the middle it says Wi-Fi

242
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:17,550
so tried to try to get it working out

243
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:20,219
the car the fly 12-volt strip nothing

244
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:23,870
happens because you need all of that

245
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:26,990
stuff so the instrument cluster the

246
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:30,330
indicator stalks the ignition key the

247
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:31,770
wiring loom body control module and all

248
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:34,380
the bits that you see on the screen

249
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:37,110
there the plan is to actually create a

250
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:39,060
car hacking a car on a bench so that

251
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:42,959
people can hack it a conference in the

252
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:46,979
future once I actually get it working on

253
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:48,780
the on the bench so rollin have all this

254
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:51,850
out I actually tried to get the head

255
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:57,610
unit working offline oh it's working

256
00:10:51,850 --> 00:11:01,519
and so that kind of that then on to some

257
00:10:57,610 --> 00:11:05,300
actual canvas bit got an Arduino an are

258
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:08,480
doing a rosca PI with a PI can hat sniff

259
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:11,089
the canvas traffic to find out what

260
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:15,470
actually messages were actually required

261
00:11:11,089 --> 00:11:17,000
to turn on the head unit did a replay on

262
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:18,819
that and then worked out the five

263
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,440
messages that were actually required to

264
00:11:18,819 --> 00:11:26,620
get the head unit working so that then

265
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:28,850
came around to little Arduino module

266
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:31,759
little thing on the left is Arduino Nano

267
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:36,230
on the right is a cam bus controller and

268
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:37,970
transceiver program that to control the

269
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:39,790
head unit and send all the correct

270
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:41,990
refugees at the right time scales

271
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:43,670
wonderful note if you are going to be

272
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:46,569
doing anything with that type of module

273
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:49,810
which has got the mCP to five one five

274
00:11:46,569 --> 00:11:52,639
its crystal frequency is eight megahertz

275
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:54,739
all over the sample code has 16

276
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:58,000
megahertz if you don't change it it

277
00:11:54,740 --> 00:12:02,300
don't work and you won't get anything

278
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:04,370
eventually it comes to this it's my head

279
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:06,979
unit on bench which if I don't want to

280
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:09,949
play with I will be around later and

281
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:14,779
it's working down here if they want to

282
00:12:09,949 --> 00:12:18,560
have a go at it finally on to thank you

283
00:12:14,779 --> 00:12:21,829
I like to thank my mentor Thomas for his

284
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:23,660
support preparation first talk also like

285
00:12:21,829 --> 00:12:26,120
to thank Ken I know he's not here that

286
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:28,250
I'm sure someone who works with it is

287
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:29,779
and finally I'd like to thank my missus

288
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:33,079
for putting off of all my rubbish while

289
00:12:29,779 --> 00:12:34,339
trying to create a car on a bench the

290
00:12:33,079 --> 00:12:35,870
amount of times when you turn the

291
00:12:34,339 --> 00:12:37,760
ignition key it beeps about a dozen

292
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:41,540
times and it's like are you playing with

293
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:43,990
that again it's like stop it finally any

294
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:43,990
questions
