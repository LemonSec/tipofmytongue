1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,730
alright hey guys like the slide says I'm

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:07,589
Keith I work at PwC and they're cyber

3
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:09,840
threat intelligence team I've been doing

4
00:00:07,589 --> 00:00:11,790
that for about a year and a half now and

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,070
I spend most of my time analyzing

6
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:16,680
malware and tracking for actors which

7
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:19,890
it's exactly what this presentation is

8
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:21,509
all about so in this presentation I'm

9
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:23,160
going to go through a few things so

10
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:24,390
firstly I'm going to introduct introduce

11
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:26,340
the idea of tractors

12
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:28,859
a few key terms that you might hear for

13
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:31,019
out the presentation define like why we

14
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:32,940
do track for actors a little bit of

15
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:35,250
background on what I did and my methods

16
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:37,079
and using a real threat actor as an

17
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:38,820
example and then going through the

18
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:40,890
methods of tracking how you can identify

19
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:43,260
patterns and walks or patterns that I

20
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:44,730
identified and then a few other tips

21
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:46,440
that I learned in my first experience

22
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:47,459
when I was tracking for actors and then

23
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:51,269
we'll end with questions if we've got

24
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:54,180
some time so right staying off what do I

25
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:55,770
mean by a threat actor and when I say

26
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:58,680
for an actor I'm essentially saying any

27
00:00:55,770 --> 00:01:00,180
bad person up to no good so normally

28
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,449
when people say this they're referring

29
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:02,750
to

30
00:01:00,449 --> 00:01:04,890
maybe cyber criminal gangs or

31
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:07,409
nation-state hacking groups which are

32
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:09,689
also known as a BTS or advanced

33
00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:12,420
persistent threats I've also done a

34
00:01:09,689 --> 00:01:14,970
little artist rendition of what the

35
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:19,049
threats are like nowadays but might not

36
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:21,000
react to her so the threat actor that I

37
00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:24,840
tracked as part of this was called dark

38
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,150
caracal they had quite a lot of activity

39
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:29,130
last year and they were the subjects of

40
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:31,350
a really interesting report by look out

41
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:32,850
in the FF so if you want some more

42
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:35,100
details about this for act I like that

43
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:36,960
background attribution and who with who

44
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:39,149
they were targeting then check out that

45
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,130
report but for this I'm just going to

46
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:43,860
kind of use them as a backdrop and show

47
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:44,600
how you can track for actors by tracking

48
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:48,810
them

49
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:50,579
so why track for actors so basically the

50
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:52,110
scenario is if you get an email through

51
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:55,320
in your organization you get a phishing

52
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:56,520
email then somebody opens it and now

53
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:58,798
you've got their malware running on your

54
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:01,320
system the first things you kind of

55
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:04,860
wanna know is who is behind this who are

56
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:06,298
their likely targets and just here they

57
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:07,740
like likely targets and what are the

58
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:09,660
common sort of techniques that you can

59
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:10,919
look out for and who do they have any

60
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:12,880
repeating behaviors that you can look

61
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:16,299
out for and then make sure the

62
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:17,920
in their tracks so also the main point

63
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:20,200
about three actor tracking is the fact

64
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:23,619
that we want to have fun of cause

65
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:26,920
cybersecurity is all about fun so that's

66
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:31,300
another reason to do it so let's get

67
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:33,959
tracking so the scenario was the around

68
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:36,700
June 2017 we were alerted of an email

69
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:38,680
but isn't the actual email right there

70
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:40,030
that's just kind of a an idea of what

71
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,710
the email looks like because all

72
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:44,440
phishing emails essentially look like

73
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:47,440
this but the main points in that email

74
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:49,810
were that there was a so the from

75
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:52,120
address was a Jessica Koran and Maxwell

76
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:55,030
group to a and also had an Excel

77
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:56,920
document attachment so the main two

78
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:58,060
things that want to focus on here and if

79
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:59,859
we want to know more information about

80
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:01,480
is thorax or I think the best place to

81
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:03,220
start is by looking at that excel

82
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,670
document and finding some things about

83
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:05,710
it

84
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:08,380
a quickest way to get more information

85
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:10,810
out of this document is to they run in a

86
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:14,530
sandbox or a virtual machine which is

87
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:16,270
which is what I did in that situation so

88
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:17,770
I've got a safe environment setup where

89
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:20,040
I've got the virtual machine that's

90
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:22,690
disconnected for anything I care about I

91
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:25,030
spin that up and I run the Excel

92
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:27,640
document inside there and like a lot of

93
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:30,820
common phishing documents it comes up

94
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:32,320
with a warning to enable macros so I do

95
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:34,180
that enable macros check all the

96
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:36,640
activity that's going on and then see

97
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:37,690
they drops out an executable file which

98
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:40,329
I've put the hash there at the bottom

99
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:40,990
there and once this executable file was

100
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:42,910
dropped out

101
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:44,950
it started to connect out the command

102
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:46,630
and control server of the factor I

103
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:49,690
pulled out a little bit of their

104
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:51,310
communication there so you can use

105
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:53,440
Wireshark to get this out and it's quite

106
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:56,290
basic to do and you'll be able to find a

107
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:58,359
few more key bits and information so

108
00:03:56,290 --> 00:04:01,359
there we've got a URL at the top there

109
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:02,500
where it goes - I knew get dot php' I've

110
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:05,459
also got the domain name that's

111
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:08,380
connecting out to which is ant max calm

112
00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:09,820
also weirdly when the command and

113
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:11,500
control server the tracks are applied

114
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:15,880
they send a little message at the bottom

115
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:17,290
saying ok Bundick x3 244 which is also

116
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:18,760
quite interesting and we're starting to

117
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:21,520
get my dear of these unique behaviors

118
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:23,260
that this tractor has so I note them

119
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:26,500
down as good I didn't let these downs

120
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:26,840
you going so another quick way to get in

121
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:30,630
for me

122
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:32,010
our file is check the metadata so if in

123
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:33,990
the executable file you can just in

124
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:35,700
Windows right click it and look at the

125
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:38,160
information in the case that I was

126
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:40,979
talking about I look at it I find it

127
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:43,170
signed it's time to a an actual person's

128
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:46,140
name this Johannes krutov on it on the

129
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:47,340
right here on the Left Ian and so I look

130
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:49,289
at that and I think writes quite

131
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:51,090
interesting as a person's name probably

132
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:53,100
not a real person but interesting all

133
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:54,630
the same and then looking at the

134
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:57,090
document as well the metadata there

135
00:04:54,630 --> 00:05:00,030
shows that how the last author of alle

136
00:04:57,090 --> 00:05:01,919
and also in the strings of the file and

137
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:03,900
these are like little messages that are

138
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:05,610
embedded inside an executable you'll be

139
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:09,900
able to pull out you can also find again

140
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:11,490
that domain that max calm so that after

141
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:13,109
doing these two quick steps that's where

142
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:15,150
you're just kind of pause and and do a

143
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:18,030
stocktake and find out what have we got

144
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:20,760
now so in our case we've got two files

145
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:23,400
we have the Excel document and the act

146
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:25,980
the executable we've got an email

147
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:29,820
Jessica Quran we've also got a domain

148
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:31,230
anchor max calm a URL and also some

149
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:33,270
miscellaneous strings so like I showed

150
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:36,210
you earlier in the Wireshark little

151
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:38,820
short of a HTTP request we saw that okay

152
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:41,489
bandit X and also in the strings of the

153
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:43,560
file there was a debug path and debug

154
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:45,180
paths are being little remnants of where

155
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:46,950
the flags are might compiled their

156
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:50,090
malware we've seen that there's this

157
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:54,150
files this folder here with the backup

158
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:55,679
2903 2014 so it's also quite unique so

159
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:57,210
that's quite interesting so we pulled

160
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,730
that one out and then we've got two

161
00:05:57,210 --> 00:06:01,620
names so far three names even so we've

162
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:03,870
got the Jessica cram those in the

163
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:06,030
initial email johannah's krutov that was

164
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:09,600
signing it interesting and then the alia

165
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:10,859
that's popped up a few times as well so

166
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,210
then you ask yourself which of these

167
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:15,120
that we know it down useful for tracking

168
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:16,859
through our actors the hint is really

169
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,360
all of them because they're all kind of

170
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:21,000
unique in the case of this factor and

171
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:22,260
things we can use to track them on also

172
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,700
a good tips to send these to your

173
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:25,620
security team on your sock or something

174
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:26,880
like that so that they can get these all

175
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:29,280
blocked and they can look out for them

176
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:30,690
in the future so that if you have been

177
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,280
hit by this tractor then you make sure

178
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:35,370
that you're shutting down any activity

179
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:37,260
from now on but once you've done that we

180
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:39,419
can get back to the fun stuff and start

181
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:40,590
to find out a bit more that's best way

182
00:06:39,419 --> 00:06:41,789
to do that is to

183
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:44,940
searching on Google or something like

184
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:47,340
that just throw in some of the strings

185
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:49,950
that we saw so like this okay bandik X

186
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:52,289
we can throw that in and already we can

187
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:53,880
see two links at the top there for

188
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:55,950
sandbox is an N and IVA at the bottom of

189
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:58,350
another sandbox so we can actually open

190
00:06:55,950 --> 00:07:00,420
those up and see other samples of that

191
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:03,960
malware running again in a different

192
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:05,970
context also in hybrid analysis you can

193
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:07,320
open this up and download the file so

194
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:10,140
again you can continue this little

195
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:11,340
snowball effect and then on the right

196
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:13,590
also if you

197
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:15,989
I also search for the D backup half of

198
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:17,880
that about fold fold apart we saw

199
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:19,950
earlier it's that's interesting so we've

200
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:22,020
already got another few other sandboxes

201
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:24,360
of the people of ever throwing this

202
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:26,130
malware sample into and again like I say

203
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:28,140
you can go into a hybrid analysis look

204
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:29,820
at the indicators there or even download

205
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:31,890
the file itself and run it in your own

206
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:33,840
environment that's interesting so we've

207
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:35,880
got more samples possibly of the same

208
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:39,599
four actor but more likely just the same

209
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:41,430
piece of malware another interesting

210
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:43,560
part I found there was that this D

211
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:45,900
backup laughs also had again I've

212
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:47,490
highlighted there the name Ally which is

213
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:49,229
popped up twice now so that's quite

214
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:51,330
interesting you starting to see a little

215
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:54,660
bit of patterns in the malware which is

216
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:56,550
quite cool so another way you can find

217
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:59,190
out a bit more information about is to

218
00:07:56,550 --> 00:08:01,860
resolve these domains so domains can be

219
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:04,560
resolved into IP addresses and then you

220
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:07,200
can also use other services such as a

221
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:11,070
passive total I think it's called a risk

222
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:12,719
IQ now you can use to see the history of

223
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:15,420
domains and where they've been pointing

224
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:18,210
to so in this example at the top bank

225
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:19,470
max was pointing to that IP address but

226
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:21,450
we also see the history of the IP

227
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:23,160
addresses as well so we've gone from one

228
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:24,900
thing and then to the next thing and

229
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:28,320
then we're starting to find more that

230
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:29,789
might be connected to this fact so once

231
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:31,380
you've got all these things it's always

232
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:33,810
good to keep a track of what you've got

233
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:35,490
so the best thing to do here is map out

234
00:08:33,809 --> 00:08:37,650
I find the easier if I can visibly see

235
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:39,299
what I've got so far is everything I've

236
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:41,640
talked about so far I've mapped out

237
00:08:39,299 --> 00:08:43,469
there on the right I've done that in

238
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:45,630
multi go there's other services you can

239
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:47,670
use as well so see map tools is a good

240
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:49,770
open source one that you can use you can

241
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:50,849
also do it in PowerPoint and even

242
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:52,829
mspaint if you're really feeling

243
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:54,179
dangerous and the

244
00:08:52,829 --> 00:08:55,410
I'll be quite an interesting task if

245
00:08:54,179 --> 00:08:56,699
someone can map out our actors

246
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:58,259
infrastructure and mspaint

247
00:08:56,699 --> 00:09:00,868
I'd like to see it and I might buy you a

248
00:08:58,259 --> 00:09:02,129
drink because I'd be impressive but once

249
00:09:00,869 --> 00:09:04,259
you've got this you want to find out

250
00:09:02,129 --> 00:09:06,509
more and the best way to find out a bit

251
00:09:04,259 --> 00:09:09,660
more about all of this is to take what

252
00:09:06,509 --> 00:09:11,519
you've got and then pivot on to more

253
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:14,850
stuff as a picture of some people

254
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:16,110
pivoting there so yeah so what so how

255
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:18,209
can you pivot and what are things to

256
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:21,449
pivot on so like I showed you earlier

257
00:09:18,209 --> 00:09:22,939
domains into eyepiece these iPS can be

258
00:09:21,449 --> 00:09:25,378
turned to hashes using services like

259
00:09:22,939 --> 00:09:26,969
passive total does a bit of that and

260
00:09:25,379 --> 00:09:28,350
also if you're lucky enough to have a

261
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:30,660
paid version of virustotal

262
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:33,959
which maybe some people might you can

263
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:35,279
also find more hashes that way like I

264
00:09:33,959 --> 00:09:37,559
showed you these unique strings that we

265
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:40,259
found like the string in the in the HTTP

266
00:09:37,559 --> 00:09:41,879
request and the debug paths you can just

267
00:09:40,259 --> 00:09:44,339
do web searches for these and find other

268
00:09:41,879 --> 00:09:46,019
samples also for email addresses and

269
00:09:44,339 --> 00:09:47,790
those signer names those unique names we

270
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:49,819
saw earlier you can do a web search for

271
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:52,589
that and find more information as well

272
00:09:49,819 --> 00:09:53,969
as you doing this obviously continue to

273
00:09:52,589 --> 00:09:56,610
keep track of these indicators in

274
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:58,139
multigo or your mapping software of some

275
00:09:56,610 --> 00:10:00,540
sort and just keep the snowball effect

276
00:09:58,139 --> 00:10:02,429
going and you eventually get so many

277
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:04,349
different indicators or mapping together

278
00:10:02,429 --> 00:10:07,049
I have an entire graph and you would

279
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:09,089
start to feel exactly like this and you

280
00:10:07,049 --> 00:10:10,529
don't know what's going on anymore so I

281
00:10:09,089 --> 00:10:11,850
when I was doing this those going to get

282
00:10:10,529 --> 00:10:13,410
into that point because I was finding so

283
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:16,110
many samples and everything was just

284
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:19,499
connected that I kind of found that I

285
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:21,089
wasn't figuring out very much so in that

286
00:10:19,499 --> 00:10:24,029
point I had that point the best thing to

287
00:10:21,089 --> 00:10:26,610
do for me was just have a cup of tea sit

288
00:10:24,029 --> 00:10:28,829
down and kind of mother over and analyze

289
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:32,639
it in your head then and yeah yeah and

290
00:10:28,829 --> 00:10:33,779
find out what's going on so but at that

291
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:35,249
point as well it kind of makes me feel

292
00:10:33,779 --> 00:10:37,860
good because you've gone from two things

293
00:10:35,249 --> 00:10:39,629
initially to a big web of stuff but like

294
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:41,339
I say sit back and look at it and kind

295
00:10:39,629 --> 00:10:44,490
of analyze it in your head and you'll

296
00:10:41,339 --> 00:10:46,169
start to figure some stuff out so some

297
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:47,999
of the patterns that I saw after after

298
00:10:46,169 --> 00:10:50,339
doing all this we're quite interesting

299
00:10:47,999 --> 00:10:52,850
and it's quite cool it's one of the

300
00:10:50,339 --> 00:10:54,199
first things was that remember there to

301
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:56,790
2017

302
00:10:54,199 --> 00:10:59,699
email that we saw earlier it have a

303
00:10:56,790 --> 00:11:01,949
Jessica Koran and then going back I was

304
00:10:59,699 --> 00:11:04,019
finding more samples of malware I found

305
00:11:01,949 --> 00:11:06,449
that again there was another malice

306
00:11:04,019 --> 00:11:09,779
sample same sample but older from

307
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:12,300
14 was signed by the same name Jessica

308
00:11:09,779 --> 00:11:14,430
Koran which is quite interesting a bit

309
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:17,069
weird so they're either repeating names

310
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:20,399
or their uninventive or what I'm not

311
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:22,470
really sure it sounds interesting so

312
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:24,750
another example is what is that this Ali

313
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:27,420
kept popping up again quite quite a few

314
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:29,010
times so I did a web search for the

315
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:32,099
malware a few times and I found a

316
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:34,709
website of a hacking group that was

317
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:36,630
selling malware the exact malware that

318
00:11:34,709 --> 00:11:39,689
I'd been analyzing being sold by this

319
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:41,010
guy called Prince Ali which was

320
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:42,750
interesting and it makes sense because

321
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:46,079
if he's producing the software then of

322
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:48,480
course his folder structure might be in

323
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:50,130
the malware itself but also interesting

324
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:53,399
that in the document we saw earlier was

325
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:54,930
also had this author name in it which

326
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:56,940
seems a bit strange because it could

327
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:59,279
mean that not only is he just produced a

328
00:11:56,940 --> 00:12:01,350
piece of malware he might be producing a

329
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:03,209
document used for fishing as well so he

330
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:04,889
might be carrying out fishing attacks or

331
00:12:03,209 --> 00:12:07,138
something like that so it could be these

332
00:12:04,889 --> 00:12:09,300
not just so the fact it might not just

333
00:12:07,139 --> 00:12:11,430
be using this guy's malware might be

334
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:14,640
using him to create entire campaigns for

335
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:17,099
him possibly so once you've got this and

336
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:19,380
you wanna wrap up and start to track the

337
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:21,120
fracture into the future then just

338
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:22,769
establish a few methods that you can

339
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:25,410
track them behind the scenes for you

340
00:12:22,769 --> 00:12:27,720
automatically so things you can use face

341
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:30,750
they're Yarra rules you can also set up

342
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:32,610
Network signatures if you want to know

343
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:35,040
more about this stuff Googler or talk to

344
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:36,240
me afterwards because the lots talk to

345
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:38,910
you to talk about in a lot of these

346
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:40,949
things also DNA DNS alerts are good

347
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:42,510
because it means you can either set

348
00:12:40,949 --> 00:12:44,790
these up on your own or the bf service

349
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:47,430
on the Internet to do it where whenever

350
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:49,829
the main changes to a different IP you

351
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:51,300
know about it you can also set up Google

352
00:12:49,829 --> 00:12:53,099
search alerts as well so for the strings

353
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:54,750
we saw earlier and these unique names

354
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:56,399
that seem to you're repeating itself a

355
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:57,690
search alert for that and then if new

356
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:59,670
sample comes up then you'll know about

357
00:12:57,690 --> 00:13:03,300
it straight away and just keep checking

358
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:05,610
up often so little tips and things like

359
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:07,859
wish Adam has started is that you've got

360
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:09,209
to automate the boring tasks of the star

361
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:12,269
I was doing this all manually throwing

362
00:13:09,209 --> 00:13:13,920
into virtual machines but automatic

363
00:13:12,269 --> 00:13:16,260
sound boxes can do this quite quickly

364
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:18,449
and also scripts can be used to pull out

365
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:19,960
the certificate information as well so

366
00:13:18,449 --> 00:13:22,150
just work on automating and making

367
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:24,190
easier for self and also ask her around

368
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:26,140
so like I said at the start there was a

369
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:28,150
report that was released about this at

370
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:29,439
the same time as I was tracking it so

371
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:30,760
would have been nice to have connected

372
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,380
with the people who are researching it

373
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:34,030
ahead of time we could have compared

374
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:36,970
notes and stuff like that so that's

375
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:37,839
quite interesting so and a lot of the

376
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:40,240
time when you're doing this you won't

377
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:41,380
realize that it's quite right widespread

378
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,630
you might be looking or less than

379
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:45,070
thinking why is no one looking at it

380
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:49,330
when really they are just behind the

381
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:51,550
scenes so it's good to reach out so to

382
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:53,440
summarise essentially throughout the

383
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:55,420
tracking I pulled it down to three main

384
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,680
things which is collect the initial

385
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:59,020
indicators from the sample you're

386
00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:00,819
starting with pivot off of these domains

387
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:03,220
to IPs and and such like I showed you

388
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:05,080
earlier and then profit once you've got

389
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:06,430
the detection rules in place you'll be

390
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:07,600
able to see them when they're starting

391
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:09,819
to do stuff in the future

392
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:11,950
and now you know if fraktur you know the

393
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:13,210
patterns of the behaviors and you're

394
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:15,460
kind of the expert and now you can

395
00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:17,140
impress people so when they get a new

396
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:19,240
email in from the same tractor you can

397
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:20,980
go oh I know this one that's a blah blah

398
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:25,630
and they'll be really impressed

399
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:27,450
hopefully anyway so yeah so that's about

400
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:30,010
it for today I went for a bit a quick

401
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:31,570
went through it a bit fast but if you

402
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:34,569
want me to talk about any other details

403
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:37,870
in a bit more detail then come and catch

404
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:40,260
me later or email me or get me at my

405
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:43,270
Twitter haven't tweeted anything but

406
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:45,290
that's how you can contact me so thank

407
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:51,370
you very much

408
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:55,209
[Applause]

409
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:55,210
it's a question
