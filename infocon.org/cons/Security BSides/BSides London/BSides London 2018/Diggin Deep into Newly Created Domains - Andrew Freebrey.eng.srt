1
00:00:00,469 --> 00:00:07,440
thank you very much so over this

2
00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:09,389
presentation I'll be looking over how I

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,610
analyze newly domains that's been

4
00:00:09,389 --> 00:00:15,809
created within a week in December last

5
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:17,789
year so a bit before that bit about Who

6
00:00:15,809 --> 00:00:21,630
I am I study at University of

7
00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:23,250
Westminster and after I graduated I did

8
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:24,750
a little bit of freelance work and

9
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:27,800
they'll be of contracting work before I

10
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:30,300
ended up a kinetic as a sake analyst

11
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:32,070
just a disclaimer all opinions in this

12
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:36,059
presentation on my own and don't reflect

13
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:38,430
any of my company so I work as a stock

14
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:43,680
analyst which is 24/7 we have external

15
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:46,019
clients and it's all seen monitoring the

16
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:50,070
reason why I did this analysis is to

17
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:51,809
understand a threat landscape it gives

18
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:52,890
us better context or what's actually

19
00:00:51,809 --> 00:00:55,169
happening out there

20
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:57,270
it also allows us to be proactive within

21
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:59,940
our defense it's staying one step ahead

22
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:02,340
of the game and stopping the bad guys

23
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:06,450
helping us stop the bad guys before they

24
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:09,030
even have a chance to act it's great for

25
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:11,939
this analysis greatful kite finding

26
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:14,640
correlation between trends and try and

27
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:18,508
spot some malicious campaigns out there

28
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:21,600
as they're being created the limitations

29
00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:23,970
that I've added to it was it's all

30
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,860
passive and open source intelligence so

31
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:28,860
it means no banner grabbing no direct

32
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:30,990
contact or connection and it's all to

33
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:33,450
preserve operational security so we

34
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:37,199
don't to expose attribution back to our

35
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:42,210
own organizations the data that I've

36
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:44,909
been working with is from who is the

37
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:47,130
Escom which is basically a text document

38
00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:50,610
of all newly created domains within a

39
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:52,890
single day it's free it is free for

40
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:55,470
about seven days in the past the

41
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:57,479
licensing allows us to use that in a

42
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:59,399
corporate environment as well there are

43
00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:01,530
other places you can go to as well that

44
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:05,579
has better data but we'll stick to this

45
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:07,740
one in my analysis so the first step we

46
00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:08,500
need to do is to collect all that data

47
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:11,200
and

48
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:15,430
to a file that's easily something that

49
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:18,730
can be easily queried and analyzed so

50
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:22,920
after putting it all into a database we

51
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:26,440
able to look at some of the common

52
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:29,649
activities within a malicious domain

53
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:31,780
names so you have a brand jacking where

54
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:34,500
they use well-known brands to try and

55
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:37,000
get people to click on their website

56
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:39,850
doppelgangers which look exactly the

57
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,670
same as the means that are already out

58
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:44,980
there by removing the dot from the host

59
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:48,880
or subdomain you also have typosquatting

60
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:51,250
so you have like Apple calm but they

61
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:53,410
might miss the e with fat fingers and

62
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:57,370
press R instead sits on my registered

63
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:59,320
that and that relies on the end users

64
00:02:57,370 --> 00:03:03,340
mistakes now one of the most interesting

65
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:10,260
ways is homograph attacks which is peeny

66
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:10,260
codes within the URL for international

67
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:21,549
though for sorry internationalized

68
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:25,359
domain names so two for this attack you

69
00:03:21,549 --> 00:03:30,880
have to have the xn - - prefix to tell

70
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:34,390
the browser that is an IDE and as from

71
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:37,780
this example the xn - - a tak so on so

72
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:41,500
forth if you put into a browser that is

73
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:45,280
configured for ID ends it actually

74
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:51,160
appears as Apple calm and the reason why

75
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:55,840
is you have none Roman alphabets which

76
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:58,510
are all based on ascii so a go back the

77
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:00,660
greek latin and cyrillic oh all look the

78
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:04,950
same but they all have different codes

79
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:08,739
so under 27th of December we there was

80
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:13,859
881 domains with the XM - - which are

81
00:04:08,739 --> 00:04:15,760
all ASCII compatible encoding unless so

82
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:17,859
other things

83
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:20,469
there needs to do after looking all the

84
00:04:17,858 --> 00:04:22,120
fishing sites is to gather all the

85
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:23,889
domain names and look at how many were

86
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:28,449
created in the top-level domain on each

87
00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:30,310
day and looking at it it's difficult for

88
00:04:28,449 --> 00:04:35,139
the humans to read so we need to

89
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:38,470
organize it and display it in a way that

90
00:04:35,139 --> 00:04:43,630
humans can easily interpret so from this

91
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:48,479
we can already see that dot info was the

92
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:51,400
dot lame sorry was very quiet and so

93
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:54,150
until the 31st so it was a few hundred

94
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:59,099
until I got to 53,000 on that single day

95
00:04:54,150 --> 00:05:03,609
so that was clearly a campaign going on

96
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:05,650
so like I said we need to organize it so

97
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:08,740
it's easier to look for trends if we go

98
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:10,330
back in the data we can see that on the

99
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:13,930
first year it looks like there's a

100
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:16,090
little erroneous data as well where it

101
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:20,229
just wasn't recording the newly created

102
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:23,739
domains so after doing all that we look

103
00:05:20,229 --> 00:05:26,139
for piece in activity so by putting it

104
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:28,660
into a graph which are normalized so

105
00:05:26,139 --> 00:05:33,340
that all data is between the range of 0

106
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:37,320
and 1 it's easier for us to see ky peaks

107
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:39,669
with domains that could be linked so

108
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:42,190
looking at this I saw that there might

109
00:05:39,669 --> 00:05:44,948
be something going on with the dot vote

110
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:48,719
top-level domain so after digging a

111
00:05:44,949 --> 00:05:54,900
little bit into it what I found was a

112
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:58,360
load of domain names that were sorry

113
00:05:54,900 --> 00:06:02,260
that were named after American

114
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:04,479
University sports teams and there were

115
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:07,780
several hundreds of those and each of

116
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:12,210
them were to get a domain in that it

117
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:14,710
cost $39 99 and while it was on sale so

118
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:17,198
estimated the amount of investment that

119
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:20,229
this person had to put in it would have

120
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:22,090
been twelve thousand dollars so it could

121
00:06:20,229 --> 00:06:23,950
be that he's intended intending to

122
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:24,700
squattin these domains and sell them to

123
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:30,610
the universe

124
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:32,890
teams or from my perspective it was more

125
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:37,750
of a phishing campaign targeted at these

126
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:39,610
universities by looking into the person

127
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:43,000
behind her it was a person called jake

128
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:44,230
hoffman and but looking deeper into him

129
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,450
while using some open source

130
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:49,390
intelligence we can see he was an

131
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:51,490
Arizona Queen Creek councilman he does

132
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:54,039
own a digital communications company so

133
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:56,920
it could be a legit could be him

134
00:06:54,040 --> 00:07:02,170
legitimately buying these domains to

135
00:06:56,920 --> 00:07:04,570
sell to these American universities but

136
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:06,250
after digging deeper into men finding

137
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:08,610
more email addresses associated with him

138
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:11,050
I put him through how about being pwned

139
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:11,760
and we do see that he has been

140
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:15,460
compromised

141
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:19,780
so we see BTB USA business and Linkedin

142
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:24,609
where his physical address email

143
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:26,729
addresses passwords employers job titles

144
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:32,260
phone numbers all of these have been

145
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:35,380
leaked so it could be that a actor has

146
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:38,530
taken these bits of information and used

147
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:42,610
them to register these domains within

148
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:46,150
his name other things that we can find

149
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:48,970
within domain names are DJ's which are

150
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:52,900
the main generated algorithms they act

151
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:56,680
as a CNC rendezvous point for malware so

152
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:59,229
as a brief overview a malware will use

153
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:03,130
pseudo random generation to create a

154
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:06,000
domain name and the threat actor would

155
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:08,620
gen would register these domain names so

156
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,130
the malware then reach out to it and

157
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:13,900
then reach back up to the CNC server

158
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:16,030
reason they do that is if they directly

159
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:18,219
go to a CNC server you can block off

160
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:20,559
access to it through the firewall but

161
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:22,030
having several different domains means

162
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,190
if you could block off one then it would

163
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:26,169
generate another one go to it go back

164
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:31,930
and then so on and so forth allowing

165
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:33,940
more persistence within your network one

166
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:36,370
way that I was able to group these

167
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:37,409
domain generated algorithms names

168
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:39,740
together

169
00:08:37,409 --> 00:08:42,120
was that there always a set length

170
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:46,949
that's the way that the algorithm

171
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:51,509
outputted it so we can see the dot party

172
00:08:46,949 --> 00:08:56,279
there were many domain names on the with

173
00:08:51,509 --> 00:08:59,399
character lengths 1718 which show but

174
00:08:56,279 --> 00:09:04,649
look by verifying the data always see

175
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:06,209
that there were BGA's as well going back

176
00:09:04,649 --> 00:09:08,370
into more of the Whois we could see

177
00:09:06,209 --> 00:09:10,680
different personas as well that people

178
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:12,959
could take a lot of them were Chinese

179
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:16,229
personas but they possibly can might not

180
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:20,099
be Chinese as it's very easy to fake a

181
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:22,529
persona online things that you can do to

182
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:26,329
grieve them together is reverse few is

183
00:09:22,529 --> 00:09:30,689
which helps find all domains general

184
00:09:26,329 --> 00:09:33,269
registered within from that person so

185
00:09:30,689 --> 00:09:37,230
looking into it taking a sample of 20

186
00:09:33,269 --> 00:09:38,910
from one domain every 2700 domains you

187
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:40,279
see one rigid for years which is

188
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:42,990
alibaba.com

189
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:45,509
we three I saw three identical

190
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:49,290
identities use Allen turn Li Xiaolong

191
00:09:45,509 --> 00:09:52,019
and Kim magician all of them were based

192
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:53,730
in Singapore two of them were in the

193
00:09:52,019 --> 00:09:58,680
city of ginger powe

194
00:09:53,730 --> 00:10:01,529
one city of Singapore and two with phone

195
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:05,420
numbers from Singapore and one with a

196
00:10:01,529 --> 00:10:09,029
phone number registered with China

197
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:11,160
looking into the names Allen turn is a

198
00:10:09,029 --> 00:10:14,040
famous Singaporean actor though other

199
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:16,560
people could take his name Lygia along

200
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:20,370
is the native name of the famous martial

201
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:22,170
artist and actor Bruce Lee and Kings

202
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:24,240
usually is possibly a researcher with

203
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:27,180
India Philip Duke University Medical

204
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:29,069
Center in the u.s. so a lot of people

205
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:31,138
will try and just take other people's

206
00:10:29,069 --> 00:10:36,000
names because making up names can be

207
00:10:31,139 --> 00:10:38,790
quite difficult so what we need to do

208
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,809
next is just continually improve and

209
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:43,349
research this

210
00:10:39,809 --> 00:10:45,990
we're still working in-house to get make

211
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:50,880
it more solid so that we can definitely

212
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:54,000
say that these domains are malicious

213
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:56,700
other things that limitations on Nexus

214
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,010
due to GDP are who is is becoming less

215
00:10:56,700 --> 00:11:01,590
effective because it no longer shares

216
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:06,030
email addresses physical addresses of

217
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:07,520
the registrants so we can now instead we

218
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:10,920
try and pivoting more on SSL

219
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:14,850
certificates through census main service

220
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:19,199
as well so and also the Registrar used

221
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:24,020
so we saw a registrar service like in

222
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:26,610
Jolla it's a privacy based service so it

223
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:30,270
does all the transactions within Bitcoin

224
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:32,730
it try and keeps everything private so

225
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:39,150
we can say that people who uses that use

226
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:43,650
that or not well that can be a little

227
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:49,230
bit malicious so one thing we did see

228
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:55,160
was a national a state actor using that

229
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:55,160
register service and thank you very much

230
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:58,819
[Applause]
