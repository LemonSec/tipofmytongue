going to be delivering my talk from noob

3
00:00:05,069 --> 00:00:10,679
delete CTF story so this talk is going

4
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:12,329
to be about how caption flag

5
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:14,849
competitions are used to reinforce

6
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:17,670
security learning and a positive that

7
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:19,680
fun and friendly way and as a how CTF

8
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:21,720
have helped me as an individual trying

9
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,210
to break industry create that career

10
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:27,150
path for me

11
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:29,609
um so Who am I my name is Sofia I've

12
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:31,140
just completed my second year of cyber

13
00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:34,140
security management at Bournemouth

14
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:35,790
University I'm the vice president of the

15
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:39,030
Bournemouth University cyber security

16
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:40,800
society where we have over 120 paid

17
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:43,500
members and we run ethical hacking

18
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,149
sessions about twice a week I'm the

19
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:47,370
student ambassador for cyber security

20
00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:48,719
challenge UK of which I'm quite active

21
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:51,390
or I complete a lot of competitive

22
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:53,550
competitions with them I'm the ex Team

23
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:55,530
UK representative for the European cyber

24
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:59,190
security challenge of which we travelled

25
00:00:55,530 --> 00:01:00,870
to Malaga to last year and I've just won

26
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:03,890
the best new security blog in the

27
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:07,200
European cybersecurity blogging Awards

28
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:09,030
so what is this easier what are capture

29
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,490
the flag competitions so these

30
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:13,049
competitions are where players compete

31
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:14,820
with each other in different security

32
00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:16,650
challenges that reflect the current

33
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:18,689
security challenges we actually face in

34
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:21,060
real life so this can be anything from

35
00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:23,250
crypto challenges to where packing

36
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:25,530
memory forensics or anything down to

37
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:27,000
lock-picking as well you can also have

38
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:29,189
attacked defense coverage of flag

39
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,280
competitions where people literally hack

40
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:34,289
each other it's great fun and basically

41
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:36,150
you find flags by solving challenges

42
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:38,189
every time you solve a challenge you get

43
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:40,860
some sort of code or string which we

44
00:01:38,189 --> 00:01:42,508
trade in for points so when I first

45
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:45,990
heard about capturing flag competitions

46
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:48,299
I had no idea what this was all I knew

47
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:50,548
that I was having my time in academia

48
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:52,170
where I study a management course and I

49
00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:54,329
wanted to make my technical skills

50
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:58,530
better so that's where I came across the

51
00:01:54,329 --> 00:02:00,419
city of competitions so who are these

52
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:02,430
people that compete and capture the flag

53
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:05,700
competitions well we are the keyboard

54
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:07,979
warriors basically the competitions that

55
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:10,020
I do there enter University challenges

56
00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:11,100
where people meet up in a physical

57
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:13,530
location

58
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:15,150
they compete in these competitions so

59
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:17,610
the ones that I have been doing are run

60
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:19,290
by cyber security challenge UK and which

61
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:21,600
thought of all these universities meet

62
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:24,570
our location and we do a competition

63
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:26,609
on-site our online and offline

64
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:29,190
challenges as well for CTF

65
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:31,290
offline ones are very popular as you can

66
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:33,540
do them remotely from home and they go

67
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:35,010
globally as well thousands and thousands

68
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:38,579
of teams compete in these kind of

69
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:40,380
competitions so CTF competitions they're

70
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:43,200
not only for script kiddies or noobs

71
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:45,210
like me there's they have industry level

72
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,980
competitions as well I've just returned

73
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:48,990
for a competition in Dublin where

74
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:51,030
there's been industry level CTF there

75
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:52,770
and also companies do in-house

76
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:54,960
competitions as well to help their

77
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:56,460
employees sort of better their skill

78
00:02:54,960 --> 00:03:00,650
sets and as you engage where they have

79
00:02:56,460 --> 00:03:00,650
to learn more in their current job roles

80
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:06,420
so it's more than a competition

81
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:08,640
absolutely it's a part of security

82
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:10,859
culture it's a part of being a part of

83
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,899
this community where you can have a

84
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:15,180
friends lean on you can reach out for

85
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:17,550
help when I first joined cyber I

86
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:19,440
literally knew nothing I knew no one and

87
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:21,630
I didn't learn it very quickly it's a

88
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,730
wonderful community to be a part of a

89
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:25,920
supportive and friendly community as

90
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:28,500
well even if I just send out a tweet

91
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:30,390
asking for help someone will get back to

92
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:32,010
me eventually if I'm at a competition

93
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:34,260
where you're supposed to be out for each

94
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:36,450
other's blood to get these flags to win

95
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:38,340
the competition there will be someone

96
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:40,619
there that wants to help you to help you

97
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:43,170
kind of get those flags to get those

98
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:45,720
points and when I first joined cyber I

99
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:47,549
was told that you have to network if you

100
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:50,280
want to do well you have to create that

101
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:52,560
community make those connections so when

102
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:54,180
you break into industry you have someone

103
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,940
to lean on you have someone to reach out

104
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:59,160
to and absolutely these competitions can

105
00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:01,350
be used for these as well these

106
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:03,540
competitions have done more than just be

107
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:05,640
a competition it makes it forces you to

108
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:07,859
learn on the day as well obviously

109
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:09,600
everyone wants to win if you come across

110
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:11,400
something you don't know about you roll

111
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:13,290
there and then google it trust me

112
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:15,690
because we want to when you want to get

113
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:17,700
those flags you want to get those points

114
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:20,130
and I've made so many friends and like

115
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:22,048
connections as I said beforehand some of

116
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:22,650
these competitions are sponsored by big

117
00:04:22,048 --> 00:04:25,530
names

118
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:27,570
Amazon Deloitte and usually they are at

119
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:29,940
these competitions so to be able to go

120
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:31,919
up to these big name companies to make

121
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:33,719
yourself known to make your mark in

122
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:36,060
industry before you've even maybe gone

123
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:38,340
into industry is an absolutely brilliant

124
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:40,590
opportunity and also to meet other

125
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:42,989
like-minded students are the like-minded

126
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:45,210
individuals I know so many people now

127
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:47,699
all over the country from all kind of

128
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:50,400
universities and backgrounds but I know

129
00:04:47,699 --> 00:04:51,960
will help me if I ever get stuck or if

130
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:57,690
we just want a coffee just to kind of

131
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:59,849
catch up as well so final thoughts as

132
00:04:57,690 --> 00:05:02,760
well these ethical hacking competitions

133
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:05,010
have taught me more of just as much as

134
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:07,650
the University coming from a

135
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:08,880
cybersecurity management course I didn't

136
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:10,830
have a lot of technical skills

137
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:13,020
whatsoever I didn't even know how to

138
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:15,120
install Kali I didn't know what SQL

139
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:16,740
injection was I didn't know what nmap

140
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,050
was it's just a bunch of letters to me

141
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:21,120
so to be able to supplement my

142
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:23,340
university education in the management

143
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,169
and business side and to make myself a

144
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:28,260
more balanced well-rounded industry

145
00:05:25,169 --> 00:05:30,299
professional bio so aiding my kind of

146
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:32,010
technical side nurturing those technical

147
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:34,260
skills so I can understand the both

148
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:36,930
sides of cyber is absolutely brilliant

149
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:38,820
and I can't recommend that enough and it

150
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:41,669
also aid non techie people to break into

151
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:44,250
industry as I mentioned I was rich I

152
00:05:41,669 --> 00:05:46,590
really was a noob I'm not joking before

153
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:49,169
I started doing these CTF competitions I

154
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:51,989
had no idea about technical stuff and

155
00:05:49,169 --> 00:05:53,760
these competitions allowed me to kind of

156
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:56,699
ease into the technical side of cyber

157
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:58,349
because as I said people will help you

158
00:05:56,699 --> 00:06:00,419
and a lot of these challenges are set

159
00:05:58,349 --> 00:06:01,050
out people knew breaking into industry

160
00:06:00,419 --> 00:06:04,198
as well

161
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:05,699
I personally in my society we have a lot

162
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:07,979
of people coming from non-technical

163
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:10,380
backgrounds a lot of people that do law

164
00:06:07,979 --> 00:06:12,599
or they do psychology and they've come

165
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:14,370
up to me saying how great it was to be

166
00:06:12,599 --> 00:06:16,979
able to be part of this community from

167
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:20,190
the get-go and as I mentioned before

168
00:06:16,979 --> 00:06:22,320
quite a lot expand those networks make

169
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:25,229
those connections make this vital kind

170
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:27,599
of like foundations for you as a person

171
00:06:25,229 --> 00:06:30,270
trying to break into cyber I knew no one

172
00:06:27,599 --> 00:06:33,000
I had no idea where I was going a year

173
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:34,330
ago and now a year later after I've been

174
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,639
to all these

175
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:38,889
after I went to my first competition I

176
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:40,659
can now say that I have got quite a good

177
00:06:38,889 --> 00:06:42,580
network which I can reach out to and

178
00:06:40,659 --> 00:06:43,990
those who help other people bring into

179
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:46,359
industry by introducing them to my

180
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:48,280
connections and these competitions

181
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:50,710
they're not a small thing they are

182
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:53,378
global and they have a global impact on

183
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:55,479
the industry as I said especially with

184
00:06:53,379 --> 00:06:57,849
the online competitions anyone can join

185
00:06:55,479 --> 00:07:00,128
into it and the recent competition that

186
00:06:57,849 --> 00:07:02,590
I did do was Neverland where my team

187
00:07:00,129 --> 00:07:04,479
came top 30 globally and that was an

188
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:06,969
absolute brilliant experience but I sued

189
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:08,530
because you can you are going against a

190
00:07:06,969 --> 00:07:11,169
lot of people from all kind of

191
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:12,698
backgrounds across the globe it's not

192
00:07:11,169 --> 00:07:17,500
just a small thing it's definitely a

193
00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:20,080
large global thing so thank you very
