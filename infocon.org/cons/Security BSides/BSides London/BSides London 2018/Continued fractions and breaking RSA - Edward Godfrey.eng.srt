1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,799
hi so I'm going to talk about RSA which

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:07,230
is a pretty old kind of public key

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:09,179
cryptosystem and about Venus attack

4
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:10,679
which can have breaks this crypto system

5
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:13,559
if the parameters aren't set up quite

6
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:15,389
right I'm going to talk a little bit

7
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:17,099
about the maths involved in it that I'm

8
00:00:15,389 --> 00:00:18,960
gonna try not to get too bogged down in

9
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:20,520
the details and if you want to learn

10
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:24,480
more I'm happy to talk more about it

11
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:27,869
kind of after the talk so what's her

12
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:30,390
assay and it was invented in 1973 but

13
00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:32,180
kept private and then was kind of

14
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:35,730
rediscovered and announced publicly in

15
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:38,579
1977 so in cryptography terms this is

16
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:41,879
essentially ancient predates both Linux

17
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:43,860
and Windows but it's still used quite a

18
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:47,640
lot today in kind of establishing SSL

19
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:49,379
connections so in cryptography you have

20
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,030
the split between kind of private key

21
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:54,210
and public key cryptosystems

22
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:56,399
so for a private key cryptosystem if say

23
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:58,379
your I want to communicate we have the

24
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:00,289
same key to do so so it's the same key

25
00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:02,789
for encrypting and decrypting messages

26
00:01:00,289 --> 00:01:04,619
whereas for a public key cryptosystem

27
00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:06,360
there's kind of some part of the key

28
00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:08,580
that's public and that's given out to

29
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:10,950
everyone so I could like put it up on

30
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:12,990
the board here and then some part of the

31
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:14,850
key that's private and the idea is that

32
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:17,520
anyone that has the public part of the

33
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:19,080
key can encrypt messages but only only

34
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:23,310
me only the person with the private key

35
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:25,740
can decrypt them and so here are the

36
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:27,540
parameters for RSA and if you've seen it

37
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:29,880
before this might be a bit of a reminder

38
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:32,150
if not kind of don't worry you don't

39
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:34,798
need to know the details for this talk

40
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:37,020
the information in blue there is the

41
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:39,840
part of the key that's public and the

42
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:42,390
information in red and pink are the part

43
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,280
of the key that must be kept private so

44
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:47,040
can everyone has the stuff in blue but

45
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:50,189
only the person who owns this key has

46
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,810
the stuff in red and this is an example

47
00:01:50,189 --> 00:01:54,809
of Koeppel encryption and decryption

48
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:57,420
work in the system so you can see that

49
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:58,560
encryption only uses the public part of

50
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:01,200
the key it only uses the blue

51
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:03,630
information and the idea is that it

52
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,549
should be difficult to do the kind of

53
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:08,068
inverse of that encryption react

54
00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:08,899
encryption operation just with the

55
00:02:08,068 --> 00:02:10,728
information as

56
00:02:08,899 --> 00:02:12,530
like but if you have some extra

57
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:15,230
information if you have the decryption

58
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:21,140
key this can kind of unlock it can

59
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:24,290
reverse this encryption so now let's

60
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:27,260
talk about Venus attack and this is also

61
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:30,828
a pretty old attack it's discovered in

62
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:32,989
1989 in an academic paper so this

63
00:02:30,829 --> 00:02:35,480
doesn't quite predate Windows it's still

64
00:02:32,989 --> 00:02:38,420
predates Linux and so it's been around

65
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:42,290
for ages and it applies when the

66
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:46,518
decryption key is small but kind of not

67
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:48,319
very small and it lets you go from the

68
00:02:46,519 --> 00:02:50,569
public information so that information

69
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:53,560
had in blue to kind of get the private

70
00:02:50,569 --> 00:02:55,909
key which you shouldn't be able to do

71
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:58,220
it's kind of worth talking about why

72
00:02:55,909 --> 00:03:00,530
you'd ever want to have a small

73
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:02,810
decryption key and you might kind of

74
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:04,189
reasonably say well we won't have as big

75
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:06,290
a key as possible because that makes it

76
00:03:04,189 --> 00:03:08,959
more secure

77
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:11,569
so one motivating example is for smart

78
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:13,639
cards and these devices are kind of

79
00:03:11,569 --> 00:03:16,089
pretty low-power devices and they often

80
00:03:13,639 --> 00:03:18,980
need to perform cryptographic operations

81
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:21,440
and kind of signing a message in a

82
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:23,540
public key cryptosystem is the same as

83
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:25,310
it's the same primitive as decrypting a

84
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:28,429
message so that's something that you

85
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:31,280
might want to make fast so one idea you

86
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:33,260
might have is oh well we can put a small

87
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,209
decryption key on and as long as it's

88
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:37,970
like pretty big it still must be secure

89
00:03:35,209 --> 00:03:40,129
and this attack basically says that this

90
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:43,579
is a terrible idea and will completely

91
00:03:40,129 --> 00:03:45,108
break your security the other place this

92
00:03:43,579 --> 00:03:47,720
comes up which is where I found out

93
00:03:45,109 --> 00:03:49,909
about this attack is in CTFs and so

94
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:52,099
sometimes CTFs have kind of challenges

95
00:03:49,909 --> 00:03:54,500
where you break various RSA parameters

96
00:03:52,099 --> 00:03:57,198
and this tends to be a kind of somewhat

97
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:58,760
popular attack that comes up and I think

98
00:03:57,199 --> 00:04:01,669
because it doesn't require too much code

99
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:03,409
right cool

100
00:04:01,669 --> 00:04:06,310
so let's talk about kind of the maths

101
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:09,798
behind this that makes it work and I

102
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:11,690
hope I don't bore you too much so it

103
00:04:09,799 --> 00:04:13,940
relies quite heavily on this concept

104
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:15,560
called continued fractions which is a

105
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:17,029
way of taking a number and kind of

106
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:19,459
breaking it down into a chain of

107
00:04:17,029 --> 00:04:21,000
fractions I'll kind of go through how

108
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:22,500
you compute this and

109
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,360
and then show you what it looks like and

110
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,310
explain some of the properties that make

111
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:29,010
this useful

112
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:30,720
so for computing this you kind of take

113
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:33,659
the number you start with so we'll go

114
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:36,030
through it with PI and you break it into

115
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:38,040
the integer part and the fractional part

116
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:40,020
so I could have written that up there

117
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:41,580
with the thing in orange is the integer

118
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:44,010
part and the thing on the right is the

119
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:45,930
fractional part and then we do can have

120
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:48,990
one over the fractional parts and kind

121
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:50,340
of do the same thing again so if we do

122
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:51,960
this we kind of get some of the looks

123
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:53,969
like that and again we're breaking it

124
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:57,030
into the integer part and the fraction

125
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:59,220
part and we kind of keep going forever

126
00:04:57,030 --> 00:05:01,500
and if you kind of put this together

127
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:03,950
into one big expression it ends up

128
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:06,870
looking like this slightly scary thing

129
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:08,909
so this might seem like a strange thing

130
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:12,540
to do but it turns out this construction

131
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:15,150
has quite a few nice properties so one

132
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:17,160
thing we can do with this is we can kind

133
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:19,650
of get rid of everything that kind of

134
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:21,180
comes after a plus sign so that's like

135
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:23,159
when we got one of those intermediate

136
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:25,620
values just taking the integer part and

137
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:27,570
throwing away the fractional part so

138
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:29,310
this gives us sub expressions that look

139
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:31,980
like these where it kind of only goes

140
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:35,160
down to a certain point and we can kind

141
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:37,310
of so these are the same things but kind

142
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:39,900
of evaluate it as single fractions and

143
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:41,490
this gives us a series of fractions

144
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:45,330
called the convergence for the number

145
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:47,940
and so these have some nice properties

146
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:52,260
if we look at what these are is kind of

147
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:54,270
actual decimals we get these so if

148
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:56,130
you're kind of familiar with the

149
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:58,200
expansion of Pi or remember that from a

150
00:05:56,130 --> 00:06:00,120
couple of slides ago you'll see that

151
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:03,630
these are tending towards PI pretty

152
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:05,430
quickly and it turns out that this is

153
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:07,260
like a really good way to get a series

154
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:10,830
of fractions that get close for that can

155
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:12,659
be you started with so these fractions

156
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:16,169
get close and it turns out the kind of

157
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:17,880
the opposite way around holds so if you

158
00:06:16,169 --> 00:06:20,940
have a fraction that's pretty close to

159
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:25,229
some number then it must come from this

160
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:30,450
sequence so the precise condition is

161
00:06:25,229 --> 00:06:32,729
there but kind of one way to put this in

162
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:34,349
words with other details is if the

163
00:06:32,729 --> 00:06:36,300
fraction is close

164
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:38,640
the denominator of the fraction isn't

165
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:40,110
too big then it must be coming from the

166
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:43,289
sequence which you get from the

167
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:45,630
continued fraction expansion so kind of

168
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:48,150
taking that same result but phrasing it

169
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:51,270
a bit more like an attacker if there's

170
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:54,659
some fraction which like you know and I

171
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:57,120
don't but I know this other number that

172
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:58,980
is pretty close to then I can find out

173
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:01,290
the fraction you know by taking the

174
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:03,030
number I know working out all of the

175
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:05,610
continued fraction expressions from it

176
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:09,570
and kind of one of those fractions I get

177
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:12,080
must be the thing that you had so this

178
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:15,480
is pretty much how viñas attack works

179
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:17,820
so to understand Veena's attack we need

180
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:22,140
to dig a bit more into the details of

181
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:25,110
those parameters so the decryption key

182
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:28,229
in RSA is to find to be the inverse of

183
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:30,570
something in the public key and what

184
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:33,180
that means technically is there some

185
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:36,719
integer K such that that expression

186
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:39,270
there holds now that's not that useful

187
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:41,490
to us at the moment because we kind of

188
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:43,289
know the thing in blue there but we

189
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:45,780
don't know the other parameters which

190
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:50,160
all in red but we can do some

191
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:51,780
rearranging of this so that top

192
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,490
expression is what I just showed you

193
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:55,789
that holds from the definition of the

194
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:58,560
decryption key

195
00:07:55,790 --> 00:08:02,100
if we divide through we get something

196
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:03,840
that looks like that so that fraction on

197
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:06,390
the right hand side is something that we

198
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,770
kind of love to discover because the

199
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:10,950
bottom part of it gives us the

200
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:13,020
decryption key for the system the

201
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:15,360
left-hand side we kind of know the top

202
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:19,500
half of that fraction but we don't know

203
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:22,980
the bottom half but it's pretty close

204
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:24,930
5n is pretty close to N so that fraction

205
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:27,840
on the left hand side is pretty close to

206
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:29,910
e over N so now we have this expression

207
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:32,579
where there's some fraction on the right

208
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:34,200
hand side which we don't know and

209
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:37,169
there's something on the left-hand side

210
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:39,570
which is all in blue so that's all part

211
00:08:37,169 --> 00:08:42,539
of the public key so we do know that and

212
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:44,130
they're pretty close and it turns out

213
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:46,829
that if the decryption key is small

214
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:47,650
enough then that result from the theory

215
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:50,890
of continued Frank

216
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:53,500
holts so we can work out that fraction

217
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:55,120
on the right hand side by taking the

218
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:57,250
thing on the left hand side which we

219
00:08:55,120 --> 00:09:00,010
know taking its continued fraction

220
00:08:57,250 --> 00:09:01,690
expression and kind of checking all of

221
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:04,810
the results we get to see if they're

222
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:08,200
right which is pretty much exactly how

223
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:10,569
venus attack works to do this we need

224
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:14,529
some way of checking if our guess is

225
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:17,830
correct so because this is a public key

226
00:09:14,529 --> 00:09:19,839
cryptosystem we can just kind of encrypt

227
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:22,270
some messages and see if the result we

228
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:24,700
get for D works to decrypt them or

229
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:26,949
there's a slightly more kind of fiddly

230
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:29,650
way of using both parts of that fraction

231
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:33,820
to kind of solve for the parameters used

232
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:37,089
to generate the private key so here's

233
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:38,860
like a small example of this attack so

234
00:09:37,089 --> 00:09:42,010
we have that up there which is the

235
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:43,870
public key which we know and I've kind

236
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:45,640
of written down what the first few

237
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:48,610
fractions you get from that continued

238
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:50,260
fraction for a over an R and then we can

239
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:52,360
kind of go through those and just check

240
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:55,180
if one of them gives a reasonable guess

241
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:57,010
for K over D so if you kind of do that

242
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:58,510
and do the thing of encrypting some

243
00:09:57,010 --> 00:10:01,540
messages and seeing if you can decrypt

244
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:05,110
them you find out D equals three works

245
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:07,089
this example so this is kind of a small

246
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:10,630
example and you could probably have kind

247
00:10:07,089 --> 00:10:13,660
of just check some small keys anyway

248
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:16,779
I don't know how well that shows up but

249
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:19,510
this is an example I tried with a kind

250
00:10:16,779 --> 00:10:22,450
of proper RSA keys so this is around

251
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:30,760
4,000 bits long with the decryption key

252
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:33,370
that's 300 bits long and yeah so this is

253
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:35,200
a quick quick Python script I wrote and

254
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:38,920
it's able to kind of crack the

255
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:41,700
decryption key in around I think it was

256
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:44,380
52 seconds so around a minute

257
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:46,300
whereas kind of brute forcing all of the

258
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:50,189
possible decryption keys below two to

259
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:53,589
the 300 would take essentially forever

260
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:55,490
so yeah a little bit of maths can

261
00:10:53,589 --> 00:10:58,490
completely break your security and this

262
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:59,779
yes I'm pretty confident this attack

263
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:03,139
could be made quicker if it was

264
00:10:59,779 --> 00:11:04,610
optimized as well so the codes don't get

265
00:11:03,139 --> 00:11:08,179
help if you're interested and want to

266
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:09,980
kind of dig into how it works I'm not

267
00:11:08,179 --> 00:11:12,339
sure what the moral of this is except

268
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:16,339
don't use a small decryption key for RSA

269
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:18,529
and sometimes you think you're secure

270
00:11:16,339 --> 00:11:21,940
and then results from maths completely

271
00:11:18,529 --> 00:11:27,019
break what you have Thanks

272
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:27,019
[Applause]
