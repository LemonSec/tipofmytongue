1
00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:05,430
hey everyone as already been mentioned

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:06,240
this is one year insecurity what's that

3
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:08,730
thing called again

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,920
I'm Joel Potts and if you really want to

5
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:14,130
you can find me on Twitter I'm at your

6
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:16,859
pots UK and this isn't going to be a

7
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:19,980
technical talk but what I'm going to

8
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:22,920
talk about is my first year in security

9
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:27,060
some some of the things I found

10
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:28,890
difficult such as cram learning maybe

11
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:31,619
even touch on some things I enjoyed and

12
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:33,149
we'll see what happens so this is my

13
00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:34,920
first time speaking at a conference I'd

14
00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:37,649
like to say a big thank you to B sides

15
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:41,040
and to NIC trade should be my mentor and

16
00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:43,140
so let's get on with that so first of

17
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:45,809
all a little bit a little bit about me

18
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:48,000
on my professional side I'm a security

19
00:00:45,809 --> 00:00:51,089
analyst at the NATO Communications and

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,570
Information Agency I've got a couple of

21
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:58,140
son certificates the G SEC and the G CH

22
00:00:54,570 --> 00:01:00,210
and hopefully soon the GCF a got a

23
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:04,530
couple of other certificates as well the

24
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:08,010
CCNA cyber ops and the xry certification

25
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:11,130
for mobile forensics you'll notice on

26
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:12,689
screen I've got two degrees Bachelor of

27
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:17,039
Arts in English in Spanish and English

28
00:01:12,689 --> 00:01:19,380
and the BSC in intelligence is curry the

29
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:25,580
reason for that is the Spanish one

30
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:27,570
didn't go so well so about me personally

31
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:30,090
unfortunately I don't have sweet

32
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:32,279
nunchuck skills or sweet bow hunting

33
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:35,009
skills I've got some computer hacking

34
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:37,079
skills because remember girls want

35
00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:39,650
boyfriends who have got sweet skills

36
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:39,649
gosh

37
00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:48,670
so I also like to do online CTFs such as

38
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:50,619
the ones on hack the box root me and our

39
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:55,270
immersive labs has been mentioned in the

40
00:01:50,619 --> 00:01:56,740
previous presentation alongside that I

41
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:59,020
like to play my home lab build things

42
00:01:56,740 --> 00:02:01,119
break things see how things work just

43
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:04,000
get to grips with stuff I don't normally

44
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:07,140
get chance to outside of the secure east

45
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,119
side of things and my personal life I

46
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:12,310
like to go rock climbing when I can I'm

47
00:02:10,119 --> 00:02:15,310
a Tottenham Hotspur funds please don't

48
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:19,390
bill and doesn't that I spend time with

49
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:21,640
my family and friends so let's move on

50
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:24,309
to my journey whilst it all looks very

51
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:26,440
nice and neat up there going through it

52
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:28,239
it wasn't really a lot of it was all

53
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:31,799
over the place when at the same time

54
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:34,630
overlapping here they're everywhere

55
00:02:31,799 --> 00:02:37,480
so let's start at the beginning of this

56
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:41,430
journey in I was working in open-source

57
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:45,880
intelligence during my first degree and

58
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:48,970
it was cool and then after graduating I

59
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:52,320
continued working in Olson and this is

60
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:54,489
where I developed an interest in InfoSec

61
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:57,400
looking at how I can go into it more

62
00:02:54,489 --> 00:02:59,500
technically and it was also here that a

63
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:01,840
co-worker gave me the heads up about the

64
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:04,090
Sun cyber retraining Academy so I

65
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:06,910
thought what the hell I applied didn't

66
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:09,370
really expect to hear back then I went

67
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:12,030
back to work I went back to waiting and

68
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:15,459
waiting and waiting still in here much

69
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:17,920
and then one day out of the blue I was

70
00:03:15,459 --> 00:03:20,500
on Christmas leave I was at my

71
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:21,819
girlfriend's house home alone didn't

72
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,680
have any contact I know no-one was

73
00:03:21,819 --> 00:03:25,798
replying to me it was really really

74
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:28,989
boring that they this email came through

75
00:03:25,799 --> 00:03:32,260
and said congrats you've been accepted

76
00:03:28,989 --> 00:03:33,400
so I did what any sane person would do

77
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:37,090
and I started dancing with the cap

78
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:39,329
because no one was talking to me and

79
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:39,329
then

80
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:47,990
so before I got into the cyber training

81
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:50,569
academy I did have to go through a phone

82
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:54,380
interview some technical skills tests

83
00:03:50,569 --> 00:03:55,519
face to face interview but I can

84
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:57,920
definitely say it was worth it and if it

85
00:03:55,520 --> 00:04:03,380
pops up again let people know about it

86
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:05,179
spread the word so before that when I

87
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:09,640
went back to work before starting the

88
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:12,050
Academy handed in my notice to say I

89
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:13,850
didn't really know what to expect

90
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:15,950
didn't know what was coming afterwards

91
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:18,620
didn't really know what I'd do for work

92
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:22,789
would I get work in the industry who

93
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:24,410
knows so I started a blog about my

94
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:26,030
experiences so even if I didn't end up

95
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:28,730
doing anything with it I'd have

96
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:32,630
something to look back on just to sort

97
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:34,880
of remember it for myself but everything

98
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:36,680
turned out all right in the end towards

99
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:38,750
the end of the Academy the job search

100
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:41,150
ramped up I wasn't really get much

101
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:43,250
feedback at the start of that because I

102
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:44,750
didn't yet have the qualifications but

103
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:47,180
when the G second did you say H

104
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:49,700
certificates come in people start

105
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:51,979
responding but not it was a real

106
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:53,719
confidence boost considering before when

107
00:04:51,979 --> 00:04:55,940
I applied for stuff just got the

108
00:04:53,720 --> 00:05:01,250
standard you know got a lot lot of

109
00:04:55,940 --> 00:05:04,430
applicants at this time sorry in

110
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:06,110
addition to this having the G SEC the G

111
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:08,630
say age I also made it onto the GI

112
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:11,419
advisory board mailing list so I did

113
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:13,130
well in one of the exams which complete

114
00:05:11,419 --> 00:05:16,580
surprise have shift to bits with that

115
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:18,710
and then I got offered my current

116
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:21,140
position where unfortunately I haven't

117
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:23,539
had the time to be able to study as much

118
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:25,909
or as intensively as it was during the

119
00:05:23,539 --> 00:05:29,479
Academy which kind of went from going up

120
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:31,010
here to down here sort of tempo wise but

121
00:05:29,479 --> 00:05:34,010
I managed to do some more courses I did

122
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:35,030
the CCNA cyber ops which Cisco was

123
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:40,460
shelling out for free

124
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:43,869
and I also did the four-five away on the

125
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:46,460
work-study program with sons and

126
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:49,070
recently I also finished my degree

127
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:50,880
second one and I did a lot better this

128
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:54,599
time

129
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:56,919
but how did it feel like well I think

130
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:58,810
SpongeBob and Patrick summing up pretty

131
00:05:56,919 --> 00:06:01,060
well right there there's a lot of

132
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:02,740
screaming it really was an emotional

133
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:06,040
roller coaster with the UPS the Downs

134
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:08,410
the loop-de-loops sideways this way all

135
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:11,350
over the place the stress the excitement

136
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:14,860
the apathy at times was it really worth

137
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:16,150
it being here yeah the wanting to give

138
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:24,160
up coming off the back of that and the

139
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:28,198
loneliness all I can say is it was worth

140
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:30,669
it this cross-training

141
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:35,940
really got me somewhere that I want it

142
00:06:30,669 --> 00:06:37,960
to be so whilst I did work in Austin I

143
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:41,949
managed to study a little bit in a

144
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:45,638
little bit often and that was good it

145
00:06:41,949 --> 00:06:47,320
was sort of an introduction and the

146
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:48,669
further I got into it I could see this

147
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:50,280
mountain and mountain of knowledge in

148
00:06:48,669 --> 00:06:53,109
front of me that I had to take in and

149
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:55,659
that was the first hurdle understanding

150
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:57,610
that when you do cross train in your

151
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:59,770
hard disks essentially full and you need

152
00:06:57,610 --> 00:07:02,470
to get rid of some clutter to make way

153
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:03,609
for this new information the second

154
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:06,669
hurdle to borrow from running

155
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:08,260
terminology again hitting the wall this

156
00:07:06,669 --> 00:07:09,820
knowledge builds up you see it growing

157
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:11,289
growing and growing you're gonna hit the

158
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:14,110
wall and you're gonna want to stop give

159
00:07:11,289 --> 00:07:17,590
up go home go back to what you want what

160
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:20,310
you did before well you know so then as

161
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:23,349
you progress you get back into it again

162
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:26,470
you hit the third hurdle you see that

163
00:07:23,349 --> 00:07:28,570
the more you know and the more you learn

164
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:30,190
the more you realize that you don't know

165
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:33,039
this mountain just keeps getting bigger

166
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:35,380
and then you realize it's not gonna be a

167
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:38,070
quick and easy thing to cross train into

168
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:41,219
an industry and speaking of quick things

169
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:44,949
I'd like to talk about cram learning now

170
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:46,530
so as mentioned previously when I

171
00:07:44,949 --> 00:07:49,000
started I did a little bit and often

172
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:52,138
awesome then when I started the sons

173
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:54,760
side of things it was a bit old water

174
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:58,630
this water via a head in front of the

175
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:59,919
firehose moment and for anyone who

176
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:02,560
hasn't been on a sons course for a

177
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:03,650
simile fast pace of course that is

178
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:10,100
freedom

179
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:11,750
what it feels like if this crime

180
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:13,610
learning way of doing things was also

181
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:15,380
how I saw people study University how

182
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:18,020
I've seen people study at school you

183
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:19,729
study for an exam to pass that exam it's

184
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:21,710
also how I've prepared for interviews

185
00:08:19,729 --> 00:08:26,060
you look at the job spec and you study

186
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:28,190
you cram just for that but the problem

187
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:30,740
with this is how much do you really

188
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:32,360
retain I read this somewhere in some

189
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:34,820
marketing come from memory training up

190
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:36,229
but they said that after one hour people

191
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:38,150
retain less than a half of the

192
00:08:36,229 --> 00:08:41,779
information that was taught when they

193
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:44,360
were being I was taught whilst they were

194
00:08:41,779 --> 00:08:46,250
giving it after one day people forget

195
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:48,470
more than 70% of what was taught in

196
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:52,250
training and after six days to a week

197
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:55,190
it's up to 75% of the information that

198
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:56,839
was given that people don't remember so

199
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:58,670
what do you do when you've had all this

200
00:08:56,839 --> 00:09:02,990
information thrown at you when you get

201
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:06,490
the job well you look a little bit like

202
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:09,830
this to the first few weeks months maybe

203
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:12,560
that's how I felt I could do the job had

204
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:14,120
the qualls but ten weeks before I was

205
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:17,900
doing something completely different and

206
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:19,400
I felt like an imposter and this is when

207
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:21,699
I found out about impostor syndrome and

208
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:25,040
that did start to set in a little bit

209
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:28,790
only made worse by making little

210
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:31,849
mistakes now such as in my first meeting

211
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:34,099
with the sort of my team head DNS became

212
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:38,690
the resolution e protocol and was doing

213
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:41,060
zone transfers over over UDP not TCP and

214
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:43,220
let's forget about incremental zone

215
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:48,949
transfers for a minute but at the time

216
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:52,040
that felt really huge to me and that's

217
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:53,480
how I left that meeting I felt like an

218
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:55,880
idiot I know it's not the worst thing I

219
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:57,320
could have said but I still felt like

220
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:58,850
this for a while just those little

221
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:01,670
mistakes from not having had enough

222
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:03,890
exposure and enough time to learn the

223
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:10,040
material and it just kept building up

224
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:12,290
and it led me into trying to justify

225
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:15,620
myself trying to count these mistakes

226
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:17,040
take on extra work extra shifts overly

227
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:18,960
detailed tickets

228
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:21,420
reading more learning more trying to

229
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:22,920
overcome this rather than accept that it

230
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:26,160
was new and that these mistakes were

231
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:29,579
sort of expected and when I did realize

232
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:31,680
that ask him for help people you

233
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:35,790
co-workers more than likely unless

234
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:38,099
they're really awful tear will help but

235
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:41,640
I only realised this after I started to

236
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:44,370
get a bit ill with the stress the lack

237
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:48,330
of sleep and the fatigue setting in I

238
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:50,040
was heading the burnout in a sense so I

239
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:53,210
spoke to my support network my family my

240
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:56,459
friends and they told me that they were

241
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:59,280
proud of what I was doing not all of the

242
00:10:56,460 --> 00:11:00,990
extra work but I'd found something I had

243
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:04,740
a passion for and I was going for it

244
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:09,660
and eventually I just kind of got tired

245
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:11,570
and I learned to accept it and then once

246
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:13,829
I accepted it after a while I realized

247
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:18,000
everyone's a bit like this everyone

248
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:21,300
still makes mistakes and everyone's a

249
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,760
lot like this new types of traffic

250
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:26,939
Google quick blew my mind the first time

251
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:29,010
I saw I had to google it HTTP for an

252
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:30,120
eighth response for example just google

253
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:35,520
it you name it something goes down

254
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:39,120
Googler if you still can and that sort

255
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:40,650
of helped to ease my mind so I know this

256
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:46,230
hasn't been the most polished

257
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:48,480
presentation possible but let's say the

258
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:51,090
day after I had that conversation

259
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,860
my father sadly passed away so I know

260
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:57,900
what it's like when life gets in the way

261
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:59,130
of things and I felt I had to be here as

262
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:02,040
that was one of the sort of last things

263
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:03,990
we spoke about so to anyone getting into

264
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:06,240
the industry who's in here I just want

265
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:08,940
to say don't let these mistakes get in

266
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,740
your way a year down the line you'll

267
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:13,350
have made loads of mistakes but you'll

268
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:16,440
have learnt from them don't let these

269
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:17,970
mistakes make you do extra shifts get

270
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:21,570
yourself burnt out don't let it impact

271
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:24,060
your health and finally cybers a great

272
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:26,010
passion but when you start taking these

273
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:28,229
extra shifts and this extra work and it

274
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:29,939
starts to take care of your life

275
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:31,080
you don't get to see your family and

276
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:33,480
friends you don't get to do the things

277
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:38,100
you enjoy all those extra shifts worth

278
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:40,370
it thank you for listening does anyone

279
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:40,370
have any questions
