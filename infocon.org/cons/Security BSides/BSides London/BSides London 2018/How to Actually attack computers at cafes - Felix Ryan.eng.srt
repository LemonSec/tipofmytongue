2
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:06,060
so hi everyone I'm Felix I'm a freelance

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:07,770
pen tester I've been doing this for a

4
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:11,790
while now and breaking it to stuff you

5
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:13,678
know longer but yeah today I'm here to

6
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:17,009
talk to you about some work that I did

7
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:19,500
for my Master's dissertation essentially

8
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:21,210
I was told to always find a find a

9
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:24,000
project you go do some sort of mild

10
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:25,800
research and at the same time I had a

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,830
client that basically with you to take

12
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:31,140
my word for it they they told me that

13
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:33,390
they had lots of people who lived in

14
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:37,200
cafes and airports and hotels and stuff

15
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:38,280
using free Wi-Fi and open Wi-Fi and they

16
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,020
did nothing about it they they

17
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:41,250
essentially had all of the traffic just

18
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:43,950
going across the internet and and it

19
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:45,120
worried me and and so the guy turn

20
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:46,739
around to me when I was telling him this

21
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,570
and said well can you can you prove it

22
00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:49,890
can you show me this and because

23
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:52,469
otherwise I'm gonna do nothing about it

24
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:53,969
I had a look around and I genuinely I

25
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:56,760
couldn't find a tool that really did

26
00:00:53,969 --> 00:01:00,899
anything that the business care about so

27
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:02,910
I started out by doing it myself the

28
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:04,110
work I'm about to show you relies quite

29
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:06,000
heavily on man-in-the-middle so just as

30
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:07,740
a recap for everyone who may or may not

31
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,350
know in the middle conditions are

32
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:11,490
essentially where you have a bit of

33
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:14,189
infrastructure where an attacker

34
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:15,600
controls it and can do stuff with the

35
00:01:14,189 --> 00:01:18,449
communication that's going back and

36
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:20,280
forth between legitimate user and as a

37
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:22,049
service so things you can do listen to

38
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:24,840
communication change the communication

39
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:28,290
or block the communication and so I

40
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:31,829
decided I was gonna basically make my

41
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:35,100
own Wi-Fi access point yeah and it

42
00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:37,500
steals some users creds by being a man

43
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:39,119
in the middle and then turn around to my

44
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:41,880
client and say well you know this is why

45
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:44,640
you need to do something about it at

46
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:46,500
this point in time I thought this is

47
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,560
gonna be easy you know why would it be

48
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:50,729
hard it's open Wi-Fi right anyway it

49
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:52,950
turns out encryption is a thing

50
00:01:50,729 --> 00:01:54,240
obviously I already knew this but it can

51
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:55,860
be done at lots of different places and

52
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,530
these days there's not that much in

53
00:01:55,860 --> 00:02:00,240
terms of plain text creds going around

54
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:02,549
the world it's usually encoded in

55
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:05,429
something encrypted somewhere and so

56
00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:06,600
that sort of proved very quickly to me

57
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:10,170
that I needed to do something a bit

58
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:12,959
different so the idea was to go from

59
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:14,159
this normal transaction to

60
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:15,840
a little bit more like this and I

61
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:17,429
already had a bit of a plan based on

62
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,900
some other work that I've seen and I

63
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:21,180
know is quite prevalent out there in the

64
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:22,920
world and essentially I do stuff down at

65
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:25,769
the bottom with this this pink bit here

66
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:28,828
is where the me as the attacker can I

67
00:02:25,769 --> 00:02:30,209
can do stuff as the man in the middle so

68
00:02:28,829 --> 00:02:33,120
what I actually did I took Wi-Fi

69
00:02:30,209 --> 00:02:34,769
pineapple and I set up a wireless

70
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,659
network and I thought I was pretty

71
00:02:34,769 --> 00:02:36,989
obvious with the name that I used you

72
00:02:36,659 --> 00:02:39,689
know

73
00:02:36,989 --> 00:02:43,200
don't touch it but people did anyway why

74
00:02:39,689 --> 00:02:45,900
not and so this is what it actually

75
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:47,339
looked like had a 4G modem my Wi-Fi

76
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:49,019
pineapple battery I wanted to prove to

77
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:52,760
my client that it was portable you could

78
00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:52,760
do it anywhere and it was nice and easy

79
00:02:52,819 --> 00:02:58,768
anyway so I I decided writing my tool so

80
00:02:57,629 --> 00:03:02,548
I had an idea of what I wanted to do

81
00:02:58,769 --> 00:03:04,680
with it all and so I I took somebody

82
00:03:02,549 --> 00:03:06,919
else's code frankly because it was easy

83
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:09,900
it worked and then I added stuff to it

84
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:12,060
and and I went through this process over

85
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:13,469
quite a long time of you know building a

86
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:15,209
bit and it worked a bit and then I would

87
00:03:13,469 --> 00:03:16,620
come up with a bug later and it'll tear

88
00:03:15,209 --> 00:03:18,359
my hair out and leaving it coming back

89
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:21,269
to it later you know a good software

90
00:03:18,359 --> 00:03:24,180
development lifecycle obviously but this

91
00:03:21,269 --> 00:03:27,000
is what it fundamentally does it is a

92
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:30,150
transparent proxy sat on top of the SMB

93
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,310
capture stack from responder and what it

94
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:35,840
does the bit that's important is it

95
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:37,409
inject an image tag in there in HTML

96
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,000
because then you I couldn't get

97
00:03:37,409 --> 00:03:40,560
plaintext creds so what I was going to

98
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,750
do instead is the next best thing and

99
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,849
get a net until M hashes so that I can

100
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:47,519
do cracking against those I call the

101
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:51,858
attack so evil twin authentication

102
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:54,419
capture because you know so windows off

103
00:03:51,859 --> 00:03:57,750
one of the things that you can do with

104
00:03:54,419 --> 00:04:00,870
windows off is basically use things like

105
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:02,879
Internet Explorer to do authentication

106
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:05,519
attempts against resources that you've

107
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:07,620
got in your control I was convinced that

108
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:10,470
it was really important for me to make

109
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:13,290
sure that this was done against as stock

110
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:14,728
windows as possible because I've seen

111
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:17,699
lots of presentations of similar nature

112
00:04:14,729 --> 00:04:18,989
that you kind of tweak things and move

113
00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:20,489
stuff around and make it really weak and

114
00:04:18,988 --> 00:04:22,508
then it works but I wanted this to be

115
00:04:20,488 --> 00:04:25,419
something more real than that

116
00:04:22,509 --> 00:04:26,650
so I didn't even install anything so no

117
00:04:25,419 --> 00:04:28,750
Firefox or anything along those lines

118
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:30,638
the only change I made to my victim

119
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:32,770
machines which you'll see in a bit is I

120
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:39,009
added them to an Active Directory domain

121
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:40,659
and sort of so to clarify what I'm

122
00:04:39,009 --> 00:04:43,060
trying to do is get Internet Explorer to

123
00:04:40,659 --> 00:04:46,000
authenticate against something and the

124
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:48,099
way that by stock it can do that is if

125
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,750
on the left hand side there you can see

126
00:04:48,099 --> 00:04:51,219
it says automatic logon only on internet

127
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:53,620
zone so if it thinks that it's part of

128
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:56,229
Internet it will do it and the Internet

129
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:59,139
is defined by this one on the right hand

130
00:04:56,229 --> 00:05:01,090
side which is essentially all sites that

131
00:04:59,139 --> 00:05:03,789
are explicitly listed as your Internet

132
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:06,250
in your internet zone all sites that

133
00:05:03,789 --> 00:05:09,099
bypass the proxy server and anything

134
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:11,860
that is a UNC path better known as the

135
00:05:09,099 --> 00:05:13,150
dot rule which essentially means you can

136
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:14,440
only do this against host names you

137
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:15,880
can't do it against IP addresses or

138
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:17,500
fully qualified domain names because

139
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:18,969
well they have a dot in them they're

140
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:22,659
obviously not part of your internet and

141
00:05:18,969 --> 00:05:24,219
so on so I realized very quickly I

142
00:05:22,659 --> 00:05:27,270
needed a DNS server that was under my

143
00:05:24,219 --> 00:05:30,159
control as well oh sorry go back one

144
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:32,229
this is what my attack structure ended

145
00:05:30,159 --> 00:05:34,479
up being so first of all you're on the

146
00:05:32,229 --> 00:05:37,770
Left you've got the the victim joins the

147
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:40,449
evil twin wireless network ask for DHCP

148
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:44,109
at least and it gets one from the

149
00:05:40,449 --> 00:05:46,419
attackers of attackers server and then

150
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:50,199
this bit here we've got two transactions

151
00:05:46,419 --> 00:05:52,389
really one both of them go through the

152
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:56,169
the web proxy but ones the requests and

153
00:05:52,389 --> 00:05:57,969
ones the response now on the way out I I

154
00:05:56,169 --> 00:05:59,440
do my best

155
00:05:57,969 --> 00:06:01,690
not exactly downgraded off but kind of

156
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:04,569
weakened the requests a little bit so

157
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:06,669
deal with certain headers that are in

158
00:06:04,569 --> 00:06:08,349
the HTTP transaction and a few other

159
00:06:06,669 --> 00:06:09,940
bits and pieces not so much like it has

160
00:06:08,349 --> 00:06:12,669
to sell stripping I wasn't interested in

161
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:15,639
that was trying to just make it easy

162
00:06:12,669 --> 00:06:18,279
frankly for me on the return path on the

163
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:19,960
return path I then do lots of things but

164
00:06:18,279 --> 00:06:21,969
one of them is inject that image tag

165
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:25,270
that I've showed you earlier and then

166
00:06:21,969 --> 00:06:27,099
obviously the next bit is the victim

167
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:28,900
machine needs to know where to send the

168
00:06:27,099 --> 00:06:31,800
next request so it has to do a DNS

169
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:35,789
lookup so it gets that and then here

170
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:38,759
in is where the SMB stack stuff from

171
00:06:35,789 --> 00:06:40,800
responder kicks in so it asks for a

172
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:42,930
resource it's told no you need to

173
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,550
authenticate first and then it oughtn't

174
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:47,669
Achatz and that's where the resource and

175
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:50,430
maybe get something back so that sounds

176
00:06:47,669 --> 00:06:53,370
like it should be brilliant right it

177
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:56,430
kind of works I'll explain why

178
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:58,669
first of all HTTP ER is a pain frankly

179
00:06:56,430 --> 00:07:01,650
there's quite a lot of variants in there

180
00:06:58,669 --> 00:07:03,599
so the Wi-Fi pineapple doesn't have a

181
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:06,690
lot of power to it so one of the things

182
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:08,130
I had to do was not go into just using

183
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:09,630
other people's libraries and click click

184
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:10,280
click done I had to write most of this

185
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:12,659
myself

186
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:14,489
and then there was status codes that

187
00:07:12,659 --> 00:07:16,080
kept coming up with problems I had no

188
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:20,610
idea I've never seen before like four on

189
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:22,229
six which is range not satisfiable or s

190
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:24,090
does that mean and then working through

191
00:07:22,229 --> 00:07:25,520
the different types of headers that I

192
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:28,919
spotted which were causing me problems

193
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:30,030
and and then normal error handler

194
00:07:28,919 --> 00:07:32,190
because you know sometimes people don't

195
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:33,539
finish a connection it just it dies for

196
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:35,880
whatever reason they can they escape it

197
00:07:33,539 --> 00:07:38,159
and then obviously there's differences

198
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:41,340
between transparent proxies and declared

199
00:07:38,159 --> 00:07:43,500
proxies sometimes one of the things that

200
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:45,780
I hadn't realized before hundreds of the

201
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:47,759
transparent proxies don't get explicitly

202
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:49,080
told what port to actually go and make

203
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:51,029
the request on because it's part of the

204
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:52,979
original transaction so if you're doing

205
00:07:51,029 --> 00:07:55,800
iptables manipulations you lose some of

206
00:07:52,979 --> 00:07:57,389
that information it's it's easy to kind

207
00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:00,150
of guess it but you have to code it all

208
00:07:57,389 --> 00:08:05,099
in and then my favorite bit was the

209
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:06,690
chunking so HTTP one point naught and

210
00:08:05,099 --> 00:08:08,610
one point one working a little bit of a

211
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:11,279
different way and although they are a

212
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:12,900
bit interchangeable one of the most

213
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:16,340
difficult parts of this was dealing with

214
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:18,239
chunked transfer encoding CTE because

215
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:20,008
essentially if you think about it you

216
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,300
you get a chunk of information and then

217
00:08:20,009 --> 00:08:23,940
the next chunk of the next chunk of the

218
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:25,500
next chunk and and that's fine but you

219
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:27,779
have to work out what the schema is and

220
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:30,210
there seems to be two main types there's

221
00:08:27,779 --> 00:08:31,740
one which are marked try which is on the

222
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:33,510
left hand side at the bottom here and it

223
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:34,919
says how big the next chunk is and then

224
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:37,649
there's ones that don't have any markers

225
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:40,020
at all but either way if you think about

226
00:08:37,649 --> 00:08:41,250
it I'm trying to inject an HTML tag you

227
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:42,569
have to be quite careful where that goes

228
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:43,559
otherwise you end up with half of it in

229
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:45,870
one chunk and half of

230
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:47,790
next chunk or you save it all up in your

231
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:49,380
transparent proxy manipulate the whole

232
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:51,300
thing and then spit it out that that

233
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:55,470
then gives you a massive delay which you

234
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:57,900
know Mike make users suspicious anyway

235
00:08:55,470 --> 00:09:00,750
so the success I had was the fact that a

236
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:02,640
standalone Windows 7 machine gave me net

237
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:04,830
and tell'em creds no problem whatsoever

238
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:06,120
every single time it was happy the

239
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:07,950
moment I joined it to an Active

240
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:11,850
Directory domain things started going a

241
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:13,850
bit pear-shaped what happens is you have

242
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:16,740
the the SMB connection up here and

243
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:21,300
almost straightaway it tries to work out

244
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:23,580
where the Kerberos KDC is at the fqdn of

245
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:25,740
its domain that it knows about and when

246
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:28,110
it doesn't get a response back no such

247
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:30,710
name you just it just literally sends an

248
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:32,910
RS team end of connection game over

249
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:35,250
there's lots of ways that I think I

250
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:36,600
could maybe develop this further bluntly

251
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:38,070
putting it I ran out of time from my

252
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:40,950
master's thesis so I had to submit and

253
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:42,300
it was fine but I think you might well

254
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:45,420
be able to develop this further so that

255
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:47,189
you could impersonate the KDC perhaps

256
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:48,870
depends on exactly what it's looking for

257
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:53,850
to prove that it is within the network

258
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:57,300
that it thinks it's in so in summary my

259
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:58,740
tool is on github I definitely think I

260
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:02,099
could develop it further and I really

261
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:03,390
would like to but you know time needs to

262
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:07,050
happen if you guys want to do it please

263
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:08,640
do essentially ad join network machines

264
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:10,770
not going to happen at this point in

265
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:15,810
time but anything else anything loose

266
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:18,140
you're onto a winner so do I have any

267
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:18,140
questions
