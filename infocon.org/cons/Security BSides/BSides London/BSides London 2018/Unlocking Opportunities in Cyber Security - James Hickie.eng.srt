1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,759
thank you very much cheers for coming on

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:08,309
guys I'm really excited this is my very

3
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:10,200
first talk today I'm gonna be talking to

4
00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:14,489
you like you said about unlocking

5
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:17,369
opportunity in cybersecurity it's been

6
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:19,470
said that opportunity is all around us

7
00:00:17,369 --> 00:00:21,710
especially in cybersecurity you know

8
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:24,330
there's so many opportunities going on

9
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:28,170
with all the things coming at gdpr

10
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:29,609
you know there's so many jobs that need

11
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:32,360
filling the gaps that need filling

12
00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:34,620
however there's a lot of people that

13
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:38,250
they're letting those opportunities slip

14
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:40,559
by every day and they're not taking up

15
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:42,809
those opportunities so you know this

16
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:46,010
talk is mainly aimed at students and

17
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:48,300
people who are currently working in

18
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:51,300
LASIK IT roles who are looking to

19
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:55,288
transition into cybersecurity and it's

20
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:59,699
to try and teach you about how to get

21
00:00:55,289 --> 00:01:03,809
that opportunistic mindset now to set

22
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:05,099
yourself well to land yourself the roles

23
00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:09,090
that you're looking for within

24
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:10,380
cybersecurity it's no doubt that a lot

25
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:14,670
of people are missing those

26
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:17,939
opportunities by not researching not

27
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:20,939
finding out what free resources are

28
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:23,399
available and things like that and just

29
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:24,570
a bit about myself my background my name

30
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:29,540
is James Hickey I

31
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:31,919
I am ex-raf six years in the area I

32
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:33,540
would found out about something called

33
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,130
the free degree scheme and I was like

34
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:37,920
wait a minute I can go and do a free

35
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:40,170
degree that sounds cool three years

36
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,450
27,000 pounds and you'll pay for it and

37
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:45,299
there's no commitment to go back in yeah

38
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:47,909
I'll do that so I I'm back in University

39
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:49,890
in a moment and I'm in my second year of

40
00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:51,450
a computer science degree I originally

41
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:52,770
picked computer science specifically

42
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:55,350
because I just wanted to be a developer

43
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:57,750
but twelve months ago at the end of my

44
00:01:55,350 --> 00:02:00,119
first year I realized around this sort

45
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:03,899
of time I went to a cybersecurity

46
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:05,579
challenge event they held a event at the

47
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:07,530
University of Birmingham is a fantastic

48
00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:10,679
event they had a CTF there lots of talks

49
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:13,050
and I realized hey this is cool this is

50
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:13,800
really awesome I'm excited by this I

51
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:16,850
want to get into

52
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:20,790
cybersecurity this is something I like

53
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:23,040
I'm also at the moment as part of that

54
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:24,810
in a passion for cybersecurity and that

55
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:27,239
real interest in penetration testing and

56
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:29,760
challenges I'm currently with my friend

57
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:31,650
over there Jackies having a little go

58
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,329
with this camera and setting up so we

59
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:36,660
called the Cyber League and what that is

60
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:39,930
is it's a University CTF League to try

61
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:42,750
and connect all the societies and to get

62
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:45,060
them doing regular CTF events throughout

63
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:46,830
the year online you know there's lots of

64
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:49,290
face-to-face events but there's not a

65
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:50,970
lot of actual University only academic

66
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:54,030
MCT of events so that's something that

67
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:56,430
I'm trying to do in my own time you'll

68
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:58,260
notice it quite amusing picture there it

69
00:02:56,430 --> 00:03:05,130
does have a lot of revelant relevant

70
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:06,630
because buzz like it is my hero you

71
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:08,880
might say that's a bit of an odd hero to

72
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:11,040
have but there's the quote to infinity

73
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:16,230
and beyond I've lived by that for quite

74
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:19,470
a long time now specifically because to

75
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:21,090
me that means that there's no limits on

76
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:26,430
what you can achieve and what you can do

77
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:29,070
that's the way I see it I see challenges

78
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:30,959
therefore as nothing more than an

79
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:34,470
opportunity for me to change and to grow

80
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:38,000
and to gain experiences and to try new

81
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:42,390
things and to expand myself and and to

82
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:44,910
improve my circumstances essentially so

83
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:47,458
like I said before and what I think

84
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:49,079
everyone needs to do to get what they

85
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:52,200
want and to do what they want is to get

86
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:54,320
that opportunistic mindset and the first

87
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:58,829
part of the opportunistic mindset is

88
00:03:54,320 --> 00:04:01,320
curiosity I've got written down here

89
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:03,930
opportunity desires a curious mind

90
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:07,079
that's always asking deeper and more

91
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:09,959
insightful questions so what we want to

92
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:12,300
be thinking about with that is trying to

93
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:14,700
find out deep into you know how things

94
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:17,040
work taking things apart you've got to

95
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:18,930
be curious you've got to there are lots

96
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,480
of things that you can and for example

97
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:23,400
there are some fantastic things you can

98
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:25,580
go and visit and it's for your a student

99
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:27,510
specifically or if you're ex-military

100
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:29,940
immersive labs go and see them

101
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:32,159
now please they are fantastic they have

102
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:34,590
a platform where they have hundreds of

103
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:37,170
labs it's free for students and

104
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:40,400
ex-military at the moment they are they

105
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:42,750
do provide access to other people

106
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,099
exclusively to test it and because

107
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:46,680
they're going to rolling that out with

108
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:48,960
it businesses it gives you up an

109
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:51,270
opportunity to try out the skills and

110
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:53,460
the tool sets to try them out and serve

111
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:54,780
use them in a lab environment and to let

112
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:56,909
you know so that you're learning about

113
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:58,739
the mouth different types of malware how

114
00:04:56,910 --> 00:05:03,480
you can use all the different sorts of

115
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:05,490
tools just gaining a better insight into

116
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:07,290
how things within the industry work

117
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:09,720
whether it's defensive you know in a

118
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:12,210
sock an analyst kind of role or

119
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:15,120
offensive in a pen testing red teaming

120
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:17,640
role or on from that you know if you

121
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:20,400
have an interest in pentesting hack the

122
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:24,030
box you absolutely fantastic site

123
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:26,159

124
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:31,109
for you to go and attack go and get into

125
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:33,240
too it's a root great a bit of fun one

126
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:34,770
thing I find that is so important for

127
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:38,040
guys you've got to be curious you've got

128

00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:11,549
this one has really unusual and actually

144
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:18,890
found it out within the last three

145
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:21,090
months I would probably say it books

146
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:23,640
there's a resource called O'Reilly

147
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:25,590
Safari it cost a fortune if you're not a

148
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:29,159
student and know how to get it nice and

149
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:31,650
sheet because around I think it is $300

150
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:34,140
a years to access but if you're a

151
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:36,900
student you can go onto the ACMs

152
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:38,030
Association of Computing Machinery it's

153
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:40,310
an American

154
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:43,130
computing society you can have a student

155
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:45,620
membership for only $42 and that gives

156
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:48,230
you access to the entire digital

157
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:50,240
versions of the entire O'Reilly library

158
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:52,010
the entire no starch press library and

159
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,530
the entire Packt publishing the library

160
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:56,150
so if you're a student and you have an

161
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:58,309
interesting gaining lots of knowledge

162
00:06:56,150 --> 00:07:00,830
those are all that the top books that

163
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:03,380
everyone's reading if you're not a

164
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:06,260
student you can still get professional

165

166
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:09,920
for a hundred and ninety-nine dollars

167
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:12,860
and that gives you full access to those

168
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:15,290
the entire Safari online book library a

169
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:17,210
fantastic resource I only found that

170
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:19,520
three months ago and I've I paid my

171
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:21,409
42-pound and I've been dollar sorry and

172
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:25,190
I've been reading as many books as I can

173
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:27,170
to feed the curiosity and make sure I'm

174
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:31,330
learning and and understanding all these

175
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:36,050
these methodologies and these techniques

176
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:39,830
my next little thing is generosity there

177
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:41,690
are so many good groups around if you've

178
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:43,580
ever heard of many hats club or the

179
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:44,930
Manchester gray hats I don't know why I

180
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:47,359
left that logo there that is still the

181
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:52,310
Hawks logo Boise's a Manchester gray

182
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:53,660
hats up there get on their websites

183
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:55,280
join them they have they both have

184
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:57,560
discord groups they both chat about

185
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:59,630
things all the time and when I see a

186
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:01,400
generosity what I really mean is the

187
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:02,870
ability to share back with other people

188
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:05,210
if you are doing something really

189
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:08,000
interesting share it let everyone know

190
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:09,620
about it go on these these sites join

191
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,750
these clubs join these groups and get

192
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:15,020
talking get talking about things talk

193
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:17,420
about what you're doing share what what

194
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:19,099
are they talking about okay you're doing

195
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:21,230
something that's really interesting

196
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:22,160
I actually I do this it's really similar

197
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:23,930
as you want to talk about something

198
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:25,400
we'll meet in the middle and do

199
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:27,980
something together it's that kind of

200
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:29,719
thing building links it's the fact that

201
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:32,420
you come here is fantastic

202
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:36,050
sharing the generosity of coming here

203
00:08:32,419 --> 00:08:38,240
and sharing your talks things like that

204
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:42,020
like I say sharing on social media make

205
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:44,180
sure you give give away

206
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:47,240
DEFCON groups they're fantastic there's

207
00:08:44,179 --> 00:08:50,630
a I think there's three decent difficult

208
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:53,090
groups that - I can think of the dc4 420

209
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:55,400
which is in London and DC one five one

210
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:57,680
at Leeds those of other fantastic groups

211
00:08:55,400 --> 00:09:00,140
that have get together really often they

212
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:01,250
all the many hats Club is purely online

213
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:03,920
and they did actually have a

214
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:06,650
face-to-face get-together in Dublin this

215
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:09,819
year they all get together really often

216
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:12,500
they have events do things like that

217
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:16,940
be generous share what you've got share

218
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:19,910
what you know next you gotta be pissed

219
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:23,350
you've gotta have some perseverance try

220
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:23,350
harder to suck less

221
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:27,739
within the opportunistic mindset you

222
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:30,230
need to be someone that has the

223
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:35,450
determination to keep persisting and

224
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:38,120
keep persevering despite failure and not

225
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:40,460
success in you know for example big one

226
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:42,710
they always use the phrase try harder

227
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:45,410
there are people on who taking on the OS

228
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:47,300
CP labs when they getting stuck on some

229
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:49,520
ink don't keep going have the

230
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:52,130

237
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:05,690
