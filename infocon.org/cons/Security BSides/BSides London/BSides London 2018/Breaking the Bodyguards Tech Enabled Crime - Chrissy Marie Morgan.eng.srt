1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,550
hi guys hi guys so as I said I'm Chrissy

2
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:13,110
Morgan and today I'm gonna be talking

3
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:16,949
about breaking the body guard to take an

4
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:19,080
able crime so firstly I'm going to be

5
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:20,820
going into just a high-level overview

6
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:23,038
because we've only got 15 minutes here

7
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:24,960
and the investigation that I've been

8
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:27,210
taking into the close protection

9
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,310
industry and I'm going to be going about

10
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:30,929
my background white is I do what I do

11
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:33,600
and some of the people that are involved

12
00:00:30,929 --> 00:00:36,300
in the industry the tech that could

13
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,100
actually be used against them the plan

14
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:40,530
that I came up with to users take

15
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:46,350
against them and always have a plan B

16
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:51,000
right and then finally the results so my

17
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:54,649
background 2002 I've started off as I

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:58,739
helped des analyst wiped many sectors

19
00:00:54,649 --> 00:01:01,079
somehow in 2010 got headhunted to be a

20
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:03,570
close protection bodyguard I was working

21
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:05,580
in that area for around a few years and

22
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:09,060
then I was like okay this is getting

23
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:11,130
slightly annoying now I was seen per sec

24
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:13,380
and OPSEC failures on the daily basis

25
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:14,580
and it got to the point myself I need to

26
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:18,089
do something about this but I'm not

27
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:20,460
educated enough so what I did I went to

28
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:22,470
uni that worked out quite well just

29
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:24,600
graduated with the Masters of won a

30
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:26,130
couple of big CTF and black hat

31
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:28,589
challenge coins so I think I'm on the

32
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:31,289
right track and what I'm trying to do

33
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:32,880
today is kind of be in a position within

34
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:35,610
the industry of actually making a

35
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:37,649
difference and making a change so at the

36
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:39,450
moment I'm a DPO and that kind of gives

37
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:44,420
me a little bit of freedom to implement

38
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:46,909
some changes so who needs our help

39
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:49,320
you have the clothes protection officers

40
00:01:46,909 --> 00:01:51,350
the layer above that is the private

41
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:54,029
security companies that employ them and

42
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:56,699
the high net worth families that employ

43
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:59,820
them so if we start with a close

44
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:01,890
Protection officers on a regular basis

45
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:04,169
like I said before I'd be seeing lots of

46
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:06,329
different problems on the ground one of

47
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:08,580
the problems we have today still persik

48
00:02:06,329 --> 00:02:10,889
the personal security mainly their

49
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:13,500
online social media profiles

50
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:15,239
I've got CPS on my Facebook and I see

51
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,800
and checking in and posting photos

52
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:18,810
friend think they think that they were

53
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,330
the client they live in this luxury life

54
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:23,460
and that's not everyone that does that

55
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:25,170
but obviously the people out there that

56
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:29,490
do do this this is a threat to our

57
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:31,440
clients because we have quite a lot of

58
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:33,270
guys from a military Armed Forces

59
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:36,270
background they've actually been working

60
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:38,070
with people during the training for

61
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:39,810
terrorism purposes just to make sure

62
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:41,760
that the locking down their profiles and

63
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:43,290
I've actually seen a difference and how

64
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:46,560
people are actually improving now with

65
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:48,359
this kind of thing routine so having

66
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,890
worked from the ground upwards I've

67
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:51,720
worked in national infrastructure sites

68
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:54,329
all the way up to escorting royalty

69
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:57,510
there are routines within the day-to-day

70
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:59,459
job of what you do there is a thing

71
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:01,310
called the circuit which is the London

72
00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:04,500
circuit it's a comprised of around

73
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:06,480
200-250 guys that work and it's very

74
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:08,670
much the client dictates what you do on

75
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,290
a daily basis however there's going to

76
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:13,079
always be the same places that they're

77
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:14,730
going to go to similar times of the year

78
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:17,459
and then when the guys were off-duty

79
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:19,920
they have their only or hangouts I mean

80
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:21,239
if anything the Michael McIntyre event

81
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,649
that's just happened with him getting

82
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:24,480
robbed

83
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:26,549
that was basically down to routine

84
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,018
school run they've seen him he was

85
00:03:26,549 --> 00:03:31,440
actually outside the car getting

86
00:03:28,019 --> 00:03:34,140
attacked and his is like what's taken

87
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:36,480
off in and because I know the routines

88
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:38,609
you know someone else could do as well

89
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:42,238
the bad guys isn't that hard to figure

90
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:44,820
out lack of awareness so isn't that they

91
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:46,260
don't know about cyber it's just they

92
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:48,600
don't know how to practically apply it

93
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:50,700
to their own personal devices I think

94
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:52,200
some of them can have issues there so

95
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:53,640
they need some help we have guards too

96
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:55,828
how does it practically apply to them on

97
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:57,988
the ground okay so we have the private

98
00:03:55,829 --> 00:03:59,670
security companies once again like a

99
00:03:57,989 --> 00:04:02,160
cyber awareness sometimes a little bit

100
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:04,260
of ignorance as well because they

101
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:06,150
actually do have the same threat models

102
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:08,010
and the threat life so I caused us in a

103
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:10,350
way so they can understand and realize

104
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:12,620
the you know the problems that might

105
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:15,780
face in online as well as offline

106
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:17,970
however sometimes for them they have no

107
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:19,260
time for tech as well so when you have

108
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:21,329
no time for take there's a lack of

109
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:23,280
investment and a lack of knowledge you

110
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:25,060
end up having a bit of a culture where

111
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:28,280
there's a bit of a problem

112
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:29,840
so the next one up the chain is the

113
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:32,270
high-net-worth clients they're the guys

114
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:34,400
who give us the work to put into

115
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:37,849
perspective there's around 4000 high

116
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:41,388
network out worth families in America

117
00:04:37,849 --> 00:04:45,770
alone you've also got the UK and Europe

118
00:04:41,389 --> 00:04:48,440
and Asia which is a growing market for

119
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:50,180
these guys is a case of you have around

120
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:53,389
10 to 12 people working within these

121
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:55,849
family offices there they have the net

122
00:04:53,389 --> 00:04:57,560
worth of a big corporate organization

123
00:04:55,849 --> 00:04:59,750
but they don't have the same governance

124
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:02,090
and structure therefore problems can

125
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:03,620
arise with privileges because it's a

126
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:06,099
small team a lot of people have access

127
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:08,599
to stuff that they really shouldn't have

128
00:05:06,099 --> 00:05:10,759
when the people who are working for them

129
00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:13,940
the PAS on a daily basis they're also

130
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:15,500
dealing with external vendors now these

131
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:17,539
external vendors could be boutique

132
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:19,490
businesses you've got your like tennis

133
00:05:17,539 --> 00:05:21,530
instructors Ryman instructors you know a

134
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:23,720
very small boutique shops and they won't

135
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:26,508
have the cyber security in place to help

136
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:30,919
protect them so once again it's a risk

137
00:05:26,509 --> 00:05:33,080
to us anonymization issues so old school

138
00:05:30,919 --> 00:05:35,090
families they've done really well over

139
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:37,550
the years protecting themselves keeping

140
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:40,190
a very low profile a lot of high net

141
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:41,509
worth we'll try and veer back from the

142
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:42,320
social media because they know it would

143
00:05:41,509 --> 00:05:45,409
be a problem

144
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:47,690
however with Osen you know it's

145
00:05:45,409 --> 00:05:49,699
advancing the way it is there's also

146
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:52,360
there's marketing platforms out there

147
00:05:49,699 --> 00:05:55,310
who identify high net worth individuals

148
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:56,690
so for marketing person can go ahead and

149
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:58,310
do that what's to say that organized

150
00:05:56,690 --> 00:06:01,550
crime units aren't using the same tech

151
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:04,460
to be able to identify at these guys and

152
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:05,930
also it's a fast-paced environment like

153
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:07,820
literally every single day it's

154
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:10,340
something different you can be in Paris

155
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:12,770
one day and Australia the next you know

156
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:14,388
that doesn't give you much time to to

157
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:16,758
work with the devices work for the

158
00:06:14,389 --> 00:06:18,710
people and a lot of the time it's a case

159
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:20,240
of you weighing up the security with the

160
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:26,049
efficiency of the service and how the

161
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:26,050
family office run so the tech

162
00:06:27,029 --> 00:06:33,339
now I'm showing some tech here when I

163
00:06:30,659 --> 00:06:35,949
looked in things I wanted to be able to

164
00:06:33,339 --> 00:06:37,569
demonstrate to the guys some really

165
00:06:35,949 --> 00:06:39,399
quick and dirty methods are being able

166
00:06:37,569 --> 00:06:41,259
to get things done you know very basic

167
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:43,180
stuff that you can pick up online you

168
00:06:41,259 --> 00:06:46,749
can learn in a matter of weeks and then

169
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:50,169
actually use it to exploit them so we've

170
00:06:46,749 --> 00:06:53,889
got a hack or f1 here so with this we

171
00:06:50,169 --> 00:06:55,748
can intercept alarms we can play replay

172
00:06:53,889 --> 00:06:59,589
attacks on them like garages and stuff

173
00:06:55,749 --> 00:07:02,740
like that you know it can do a manner of

174
00:06:59,589 --> 00:07:04,300
things that's quite cheap to buy on top

175
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:08,580
of that you've also got jammers which

176
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:11,319
can also affect 3g and 4g technologies

177
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:12,909
imagine if you're on a job and all of a

178
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:14,770
sudden your phones go down and then

179
00:07:12,909 --> 00:07:16,959
something else happens these guys are

180
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:19,568
built to protect from the physical

181
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:22,300
they're not built and trained to protect

182
00:07:19,569 --> 00:07:25,089
from the cyber so things like that can

183
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:27,399
really mess them up on ops next thing

184
00:07:25,089 --> 00:07:28,839
proxmark in a hotel scenario we have a

185
00:07:27,399 --> 00:07:30,309
lot of clients that come over to certain

186
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:33,789
times a year and they'll hire out who

187
00:07:30,309 --> 00:07:36,759
whole hotel suite the whole floor you'll

188
00:07:33,789 --> 00:07:39,789
have our si rst guys outside the doors

189
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:41,229
or on the actual wing what can happen is

190
00:07:39,789 --> 00:07:42,669
that you can actually walk pass them or

191
00:07:41,229 --> 00:07:44,919
come near them catch them in the lift

192
00:07:42,669 --> 00:07:48,878
they will have a number of cards on them

193
00:07:44,919 --> 00:07:52,508
four different doors for the wing that's

194
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:54,009
easily done unfortunately if we were to

195
00:07:52,509 --> 00:07:56,199
get into a room we could always use like

196
00:07:54,009 --> 00:07:58,509
a Bosch bunny which you know standard we

197
00:07:56,199 --> 00:08:00,490
can get the creds we might not even need

198
00:07:58,509 --> 00:08:02,649
to go that far you know cell Wi-Fi

199
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:04,539
pineapple get the team to join the

200
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:06,939
network it's game over if we've got the

201
00:08:04,539 --> 00:08:08,889
itinerary and the agenda unfortunately

202
00:08:06,939 --> 00:08:13,389
for these people it's going to be game

203
00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:17,110
over like index so one of ones I found

204
00:08:13,389 --> 00:08:19,509
what was quite interesting was the yell

205
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:20,919
great to consumer device so there's a

206
00:08:19,509 --> 00:08:23,259
grading system with some of the home

207
00:08:20,919 --> 00:08:24,639
alarm systems and such great one being

208
00:08:23,259 --> 00:08:26,589
the lowest grade four being the highest

209
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:28,719
in the UK it's normally around twos

210
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:30,639
being the highest now with this with the

211
00:08:28,719 --> 00:08:32,370
RF cat what you can do is you can

212
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:34,719
intercept the signals and block them

213
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:36,880
however it doesn't always have the

214
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:39,800
securing mechanism built in to actually

215
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:43,219
prevent well to let us know that

216
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:44,870
- happened which is a massive problem on

217
00:08:43,219 --> 00:08:48,740
top of that you can use stuff like hack

218
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:51,470
RF that can actually do the replay

219
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:53,240
attack so we could get part of the same

220
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:57,500
sort frequencies for the key fob and

221
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:59,510
also one of the gaol alarm systems you

222
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:01,160
can actually malformed the packets the

223
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:03,740
problem is when you do that and you send

224
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:05,899
it to the system itself it just hangs

225
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:07,370
and that's it it doesn't do anything

226
00:09:05,899 --> 00:09:09,920
the sensors don't work in what you have

227
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:13,420
to physically reset the machine in order

228
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:17,360
to do you know anything to put back on

229
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:19,250
okay so myself in sharks we went to a

230
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,690
hotel one weekend to get a bit hands-on

231
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:23,180
I wanted to understand the background

232
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:26,029
technologies with some of this stuff so

233
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:27,349
I went into a hotel pretty much ripped

234
00:09:26,029 --> 00:09:29,300
it apart had a little look at some of

235
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:31,399
the tech we had some good down time

236
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:35,630
looking at the hardware I wanted to find

237
00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:38,240
out more about RFID so what I did pretty

238
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:40,310
much I made my little RFID reader I

239
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,630
didn't have a proxmark at the time so

240
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:44,359
this was the best way of learning the

241
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:46,399
technology myself there's some really

242
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:48,020
good stuff online major malfunction does

243
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:50,899
some really good stuff and blogs and

244
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:52,040
everything one of the things I wanted to

245
00:09:50,899 --> 00:09:53,959
do though is make it a little bit

246
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:56,180
different from just understanding the

247
00:09:53,959 --> 00:09:59,209
technology I wanted to improve it or use

248
00:09:56,180 --> 00:10:03,680
in a different way so what I did is I

249
00:09:59,209 --> 00:10:05,869
came up with a person poor niche so so

250
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:08,660
guys on the ground we're taught to look

251
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:11,120
for people who have like messenger style

252
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:14,180
bags you know big clothing bulky stuff

253
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:17,589
and with the buzz mark I don't know if

254
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:19,969
anyone knows about that and you have the

255
00:10:17,589 --> 00:10:22,339
reader and it's about this big and they

256
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:23,899
fits into a messenger cell bag that's

257
00:10:22,339 --> 00:10:26,959
this little brother right there it

258
00:10:23,899 --> 00:10:28,970
hasn't got the same sort of range but in

259
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:31,489
a sense it does exactly the same job I

260
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:33,079
can fit that into a purse so if I walk

261
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:35,329
up to one of the guys whether it be on

262
00:10:33,079 --> 00:10:37,279
duty off-duty RSC they're not going to

263
00:10:35,329 --> 00:10:41,630
expect some chick with the purse to be

264
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:42,769
doing something unfortunately so what

265
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:47,510
I've actually done with the reader

266
00:10:42,769 --> 00:10:50,089
itself so now we've I've put the RFID

267
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:51,439
tool that's by Corey harden really

268
00:10:50,089 --> 00:10:53,060
nicely it'll pick it

269
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,220
it can actually send the data wirelessly

270
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:56,599
to my own access point and so I don't

271
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:58,220
actually need to be anywhere near them I

272
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:00,920
can just put this somewhere it will send

273
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:05,030
everything to me and you know we've got

274
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:05,660
their their cards and whatever so the

275
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:10,160
plan

276
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:12,740
okay so so--but in my talk had a great

277
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:14,569
plan of action in my head it was like a

278
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:16,940
Nicolas Cage movie we were going to be

279
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:19,430
hacking cars getting into buildings

280
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:23,030
suffer in everyone you know it was gonna

281
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:27,770
be great and we you know we got there

282
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:30,350
however I had to do things within legal

283
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:32,390
remix so I had to set up in such a way

284
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:34,280
so the plan was to do it with a training

285
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:36,949
company they would probably have about

286
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:39,530
12 guys who are fresh out of the army or

287
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:40,790
wherever going into a training situation

288
00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:42,890
they learn all the drills of how to be a

289
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:44,569
close Protection Officer it was an ideal

290
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:45,860
opportunity to get them before they were

291
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:50,180
operation or when teaching them about

292
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:50,810
cyber unfortunately training got

293
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:56,209
cancelled

294
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:58,910
so okay what we're gonna do however a

295
00:11:56,210 --> 00:12:02,780
couple of Google's later and I found out

296
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:07,219
there was a bodyguard conference so all

297
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:10,160
this home can be right it came with its

298
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:12,170
own set of problems unfortunately for me

299
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:14,660
it was actually hosted in a military

300
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:17,660
hotel at the front there's four Gurkhas

301
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:20,780
you don't mess around with Gurkhas okay

302
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:22,100
and how do you how do you work in that

303
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:24,319
sort of environment it's a conference

304
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:27,080
you've got the most suspicious people in

305
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:29,750
the world in this one room and basically

306
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:31,280
I was walking into the Lions Den so I

307
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:32,540
had to get my thinking hat on and think

308
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:34,100
about what I was gonna do and how is

309
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:35,540
still gonna get some data for today to

310
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:37,630
be able to show you and actually

311
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:41,930
continue my investigation and research

312
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:44,480
so what I do set up a website got so

313
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:48,770
many recipes made some nice t-shirts so

314
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:51,560
I look totally legit so we ended up

315
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:53,420
actually managing get in the stand four

316
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:54,800
days before the con started they said

317
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:56,390
yeah you can understand that's fine

318
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:58,849
because I've been hammering them trying

319
00:12:56,390 --> 00:13:00,589
to find out if I could get one we had a

320
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:03,260
really nice setup we actually had the

321
00:13:00,589 --> 00:13:04,800
Wi-Fi pineapples set up and working with

322
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:07,439
an Access Point showing people

323
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:10,439
we had bat bunny on the table and an

324
00:13:07,439 --> 00:13:12,180
iPad so we would just stood there

325
00:13:10,439 --> 00:13:15,269
talking to them and you know in a sense

326
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:17,099
it was a phony company it was we could

327
00:13:15,269 --> 00:13:20,339
have been bad guys you know we're just

328
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:23,309
they didn't know me so it's a case of

329
00:13:20,339 --> 00:13:25,350
what can we do so what I did set up a

330
00:13:23,309 --> 00:13:27,868
website it collected their personal

331
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:30,420
information contact details I actually

332
00:13:27,869 --> 00:13:32,839
even asked on the website form what's

333
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:34,920
your biggest fear with cyber security a

334
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:37,439
lot of the guys actually said about

335
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:39,449
Wi-Fi attacks once we showed them and I

336
00:13:37,439 --> 00:13:41,550
had never seen this before a lot of them

337
00:13:39,449 --> 00:13:46,849
they were like yeah that's the one and

338
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:49,498
so we got the details got some USBs um

339
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:51,809
once again I had to be quite legal with

340
00:13:49,499 --> 00:13:53,939
things so I could have been nasty but

341
00:13:51,809 --> 00:13:55,709
it's a proof of concept if these guys

342
00:13:53,939 --> 00:13:57,360
are taking the USBs off me and they're

343
00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:59,609
actually using them at home or wherever

344
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:04,050
in the workplace it's showing that they

345
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:06,269
haven't got that that mindset so I put a

346
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:08,849
PDF on and also some link trackers as

347
00:14:06,269 --> 00:14:11,129
well so I could see what the data was on

348
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:15,120
the day absolutely fine it's quite good

349
00:14:11,129 --> 00:14:17,970
that was our view from our table so the

350
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:22,199
response we had 10% actually plug in the

351
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:25,230
USB s so I'm not sure that's a good or

352
00:14:22,199 --> 00:14:28,019
bad thing yet 21% or actually giving me

353
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:29,850
their details and and then what I've

354
00:14:28,019 --> 00:14:32,040
done is I've actually looked into them

355
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:34,079
so this is a small sample set of what I

356
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:36,029
did so I did some posting on them some

357
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:37,469
of the worst parts the guess was we had

358
00:14:36,029 --> 00:14:39,779
some guys who were and have I been

359
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:40,980
pawned obviously you know yourself we go

360
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:42,990
on there you can get to the data dumps

361
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:45,029
it might be passwords available we can

362
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:48,329
get into their accounts and they've got

363
00:14:45,029 --> 00:14:49,889
phone numbers on LinkedIn and most of

364
00:14:48,329 --> 00:14:52,439
the guys have got good upset they

365
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:54,870
haven't actually you know put too much

366
00:14:52,439 --> 00:14:57,449
online but there were traits that could

367
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:59,339
be used that were publicly available you

368
00:14:57,449 --> 00:15:00,929
could then social engineer them in in

369
00:14:59,339 --> 00:15:04,790
either an email because I've got all

370
00:15:00,929 --> 00:15:07,499
their details and go from there so

371
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:10,498
what's next I'm actually going to read

372
00:15:07,499 --> 00:15:11,670
team a some guys in September on a

373
00:15:10,499 --> 00:15:13,290
training course which would be fun to

374
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:15,430
actually gonna be using the technology

375
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:16,689
and showing the guys as well

376
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:18,729
we're setting up a cyber awareness

377
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:20,830
program specifically for CPS so they

378
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:22,420
know what they're doing I just want to

379
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:24,520
drive awareness to these guys because

380
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:26,170
there are a front line at the end of the

381
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:28,240
day when it comes to anything like

382
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:29,410
nefarious terrorism all the rest of it

383
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,870
these boys need to know what they're

384
00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:34,600
doing and also going to do some further

385
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:39,540
research within the tech and go from

386
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:39,540
there really so any questions
