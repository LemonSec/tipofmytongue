1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:06,990
as Craig said my name is Jon Scheyer and

2
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:10,050
I work as a researcher in the office of

3
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:12,210
the CTO at Sophos and last year I was up

4
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:14,849
here talking about the dark web and how

5
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:17,279
you could gather the necessary resources

6
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:19,890
tools and skills to basically become a

7
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:21,779
cyber criminal and during that talk I I

8
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:24,090
made a passing remark at how there's

9
00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:25,650
this fascinating story on some dark net

10
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:26,939
markets and how they got taken down but

11
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:29,490
I didn't really have the time to tell

12
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:30,750
that story so this year thanks to you

13
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:31,979
guys in your votes I get to tell that

14
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:34,200
story

15
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:36,600
so what we're gonna talk about today is

16
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:38,070
is just that is how law enforcement goes

17
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,510
about taking down some of these dark net

18
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:43,700
markets and we're gonna specifically

19
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:46,260
look at the Alpha Bay and hence

20
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:48,690
takedowns we're also going to look at

21
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:51,899
the fate of dream market which is

22
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:53,218
currently the biggest drug marketplace

23
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:55,440
as well as other illegal stuff

24
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:56,370
marketplace around there and and we're

25
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,140
going to talk a little bit about you

26
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:59,940
know how these markets work and why they

27
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:02,420
get taken down from time to time and and

28
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:05,250
generally talk about some OPSEC failures

29
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:08,760
which inevitably you know take these

30
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:09,930
guys down and one of the things we're

31
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,430
not gonna talk about though is just the

32
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:13,290
sort of morals and ethics of these

33
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:15,869
markets you know morals are subjective

34
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:18,330
and we may not disagree on the details

35
00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:19,860
but the fact remains that what these

36
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:21,270
markets are providing are goods and

37
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:23,070
services that are considered legal in

38
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:26,520
most countries and so that's why law

39
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:28,350
enforcement takes them down so before we

40
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,700
get to the main event the fun stuff we

41
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:31,589
got to talk a little bit about some

42
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:32,790
history and we got to talk about Silk

43
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:36,930
Road and if you turn on your clicker

44
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:39,119
then it works so Silk Road many of you

45
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:41,970
probably remember this as one of the

46
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:43,680
first sort of massively popular dark web

47
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:45,060
markets out there the most you know the

48
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,259
really successful one and this was

49
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:50,430
founded in 2011 by Ross Ulbricht and

50
00:01:48,259 --> 00:01:53,280
Silk Road was meant to be an expression

51
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:56,579
of the theory of or the philosophy of

52
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,469
agar ISM and counter economics and it

53
00:01:56,579 --> 00:01:59,908
was the first dark it wasn't the first

54
00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:01,798
dark net market but it was the first one

55
00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:03,960
to really gain massive popularity

56
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:06,360
amongst the people the denizens of the

57
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:08,669
dark web and it kind of helped guide the

58
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:11,008
way that many of the future dark net

59
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:12,569
markets would evolve and emerge and be

60
00:02:11,008 --> 00:02:14,129
coated from then on

61
00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:16,409
for example it was an it was an early

62
00:02:14,129 --> 00:02:19,109
adopter of things like escrow payment

63
00:02:16,409 --> 00:02:23,790
systems and also vendor reputation

64
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:27,030
systems one notable aspect of Silk Road

65
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:29,250
was the fact that it had had a policy

66
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:32,610
that the goods and services that were

67
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:36,420
sold on the site had to not pose any

68
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:38,390
harm or defraud people this applied to

69
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:40,879
things like child pornography obviously

70
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:43,950
services based on violence or other

71
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:46,768
goods used to aid and abet things like

72
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:49,619
carding and stolen identity so things

73
00:02:46,769 --> 00:02:51,030
aiding and abetting fraud essentially it

74
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:52,620
wasn't always the case some stuffs

75
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:54,150
nukkie and every once in a while but no

76
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:56,760
that's at least what we're in the Terms

77
00:02:54,150 --> 00:03:00,120
of Service and in keeping with that

78
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:02,670
libertarian ethos most of what you could

79
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:05,430
buy on Silk Road were things like drugs

80
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:07,858
and drug paraphernalia now there weren't

81
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:09,480
only illegal goods on this market there

82
00:03:07,859 --> 00:03:11,819
were actually some legal ones too there

83
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:14,000
were things like jewelry and books and

84
00:03:11,819 --> 00:03:18,060
artwork and sporting goods as well as

85
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:20,459
war memorabilia and some replicas now

86
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:23,730
according to some Silk Road contributed

87
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:25,889
to the rise in value of Bitcoin at the

88
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:27,988
time prior to Silk Road there were

89
00:03:25,889 --> 00:03:29,760
markets like the farmers market which

90
00:03:27,989 --> 00:03:31,859
actually took payments and processed

91
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:34,379
transactions using PayPal and Western

92
00:03:31,859 --> 00:03:37,919
Union which ultimately led to their

93
00:03:34,379 --> 00:03:39,750
downfall but because of Silk Road and

94
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:42,750
the huge transactional volume that was

95
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:44,669
getting processed through the site some

96
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:46,410
people think that no that really helped

97
00:03:44,669 --> 00:03:49,410
pump up the price of Bitcoin at that

98
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:53,010
time and when Silk Road was seized on 2

99
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:55,410
October 2013 there was a profound albeit

100
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:57,120
temporary dip in the price of Bitcoin

101
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:58,650
but which can be represented which is

102
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,849
represented by the line over here in the

103
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:03,269
price on the right hand the right hand

104
00:03:59,849 --> 00:04:05,399
access so you know that market really

105
00:04:03,269 --> 00:04:07,290
was an integral part of the Bitcoin

106
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:09,299
economy at the time and it wasn't long

107
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:10,709
before a lot of other people noticed

108
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:13,169
what was going on with Silk Road and

109
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:14,940
wanted to get in on the action so in

110
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:18,410
about mid 2013 we started seeing a lot

111
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:20,488
more of these markets start to open up

112
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:22,710
the second thing we needed to need to

113
00:04:20,488 --> 00:04:24,810
talk about is how these dark net markets

114
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:26,010
operate right some of the markets that

115
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:28,470
are around today still fall

116
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:30,840
that originals or libertarian ethos of

117
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:33,120
Silk Road of do no harm to other others

118
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:34,260
and they only trade in things like drugs

119
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,690
and drug paraphernalia

120
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:38,520
but the majority of the most popular

121
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:40,950
markets out there today will sell just

122
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:43,169
about anything to anybody so drugs

123
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:45,479
weapons hacking services malware

124
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:47,010
counterfeit goods you name it the only

125
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:48,600
thing that most of these markets still

126
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:50,940
prohibit are things like child sexual

127
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:55,320
exploitation material and sometimes

128
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:58,350
murder so as we can see from government

129
00:04:55,320 --> 00:05:00,210
exhibit 113 a from ulbricht's trial this

130
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:02,430
was entered by the prosecution this is

131
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:04,979
pretty much how all darknet markets

132
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:06,480
still operate today it's basically a

133
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:09,270
supply and demand equation with the

134
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:10,740
facilitator in the middle so the vendors

135
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:12,060
get on the site they would put ads on

136
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:14,220
the site for whether they want you to

137
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:15,840
buy drugs guns whatever it is and as a

138
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:17,520
user you would browse that site and then

139
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,440
eventually if you find a product that

140
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,750
you like you would create a demand order

141
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:23,070
order or a buy order first thing you

142
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:24,630
need to do obviously is take your real

143
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:26,640
money and turn it into fake money and

144
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:29,070
then deposit that into your market

145
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:31,229
account once the buy request has been

146
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:35,690
initiated the funds then go into escrow

147
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:37,860
and are held there until the buyer

148
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:39,990
acknowledges receipt of those goods and

149
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:42,360
services once the buyer acknowledges

150
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:45,900
receipt the funds are then released to

151
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:48,510
the vendor and the market will take a

152
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:50,460
cut of the proceeds so generally they

153
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:52,650
take around a two to six percent

154
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:53,849
commission somewhere in there for the

155
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:56,640
market and that's that's how these guys

156
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:58,290
basically make their money today there

157
00:05:56,640 --> 00:06:00,630
are other ways to make money too so this

158
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:02,520
is the these are the rules for opening a

159
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:04,320
vendor account on the alfa bake loan

160
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:07,020
empire market which is currently in

161
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:09,300
operation today and there's the usual

162
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:11,070
rules on here about you know not daxing

163
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:13,650
other people know child pornography or

164
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:14,730
murder no selling outside the market but

165
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:16,890
what these guys have done is they've

166
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:20,700
also instituted a $300

167
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:22,260
bond for being a vendor on the site and

168
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:23,400
this is a non refundable bond so they've

169
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:24,900
basically they're trying to keep some of

170
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:27,179
the scammers off the site at this point

171
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:29,729
they also trade security very seriously

172
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:31,350
so you have to have a PGP key if you're

173
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:32,520
going to be on this site and you have

174
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:34,140
you know have to have two-factor

175
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:35,909
authentication it's mandatory for all

176
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:38,940
users now imagine if Facebook had these

177
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:41,280
kinds of terms of services right here's

178
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:43,950
rules for a relatively new market called

179
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:46,229
nightmare market we see many of the same

180
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:47,760
rules as Empire market as matter of fact

181
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:49,320
some of the stuff is very much copy and

182
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:51,210
paste but these guys only charge a two

183
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:53,310
hundred and fifty dollar bond which is

184
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:55,409
refundable after three months if no

185
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:57,410
scammers reports and 100% fair deal so

186
00:06:55,410 --> 00:07:00,300
basically if you're a good vendor and

187
00:06:57,410 --> 00:07:02,400
everybody's happy you get you $250 back

188
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:04,530
but the number one rule is there will be

189
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:06,659
no shenanigans against Russian citizens

190
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:07,739
as a matter of fact they feel so adamant

191
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:10,080
about this that they felt the need to

192
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:13,230
mention twice so I wonder where those

193
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:14,880
guys are from and there's some other

194
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:17,550
creative ways as well that some of these

195
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:19,469
markets try to make money this is again

196
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:20,970
is from Empire market and they run a

197
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:23,010
weekly lottery for that for the low

198
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:25,170
price of one dollar u.s. which is of

199
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:28,349
course payable in bitcoins you get a

200
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:30,000
chance to win the jackpot and six

201
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:31,500
correct numbers right now we'll get you

202
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,540
around eight thousand US dollars

203
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:35,520
depending on the price of bitcoins but

204
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:37,500
they also have as you can see here the

205
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,849
wind class and the the basically the

206
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:40,680
numbers that you need to win in the

207
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:41,910
payout it goes down and if if they say

208
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:43,380
in their rules that if you know if you

209
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:44,820
get all six numbers and nobody gets five

210
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:46,590
then you get the combination of both

211
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:47,790
pots so you could stand to win a lot of

212
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:50,010
money so it's another way that these

213
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:53,190
markets kind of find creative ways to

214
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:55,770
generate some money all right so why do

215
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:59,790
these darknet markets get shut down why

216
00:07:55,770 --> 00:08:02,370
do they come and go so this a chart is a

217
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:05,460
chart tracking eighty-seven different

218
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:07,410
markets over the course of six years so

219
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:09,840
the colored bars indicate the longevity

220
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:12,030
of the market while the color indicates

221
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:14,520
why the market went down so the very top

222
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:16,650
we see Silk Road one which is coated in

223
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:18,539
green which means that it was taken down

224
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:20,190
by law enforcement right below that we

225
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:22,919
have black market reloaded which is

226
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:24,780
coated in gold which allegedly suffered

227
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:26,400
a hack and they were forced to shut down

228
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:27,960
there's still a little bit of contention

229
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:30,390
over that one but at least that's what

230
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:32,579
they say happen below that in blue we

231
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:35,309
have the Sheep of the sheep marketplace

232
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:37,560
which exits scammed now an exit scam is

233
00:08:35,309 --> 00:08:39,569
when the administrators of the market

234
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:41,069
basically take whatever is in escrow at

235
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:43,620
the time and just take off with it and

236
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:45,900
so depending on the size of the market

237
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:47,580
and the popularity and the amount of

238
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:49,020
transactions that could be quite a haul

239
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:51,150
now in the case of sheep market they

240
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:53,339
made off with about six million dollars

241
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:55,890
below that the next green line that I've

242
00:08:53,339 --> 00:08:59,040
highlighted here is Silk Road - so Silk

243
00:08:55,890 --> 00:09:01,740
Road - was opened by a former

244
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:03,060
administrator of Silk Road one and he

245
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:04,710
wanted to use the same name because you

246
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:06,630
know it was popular it was it was a

247
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:08,760
catchy name and everybody knew it so he

248
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:10,830
he wanted to trade on that name but he

249
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:13,010
wasn't an operation for very long before

250
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:16,050
it too was shut down by law enforcement

251
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:18,990
next is so the pinky purple lines these

252
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:21,209
markets that Cygnus signifies a market

253
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:23,010
that was shut down voluntarily meaning

254
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:24,779
the admins in this case instead of exit

255
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:26,910
scamming what they did was as they told

256
00:09:24,779 --> 00:09:29,040
their community were shutting down for

257
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:30,510
whatever reason maybe law enforcement

258
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,610
was getting hot on their heels were

259
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:34,710
shutting down and they gave people time

260
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:36,540
to withdraw the money that was in their

261
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:39,000
accounts so nobody lost any money and

262
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:42,360
then finally we've got evolution down

263
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:45,210
here which also ats exits scammed to the

264
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:48,180
tune of twelve million dollars at the

265
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:51,690
time evolution in Agoura were two of the

266
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:53,400
biggest markets on the dark web but just

267
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:55,920
like nature the criminal underground

268
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:58,770
abhors a vacuum and so when those

269
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:00,449
markets went away there was a need for

270
00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:03,270
another market to take his place and

271
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:05,250
that's the moment that alpha bay came

272
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:07,800
into the picture in the three days

273
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:11,520
following evolutions seizure and shut

274
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:13,920
down alpha bay gained 18,000 members and

275
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:17,790
was soon trading around 300 thousand

276
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:20,099
dollars per day alpha bay was like many

277
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:21,569
of the newer markets it dealt in drugs

278
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:23,700
but you could get all sorts of other

279
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:26,339
things like malware some hacking

280
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:28,709
services you can get things like British

281
00:10:26,339 --> 00:10:30,600
Airways air miles accounts you could get

282
00:10:28,709 --> 00:10:33,420
yourself some luxury goods like these

283
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:35,100
Yeezys now I never knew what a Yeezy was

284
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:36,930
before I started doing this talk but a

285
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:39,480
trainer really wasn't what came to mind

286
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:42,000
at first but because of the explosive

287
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:45,089
growth of this market it drew a lot of

288
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,620
law-enforcement attention and this was

289
00:10:45,089 --> 00:10:47,970
really one market that needed to be shut

290
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:49,529
down due in large parts just to the

291
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:51,870
massive amounts of drugs that were

292
00:10:49,529 --> 00:10:54,170
processed and moving through this market

293
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:56,520
at the time that it was around and

294
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:58,500
especially things like fentanyl which

295
00:10:56,520 --> 00:11:00,839
were being sold on this market so at

296
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:02,950
this point the cops took notice and they

297
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:04,779
went to work

298
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:07,540
there were mentions all over the site

299
00:11:04,779 --> 00:11:09,220
about this that it was founded and

300
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:13,329
designed and maintained by this alpha

301
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:15,870
zero 2 and alpha zero 2 also did an

302
00:11:13,329 --> 00:11:18,250
interview with deep web a news site

303
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:20,829
where he admitted to being the site's

304
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:22,510
founder so now that the cops at least

305
00:11:20,829 --> 00:11:24,550
they had a target at least they had a

306
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:27,670
moniker right but they really didn't

307
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:30,250
know who that was in real life so what

308
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:32,229
they did is they started buying drugs so

309
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:34,630
they bought some marijuana and some

310
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:36,910
heroin and some more heroin and some

311
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:39,910
more marijuana and 50 grams of meth just

312
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:42,189
for good measure then they bought some

313
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:45,459
drivers licenses and they bought an

314
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:47,050
automated an ATM skimming device but

315
00:11:45,459 --> 00:11:48,279
nothing really came of it what they were

316
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:50,439
trying to see is if they could gain some

317
00:11:48,279 --> 00:11:51,880
clues as to you know the way that things

318
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:54,730
were delivered or processed if they

319
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:56,410
could get some identities it wasn't

320
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:58,660
until they decided to register an

321
00:11:56,410 --> 00:12:00,130
account on the discussion forums most of

322
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:03,880
these markets have a discussion forum

323
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:06,130
that they caught a break one of the

324
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:08,019
features of the signup process was that

325
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:10,480
a user had to provide an email for

326
00:12:08,019 --> 00:12:12,779
password recovery purposes the system

327
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:15,790
would then send an automated email and

328
00:12:12,779 --> 00:12:20,769
buried in that header was this address

329
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:22,329
pimp Alex 91 at hotmail.com so naturally

330
00:12:20,769 --> 00:12:24,250
the feds called up Microsoft and said

331
00:12:22,329 --> 00:12:25,899
who owns that address and it turned out

332
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:28,720
that it was a Canadian by the name of

333
00:12:25,899 --> 00:12:33,370
Alex on Waqas whose birthdate was 19

334
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:34,750
October 1991 if we look at his LinkedIn

335
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:37,240
profile which was associated with the

336
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:39,010
same email address we see that he was a

337
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:41,980
software designer based in Quebec and

338
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:44,260
that he worked at EBX technologies now

339
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:45,870
the the feds later learned that this was

340
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:48,220
a company that he owned and controlled

341
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:50,410
ABX technologies was really nothing to

342
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:51,940
talk about it wasn't very profitable it

343
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:54,399
wasn't particularly productive if you

344
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:56,860
looked at their statements it was simply

345
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:59,290
a company that caused used to launder

346
00:12:56,860 --> 00:13:02,519
the money from alpha Bay so that he

347
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:06,839
could get it out into the real world

348
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:10,149
they also found mentions of both the the

349
00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:12,699
91 hotmail account and another email

350
00:13:10,149 --> 00:13:14,980
account associated with EB X

351
00:13:12,699 --> 00:13:16,390
technologies associated with a PayPal

352
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:16,570
account so now they started a piece to

353
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:18,400
get

354
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:21,490
these things right little OPSEC leak

355
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:23,140
here and there leads to getting a better

356
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:27,010
and broader picture of who this person

357
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:30,370
was further digging led to this post

358
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:33,700
from a French computer help forum by a

359
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:35,260
user calling himself alpha 0-2 now this

360
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:37,480
might have been a coincidence if it

361
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:40,630
weren't for the fact that the post was

362
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:42,790
signed an accident that caused it with

363
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:44,200
his email address of hotmail com

364
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:46,719
now that the post has actually since

365
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:49,390
been edited to remove that piece of

366
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:50,650
information for whatever reason and if

367
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:52,660
you take that email address and you

368
00:13:50,650 --> 00:13:54,819
stick it and have I bidden pwned it

369
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:56,380
shows up all over the place including

370
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:58,270
obviously and LinkedIn and some very

371
00:13:56,380 --> 00:14:00,340
notable things like exploit a n which is

372
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:03,220
a an underground forum for trading

373
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:05,230
exploits in malware and triple zero web

374
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:08,830
host which is a known repository for

375
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:11,710
shady scripts ironically in that deep

376
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:13,360
thought web interview the interviewer

377
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:15,430
asked if he you know was afraid of

378
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,840
getting caught and actually alpha zero 2

379
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:18,729
here is bragging that he thinks his

380
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:22,360
OPSEC is secure and he lives in an

381
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:23,710
offshore country where he's safe so the

382
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:26,790
feds had their man they knew who this

383
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:30,070
guy was they now had to set their trap

384
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:31,930
around the same time as alpha Bay was

385
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:34,690
around there was another market that was

386
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:36,959
getting a lot of attention both by the

387
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:39,550
use of the site and by law enforcement

388
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:41,980
like alpha bay and many of the other

389
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:43,810
markets at the time it dealt with all

390
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:45,700
sorts of illegal things goods and

391
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:48,359
services including drugs counterfeit

392
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:53,410
items digital accounts you name it

393
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:56,310
then one day in late 2016 a security

394
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:58,689
researcher found something interesting

395
00:14:56,310 --> 00:15:01,569
they found a server on the clear web

396
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:04,420
that happen appeared to be a development

397
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:07,060
server for the hanson market platform

398
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:09,880
the researcher notified the dutch police

399
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:12,280
since the server was being hosted at a

400
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:14,920
data center in the Netherlands the Dutch

401
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:17,020
high tech Crimes Unit or the HTC you

402
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:19,060
quickly got a warrant to install some

403
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:21,400
network monitoring equipment to spy on

404
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:23,410
the traffic going to and from that

405
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:26,140
development server just to see what it

406
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:27,550
was communicating with to their

407
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:30,529
astonishment and surprise they found

408
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:32,358
that that server was communicating

409
00:15:30,529 --> 00:15:35,119
was very chatty and was communicating

410
00:15:32,359 --> 00:15:36,889
with another set of servers in the same

411
00:15:35,119 --> 00:15:40,039
data center that happened to be running

412
00:15:36,889 --> 00:15:41,839
Hans's live site they were also

413
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:43,909
communicating with another pair of

414
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:47,059
servers in Germany at another data

415
00:15:43,909 --> 00:15:48,589
center so the htc you immediately made a

416
00:15:47,059 --> 00:15:51,379
copy of all the hard drives of these

417
00:15:48,589 --> 00:15:52,699
machines so that they could analyze what

418
00:15:51,379 --> 00:15:54,439
was going on in there and they got it

419
00:15:52,699 --> 00:15:57,289
basically by doing that they got every

420
00:15:54,439 --> 00:15:59,149
single transaction on record that had

421
00:15:57,289 --> 00:16:01,129
been processed through Hanson market as

422
00:15:59,149 --> 00:16:03,859
well as all the chat logs for the

423
00:16:01,129 --> 00:16:06,649
encrypted messaging system now since all

424
00:16:03,859 --> 00:16:08,539
the all the chat logs although the chats

425
00:16:06,649 --> 00:16:10,819
used pseudonyms we didn't you know he

426
00:16:08,539 --> 00:16:12,499
couldn't really map one to one the the

427
00:16:10,819 --> 00:16:16,549
person that was speaking with an actual

428
00:16:12,499 --> 00:16:18,679
real-life identity but the handset mins

429
00:16:16,549 --> 00:16:21,858
had made a huge OPSEC mistake yet again

430
00:16:18,679 --> 00:16:24,379
if you look way back in the history of

431
00:16:21,859 --> 00:16:26,899
the chat logs down near the bottom both

432
00:16:24,379 --> 00:16:28,999
of men's names appeared in clear text as

433
00:16:26,899 --> 00:16:31,549
well as the home address of one of those

434
00:16:28,999 --> 00:16:34,219
admins and both of them were German

435
00:16:31,549 --> 00:16:36,049
nationals so when the Dutch police

436
00:16:34,219 --> 00:16:37,369
approached the Germans to say hey we

437
00:16:36,049 --> 00:16:39,108
need to get these guys arrested and

438
00:16:37,369 --> 00:16:41,749
extradited it turns out that the German

439
00:16:39,109 --> 00:16:43,999
police was already on the case and

440
00:16:41,749 --> 00:16:46,309
already had these guys on their radar it

441
00:16:43,999 --> 00:16:50,029
turns out they were running another site

442
00:16:46,309 --> 00:16:52,249
that was selling it was called Lu LTO

443
00:16:50,029 --> 00:16:56,269
and that was selling pirated a books

444
00:16:52,249 --> 00:16:57,619
audiobooks and mp3's so the Dutch police

445
00:16:56,269 --> 00:17:01,369
kind of had an idea here they thought

446
00:16:57,619 --> 00:17:03,619
well maybe we can use the arrest of

447
00:17:01,369 --> 00:17:07,819
these guys for this as a cover for our

448
00:17:03,619 --> 00:17:09,740
other operation and everything was kind

449
00:17:07,819 --> 00:17:12,319
of ready to go and when the Rue Dutch

450
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:15,859
were ready to set their trap everything

451
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:18,618
went dark the assumption is that the

452
00:17:15,859 --> 00:17:22,008
Hansa admins had noticed the hard drive

453
00:17:18,618 --> 00:17:25,789
copy panicked and moved the servers to a

454
00:17:22,009 --> 00:17:28,459
different tor protected location the HDC

455
00:17:25,789 --> 00:17:30,379
you had nothing to go on anymore and now

456
00:17:28,459 --> 00:17:31,879
it was really just back to analyzing all

457
00:17:30,379 --> 00:17:34,639
those logs and those images to see if

458
00:17:31,879 --> 00:17:36,769
they could find yet another clue luck

459
00:17:34,639 --> 00:17:39,139
was on their side again in April 2017

460
00:17:36,769 --> 00:17:41,929
when they found a Bitcoin wallet address

461
00:17:39,139 --> 00:17:44,570
buried in one of those chat logs it

462
00:17:41,929 --> 00:17:47,060
turns out that that Bitcoin address

463
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:49,040
and in using some blockchain analysis it

464
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:51,500
turns out that they found that a payment

465
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:53,720
was made out of a payment processor in

466
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:55,430
the Netherlands so they were able to go

467
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:57,530
over there with a warrant and say give

468
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:59,300
us some information the information they

469
00:17:57,530 --> 00:18:03,050
got was that the payment was made to a

470
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:04,490
hosting company in Lithuania and again

471
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:06,340
with another warrant in hand and a

472
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:09,080
little bit of multilateral cooperation

473
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:10,850
they found the hands of servers once

474
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:13,909
again that's the actual server in the

475
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:16,310
server rack so it wasn't too long after

476
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:19,310
this second break that the FBI notified

477
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:21,409
the HTC u that they too had found some

478
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:23,179
interesting servers namely the servers

479
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:26,270
hosting the Alpha Bay infrastructure and

480
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:28,340
they were planning to take them down so

481
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:31,010
this gave the Dutch another idea they

482
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:34,550
said well if alpha Bay goes down users

483
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:36,920
would as have happened so many times

484
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:38,450
they would flock somewhere else and the

485
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:42,740
likely source or the likely destination

486
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:46,570
for that would be handsome so on 20 June

487
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:49,120
in 2017 the Dutch police sent some

488
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:52,100
officers to Lithuania to the data center

489
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:54,469
while the German police went to arrest

490
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:56,179
the two gentlemen in Germany now they

491
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:58,730
waited until they could see that there

492
00:18:56,180 --> 00:19:00,290
was actual admin on on the network as

493
00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:01,550
they were obviously monitoring it and

494
00:19:00,290 --> 00:19:03,080
when they were sure the two guys were at

495
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:05,450
the keyboard the German police swooped

496
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:07,610
in and arrested the two the two German

497
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:11,240
nationals while their computers were

498
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:13,189
online unlocked and unencrypted now in

499
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:14,990
that carefully coordinated raid they

500
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:16,940
also phoned up the deed the Dutch police

501
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:18,620
who were in Lithuania and they

502
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:22,580
immediately started imaging those

503
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:25,520
servers over to some servers that they

504
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:27,080
controlled back in the Netherlands under

505
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,460
questioning by German police the two

506
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:29,840
guys just basically gave up everything

507
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:32,600
and gave up all the passwords all the

508
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:34,070
keys to everything effectively because

509
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:36,199
of this operation and the way they did

510
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:37,939
the swiftness and the and and the way

511
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:40,310
that the secrecy that they did it under

512
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:41,930
there was no downtime nobody noticed the

513
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:46,280
thing enhanced I just kept running as

514
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:49,250
usual so with all the pieces in place

515
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:52,420
now this is when Operation bayonet was

516
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:55,130
born this was an operation that involved

517
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:57,290
multilateral cooperation between the U

518
00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:59,210
of the Americans the Canadians

519
00:19:57,290 --> 00:20:00,590
Dutch the Germans and a bunch of other

520
00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:01,060
law enforcement agencies around the

521
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:06,320
world

522
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:08,629
on 5 July 2017 the FBI with the help of

523
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:10,580
the Canadian authorities and the Thai

524
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:13,040
authorities shut down alphabet the

525
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:14,990
Canadian authorities went to the data

526
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:16,250
center that where the servers were being

527
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:17,870
hosted it was in Montreal and they

528
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:19,910
started taking down these servers and

529
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:23,179
the Thai police arrested cause at one of

530
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:24,920
his luxury homes in Bangkok what the

531
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:27,230
Thai police did is they this is his home

532
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:29,750
but the Thai police did is they took an

533
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:32,480
unmarked car and brought it down the

534
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:34,880
street and then they staged an accident

535
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:36,080
they banged into his gate pretending to

536
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,910
turn the car around then some other

537
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:39,260
undercover officers came running out

538
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:41,000
pretending to be neighbors and causing a

539
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:43,340
ruckus and yelling and they're trying to

540
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,230
draw this guy out right and because they

541
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:47,629
knew he was online because obviously

542
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:50,210
they were monitoring his traffic and so

543
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:51,620
he didn't come out so they you know kept

544
00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:53,120
moving the car kept banging into his

545
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:54,800
gate kept making more ruckus and

546
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:56,780
eventually he came out he had a phone in

547
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:58,610
his hand he's wearing you know just

548
00:20:56,780 --> 00:21:01,010
trainers and shorts and no shirt and

549
00:20:58,610 --> 00:21:02,479
that's when the cops whoop tin he kind

550
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:04,070
of tried to run away but he didn't make

551
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,780
it too far they tackled him and put him

552
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:07,159
in handcuffs and grabbed his phone right

553
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:09,560
away to make sure it didn't lock and

554
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:11,660
when they went inside his house his

555
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:13,520
computer was logged into alpha base

556
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:16,460
servers and unlocked and the police were

557
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:18,920
able to seize everything the reason he

558
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:20,600
was on his computer was because his

559
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:23,050
servers were going down and he was

560
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:26,060
trying to figure out what was happening

561
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:27,710
meanwhile in the Netherlands the Dutch

562
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:30,320
police had been fiddling with the code

563
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:33,230
of the of the Alpha market oh hey sorry

564
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:35,210
handsome market they rewrote the site's

565
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:37,250
code so that passwords were no longer

566
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:40,190
being stored as hashes but in plain text

567
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:42,380
instead they also made a small tweak to

568
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:44,510
the messaging system so that before

569
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:46,040
messages got encrypted there was a copy

570
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:47,540
of them that was made in plain text and

571
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:50,510
this got them a lot of the buyers home

572
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:52,129
addresses they removed a feature that

573
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:54,050
stripped out metadata from product

574
00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:56,870
photos as they were being uploaded into

575
00:21:54,050 --> 00:21:58,190
the market and so that you know

576
00:21:56,870 --> 00:21:59,899
basically could get them some things

577
00:21:58,190 --> 00:22:01,430
like geolocation coordinates hopefully

578
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:02,900
they actually staged a really

579
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:05,150
interesting server glitch where they

580
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:07,370
said you know all our photos are gone

581
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:08,810
you need to re-upload all your product

582
00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:10,389
photos and they were able to actually

583
00:22:08,810 --> 00:22:12,940
grab 50 dealers that way

584
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:15,100
and then finally they also tricked some

585
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:17,380
of the sellers into downloading a backup

586
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:19,990
file which is a booby-trap excel file

587
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:21,550
that when the sellers open that file it

588
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:23,680
would phone home and reveal the user's

589
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:28,000
real IP addresses and that got them

590
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:31,420
another 64 targets so shutting down

591
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:33,250
alpha bay had the desired effect more

592
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:35,850
than five thousand users were

593
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:39,130
registering on Hansa every single day a

594
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:40,750
week later though once the news broke

595
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:43,810
officially that alpha bay had been

596
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:45,700
seized by the police the influx of users

597
00:22:43,810 --> 00:22:47,530
was so large that the police actually

598
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:48,940
had to shut down registrations

599
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:50,020
temporarily because they just couldn't

600
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:52,660
deal with it anymore

601
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:55,570
and unfortunately for the Dutch cops and

602
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:58,870
Dutch law states that you had to track

603
00:22:55,570 --> 00:23:01,960
every single transaction and report that

604
00:22:58,870 --> 00:23:04,090
to Europol and this was becoming just a

605
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:07,450
massive nightmare and paperwork headache

606
00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:09,310
for these guys so after only about

607
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:10,900
twenty seven days they had to shut down

608
00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:12,669
the operation because they were at that

609
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:14,260
point there was about a thousand

610
00:23:12,670 --> 00:23:15,640
transactions a day that were going

611
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:17,170
through the Hansa market so if not

612
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:18,460
you're doing paperwork a thousand times

613
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:20,830
a day it's not fun

614
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:23,260
so they shut down the site and pull the

615
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:26,470
plug on hansa and the results were

616
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:28,450
pretty staggering the police had

617
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:31,780
attained data on four hundred and twenty

618
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:35,080
thousand users including a hundred

619
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:37,570
thousand home addresses which they later

620
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:39,460
turned over Europol and a few believe

621
00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:40,929
they called knocking talks where police

622
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:42,730
show up at your door and say hey I think

623
00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:45,700
you bought something um you might want

624
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:46,740
to rethink that in the future and they

625
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:49,180
distributed these home addresses

626
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:52,030
worldwide to some of the other police

627
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:53,800
agencies and they also seized around 12

628
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:55,149
million dollars worth of Bitcoin which

629
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:59,710
we're currently sitting in the escrow

630
00:23:55,150 --> 00:24:01,600
accounts by the time it was seized alpha

631
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:03,640
bay had over three hundred and seventy

632
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:05,770
thousand listings on its site over four

633
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:08,440
hundred thousand members and was trading

634
00:24:05,770 --> 00:24:11,410
anywhere from 600 to 800 thousand

635
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:13,960
dollars per day just for comparison in

636
00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:17,070
its heyday Silk Road only had 13

637
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:20,590
thousand listings so a massive

638
00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:22,480
improvement I guess if you will over the

639
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:24,159
the older markets and it's estimated

640
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:26,020
that alpha bay over it's very

641
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:30,340
short lifetime of roughly two years

642
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:33,490
grossed around 1 billion dollars now

643
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:35,620
Alex was living the good life the

644
00:24:33,490 --> 00:24:37,780
forfeiture document when he was arrested

645
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:40,929
list self several luxury properties

646
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:43,120
including this villa in in Phuket in

647
00:24:40,930 --> 00:24:45,940
Thailand you could actually rent this

648
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:47,590
villa for a period of time well before

649
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:49,060
he was arrested now when you go to these

650
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:51,699
rental agencies it just says it's

651
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:53,770
unavailable but he had a whole bunch of

652
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:55,900
other properties as well he was what he

653
00:24:53,770 --> 00:24:57,970
called an economic citizen he would buy

654
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:59,890
properties in certain countries where if

655
00:24:57,970 --> 00:25:01,690
you spent enough money on real estate or

656
00:24:59,890 --> 00:25:04,390
development they would then offer you

657
00:25:01,690 --> 00:25:06,190
citizenship so he had a citizenship with

658
00:25:04,390 --> 00:25:08,950
Antigua coz he bought a four hundred

659
00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:11,170
thousand dollar beachfront property and

660
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:13,660
then he was in the process of getting a

661
00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:15,670
property in Cyprus for the same reason

662
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:17,710
so in Cyprus if you spend over two

663
00:25:15,670 --> 00:25:21,520
million euros then you get economic

664
00:25:17,710 --> 00:25:22,810
citizenship as well if he hadn't been at

665
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,160
my talk last year he would have learned

666
00:25:22,810 --> 00:25:25,990
that if you stay out of the blue

667
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:27,790
countries you don't get extradited to

668
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:29,500
the United States but unfortunately all

669
00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:31,540
his properties and he lived in Thailand

670
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:34,320
and all of his assets were in

671
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:37,149
extradition available countries

672
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:42,639
there was also ten luxury cars including

673
00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:46,330
this lovely Lamborghini Aventador LP 708

674
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:49,690
as be around 23 million dollars so he

675
00:25:46,330 --> 00:25:52,179
made a lot of money unfortunately the

676
00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:54,640
good news of alpha Bay was somewhat

677
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:58,240
tainted while awaiting for extradition

678
00:25:54,640 --> 00:26:00,400
in to the u.s. in Thai jail he hung

679
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:02,530
himself in his bangkok jail cell rather

680
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:08,860
than face the long arm of the law in the

681
00:26:02,530 --> 00:26:11,350
US so with alpha Bay Conn and Hansa gone

682
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:14,770
it was Dreamz turn to inherit the

683
00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:16,240
spotlight by all accounts dream had

684
00:26:14,770 --> 00:26:19,060
inherited all the what they call the

685
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:21,640
refugees from these markets and it

686
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:24,399
basically emerged as the number one

687
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:26,860
leading market of the time and back in

688
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:28,810
March when I began putting together this

689
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:31,030
talk at least of the pitch for this talk

690
00:26:28,810 --> 00:26:34,590
I was kind of doing my regular rounds on

691
00:26:31,030 --> 00:26:37,590
the dark web and I saw this notice

692
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:40,769
this is big news no one had a clue what

693
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:44,070
was going on there were wild rumors and

694
00:26:40,769 --> 00:26:45,929
speculation on many forums that saying

695
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:48,450
that speed stepper the owner and

696
00:26:45,929 --> 00:26:50,580
operator of the site had either been

697
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:54,960
arrested or exit scheme let's exit

698
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:56,879
scammed many people still vouch for him

699
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:58,440
said you know don't worry about it he's

700
00:26:56,879 --> 00:27:00,870
okay he's just taking a break whatever

701
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:02,639
everything will be okay but you know the

702
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:04,529
rumor mill starts to get starts to turn

703
00:27:02,639 --> 00:27:06,498
and things start to you know conspiracy

704
00:27:04,529 --> 00:27:08,669
theories start to take hold and

705
00:27:06,499 --> 00:27:10,679
curiously unlike most of the messages

706
00:27:08,669 --> 00:27:13,619
that are from administrators this one

707
00:27:10,679 --> 00:27:15,419
was not signed and that's usually a big

708
00:27:13,619 --> 00:27:17,100
red flag on the dark web if you're not

709
00:27:15,419 --> 00:27:20,789
signing your messages as an admin or

710
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:23,789
just even as a user so during this time

711
00:27:20,789 --> 00:27:25,080
that the site stayed up and but you just

712
00:27:23,789 --> 00:27:26,639
couldn't buy any product there was no

713
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:28,408
product listings anymore just this

714
00:27:26,639 --> 00:27:30,149
notice and said you know for 30 2019

715
00:27:28,409 --> 00:27:32,759
we're going down and transferring to a

716
00:27:30,149 --> 00:27:34,139
partner market now apparently you can

717
00:27:32,759 --> 00:27:36,600
still withdraw your bitcoins at this

718
00:27:34,139 --> 00:27:38,039
time which meant that users could you

719
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:39,389
know if they wanted to liquidate their

720
00:27:38,039 --> 00:27:40,769
accounts they could but apparently there

721
00:27:39,389 --> 00:27:42,299
were some problems with that as well and

722
00:27:40,769 --> 00:27:43,769
if you read you know if you were on the

723
00:27:42,299 --> 00:27:45,450
forums people were all panicking and

724
00:27:43,769 --> 00:27:46,860
then the rumors of exit scams started

725
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:50,190
all over again and it was it was a lot

726
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:52,740
of fun to read 30 April came and went

727
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:55,799
and the site was still up still showing

728
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:57,779
the same banner then in early May a post

729
00:27:55,799 --> 00:28:00,450
on reddit which is kind of like the dark

730
00:27:57,779 --> 00:28:02,940
webs equivalent of reddit attempted to

731
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:04,619
set the record straight it turns out

732
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:07,440
that dream had been on the receiving end

733
00:28:04,619 --> 00:28:09,899
of a sustained 7 week DDoS attack and

734
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:12,389
the attackers were demanding a four

735
00:28:09,899 --> 00:28:14,428
hundred thousand dollar ransom now DDoS

736
00:28:12,389 --> 00:28:16,258
attacks on the on the Tor network are

737
00:28:14,429 --> 00:28:19,080
nothing new there quite common actually

738
00:28:16,259 --> 00:28:20,879
and and markets like this are very often

739
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:23,699
the target just because of the profile

740
00:28:20,879 --> 00:28:25,498
that they occupy and DDoS attacks are

741
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:26,970
also kind of systemic there's there's a

742
00:28:25,499 --> 00:28:28,710
there's actually issues with the

743
00:28:26,970 --> 00:28:32,970
protocol that make them really

744
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:35,999
successful and really possible and so it

745
00:28:32,970 --> 00:28:38,190
seems instead of giving up what the what

746
00:28:35,999 --> 00:28:39,869
speed stepper or whomever is behind this

747
00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:43,320
particular market decide to do was just

748
00:28:39,869 --> 00:28:45,389
shut it down and maybe you know start

749
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:46,408
coding from scratch or at least what

750
00:28:45,389 --> 00:28:47,899
they're saying is they're trying to

751
00:28:46,409 --> 00:28:49,700
improve the site's code maybe may

752
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:51,170
more DDoS brazilian maybe add some new

753
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:53,710
features and they're gonna relaunch

754
00:28:51,170 --> 00:28:56,210
bigger and better than before

755
00:28:53,710 --> 00:28:57,770
shortly after this notice appeared on

756
00:28:56,210 --> 00:28:58,940
the market so now instead of saying

757
00:28:57,770 --> 00:29:00,260
they're moving to a partner market

758
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:03,080
they're saying they're going to reopen

759
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:05,480
in August with new infrastructure and an

760
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:09,590
accompanying post on reddit confirmed

761
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:12,320
the same thing as of this week the dream

762
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:14,270
mirrors have all gone offline and the

763
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:16,939
true fate of the site is still unknown

764
00:29:14,270 --> 00:29:20,150
so here I am with an unfinished talk and

765
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:22,010
wondering what to do and that's when law

766
00:29:20,150 --> 00:29:24,740
enforcement steps the law enforcement

767
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:26,810
stepped in to give me a hand along with

768
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:28,640
dream market Wall Street Market in

769
00:29:26,810 --> 00:29:32,030
Valhalla were a couple of other large

770
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:35,780
and well traffic sites on the morning of

771
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:37,760
2 May I woke up to this notice the

772
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:40,850
German police had seized Wall Street

773
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:44,090
market and finished customs and French

774
00:29:40,850 --> 00:29:45,740
police had seized Valhalla this again

775
00:29:44,090 --> 00:29:47,480
rocked the darknet community and there

776
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:50,240
was panic in the proverbial dark web

777
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:54,200
streets the forum's got really excited

778
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:55,700
exciting on that day and then only five

779
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:58,190
days later because they didn't want to

780
00:29:55,700 --> 00:30:01,190
be left out of the fun the FBI seized

781
00:29:58,190 --> 00:30:04,550
the extremely popular dark web news site

782
00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:07,310
deep web so it was easy to understand

783
00:30:04,550 --> 00:30:11,899
why Wall Street and Valhalla went down

784
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:13,310
but why D top deep web those of you who

785
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:15,200
might have been here last year might

786
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:17,750
recall that deep thought web was not

787
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:20,510
only a new site but also amongst other

788
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:22,900
things a portal to dark net markets on

789
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:25,940
the sidebar here you can see a bunch of

790
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:29,810
popular markets that are highlighted as

791
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:31,640
well as their availability it also had

792
00:30:29,810 --> 00:30:34,639
some referral links for all of these

793
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:37,760
markets and this was the bridge between

794
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:40,040
the clear web and the dark web but it

795
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:41,930
still doesn't explain why the site was

796
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:45,590
shut down which left a lot of us kind of

797
00:30:41,930 --> 00:30:47,210
scratching our heads as part of their

798
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:49,820
press release the FBI published this

799
00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:52,280
handy infographic which basically

800
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:54,080
explained why all of this was illegal so

801
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:56,030
it turns out that the Deep top web

802
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:57,919
admins would create an account on one of

803
00:30:56,030 --> 00:31:00,379
these markets when you create an account

804
00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:01,280
you get a referral link they would take

805
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:03,590
that referral link

806
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:06,379
publish it on Deep Web and then promote

807
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:08,209
the site now anybody who wanted to go to

808
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:09,920
one of these markets and found them

809
00:31:08,210 --> 00:31:11,930
let's say through Deep Web and a lot of

810
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:14,390
people did when they opened their

811
00:31:11,930 --> 00:31:17,480
account they would use that referral

812
00:31:14,390 --> 00:31:20,030
link from that day forward every single

813
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:22,550
purchase that that user made would would

814
00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:25,120
be a cut of the the purchase would

815
00:31:22,550 --> 00:31:27,680
actually go to the Deep Web admins and

816
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:29,659
from there they would take the money and

817
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:30,710
this is in perpetuity they would take

818
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:32,360
that money and then they would

819
00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:34,880
subsequently launder it through some

820
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:37,790
shell companies and the indictment we

821
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:39,650
see that deep dot Webb's referral link

822
00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:41,510
was actually responsible for nearly

823
00:31:39,650 --> 00:31:45,470
twenty percent twenty four percent of

824
00:31:41,510 --> 00:31:48,680
all alpha Bay transactions and 47% of

825
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:51,260
all handset transactions the admins

826
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:54,050
received over fifteen million dollars in

827
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:56,210
kickbacks from the dark various dark net

828
00:31:54,050 --> 00:31:58,310
markets that they promoted I believe

829
00:31:56,210 --> 00:32:01,010
most law enforcement agencies call these

830
00:31:58,310 --> 00:32:04,280
proceeds of crime I also believe this is

831
00:32:01,010 --> 00:32:06,110
the first time that a web site a bust

832
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:08,840
has occurred of a web site a clear net

833
00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:11,929
site that only contained referral links

834
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:14,090
and what was also interesting is there

835
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:15,620
are a few other sites around at the time

836
00:32:14,090 --> 00:32:17,449
when these guys got busted that I've

837
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:22,639
since just disappeared off the internet

838
00:32:17,450 --> 00:32:24,980
so like many of their predecessors a

839
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:27,260
slew of OPSEC mistakes were really to

840
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:30,440
blame for the takedowns of Wall Street

841
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:34,040
and Deep Web unfortunately I couldn't

842
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:35,960
find any public information on the busts

843
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:38,600
of valhalla but I'm willing to bet a few

844
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:40,250
pints of bitter that an OPSEC fail was

845
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:43,280
probably very central to that bust as

846
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:47,000
well it doesn't take much to take down

847
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:49,730
your criminal world the Deep Web

848
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:53,030
indictment identified tau pre har and

849
00:32:49,730 --> 00:32:56,120
Michael fan as the admins behind Deep

850
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:57,770
Web tau pre Hara is listed as the owner

851
00:32:56,120 --> 00:33:00,110
on his LinkedIn LinkedIn profiles the

852
00:32:57,770 --> 00:33:02,510
owner of ot s our biz tech in mmm

853
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:06,409
marketing and Michael Phan is the owner

854
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:09,590
of jazz coffee trade limited so the cops

855
00:33:06,410 --> 00:33:11,270
by watching these sites knew what the

856
00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:12,980
who the shell companies were and by

857
00:33:11,270 --> 00:33:15,000
doing just a simple bit of you know

858
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:17,070
open-source intelligence they were

859
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:19,800
were able to start piecing these things

860
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:22,260
together and gather who the real life

861
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:23,820
identities were of the deep web admins

862
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:25,590
as a matter of fact if you looked at

863
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:27,750
Michael fans Facebook profile you can

864
00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:31,949
see up here that he was also the the

865
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:33,720
owner of MNT marketing so starting with

866
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:35,220
some shell companies and following the

867
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:38,010
money led the authorities to the

868
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:41,850
real-life identities of Deep Web admins

869
00:33:38,010 --> 00:33:45,000
that's all it took another good example

870
00:33:41,850 --> 00:33:48,659
it's the story of a senior dream market

871
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:52,650
admin who was arrested in the US on his

872
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:54,630
way to a beard growing competition oxy

873
00:33:52,650 --> 00:33:57,120
monster was a prominent member of the

874
00:33:54,630 --> 00:34:00,090
dream community as well as a form admin

875
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:02,659
and vendor his identity was pieced

876
00:34:00,090 --> 00:34:07,470
together by analyzing the public

877
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:09,149
Instagram and and Twitter posts of a guy

878
00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:12,000
by the name of gal Valerius and

879
00:34:09,149 --> 00:34:14,480
comparing those posts to other posts are

880
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:17,730
made on dream forms by oxy monster

881
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:21,480
another really helpful tip bit was they

882
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:24,179
were able to link the this dream key

883
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:27,210
here with oxy monster and further link

884
00:34:24,179 --> 00:34:30,840
it to gal Valerius as well so this is

885
00:34:27,210 --> 00:34:32,399
what one of these tip jar Bitcoin wallet

886
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:33,929
a tip jar basically on the darknet

887
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:35,940
market is just if you want to tip the

888
00:34:33,929 --> 00:34:37,980
admins a couple shekels for you know a

889
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:39,690
satisfied being a satisfied customer you

890
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:42,300
could do that but they were able to tie

891
00:34:39,690 --> 00:34:44,220
this Bitcoin address not only with oxy

892
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:48,690
monster but with the real-life identity

893
00:34:44,219 --> 00:34:50,939
of gal Valerius so on 31 August of 2017

894
00:34:48,690 --> 00:34:52,860
he was detained in question in Atlanta

895
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:55,260
on his way to Texas the beard growing

896
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:57,000
competition and the indictment indicates

897
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:59,310
that they found the login credentials to

898
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:03,750
dream market as well as a PGP encryption

899
00:34:59,310 --> 00:35:06,540
key titled oxy monster like these guys

900
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:09,240
have never heard of tails gal Valerius

901
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:11,520
was tried and subsequently sentenced and

902
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:14,729
found guilty and sentenced to 20 years

903
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:16,740
in prison for distributing drugs and is

904
00:35:14,730 --> 00:35:18,180
now serving his time in federal prison I

905
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:20,100
think he got a little bit of time off

906
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:22,350
for clemency probably ratted out some of

907
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:25,190
the the other admins as well it was a

908
00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:25,190
pretty sick beard though

909
00:35:25,410 --> 00:35:29,740
as of April this year

910
00:35:28,030 --> 00:35:31,930
Wall Street market was one of the

911
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:34,450
largest darknet markets out there it had

912
00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:36,730
over 5,400 vendors over a million

913
00:35:34,450 --> 00:35:38,410
customers it was one of the many places

914
00:35:36,730 --> 00:35:41,350
where you could get yourself some Donald

915
00:35:38,410 --> 00:35:42,940
Trump ecstasy as well as all sorts of

916
00:35:41,350 --> 00:35:45,279
other illegal goods and services and

917
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:46,660
like all other markets had generated

918
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:49,000
money by taking a cut of each

919
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:50,859
transaction in this case anywhere from

920
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:53,830
two to five percent depending on the

921
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:55,390
vendor status and/or rating and aside

922
00:35:53,830 --> 00:35:57,310
from the obvious reasons for why this

923
00:35:55,390 --> 00:36:02,560
would get law enforcement attention they

924
00:35:57,310 --> 00:36:05,890
were also allegedly tied to a real-life

925
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:08,890
death of a resident of Florida because

926
00:36:05,890 --> 00:36:11,940
he ordered a fentanyl fentanyl laced

927
00:36:08,890 --> 00:36:13,900
nasal spray off of Wall Street Market

928
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:16,600
Wall Street Market was also the

929
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:19,810
successor of German plasma market which

930
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:22,839
exit scammed in 2016 so again by using

931
00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:24,070
blockchain analysis the federal agents

932
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:26,470
were able to follow the money and

933
00:36:24,070 --> 00:36:28,570
establish that the money from the

934
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:30,040
wallets associated with German plasma

935
00:36:28,570 --> 00:36:32,920
market were being used to fund the

936
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:35,440
operation of Wall Street Market now

937
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:37,960
since the busts are relatively new we

938
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:39,010
don't have all the details yet but

939
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:40,540
reading through some of these

940
00:36:39,010 --> 00:36:42,130
indictments can kind of give us some

941
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:45,730
clues as to how the three men behind

942
00:36:42,130 --> 00:36:47,950
Wall Street were identified the police

943
00:36:45,730 --> 00:36:49,900
discovered several servers thought to be

944
00:36:47,950 --> 00:36:51,580
those belonging to Wall Street image

945
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:53,650
them and then start analyzing those

946
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:56,710
images for clues there weren't any

947
00:36:53,650 --> 00:36:58,420
immediate smoking guns but the cops were

948
00:36:56,710 --> 00:37:00,609
able to get some pseudonyms from the

949
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:02,140
code and from the databases and all

950
00:37:00,609 --> 00:37:04,509
sorts of other things that would later

951
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:06,790
be associated with the defendants if

952
00:37:04,510 --> 00:37:08,710
you're going to use a pseudonym don't

953
00:37:06,790 --> 00:37:11,200
reuse that pseudonym on the clear web

954
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:12,910
it's that simple the authorities were

955
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:14,618
also able to analyze some of the network

956
00:37:12,910 --> 00:37:16,299
traffic coming in and out of those

957
00:37:14,619 --> 00:37:19,060
servers while they were monitoring them

958
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:21,670
and in this case one of the defendants

959
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:24,460
VPN services betrayed him when it shut

960
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:26,590
down unexpectedly on him while he was

961
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:28,690
actively using the WSM or being

962
00:37:26,590 --> 00:37:30,790
administrating the WSM infrastructure

963
00:37:28,690 --> 00:37:33,670
thus revealing and unmasking his

964
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:35,560
real-world IP address it turns out that

965
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:36,910
that IP address was tied to one of those

966
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:39,850
mobile UMTS

967
00:37:36,910 --> 00:37:41,290
sticks that was registered to a

968
00:37:39,850 --> 00:37:44,920
broadband company in Germany under a

969
00:37:41,290 --> 00:37:47,050
fictitious name and by using additional

970
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:48,970
monitoring of that IP address and some

971
00:37:47,050 --> 00:37:50,890
geolocation of the stick itself they

972
00:37:48,970 --> 00:37:52,660
found that the stick was being used not

973
00:37:50,890 --> 00:37:55,200
only at his place of work but also at

974
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:58,089
his residence in Germany

975
00:37:55,200 --> 00:38:01,060
another guy registered his VPN service

976
00:37:58,090 --> 00:38:03,820
in the name of his mother that was nice

977
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:06,100
and easy that admin later admitted to

978
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:08,680
all charges and his complicity in the

979
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:11,560
inn as being an administrator of adult

980
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:14,109
wall street market now meanwhile the

981
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:16,029
analysis the images the images kept kept

982
00:38:14,110 --> 00:38:18,880
going and they turned up a bunch of PGP

983
00:38:16,030 --> 00:38:20,860
keys it was found that some of those PGP

984
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:22,390
keys and some of the other keys that

985
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:24,220
they found were associated with wallets

986
00:38:22,390 --> 00:38:26,560
that were used to pay for some digital

987
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:28,720
marketing services for Wall Street

988
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:30,790
market these guys do advertise after all

989
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:33,490
a lot of them advertised on Deep Web as

990
00:38:30,790 --> 00:38:35,440
a matter of fact and one of these PGP

991
00:38:33,490 --> 00:38:38,680
keys was also found to be associated

992
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:40,300
with a wall of a Hansa user and because

993
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:42,520
the cops had all the hands of stuff they

994
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:44,830
were able to dig through that and find

995
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:46,900
some additional information and then

996
00:38:44,830 --> 00:38:48,340
further Bakhtin chain analysis of all

997
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:50,920
the wallets that were found in the

998
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:53,200
infrastructure indicated that the other

999
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:55,120
wallets were that wallet and the other

1000
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:56,859
wallets were also associated with this

1001
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:58,480
Martin frost and this email address so

1002
00:38:56,860 --> 00:39:00,250
basically this guy was opening wallets

1003
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:02,440
all over the place and opening accounts

1004
00:39:00,250 --> 00:39:05,020
for you know on gaming sites and other

1005
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:06,490
places using the same email address

1006
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:08,410
so again if you're gonna be a criminal

1007
00:39:06,490 --> 00:39:13,390
don't be stupid use a different email

1008
00:39:08,410 --> 00:39:15,580
address what makes the WM WSM case even

1009
00:39:13,390 --> 00:39:18,640
more interesting is the fact that the

1010
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:22,390
three admins were actively planning an

1011
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:24,430
exit scam in late April this message

1012
00:39:22,390 --> 00:39:26,980
appeared on the site I happen to just

1013
00:39:24,430 --> 00:39:28,359
stumble upon it just by accident I was

1014
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:30,850
like oh maintenance Kyle check back in a

1015
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:32,110
couple days apparently just they were

1016
00:39:30,850 --> 00:39:34,569
gonna go down for maintenance and they

1017
00:39:32,110 --> 00:39:35,440
were gonna be back you know shortly the

1018
00:39:34,570 --> 00:39:37,810
site never came up

1019
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:39,820
the feds because they were watching this

1020
00:39:37,810 --> 00:39:42,250
notice that these guys were planning an

1021
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:45,070
exit scam and decided to actually you

1022
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:48,430
know push up their their their seizure a

1023
00:39:45,070 --> 00:39:49,900
little bit earlier than planned so law

1024
00:39:48,430 --> 00:39:50,828
enforcement noticed but so did a bunch

1025
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:53,199
of other people

1026
00:39:50,829 --> 00:39:55,089
on dredit there was a post that happened

1027
00:39:53,199 --> 00:39:56,349
shortly after that saying like it goes

1028
00:39:55,089 --> 00:39:58,689
without saying Wall Street's exit

1029
00:39:56,349 --> 00:40:00,069
scamming so get your stuff out now and

1030
00:39:58,689 --> 00:40:02,379
there's also this mentioned down here

1031
00:40:00,069 --> 00:40:05,558
Ellie having the IP address to the admin

1032
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:06,880
panel so what was that about well

1033
00:40:05,559 --> 00:40:08,469
shortly after the site went into

1034
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:10,509
maintenance another interesting post

1035
00:40:08,469 --> 00:40:12,789
appeared on dredit it seemed like

1036
00:40:10,509 --> 00:40:16,989
somebody had just leaked the admin panel

1037
00:40:12,789 --> 00:40:19,569
URI and a username and password for the

1038
00:40:16,989 --> 00:40:21,759
Wall Street Market admin panel so who

1039
00:40:19,569 --> 00:40:23,859
could have done this and why so this is

1040
00:40:21,759 --> 00:40:25,630
where things get interesting again and

1041
00:40:23,859 --> 00:40:27,578
we started looking at a big bucket of

1042
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:30,400
octet fail now so if we look at this

1043
00:40:27,579 --> 00:40:33,249
username here Medellin I guess he wants

1044
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:35,769
to be a big-time drug dealer we find

1045
00:40:33,249 --> 00:40:38,348
this indictment for Marco's Paulo de

1046
00:40:35,769 --> 00:40:43,178
Oliveira anabolic also known as Medellin

1047
00:40:38,349 --> 00:40:45,579
or Medellin WSM for a while

1048
00:40:43,179 --> 00:40:48,969
reddit used to actually allow subreddits

1049
00:40:45,579 --> 00:40:52,689
of darknet marketplaces and this bottom

1050
00:40:48,969 --> 00:40:55,509
aka here was the the pseudonym or the

1051
00:40:52,689 --> 00:40:57,038
moniker that this person used to you

1052
00:40:55,509 --> 00:40:57,969
know speak with people on them on the

1053
00:40:57,039 --> 00:41:00,789
market because he was a representative

1054
00:40:57,969 --> 00:41:02,829
of Wall Street Market answer questions

1055
00:41:00,789 --> 00:41:07,359
settle disputes whatever the case may be

1056
00:41:02,829 --> 00:41:11,559
and he spoke fluent English and and

1057
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:14,380
Portuguese and he actually interacted

1058
00:41:11,559 --> 00:41:17,380
with the Dutch police on handsome when

1059
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:20,199
he noticed that alpha bay went down on 5

1060
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:22,539
July on 10 July he actually contacted

1061
00:41:20,199 --> 00:41:24,729
the administrators of Hansa and said hey

1062
00:41:22,539 --> 00:41:27,160
you're probably gonna get an influx of

1063
00:41:24,729 --> 00:41:30,698
users you could need some help you know

1064
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:32,259
can I have a job and so they started

1065
00:41:30,699 --> 00:41:33,549
questioning about his skills and what he

1066
00:41:32,259 --> 00:41:35,170
could wait what he could offer and

1067
00:41:33,549 --> 00:41:38,019
because he was a community manager for

1068
00:41:35,170 --> 00:41:39,640
WSM and had been in this game for a

1069
00:41:38,019 --> 00:41:41,169

1074
00:41:48,670 --> 00:41:51,759

and help you guys you know have the best

1080
00:41:57,910 --> 00:42:01,868
market around little did he know he was

1081
00:42:00,039 --> 00:42:03,339
actually talking to the the Dutch police

1082
00:42:01,869 --> 00:42:04,450
at the time and they kept stringing him

1083
00:42:03,339 --> 00:42:06,040
along and they

1084
00:42:04,450 --> 00:42:07,779
eventually asked him for his home

1085
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:10,060
address they said they were gonna send

1086
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:11,040
them a security token and he said well I

1087
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:13,900
live in Brazil

1088
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:15,400
OPSEC mistake I live in Brazil and the

1089
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:17,079
post here is really slow and I'll take

1090
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:19,000
like 60 days before it gets to me and

1091
00:42:17,079 --> 00:42:20,680
the key will probably expire so don't

1092
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,849
bother doing that and they kept pressing

1093
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:23,710
the issue and kept pressing the issue

1094
00:42:21,849 --> 00:42:26,170
and finally he relented and gave them an

1095
00:42:23,710 --> 00:42:28,660
address in the city of Campina in the

1096
00:42:26,170 --> 00:42:31,690
state of são Paulo in Brazil it was

1097
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:33,190
registered so and and what he said was

1098
00:42:31,690 --> 00:42:35,440
it was one of his drop addresses right

1099
00:42:33,190 --> 00:42:36,910
so drop addresses basically if you're

1100
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:38,380
ordering illegal things it's kind of

1101
00:42:36,910 --> 00:42:40,569
good to have a drop address this is

1102
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:41,980
where the goods arrive you either pick

1103
00:42:40,570 --> 00:42:43,780
them up from there it's not your home

1104
00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:45,460
residence or you have somebody there

1105
00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:46,960
who's an accomplice of yours that's

1106
00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:48,839
gonna forward those packages on to you

1107
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:52,630
later on and most of these are often

1108
00:42:48,839 --> 00:42:54,910
registered under fake names or or under

1109
00:42:52,630 --> 00:42:59,859
other people's names but he registered

1110
00:42:54,910 --> 00:43:02,618
this address under Marcos Paulo so not a

1111
00:42:59,859 --> 00:43:03,460
good idea and then I found this in the

1112
00:43:02,619 --> 00:43:05,079
indictment which I thought was pretty

1113
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:07,930
interesting please don't send the cops

1114
00:43:05,079 --> 00:43:09,400
to this address you know you guys you

1115
00:43:07,930 --> 00:43:11,950
know I trust you guys because Hance has

1116
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:13,510
always been good don't do any bad joke

1117
00:43:11,950 --> 00:43:14,980
I've had this drop for a long time and I

1118
00:43:13,510 --> 00:43:17,319
don't I don't want it I don't know it

1119
00:43:14,980 --> 00:43:18,550
lost so some of the federal agents did

1120
00:43:17,319 --> 00:43:20,079
is they took that address they took the

1121
00:43:18,550 --> 00:43:22,030
name Marcos Paulo they gave it to the

1122
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:24,550
DEA agents in Sao Paulo and they

1123
00:43:22,030 --> 00:43:27,069
returned the full name of the person who

1124
00:43:24,550 --> 00:43:29,890
was actually registered behind that

1125
00:43:27,069 --> 00:43:32,079
address that wasn't the only object

1126
00:43:29,890 --> 00:43:34,000
fails this guy made this medi II mean

1127
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:36,520
was all over the place there was an

1128
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,810
about me profile that stated he was a

1129
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:39,430
student small business owner and

1130
00:43:37,810 --> 00:43:42,310
consultant in camp penis Brazil so again

1131
00:43:39,430 --> 00:43:44,169
we've got a location here visit my web

1132
00:43:42,310 --> 00:43:47,170
site this went to Marco's Sandy Valley

1133
00:43:44,170 --> 00:43:50,980
comm if he went there there was a QR

1134
00:43:47,170 --> 00:43:52,869
code with an Bitcoin wallet address as a

1135
00:43:50,980 --> 00:43:55,420
PGP key in here a key based audio

1136
00:43:52,869 --> 00:43:57,760
profile this onion address which no

1137
00:43:55,420 --> 00:44:00,220
longer is in operation a github profile

1138
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:02,470
and a Twitter profile the github profile

1139
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:04,899
was - a username by the by the name of

1140
00:44:02,470 --> 00:44:07,569
coins of pixel and the Twitter account

1141
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:08,770
was for dark net citizen now the Twitter

1142
00:44:07,569 --> 00:44:11,259
account has since been shut down

1143
00:44:08,770 --> 00:44:12,790
but the github profile still up now it

1144
00:44:11,260 --> 00:44:15,369
wasn't a very prolific github

1145
00:44:12,790 --> 00:44:16,569
contributor but you know you start

1146
00:44:15,369 --> 00:44:18,760
piecing these things together you can

1147
00:44:16,569 --> 00:44:21,940
get a better idea of who these people

1148
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:24,819
here's his Bitcoin address it was sort

1149
00:44:21,940 --> 00:44:26,380
of pseudo personalized so now we know

1150
00:44:24,819 --> 00:44:28,359
that you know it's probably a good bet

1151
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:30,670

there were digital crumbs all over the

1170
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:15,368
place for this guy he had multiple email

1171
00:45:13,569 --> 00:45:17,140
addresses but he kept freezing them over

1172
00:45:15,369 --> 00:45:20,559
and over and mixing them between his

1173

clear web and his dark web presence they

1174

1178
00:45:27,609 --> 00:45:30,640
of make sense right this this was his

00:45:34,029 --> 00:45:38,740
manager for a real company and what was

1183
00:45:36,940 --> 00:45:40,900

1184
00:45:38,740 --> 00:45:45,149
here at this book this is a book by

1185
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:48,549

1186
00:45:45,150 --> 00:45:51,460
feds were analyzing the WSM chat logs

1187
00:45:48,549 --> 00:45:53,740
they stumble on one chat that said that

1188
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:56,349
where Markos had posted a message saying

1189
00:45:53,740 --> 00:45:58,000

1196
00:46:08,260 --> 00:46:11,890
know password dump right so Marco Santa

1197
00:46:10,599 --> 00:46:14,520
Valley one of his email addresses in

1198
00:46:11,890 --> 00:46:17,470
Brazil and a very super elite password

1199
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:18,970
alright so where does that leave us what

1200
00:46:17,470 --> 00:46:20,169
do we stand now a bunch of these markets

1201
00:46:18,970 --> 00:46:22,779
have gone down there's good news in this

1202
00:46:20,170 --> 00:46:25,180
bad news right the good news is a lot of

1203
00:46:22,779 --> 00:46:26,770
the drug pushers specifically the ones

1204
00:46:25,180 --> 00:46:29,078
pushing dangerous drugs like fentanyl

1205
00:46:26,770 --> 00:46:30,700
are being taken off the street and a lot

1206
00:46:29,079 --> 00:46:31,810
of these markets are shutting down the

1207
00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:33,220
bad news is

1208
00:46:31,810 --> 00:46:34,509
there's always going to be another one

1209
00:46:33,220 --> 00:46:37,390
it's a game of whack-a-mole these

1210
00:46:34,510 --> 00:46:39,280
markets come back up and very often they

1211
00:46:37,390 --> 00:46:41,200
learn from past mistakes and they become

1212
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:42,940
stronger than ever as a matter of fact

1213
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:45,069
right now Empire market and nightmare

1214
00:46:42,940 --> 00:46:46,600
market are kind of the two Biggie's on

1215
00:46:45,070 --> 00:46:48,280
the street there's a couple other minor

1216
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:51,600
players but those are the two that are

1217
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:53,920
seeing a lot of traffic right now and

1218
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:56,350
that OPSEC will always bring you down

1219
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:58,000
whether you're a cyber criminal or just

1220
00:46:56,350 --> 00:47:00,940
a private citizen looking to stay

1221
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:04,810
private remember if you're going to have

1222
00:47:00,940 --> 00:47:06,250
dual identities don't mix them it's true

1223
00:47:04,810 --> 00:47:08,560
for good people it's true for bad people

1224
00:47:06,250 --> 00:47:10,300
so I hope you found that somewhat

1225
