1
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:07,350
so by now you guys have had time to read

2
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:09,660
the title of the talk I'm talking about

3
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:12,059
stock aware and I'm trying to compress

4
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:14,009
what is a very complex topic that I

5
00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:18,000
could talk about for hours into quite a

6
00:00:14,009 --> 00:00:22,080
short space of time so here we go this

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,609
is me the github at the bottom is

8
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,919
important because I have a lot written

9
00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:29,029
about stock aware on that github so I'll

10
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:31,289
be bringing that back at the end as well

11
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:33,930
so I don't know if you guys followed the

12
00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:36,540
trial of El Chapo Guzman but I did

13
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:41,460
because it turned out that El Chapo was

14
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:43,200
giving the the drug cartel kingpin was

15
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:45,390
giving phones infected with flexi spy to

16
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,280
his top lieutenants and his mistresses

17
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:49,469
and his wife and what he would do is he

18
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,820
would call at an inopportune moment he

19
00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:52,320
would call and he would talk to them

20
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:55,170
briefly and then he would hang up and he

21
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,789
would activate a remote microphone

22
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:58,829
basically use their phone as a remote

23
00:00:56,789 --> 00:01:00,300
microphone to listen to what they would

24
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:01,920
say about him after they hung up and

25
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:03,959
this was his way of checking in on

26
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:07,080
people he also had a crazy scheme to

27
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:10,260
infect local internet cafes around his

28
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:11,369
his headquarters with malware so that he

29
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:13,490
could make sure that nobody was talking

30
00:01:11,369 --> 00:01:16,229
about him but that's a different story

31
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:18,060
this is another case where this woman

32
00:01:16,229 --> 00:01:20,729
had a boyfriend with a life insurance

33
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:22,320
policy and she wanted to kill him the

34
00:01:20,729 --> 00:01:24,060
problem was he was sleeping in his car

35
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,529
at the time so she installed three

36
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:28,200
different stock core apps on his phone

37
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:29,970
and made the mistake of hiring an FBI

38
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:32,490
informant to kill him

39
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:34,079
so this is another recent cases 2017

40
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:35,939
that's just to illustrate what we're

41
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:39,960
talking about here so we can see the

42
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:41,460
seriousness should we say so I broken

43
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:43,048
this talk down into three parts we have

44
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:44,820
defining the problem the scope of the

45
00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:47,960
problem and then what I think are a few

46
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:51,600
solutions to the problem of soccer so

47
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:54,419
soccer basics stalker where is basically

48
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:56,490
targeted malware you need physical

49
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:59,009
access to the phone to install it it

50
00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:00,630
monitors and exfiltrate data it stores

51
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:02,969
that data on a server controlled by

52
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:04,530
whoever makes the app and the basic

53
00:02:02,969 --> 00:02:06,270
functionality is similar in all of these

54
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:09,330
apps so they collect your text messages

55
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:10,649
they log your phone calls they usually

56
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:12,680
have some sort of remote listening

57
00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:14,239
capability

58
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:15,799
it's fairly standard across the board

59
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:17,120
there's a few with more advanced

60
00:02:15,799 --> 00:02:20,620
features there's a few with less

61
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:22,760
features but that's basically it so

62
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:25,430
there's a bunch of different names for

63
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:27,439
stock aware and defining it is important

64
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:30,230
so we have mobile remote access Trojans

65
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:32,060
elsewhere which I guess implies that

66
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:33,349
it's it's mainly married couples users

67
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:34,670
and I don't think that's true

68
00:02:33,349 --> 00:02:36,290
spyware which is a little bit generic

69
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:38,179
and instrument partner surveillance

70
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:41,989
which I quite like actually because it's

71
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:43,909
very specific so stock cover companies

72
00:02:41,989 --> 00:02:45,230
themselves describe their products as

73
00:02:43,909 --> 00:02:48,888
child monitoring tools employee

74
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:50,988
monitoring tools anti-theft apps some of

75
00:02:48,889 --> 00:02:52,340
these apps can function and they are

76
00:02:50,989 --> 00:02:55,849
called dual use apps like people who

77
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:57,739
study stalker wear so you could use Find

78
00:02:55,849 --> 00:02:59,450
My Phone for instance you could install

79
00:02:57,739 --> 00:03:03,379
that on someone else's from and then use

80
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:05,780
it to track their location promotional

81
00:03:03,379 --> 00:03:07,159
material for the the actual stock cover

82
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:09,799
apps that aren't in the Google Play

83
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:12,858
Store or the Apple App Store often use

84
00:03:09,799 --> 00:03:16,819
quite troubling imagery they try to play

85
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:18,019
a paranoia though depict domestic

86
00:03:16,819 --> 00:03:20,208
violence they'll talk a lot about

87
00:03:18,019 --> 00:03:23,660
adultery caused by online interactions

88
00:03:20,209 --> 00:03:26,090
so this is part of their marketing I

89
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:27,470
talked to someone from spy tech which is

90
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:30,260
one of the companies that market stalker

91
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:32,359
wear and I asked them if I could install

92
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:34,730
this without my wife knowing and they

93
00:03:32,359 --> 00:03:37,699
were quite happy to advise me on doing

94
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:40,220
that they have reviews on their site

95
00:03:37,699 --> 00:03:41,810
featured and as you can see the bottom

96
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:43,459
one is he has absolutely no idea it is

97
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:47,239
even installed on his phone and that's

98
00:03:43,459 --> 00:03:48,709
the top review for their software so

99
00:03:47,239 --> 00:03:51,530
this is a case that I was actually

100
00:03:48,709 --> 00:03:55,609
involved in i reverse-engineered an APK

101
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:58,250
and found a URL for a subdomain of the

102
00:03:55,609 --> 00:04:00,500
stalker where Apps domain and on that

103
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:02,180
domain was ninety five thousand photos

104
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:04,030
and about twelve thousand audio

105
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:07,129
recordings sitting in an indexed

106
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:10,549
directory with no login no password to

107
00:04:07,129 --> 00:04:12,620
access it so I worked with Lorenzo from

108
00:04:10,549 --> 00:04:14,299
motherboard and we eventually got the

109
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:15,859
hosting company to take down the site

110
00:04:14,299 --> 00:04:16,970
because we couldn't get ahold of the

111
00:04:15,859 --> 00:04:20,150
people who are actually running the app

112
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:22,610
itself so this gives you an idea of how

113
00:04:20,149 --> 00:04:24,440
much data is is being collected but also

114
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:25,760
being leaked by companies that are

115
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:27,920
handling master demands

116
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:30,980
data with no real interest in securing

117
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:33,020
it at all so when we're looking at the

118
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:36,230
scope of the problem I know we all like

119
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:38,830
to deal in statistics and it's good as a

120
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:42,080
metric stalker is a global phenomenon

121
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:44,000
but companies specialize so we have let

122
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:46,219
me spy here which is based in Krakov in

123
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,490
Poland so while a lot of these companies

124
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:52,280
might produce say brochures in Google

125
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:54,170
Translate different languages in this

126
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:55,549
case let me spy has an entire version of

127
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:58,510
their site in Polish they produce

128
00:04:55,550 --> 00:05:01,790
YouTube videos in Polish they produce

129
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:04,219
blog posts so you'll see that across the

130
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:06,440
board cat watchful which goes back a few

131
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:07,820
slides is a Spanish company so they do

132
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:09,680
an English version of their site and

133
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:11,930
then they have a lot of Spanish content

134
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,120
as well so that's important to think

135
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:16,010
about when you're thinking about who's

136
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:17,780
being targeted by this software the

137
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:20,140
localization is an important factor in

138
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:22,369
that and we'll come back to that as well

139
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:24,800
so this is Kaspersky has recently

140
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:26,540
decided to reclassify how they deal with

141
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:29,360
stock aware and so they release figures

142
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:32,060
on infections so they say over the past

143
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:33,550
year they've had 58 thousand users that

144
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:35,990
have detected stock or on their phones

145
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:37,970
thirty five thousand of those users had

146
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:41,060
no idea about the stock or we'll come

147
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:42,080
back to this as well and this is for

148
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:43,550
those of you are wondering how this

149
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:47,030
affects enterprise or your business

150
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:49,850
there was a study done in 2015 which is

151
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:51,020
interesting but to be honest the the

152
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:52,520
figures that they're giving are not

153
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:54,140
going to keep you guys awake at night if

154
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:56,900
this is what you're worried about about

155
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:59,000
- and every thousand employees of

156
00:05:56,900 --> 00:06:01,969
enterprise companies are infected with

157
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,780
stalker which is significant but I don't

158
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:08,660
think it's it's necessarily going to

159
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:09,739
keep anyone that worried about it so

160
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:11,570
when we're looking at the scope for the

161
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:15,020
problem I thought that one of the ways

162
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:16,310
to show this was to look at breaches

163
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:18,950
because these companies get hacked all

164
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:20,840
the time their security is terrible so

165
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:21,920
I've highlighted two in red those are

166
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:25,099
the two that we'll be looking at the

167
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:27,680
database leaks from you can see here we

168
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:29,810
have 400,000 users 179 thousand users

169
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,280
this is a lot of people each one of

170
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:33,530
these accounts represents at least one

171
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:35,450
device a lot of these companies you can

172
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:37,880
have up to five or six devices linked to

173
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:39,140
one username so we're looking at a lot

174
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:42,380
of people who are

175
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:45,469
infected with these apps so we're gonna

176
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:47,120
look at wtci first WT spy is based in

177
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:52,250
the United Arab Emirates they were

178
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:54,560
hacked in 2016 their database included a

179
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:56,210
lot of user data but what I was

180
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:59,330
interested in was country ID which I've

181
00:06:56,210 --> 00:07:01,760
highlighted in red there and based on

182
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:03,680
that country ID I was able to get ahold

183
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:05,840
of their registration page on their site

184
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,100
because their site still up pretty much

185
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,080
untouched from when they were hacked I

186
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:11,600
would imagine and I was able to work out

187
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:13,609
roughly where their main customers are

188
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:16,490
from now since they're based in the UAE

189
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:20,270
and they market in Arabic this matches

190
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:21,580
with their top ten countries that

191
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:23,690
they're selling their apps in

192
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:25,880
Afghanistan I was a little bit confused

193
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:27,890
about but it's also the first option

194
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:29,750
when you when you register so I'm not

195
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:32,409
sure that it is actually 11,000 users

196
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:34,970
although that's that's very possible

197
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:37,490
so that gives you an idea again we're

198
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:41,420
looking at 47,000 people 13,000 people

199
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:43,280
this is a lot of infected devices the

200
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:46,130
second company is hollow spy hollow spy

201
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:48,500
is a Vietnamese company the guy who runs

202
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:53,810
so spy runs about six or seven different

203
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:58,370
companies and they markets to different

204
00:07:53,810 --> 00:08:00,380
areas of the world depending so I'm not

205
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:03,320
a photographer by the way apologies for

206
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:06,380
the map quality but this is a clustering

207
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:07,520
of the GPS coordinates so at the time of

208
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:09,650
the database leaked there was one

209
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:13,070
thousand seven hundred active infections

210
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:14,719
and I took the GPS logged for each one

211
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:19,010
of those active infections the first

212
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:22,190
instance as the point of origin so they

213
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:23,690
may have moved around the devices but

214
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:26,960
this is the first time that they were

215
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:28,940
ever registered with host by so as you

216
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:31,669
can see we have some scattered through

217
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:33,470
North America some in Europe South Asia

218
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:36,950
is a hot spot and we'll look more

219
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:39,020
closely at that yeah this is Europe

220
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:42,020
obviously there are a few in London

221
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:44,569
there's one up in Scotland and the rest

222
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:46,040
is sort of scattered throughout but when

223
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:49,730
we get to Bangladesh we can see that

224
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:50,569
this is the the main number of users

225
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:53,540
that were

226
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:55,100
active at that time I kind of wondered

227
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:57,290
about this have looked for a specific

228
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:59,300
Bangladeshi marketing that they've done

229
00:08:57,290 --> 00:09:01,640
there's a few YouTube videos I think

230
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:04,010
maybe they're taking at Google ads I'm

231
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:05,510
not entirely certain something I need to

232
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:07,280
look into more but it shows the

233
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:09,770
localization that a Vietnamese company

234
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:11,800
would be selling to this amount of

235
00:09:09,770 --> 00:09:14,420
people in Bangladesh

236
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:16,339
so devising solutions to all of this

237
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:19,760
because this is a problem that needs to

238
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:21,830
be solved so first of all we have

239
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:26,060
antivirus this is a really good paper

240
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:27,770
that details a lot of things to do with

241
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:30,920
stock whoever's specifically they tested

242
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:33,590
the efficiency of antivirus apps to

243
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:35,870
detect stalker work and it goes into

244
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:39,980
some detail as to how good these apps

245
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:41,780
are eva at the e FF has been trying to

246
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:44,660
encourage antivirus companies to take

247
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:45,980
this problem more seriously and I think

248
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:47,900
that is having some effect as we saw

249
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:50,060
with Kaspersky they're now giving a more

250
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:52,340
strenuous warning when they detect this

251
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:53,510
software instead of just sort of vaguely

252
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:56,540
worded one that people might not

253
00:09:53,510 --> 00:10:00,230
understand this is coming back to

254
00:09:56,540 --> 00:10:03,920
Kaspersky's statistics on detected

255
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:05,510
stalker where now what's important about

256
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:07,040
this is that when I first saw the

257
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:09,290
statistics and this was earlier this

258
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:11,630
year I'd never heard of these three apps

259
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:13,189
and I had to go searching for them and

260
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:14,750
the reason I'd never heard about them is

261
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:16,400
because they are specifically Russian

262
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:18,800
they're marketed in the Russian language

263
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:19,850
and two Russian users so it's important

264
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,890
once again when you think about

265
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:24,050
localization with these apps that if you

266
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:26,569
install Kaspersky and you expect it to

267
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:27,979
detect stalker where if these are the

268
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:29,390
main variants of stock or that they're

269
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:32,660
detecting and this is skewed heavily

270
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:34,550
towards Russian apps so it's not really

271
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:36,439
one size fits all I'd be very interested

272
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:38,599
to see there the detection rates of

273
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:43,520
stock aware that that are more common in

274
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:45,020
the West so the main thrust of how I

275
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:47,210
think this problem can be solved is

276
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:47,510
through cutting off the money as simple

277
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:49,730
as that

278
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:51,170
PayPal processes an awful lot of

279
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:52,640
payments for these companies they need

280
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:56,500
to transfer money somehow they need to

281
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:59,360
avoid local taxes and PayPal is sort of

282
00:10:56,500 --> 00:11:02,690
seemingly willing partner in this

283
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,779
they're basically allowing violations of

284
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:06,149
the Terms of Service

285
00:11:03,779 --> 00:11:08,879
by allowing companies that are marketing

286
00:11:06,149 --> 00:11:12,600
specifically products that are designed

287
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:15,329
to break the law and it would be I think

288
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:17,459
very advantageous to cut off this flow

289
00:11:15,329 --> 00:11:19,680
of money so that these companies then

290
00:11:17,459 --> 00:11:24,508
would not have so much of a reason to

291
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:26,430
market so heavily this is a spreadsheet

292
00:11:24,509 --> 00:11:28,790
that I came up with myself it shows some

293
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:31,589
of the main stock of our companies and

294
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:36,480
as you can see PayPal is very heavily

295
00:11:31,589 --> 00:11:38,040
represented there there's another talk

296
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,660
on stock over later which I would

297
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:41,069
recommend that you all go to which is

298
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:46,649
going to deal more of a technical aspect

299
00:11:41,069 --> 00:11:48,240
and that is at 125 and this is my github

300
00:11:46,649 --> 00:11:49,499
as I mentioned earlier which goes into a

301
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:54,930
lot more detail than I was able to do

302
00:11:49,499 --> 00:12:04,529
here because of time so does anybody

303
00:11:54,930 --> 00:12:06,569
have any questions do not risk that if

304
00:12:04,529 --> 00:12:08,129
you cut off that PayPal access they'll

305
00:12:06,569 --> 00:12:11,309
go to other systems which are

306
00:12:08,129 --> 00:12:14,160
potentially more anonymous or even worse

307
00:12:11,309 --> 00:12:16,350
security wise and PayPal ease so that is

308
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:17,969
definitely concerned but I think this is

309
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:21,209
sort of a crime of opportunity in my

310
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:22,740
mind so people think about you know

311
00:12:21,209 --> 00:12:24,300
maybe I'll spy on my wife maybe I'll spy

312
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:26,639
on my husband they go online they've

313
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:28,889
used PayPal for eBay PayPal is safe to

314
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:30,930
them they're sending money to a shady

315
00:12:28,889 --> 00:12:31,949
company but PayPal to them is something

316
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:34,019
that they can trust

317
00:12:31,949 --> 00:12:36,269
if you force them from PayPal on to a

318
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:37,889
less reputable service people are less

319
00:12:36,269 --> 00:12:39,809
likely to send their money I think and

320
00:12:37,889 --> 00:12:41,639
if you force them down to using Bitcoin

321
00:12:39,809 --> 00:12:43,500
a lot of people are just going to not

322
00:12:41,639 --> 00:12:47,069
bother at that point they're going to be

323
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:49,019
dissuaded you need to to take make the

324
00:12:47,069 --> 00:12:50,399
steps that are required for them to be

325
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:52,350
able to install this app on their wife

326
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:53,939
or husband's phone you need to make more

327
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:56,730
steps and you need to make it more

328
00:12:53,939 --> 00:13:03,379
complicated so that that's that's my

329
00:12:56,730 --> 00:13:05,440
thought on the matter any more questions

330
00:13:03,379 --> 00:13:07,750
