1
00:00:03,589 --> 00:00:06,600
hi everyone thanks for coming to my talk

2
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:08,790
today

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:11,550
Toki's usernames the missing piece of

4
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:13,230
the ocean jigsaw puzzle but before we

5
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:15,560
kick off just a little bit about myself

6
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:18,000
I'm Simon Hall security sire on Twitter

7
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:19,560
I've been in the industry now for over

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,170
10 years so while I'm on the rocker

9
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:24,479
brookie talk first time speaking but

10
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:27,150
I've got a wealth of Industry background

11
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:29,550
so I came from a network in the security

12
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:30,959
background moving through pentesting red

13
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:33,180
teaming blue team in as well

14
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,790
and with a kind of a background in ocean

15
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:37,170
as well where you know working on CBEST

16
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:40,379
engagements and various other bits and

17
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:42,180
pieces I'm a principal security engineer

18
00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:44,129
had digital shadows but I do research

19
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:48,420
into various kind of tools and

20
00:00:44,129 --> 00:00:50,160
techniques CVEs exploits I do a lot of

21
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:52,140
blogging and podcast there as well as

22
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:56,279
well as leading the red team for digital

23
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:57,899
shadows internal as well so why

24
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:01,410
recycling isn't so good for your

25
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:02,910
environment and so I guess we we all see

26
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:05,158
kind of common law identifies when it

27
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:07,170
comes down to user accounts and user

28
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:09,479
profiles and there are many Pro

29
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:10,890
identifies for a particular account but

30
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:12,630
there are several that are commonly

31
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:14,610
reused so we all know about password

32
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:16,949
reuse and how bad it is for an

33
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:19,680
environment right we can take a a

34
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:21,090
password as an attacker and we can get

35
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,939
initial access with it or we can use it

36
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:25,380
for a lateral movement or anything else

37
00:01:22,939 --> 00:01:27,720
photos we can take a photo from

38
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:29,908
someone's profile and we can use that as

39
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:32,369
a kind of pivot point to identify other

40
00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:34,079
profiles as well and then we come on to

41
00:01:32,369 --> 00:01:37,040
user names as well where we can take a

42
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:39,029
single user name and have a one-to-many

43
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:41,250
relationship so we can take that user

44
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:42,780
name and identify kind of you know 15

45
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:46,320
other accounts with the same user name

46
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:47,909
as well so hopefully everyone here is

47
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,369
familiar with password reuse some why

48
00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:53,159
it's bad so we can take a single

49
00:01:50,369 --> 00:01:54,540
password and information from a

50
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:56,520
particularly user account and we can

51
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:58,560
gain access to many online accounts if

52
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:00,179
someone's reusing the same password or

53
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,530
if you're on our pentest engagement and

54
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:02,759
even cows and we gain access to a

55
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:04,680
machine that's been cloned across an

56
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:06,509
environment we may be able to take again

57
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:08,220
a single password and administrator

58
00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:09,899
account and gain access to hundreds if

59
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:11,910
not thousands machines we've all been

60
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:13,710
there on pen test engagements

61
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:15,750
so we can perform passwords Graham can

62
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:19,560
perform pass air pass the hash and

63
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:22,440
whatever else and result in shells so

64
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:23,850
one of the lesser kind of pieces of

65
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:25,200
information that I've seen out there and

66
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:26,940
I've done a lot of work with this in the

67
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,190
past is and I don't really see many

68
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:30,960
people talking about it is is image

69
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:33,300
reuse so if you've got a professional

70
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:34,890
networking profile out there and you've

71
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:36,240
got a photon there the chances are you

72
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:38,640
didn't create that photo for that

73
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:40,020
particular profile and you created it on

74
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,339
your holiday with your family or

75
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:43,200
wherever and you've used that on your

76
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:44,880
profile now we can actually take that

77
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:47,190
image and we can reverse look it up

78
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:49,470
using Google Image Search or we can use

79
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:51,480
Ti or whatever else we want to use and

80
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:54,600
we can go from a professional persona

81
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:56,549
where there's limited information down

82
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:58,200
to a potentially a personal persona

83
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:58,950
where you may be disclosing more

84
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,230
information

85
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:02,310
so there's actually quite a nice pivot

86
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:04,019
point there and I've actually gained

87
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:08,040
some really good information from doing

88
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:10,710
this so the username debate so the main

89
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:13,019
talk is around usernames I said whenever

90
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:14,370
I discussed usernames and kind of their

91
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:16,380
relevance in open source intelligence

92
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:17,760
with people there's a lot of kind of

93
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:19,560
come back and people saying it's

94
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,120
pointless one of the things there's you

95
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:23,550
know user names should be assumed to be

96
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,380
public information 100% agree where that

97
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:27,150
right we've all got it to it we've got

98
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:29,400
some people have Instagram whatever else

99
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:30,990
we're you know we want those likes we

100
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:33,209
want those retweets we want people to

101
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:35,910
share our information so the user name

102
00:03:33,209 --> 00:03:37,920
should be public the problem comes when

103
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:39,840
we have a user name that is bleeding

104
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:42,359
into our personal lives we use the same

105
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:44,670
same handle as the Twitter on our

106
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:47,010
Instagram on a Facebook we use that on

107
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:49,049
our ISP profile we use it on any of the

108
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:50,910
provider profiles out there and this

109
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:52,410
gives a bigger attack surface for the

110
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:55,829
attackers to actually start being out to

111
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:58,260
identify information moment person user

112
00:03:55,830 --> 00:04:00,660
names a useless alone couldn't disagree

113
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:02,399
with this more it's not a silver bullet

114
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:04,440
it never will be you know it's not like

115
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:07,410
final ascetic credentials in bridge data

116
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:09,120
but we can take a user name if it's the

117
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:10,890
only identifier we've got for an

118
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,510
individual we've run out of kind of

119
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:14,820
information on the reamer addresses we

120
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:16,890
can't find anything on those but we've

121
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:18,540
managed to find a twitter handle we take

122
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:19,829
that for that personal pair for that

123
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:21,690
person we can throw it into our

124
00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:22,260
impersonal breach data if we have it to

125
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:24,539
identify

126
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:25,680
email addresses passwords password

127
00:04:24,539 --> 00:04:27,449
hashes

128
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,370
physical addresses whatever out so we

129
00:04:27,449 --> 00:04:31,560
can do a lot of things with a particular

130
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:33,240
username we can even throw it into some

131
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:35,340
it like name check and we can discover

132
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:37,710
in you know 15 20 different accounts

133
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:39,030
from a single username so there are a

134
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:41,940
lot of things we can actually do with

135
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:43,859
that say nothing about me this is

136
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:46,289
normally mr. sis boots obviously got

137
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:48,240
everything locked down you know their

138
00:04:46,289 --> 00:04:50,550
accounts are all randomly generated for

139
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,620
every single service but that's not the

140
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:54,570
case we're targeting VIPs we're

141
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:57,139
targeting or the attackers attack on an

142
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:59,699
individual in an organization where

143
00:04:57,139 --> 00:05:01,199
they've been educated about password

144
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:03,780
complexity they've been educated about

145
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:06,330
password reuse and everything else but

146
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:08,219
how many people are educated around user

147
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:10,620
names not containing your year of birth

148
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:13,650
your country code your first name

149
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:15,090
surname first initial surname and you

150
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:16,409
know there's not a lot of education

151
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:18,060
around this so a password it can

152
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:19,710
actually sorry a using can actually

153
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:24,509
disclose a lot of information about a

154
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:25,620
particular individual and often does so

155
00:05:24,509 --> 00:05:28,080
I'm going to run through this one pretty

156
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:29,430
quickly due to time but you know there

157
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,680
are a lot of methods out there where we

158
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:34,590
can gather usernames for an individual

159
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,970
last year we saw the OpenSSH in a user

160
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:37,739
enumeration vulnerability

161
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:39,720
it's a brute-force method but you know

162
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:41,639
it's still quite valuable for

163
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:44,729
identifying where devs might log in to a

164
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:46,560
particular organization you know every

165
00:05:44,729 --> 00:05:48,630
website out there these days still has

166
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,970
some form of using a user numeration

167
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:53,460
through password resets or for account

168
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:57,330
creation and on bug bounties are often

169
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:59,489
excluded but we also see RDP with no NRA

170
00:05:57,330 --> 00:06:01,740
so we can actually scrape usernames from

171
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:03,090
those really easily but to be fair it's

172
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:07,020
got RDP open these days you've got

173
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:09,359
bigger problems so one of the key

174
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:11,789
examples I absolutely love when it comes

175
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,360
to gathering user names and user name

176
00:06:11,789 --> 00:06:14,130
disclosure

177
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:15,659
Plusnet I'm sure a lot of people here

178
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:17,880
familiar with Plusnet has a an

179
00:06:15,659 --> 00:06:20,669
organization you know pretty good ISP

180
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:22,139
and actually one of the only a handful

181
00:06:20,669 --> 00:06:24,448
of ISPs in the UK that will give you a

182
00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:26,130
static IP address as a domestic customer

183
00:06:24,449 --> 00:06:29,099
and one of the things that's

184
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:31,080
lesser-known about this is that they

185
00:06:29,099 --> 00:06:32,759
actually associate if you have a static

186
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:34,650
IP address with Plusnet they will

187
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:37,139
associate your username for your account

188
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:38,760
with your IP address so if someone gains

189
00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:39,360
your IP address in here using the static

190
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:41,490
IP

191
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,919
with those they can do a reverse lookup

192
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:45,870
and look at the PTR records for for that

193
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:47,340
particular IP address and they can

194
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:48,050
actually gain your username really

195
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:51,479
easily

196
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:52,979
so from that there can be limited from

197
00:06:51,479 --> 00:06:54,990
an IP address through to a particular

198
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:57,568
person's face book profile whatever else

199
00:06:54,990 --> 00:07:00,000
so I did a quick piece of research on

200
00:06:57,569 --> 00:07:02,610
this and took 1/17 I was able to find

201
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,020
13,000 unique user names and company

202
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:06,750
names and I want to be more research

203
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:08,400
into this but from a manual kind of dig

204
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:10,379
into some of these I was able to find

205
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:12,659
Facebook account so as they provide

206
00:07:10,379 --> 00:07:14,479
Twitter accounts and numerous other

207
00:07:12,659 --> 00:07:17,610
things by punching in july-- name check

208
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:20,250
but in one particular example I found a

209
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:22,259
dues name check found a gift github

210
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:24,690
prepaid further person found a Facebook

211
00:07:22,259 --> 00:07:26,490
account and the github repo actually

212
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:27,900
contained information about service they

213
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:30,870
were running on the same static IP

214
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:32,310
address so you know it can be a valuable

215
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:36,539
piece of information and this is all

216
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:40,050
going from a single username so the life

217
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:42,419
cycle would be username so the problem

218
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:44,099
with usernames is right we can generate

219
00:07:42,419 --> 00:07:46,318
them whatever we want but they will

220
00:07:44,099 --> 00:07:48,300
follow us through our life so a part of

221
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:49,529
username can be nonsensical in a sense

222
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:52,409
we can generate it with whatever

223
00:07:49,529 --> 00:07:54,150
characters we want but people were lazy

224
00:07:52,409 --> 00:07:57,360
we're all lazy we're all guilty of it

225
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:59,159
will create username with a identifier

226
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,839
of some kind in it you know whether

227
00:07:59,159 --> 00:08:03,300
there is the year of birth whether it is

228
00:08:00,839 --> 00:08:04,289
our first name surname or just a

229
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:06,240
nickname that we've gone through

230
00:08:04,289 --> 00:08:08,068
childhood you know we'll we start off

231
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,629
gaming we'll create a game a handle but

232
00:08:08,069 --> 00:08:12,000
we'll go from one game to another game

233
00:08:09,629 --> 00:08:13,889
then it becomes a part of our email

234
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,690
address what is the local part during

235
00:08:13,889 --> 00:08:18,419
like a gmail creation or whatever else

236
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:21,089
and you know after 10 years you've now

237
00:08:18,419 --> 00:08:23,520
got it using them as actually inserted

238
00:08:21,089 --> 00:08:25,440
into your whole life and we can use that

239
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,639
information to kind of profile

240
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:30,330
particular individual a lot more

241
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:31,680
accurately so we can take if we just

242
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:33,088
have a username we can take that and

243
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:36,839
throw it into forgotten passwords on

244
00:08:33,089 --> 00:08:39,390
various services Facebook on the Left

245
00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:41,550
eBay on the right I believe and we can

246
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:43,559
use just a username and try and get some

247
00:08:41,549 --> 00:08:45,689
more information from these examples we

248
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:48,479
can actually try and guess some of the

249
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:50,819
information about email address Facebook

250
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,709
for example will just give you the first

251
00:08:50,819 --> 00:08:53,130
and last characters and the email

252
00:08:52,709 --> 00:08:55,979
address

253
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:57,780
and just start up the rest a bay will do

254
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:59,340
the same but truncate that as well but

255
00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:01,589
at least we face but you actually have

256
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:02,970
an accurate count of the characters as

257
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:05,310
well so you can use that as kind of

258
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:07,530
their identifier shrank guess that email

259
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:09,689
address in next example it's two

260
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:11,699
services you found fifteen services you

261
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:13,920
found twenty services of thirty services

262
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:15,840
you can then take that information and

263
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,640
collate it and make a bigger picture for

264
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:20,130
a particular individual some of these

265
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:22,590
services are really noisy Facebook for

266
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:25,170
instance will just email the person so

267
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:26,850
there's not great as an example to be

268
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:28,530
fair but as I say when you've got about

269
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:30,300
thirty different services out there to

270
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:33,540
go from someone's created a user account

271
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:36,930
across a mall then the there kind of the

272
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:38,699
picture becomes clear so once we've

273
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:40,319
actually ascertained the email address

274
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:42,270
we can go for the standard processor

275
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,640
foreign it into breach data if we have

276
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:46,829
access to that to find passwords and

277
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:48,930
other email addresses associated for

278
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:51,810
addresses and anything else we want to

279
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:53,520
to gather but we can also just take the

280
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:56,640
the username again if we have that rich

281
00:09:53,520 --> 00:10:00,090
data and do a initial search from as

282
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:02,670
well so you know a username is useless

283
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:05,370
alone that's an inaccurate statement we

284
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:07,170
can do a lot whether user name and you

285
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:11,010
know attackers do and we do when we do

286
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:13,439
Osen as well so just a quite quick

287
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:15,720
wrap-up on this what we should be doing

288
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:18,180
we should be educating users and

289
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:20,010
ourselves that user names well they

290
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:22,439
should be public for our likes and

291
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:25,800
that's we need to retweet whatever right

292
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:28,920
we should not blur the lines between our

293
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:31,319
kind of service providers like our ISPs

294
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:33,120
and kind of Twitter handles and the

295
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:34,950
github accounts and everything else we

296
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,210
should be making sure and educating

297
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:37,980
people that there is a difference

298
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:40,050
between the username you use from one

299
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:42,180
service and the username you use for

300
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:44,010
another one and how these can be used to

301
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:46,079
against you you say over the password

302
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:47,819
reset stuff the accounts will give you

303
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:49,770
phone numbers partial phone numbers

304
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:51,900
partial email addresses if you do this

305
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:53,400
across 30 different accounts you can

306
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:56,010
actually overlap that information and

307
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:57,449
gain almost full telephone numbers done

308
00:10:56,010 --> 00:10:59,130
this in cases where I've actually been

309
00:10:57,450 --> 00:11:01,050
two characters short before mobile

310
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:03,540
number just from using various services

311
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:04,599
so we need to be more careful and kind

312
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:06,640
of

313
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:08,680
be cautious about how we you reuse

314
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:11,230
credentials and we use photos as well

315
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:13,209
and don't overlook seemingly unimportant

316
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:15,240
pieces of information such as a username

317
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:17,740
or something else because these

318
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:19,240
breadcrumbs can lead to a full chronic

319
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:20,770
jigsaw puzzle coming together when it

320
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:23,440
comes to our patrons those intelligence

321
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:25,360
and if you do have a certify P address

322
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:27,220
with plus net drop em a message and ask

323
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:31,060
them to remove your user name from their

324
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:42,480
DNS records but that's it and thank you

325
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:42,479
any questions do we have any questions

326
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:51,850
silence you don't want to know don't go

327
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:57,819
good but know the humor dress was made

328
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:59,410
up so okay it doesn't seem to have any

329
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:01,530
questions so thank you very much thank

330
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:01,530
you
