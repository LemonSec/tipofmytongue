1
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:08,250
so thank you very much for coming

2
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:10,260
my name is Jack Rudy Jones I'm

3
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:15,240
University South Wales and I got to that

4
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:18,330
man so all my presentations about is how

5
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:22,350
we can actually make a little phone this

6
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:24,209
is all for 2999 Mazdas to do some

7
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:27,630
interesting and weird and wonderful

8
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:32,570
things that can be useful for red

9
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:35,640
teaming and investigative journalism or

10
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:37,200
various other areas but on a sort of

11
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:38,879
shoestring so you don't need to break

12
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,559
the bank to the ff8 you're right teaming

13
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:43,230
engagement go through the room

14
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:45,750
so like I said my name is Jerry Jones so

15
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:48,239
I also go by exa I'm from the University

16
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:50,519
of South Wales and doing my PhD in

17
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:52,890
security operations and I teach the

18
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:55,079
arcane art that PHP is bhavish quite a

19
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:56,640
lot of my students didn't like and then

20
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:58,920
the other guy that was supposed to be

21
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:02,100
here Matthew Evans is a security

22
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:05,369
researcher as well and he goes by monk

23
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:09,229
some of you may know him already and if

24
00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:13,470
you want to see our blogs roll a lot so

25
00:01:09,229 --> 00:01:16,229
what what is this talk about well it is

26
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:18,360
about this little phone and the process

27
00:01:16,229 --> 00:01:20,460
that we've done to be able to develop

28
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:23,460
her and reasons why we got to this point

29
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:25,889
and then what we've actually gotten it

30
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:28,740
and the end goal here and the hurdles

31
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:31,829
that we've done so with me a monk

32
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:33,839
there's always a question of can we

33
00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:35,699
stick Debian on a device and we've got

34
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,890
pretty successful at that point in doing

35
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:40,920
yeah we can put Debian almost anything

36
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:43,920
other than a Cisco router because they

37
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:45,479
just don't like us so we thought could

38
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,640
we actually put Debian on for a phone

39
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:50,549
well that's been done quite a lot

40
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:54,000
already if you've seen how Dean at

41
00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:57,149
Hunter that's the Debian base and they

42
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,610
use chroot and CPI OS to be able to do

43
00:01:57,149 --> 00:02:01,549
to them and the problem is when it comes

44
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:06,329
to actually doing something a bit more

45
00:02:01,549 --> 00:02:08,489
covert or sneaky it having that hunter

46
00:02:06,329 --> 00:02:10,440
becomes quite expensive and it's quite

47
00:02:08,489 --> 00:02:12,750
noticeable you need a fairly powerful

48
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:13,620
device like the Naxos which can set you

49
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:16,290
back quite

50
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:21,480
if if you're doing a red team engagement

51
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:23,730
if you like an SME example so we thought

52
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:28,349
how do we sort of make this a bit better

53
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:30,209
how do we improve this we came into

54
00:02:28,349 --> 00:02:32,640
quite a lot of hurdles at this point and

55
00:02:30,209 --> 00:02:34,290
a lot of the time SELinux was one of the

56
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,410
causes that stopped us carrying on our

57
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:39,420
development because you can't actually

58
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:42,390
stop it from working selinux will always

59
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:45,450
be on on the phone it says passive but

60
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:47,390
it's still running and it'll still stop

61
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:50,280
you from doing weird wonderful things

62
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:54,000
and then one of the common friends that

63
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:55,950
methods to be able to detect the phone

64
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,500
and be able to interact with the phone

65
00:02:55,950 --> 00:03:01,349
in an investigation is using what's

66
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:04,860
called the ADB bridge so for anybody

67
00:03:01,349 --> 00:03:07,140
that's done it before may know the ADB

68
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:09,420
bridge is just a common port where you

69
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:10,980
can connect to it it'll and give you the

70
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:14,518
underlying operating system like if you

71
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:16,768
connect into like an SSH for example so

72
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:20,310
our aim was to be able to disable that

73
00:03:16,769 --> 00:03:23,459
both permanently but also remotely being

74
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:26,040
able to embark on a lot and then adding

75
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:28,790
further functionality and anti forensics

76
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:31,950
because we want our device to be able to

77
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:34,048
help those investigators and red teamers

78
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:36,929
but if they're caught you don't learn to

79
00:03:34,049 --> 00:03:38,190
be that risk in a situation where they

80
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:40,170
could be compromised and it could ruin

81
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:43,440
the entire right team engagement or it

82
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:46,349
could ruin a sort of investigation that

83
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:49,019
they're doing and then the other point

84
00:03:46,349 --> 00:03:50,970
is that with storage limitations

85
00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:54,269
you don't want because most IOT devices

86
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:56,280
and mobile phones limit on storage you'd

87
00:03:54,269 --> 00:03:58,530
want to take up a massive amount of data

88
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:02,459
which could be spent on doing like

89
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:03,780
videos or photos or recordings and then

90
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:05,549
we also want it to be affordable

91
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:10,049
that was these are pretty much all the

92
00:04:05,549 --> 00:04:12,900
main goals so we came to the ideal

93
00:04:10,049 --> 00:04:15,480
scenario so this is an Alcatel pixie

94
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:18,060
fall I think if I remember rightly which

95
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:20,820
is full Android device you can take

96
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:24,380
pictures you do all the kids it's cheap

97
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:27,190
I got it from Asda at $29.99

98
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:29,800
it's how you deniable

99
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:31,330
people have two phones these days I mean

100
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:34,930
you could raise a flag saying why we got

101
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:36,700
this tree really open but and then it's

102
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:38,200
easy to root so it was a proof of

103
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:40,539
concept it makes a really good way of

104
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:42,520
doing something it's really easy to use

105
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:44,620
it's quite intuitive and it's also

106
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:46,299
running Android so there's there's the

107
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:50,400
ideal scenario that's why we came to

108
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:53,670
this firm is our our main goal

109
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:56,409
so our first process was right

110
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:58,660
Debian is massive what can we do to make

111
00:04:56,410 --> 00:05:00,670
it a bit smaller so what we've done is

112
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:04,060
use tiny core so tiny core comes in

113
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:06,730
three or four different components which

114
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:10,350
are all ranging from about eight Meg to

115
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:14,470
15 Megan sighs so you immediately go

116
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:16,540
away from this one gig size Debian image

117
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:20,640
that you would have in Kali Linux for

118
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:23,500
example so now have been a really small

119
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:25,330
operating system which you can then hide

120
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:28,390
into the actual phone's memory without

121
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:31,210
causing degradation aggradation on the

122
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:33,610
actual phone in the long run and then

123
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:37,390
the next part is that we use a cpio to

124
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:40,900
be able to load and add this in content

125
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:45,370
to our phone so in here we've got a 32

126
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:48,640
Meg operating system with Python a VPN a

127
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:53,020
network stack and a few more wonderful

128
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:55,450
gadgets involve as well and then what we

129
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:58,359
can also do is say right we've got our

130
00:05:55,450 --> 00:06:00,099
small L package what can we do to be

131
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:02,320
able to just apply it we don't want

132
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:03,640
people to become a software developer

133
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,810
just to be able to do a red team

134
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:07,930
engagement or just make your phone

135
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:10,030
quickly so we build scripts to be able

136
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:11,560
to just you buy your phone you plug it

137
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:12,909
into your laptop you run the script you

138
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:15,460
can have got a red teaming device or

139
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:18,490
you've got some form of covert device

140
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:20,890
they can use but then we've also allowed

141
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:22,780
to be able to have a remote operator on

142
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:24,070
the back end so if you're walking around

143
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:25,780
taking pictures or using the

144
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:28,540
functionality of the phone you can have

145
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:30,849
a remote operator in the background and

146
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:33,460
then with the cpio

147
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:35,169
we can get all these tools and we can do

148
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:37,840
some weird and wonderful compression in

149
00:06:35,169 --> 00:06:40,090
the fat in in the states to deal with

150
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:41,169
forensic analysts so one of the things

151
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:44,469
that we

152
00:06:41,169 --> 00:06:46,330
is that G said compression makes it

153
00:06:44,469 --> 00:06:48,729
really interesting to stop data carving

154
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:52,748
which is a common practice in forensic

155
00:06:48,729 --> 00:06:55,300
analysis and then mobile but then

156
00:06:52,749 --> 00:06:57,759
because it's also read-only if the phone

157
00:06:55,300 --> 00:07:00,129
is restarted it dies anything that was

158
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:02,409
saved on the phone is then taken off so

159
00:07:00,129 --> 00:07:04,869
if you taken pictures which is saved

160
00:07:02,409 --> 00:07:07,539
into this operating system if you get

161
00:07:04,869 --> 00:07:09,849
caught or phone inevitably does die

162
00:07:07,539 --> 00:07:12,099
although images that have been destroyed

163
00:07:09,849 --> 00:07:14,139
so if you do get caught there's no

164
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:20,438
actual evidence of you doing anything

165
00:07:14,139 --> 00:07:22,689
wrong so and I've talked about this this

166
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:25,959
little operating system and what we've

167
00:07:22,689 --> 00:07:28,330
done is used what's called Satan mod 13

168
00:07:25,959 --> 00:07:31,300
so we've modified the phone to be able

169
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:33,519
to do this Ruta cool device we've

170
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:36,099
side-loaded it with the the fact that

171
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:38,019
quite commonly a lot of people will

172
00:07:36,099 --> 00:07:41,139
either run different operating systems

173
00:07:38,019 --> 00:07:45,909
like a bunch of touch lineage which is

174
00:07:41,139 --> 00:07:47,979
the increase of it and sailfish and it's

175
00:07:45,909 --> 00:07:49,719
quite common to see this so if anybody

176
00:07:47,979 --> 00:07:51,068
does say why if you've got two operating

177
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:53,319
systems on your phone or why is your

178
00:07:51,069 --> 00:07:55,389
phone not using Android or Linux you can

179
00:07:53,319 --> 00:07:56,949
say well I like to run two things at the

180
00:07:55,389 --> 00:08:02,169
same time every one deal boots at some

181
00:07:56,949 --> 00:08:05,829
point Walla and so we get that level of

182
00:08:02,169 --> 00:08:07,568
deniability that way and then we can

183
00:08:05,829 --> 00:08:09,939
actually start developing our

184
00:08:07,569 --> 00:08:12,039
functionality because we've side-loaded

185
00:08:09,939 --> 00:08:14,729
this operating system we can still use

186
00:08:12,039 --> 00:08:17,829
the Android device we're not actually

187
00:08:14,729 --> 00:08:19,869
mangling any of Android so much to make

188
00:08:17,829 --> 00:08:22,899
it non usable because we actually wants

189
00:08:19,869 --> 00:08:24,519
people still use the phone so well

190
00:08:22,899 --> 00:08:27,189
almost what we're doing is almost making

191
00:08:24,519 --> 00:08:30,430
a wrapper around Android to be able to

192
00:08:27,189 --> 00:08:31,990
further our pause so some of the

193
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:36,759
functionality that we've used and devout

194
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:38,349
is USB tethering so if you're walking

195
00:08:36,759 --> 00:08:39,938
around a building for example a lot of

196
00:08:38,349 --> 00:08:42,479
the time people say can I just charged

197
00:08:39,938 --> 00:08:45,130
my phone and it's quite common question

198
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:47,889
but what is interesting is you can plug

199
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:49,839
the phone in and the the device will

200
00:08:47,889 --> 00:08:51,370
actually say it's charging but what's

201
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:53,990
actually happening is you're actually

202
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:57,110
adding a new network adapter

203
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:59,060
end of the server or your desktop and

204
00:08:57,110 --> 00:09:01,490
it'll start riru ting traffic straight

205
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:05,329
through the actual device out through a

206
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:06,980
4G SIM and then to whatever VPN pocket

207
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:11,209
actually got the back end of your your

208
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:13,190
network we've also got the VPN because

209
00:09:11,209 --> 00:09:16,130
we want all our data that's being

210
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:17,480
exfiltrated to be all encrypted we don't

211
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:19,550
want to see people and like friends

212
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:21,560
investigators to say they're taking out

213
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:26,300
three images that they're taking on day

214
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:28,160
X so that's how a process for that we've

215
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:30,260
got a gesture reader as well so what we

216
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:33,860
actually do is we've got Python sitting

217
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:36,170
in this site loaded okay us and it

218
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:37,880
listens for the API is within the

219
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:40,540
Android device so if you go across the

220
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:43,399
screen for example it'll say oh that's

221
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:46,010
hit these points in the screen let's

222
00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:48,649
take a picture but when it does that the

223
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:50,390
flash is then disabled the screen

224
00:09:48,649 --> 00:09:51,649
doesn't light up or anything so you

225
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:53,180
could just go like that you could be

226
00:09:51,649 --> 00:09:54,740
taking those pictures or you could be

227
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:56,449
walking around with your arms T sights

228
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:59,420
taking videos and turn the microphone on

229
00:09:56,450 --> 00:10:04,760
record and then finally be about the

230
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:06,620
photo as well so one of the things that

231
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:08,720
we found is that when it comes to

232
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:11,600
forensics quite a lot people try and do

233
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:13,940
anti forensics and it's quite hard and

234
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:16,100
one of the main things we find is

235
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:17,930
there's about three or four generic

236
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:20,050
steps when it comes to aunty forensics

237
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:23,060
or our forensic investigation sorry and

238
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:28,790
the first one saying right when it comes

239
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:31,189
to demonstrating a a an investigation we

240
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:33,380
need to first be able to get two images

241
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:35,029
that we can work on so the first image

242
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:38,810
will say right we've got all this data

243
00:10:35,029 --> 00:10:40,310
with a like a checksum or hash and then

244
00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:43,420
we take the second image and then

245
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:48,109
compare so our hashes should be the same

246
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:49,640
because our device is hidden in RAM when

247
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:51,470
it's loaded we can actually start

248
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:54,230
editing parts of dead memory within the

249
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:56,180
phone so it starts to disable that part

250
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:58,670
of the integrity track so you won't ever

251
00:10:56,180 --> 00:11:01,969
get the same type of image or the end

252
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:04,910
goal so when it comes to doing say a

253
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:07,160
quarterback or investigation and you

254
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:07,610
peak orbit phone that images will never

255
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,380
marry

256
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:12,740
so you get that level of deniability

257
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:16,310
again and this is a similar theme all

258
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:18,680
the way through the phone yet the second

259
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:20,810
part in an investigation is then do a

260
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:23,839
live analysis and that comes down to

261
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:27,589
using things like cell right or other

262
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:30,500
phone tools which always apply to

263
00:11:27,589 --> 00:11:33,290
actually use the ADB bridge but like I

264
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:36,290
said earlier we actually disable the ADB

265
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:38,029
bridge from the outset because there's a

266
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:40,849
remote operator we can actually disable

267
00:11:38,029 --> 00:11:42,439
and re-enable the ADB bridge as you want

268
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:43,970
so you can start actually attacking the

269
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:46,850
forensic investigator remotely if

270
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:48,440
they're not using a priority cage and we

271
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:50,360
can start playing with some of our tools

272
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:51,350
when you're trying to connect with us so

273
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:54,110
you can actually start being quite

274
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:56,750
offensive in the long run and then

275
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:58,040
finally when it comes to the last part

276
00:11:56,750 --> 00:12:00,170
on investigation if you can't actually

277
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:01,550
find anything on the device because

278
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:05,810
there might be some form of protection

279
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:08,120
in the long run and you you've done your

280
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:10,099
imaging and it doesn't marry up you end

281
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:12,560
up doing a destructive analysis so we

282
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:14,329
actually take the be the chips off the

283
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:16,279
back and we try and read the memory on

284
00:12:14,329 --> 00:12:18,620
it but we go for a bit more of a caveman

285
00:12:16,279 --> 00:12:20,449
approach in that quite a lot of people

286
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:23,899
don't actually think about taking the

287
00:12:20,449 --> 00:12:25,430
back slowly off so we actually glue the

288
00:12:23,899 --> 00:12:27,050
back of the phone or the back of the

289
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:29,660
chips to the back of the phone so when

290
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:31,670
you actually pull back the phone off all

291
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:33,800
the chips rip up and now you've just

292
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:36,979
lost all in all your integrity of a

293
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:38,810
device so a game over at that point so

294
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:42,560
it was a bit of a caveman approach we

295
00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:45,529
got a bit of a bit more of an intuitive

296
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:48,219
way a bit more interesting way and then

297
00:12:45,529 --> 00:12:54,370
our caveman approach to really end it

298
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:54,370
yeah so I've got a video here hopefully

299
00:12:55,720 --> 00:13:02,540
so what this is is taking a remote

300
00:12:59,149 --> 00:13:08,149
picture from the phone without actually

301
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:17,529
changing the other devices Rhonda so of

302
00:13:08,149 --> 00:13:17,529
SSH into the phone whoo

303
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:34,090
hey I forgot I was looking at myself so

304
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:36,670
I searching into the phone now I'm

305
00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:38,440
connected to the phone we've got five

306
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:40,900
scripts ones are disabled the a degree

307
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:42,850
one to enable one to the phone and then

308
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:46,209
we've got the USB Ethernet field back

309
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:47,500
you generate a remote connection so what

310
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:50,350
I'm going to do first to show that there

311
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:52,870
is no images on the actual phone so this

312
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:54,700
will go into the actual operating system

313
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:56,860
the Android operating system will check

314
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:59,500
for any device any pictures and then we

315
00:13:56,860 --> 00:14:07,780
run the the photo script which wraps

316
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:09,310
around the actual Android VP is so now

317
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:11,530
we've taken an image we've stored it

318
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:13,329
into our slide loaded operating system

319
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:15,819
so at any point it doesn't actually hit

320
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:17,970
the Android device so it's now stored in

321
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:21,040
our read-only file system at that point

322
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:23,980
or close to it anyway so there's no

323
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:26,079
actual end goal for the Android device

324
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:28,480
to be able to store this in that actual

325
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:30,850
operating system and if any point we

326
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:32,680
just want to get rid of these images we

327
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:35,290
can either remotely take it off so if

328
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:36,579
you have a remote operator or we can

329
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:38,620
actually just turn the device off or

330
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:40,330
wait till we get home to be able to

331
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:46,510
either a get the images or delete the

332
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:50,170
images so and then and then intentive

333
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:53,380
our anti forensics type attacks so this

334
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:57,030
one is to compare the ADB bridge and how

335
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:59,740
we actually generate the connection so

336
00:14:57,030 --> 00:15:05,350
but again and your that associations of

337
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:07,300
phone I call me scripts so I'm going to

338
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:10,450
check to see if any ADB devices are

339
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:13,900
actually connected to my laptop says no

340
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:19,570
even though it is so I'm going to Nabal

341
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:22,329
it I know I can connect to the phone

342
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:25,300
again so I've got my actual standard ADB

343
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:27,550
in action so I can connect to the device

344
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:32,500
with a shell I can start enter item in

345
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:33,699
the back end of the device but ones if I

346
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,240
actually just don't want this to ever

347
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:36,279
happen

348
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:38,440
so someone actually tries to generate

349
00:15:36,279 --> 00:15:39,880
the the ADP bridge connection on the on

350
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:41,709
the phone itself by plugging the

351
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:43,870
developer screen over and over again

352
00:15:41,709 --> 00:15:46,479
what I can actually do is start saying

353
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:52,800
right okay let's let's turn that off by

354
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:56,110
just disabling the ADB and now we've

355
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:57,550
disabled ADB so devices like cell right

356
00:15:56,110 --> 00:16:00,610
won't be able to connect to the device

357
00:15:57,550 --> 00:16:13,510
anymore so we can now start to play with

358
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:16,240
the investigator in the long run so what

359
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:18,939
we have we've got an extremely small

360
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:22,450
operating system where we can see that

361
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:24,490
it fits into memory without actually

362
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:27,070
compromising the overall Android device

363
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:29,770
so you can still use it to make calls it

364
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:32,170
still uses all the standard operating

365
00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:34,240
system that you would see it doesn't

366
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:37,750
lock out place when you look at it in

367
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:41,230
person the entire operating system is

368
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:43,959
also hidden in the back of a file so if

369
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:47,800
you look in for the actual operating

370
00:16:43,959 --> 00:16:50,469
system the GZ compressed image is

371
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:52,209
sitting at the end of another file so

372
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:54,670
unless you know where to look it's quite

373
00:16:52,209 --> 00:16:57,670
hard to see why where to begin which is

374
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:59,529
always a bit of a paradox and then we

375
00:16:57,670 --> 00:17:00,969
can actually load and hide the running

376
00:16:59,529 --> 00:17:02,740
operating system or into the memory of

377
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:05,140
the device which is quite important

378
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:09,130
because we just want to die we have a

379
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:10,780
core and then we can also wrap all of

380
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:13,449
our functionality using Python all the

381
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:16,000
way around all the Android devices so we

382
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:18,339
can actually turn the microphone on we

383
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,380
can mess around with the gesture readers

384
00:17:18,339 --> 00:17:25,149
like we've just done and there's so much

385
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:28,209
more you did so one of the things that

386
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:31,920
became apparent is we there's a lot to

387
00:17:28,209 --> 00:17:34,510
be done in this operating system in that

388
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:36,460
we've got things like Kali now hunter

389
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:40,480
which is just the standard approach to

390
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:41,830
doing so embedded device Tim's a pen

391
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:44,169
testing where you've got this device

392
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:46,480
you've got hand testing tools you get to

393
00:17:44,169 --> 00:17:47,770
go but there hasn't been a lot in terms

394
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:50,580
of what other things can

395
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:53,290
due to the fear that this cause so

396
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:55,210
throughout this it's been apparent that

397
00:17:53,290 --> 00:17:58,720
selinux is really not your friend when

398
00:17:55,210 --> 00:18:00,910
you're doing development in mobile or or

399
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:04,600
embedded devices at any point if you're

400
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:06,700
using Android and then there's

401
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:08,590
particular areas in memory within the

402
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:10,210
Android device and I'm sure there is in

403
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:11,770
other operating systems as well where

404
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:15,400
you can actually hide a lot of your

405
00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:20,200
stuff so what we're using in ours is the

406
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:21,820
ATP Reserve memory space but Android has

407
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:23,470
stopped using that it's just that for

408
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:24,909
legacy so you can actually just hide

409
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:27,540
quite a lot of things in that without

410
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:30,190
ever being overwritten by something else

411
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:32,500
and then obviously the offensive

412
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:34,750
developer development regarding embedded

413
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:37,930
devices is should be further improved

414
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:41,440
quite a lot so some of the future work

415
00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:43,060
all the source code advice and all the

416
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:45,820
tools and everything will be on my

417
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:48,550
github there is an academic paper

418
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:50,980
written as well and then any updates

419
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:55,030
regarding the project itself will be on

420
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:56,110
our Twitter a lot of it will be released

421
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:59,980
at the end of the week which should be

422
00:18:56,110 --> 00:19:03,510
nice and there's my lovely silhouette as

423
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:03,510
well so thank you very much

424
00:19:09,639 --> 00:19:15,799
so we've just got some time for some

425
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:35,929
questions if anybody has any never at

426
00:19:15,799 --> 00:19:40,249
like I don't have a mic with me yeah so

427
00:19:35,929 --> 00:19:41,749
when it comes to doing Android using the

428
00:19:40,249 --> 00:19:43,909
Android operating system to be able to

429
00:19:41,749 --> 00:19:44,570
do say like using the camera and things

430
00:19:43,909 --> 00:19:47,059
like that

431
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:48,799
a lot of it is just used with python

432
00:19:47,059 --> 00:19:52,820
connecting to the android functionality

433
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:56,299
so the the api's that we built to wrap

434
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:59,269
around android underline and hook into

435
00:19:56,299 --> 00:20:01,668
the actual androids system call itself

436
00:19:59,269 --> 00:20:15,309
so we can actually trigger the out

437
00:20:01,669 --> 00:20:17,629
system call whenever we want yeah so

438
00:20:15,309 --> 00:20:21,350
we're actually migrated into it like at

439
00:20:17,629 --> 00:20:23,658
root and so we're actually doing is

440
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:25,639
saying right let's just Charlotte into

441
00:20:23,659 --> 00:20:30,070
that operating system itself not into

442
00:20:25,639 --> 00:20:30,070
the actual device nine times right yeah

443
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:35,119
[Music]

444
00:20:38,379 --> 00:20:43,549
it can be I think we used we use the

445
00:20:42,259 --> 00:20:45,139
latest version of Android all the time

446
00:20:43,549 --> 00:20:48,200
and you can update Android as much as

447
00:20:45,139 --> 00:20:51,769
you want so anything yeah any any

448
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:54,409
Android as well we did try and bought it

449
00:20:51,769 --> 00:20:56,389
through a cheap Chinese watch but the

450
00:20:54,409 --> 00:20:59,570
watch actually start to melt so I wasn't

451
00:20:56,389 --> 00:21:01,189
a good home especially I'm wearing on

452
00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:03,619
your hand it got really warm really

453
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:06,220
quick yeah you don't to start doing

454
00:21:03,619 --> 00:21:06,220
Kryptonian

455
00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:18,879
[Music]

456
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:45,270
so as in yep okay so intensive recording

457
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:47,549
so how can you constantly record when

458
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:50,429
you've given a back the device so when

459
00:21:47,549 --> 00:21:52,350
it comes to the tiny core you can build

460
00:21:50,429 --> 00:21:54,090
and compile compile whatever tools you

461
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:56,129
want into it there's quite a lot of

462
00:21:54,090 --> 00:21:57,540
scripts because it's using Python on the

463
00:21:56,130 --> 00:22:01,260
back end but you can use pretty much

464
00:21:57,540 --> 00:22:02,970
anything you can add further

465
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:05,760
functionality that way so if you always

466
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:07,740
want to trigger the recording whenever

467
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:09,929
the screen lights up you can look for

468
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:11,910
the system call for Android the screen

469
00:22:09,929 --> 00:22:14,040
write out and then it can trigger the

470
00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:18,360
next system call to then record the

471
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:20,190
device so if you wanted something like I

472
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:23,610
always want to have a microphone

473
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:26,220
listening so anytime someone clicks the

474
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:29,309
power button because that's got a power

475
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:31,470
ID within Android it'll and trigger the

476
00:22:29,309 --> 00:22:32,580
microphone and the in the long run and

477
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:35,190
start recording into the operating

478
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:36,418
system into your root the problem is you

479
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:37,950
should need to be careful about how much

480
00:22:36,419 --> 00:22:40,380
memory you're using to record something

481
00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:41,669
because if it goes quite large yeah

482
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:52,200
you're gonna start noticing some

483
00:22:41,669 --> 00:22:53,880
triggers anymore if anybody act as play

484
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:55,980
the questions I'll be around although

485
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:58,530
it's a do you want to come see me I'll

486
00:22:55,980 --> 00:23:01,400
be great cool okay another round of

487
00:22:58,530 --> 00:23:01,399
applause please to Jack
