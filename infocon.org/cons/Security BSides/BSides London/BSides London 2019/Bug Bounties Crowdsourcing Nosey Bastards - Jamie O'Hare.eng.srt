1
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:09,540
hi everybody my name is Jimmy and we can

2
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:11,820
apologize state of our class region so

3
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:13,399
if you don't know some accent just feel

4
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:16,529
kind of an hour repeat what I said and

5
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:19,439
so yeah as I said bug bite east coast

6
00:00:16,529 --> 00:00:21,600
nosy bastards it's quite hard to make a

7
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:23,310
title about bug bunnies and desktops

8
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,600
different from other ones you make a

9
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:27,119
scene of a book meniscus can be more

10
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:30,029
about the management of mobility systems

11
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:31,380
and as a part of a war is a part of my

12
00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:33,120
lecture review from a master's to

13
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:35,550
saltation however our transitioned away

14
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:38,430
a different topic and so it may not be

15
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:39,599
the best but I can say desktop is gonna

16
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:43,140
be at least better than the end game

17
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,910
influenced and at least I'll try to so

18
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:46,680
when it kind of make an assumption you

19
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:49,160
know about bunnies are you get monetary

20
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:50,370
awards for this causing vonabell is

21
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:53,279
responsibly

22
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:55,649
and we were start off by competing Bobo

23
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,960
needs to the methods we use to SMAP and

24
00:00:55,649 --> 00:01:01,230
track mundane bugs so your imperfections

25
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:04,470
and the case of you see on bug tracking

26
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:08,789
systems so going follow the compared bug

27
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:09,990
tracking to the ponies there's one

28
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:12,119
finally people share and that's

29
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:14,399
motivation is intrinsically motivated

30
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:16,229
you are submitting for about airports

31
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:19,770
for the betterment of a system be it

32
00:01:16,229 --> 00:01:21,960
from promotive and reward or not but the

33
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:25,320
extent of which their intrinsic

34
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:29,158
motivation goes varies between em the

35
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:31,289
the two different types yeah and we'll

36
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:32,729
get onto that well there's two major

37
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:35,250
differences and we start off with

38
00:01:32,729 --> 00:01:36,179
transparency bug tracking systems you'll

39
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:39,299
find them on mail

40
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:41,939
mailing lists and on public forums and a

41
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:45,049
stick in a help application and you

42
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:47,669
don't see that so on my berries because

43
00:01:45,049 --> 00:01:49,950
it's quite obvious security flaws you

44
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:51,270
don't want them beer in the public but

45
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:53,220
that strands part is a second has a

46
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:55,289
knock-on effect which application and Bo

47
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:58,530
tracking they don't want to get

48
00:01:55,290 --> 00:02:00,540
triplicates however and bunnies

49
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:04,170
duplicates are basically king of like

50
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:07,890
the I've got a boyfriend of my unicorn

51
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:11,970
it's a really hot it's like rejection on

52
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:13,950
the top level and so asking elite on our

53
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:15,599
first gain a problem that's triplication

54
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:18,839
problem which code the information must

55
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:21,929
match oh so that comes from economic

56
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:23,400
theory that's mess match term and we'll

57
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:26,569
get on to about more you cannot feel

58
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:29,250
they are but it basically boils down to

59
00:02:26,569 --> 00:02:31,530
we know what people want but we don't

60
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:33,930
provider and that's kind of shortcoming

61
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:37,110
to get around what people want is the

62
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:39,360
problem so if we look at the one we've

63
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:42,390
got a handy-dandy is all that was

64
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,860
updated last yeah and which covers you

65
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:45,988
what you should put and I wonder where

66
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:49,680
the port that's includes of course

67
00:02:45,989 --> 00:02:52,019
location step see production PLC work

68
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:54,269
media impact of any types of

69
00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:56,790
vulnerability rip causes discord your

70
00:02:54,269 --> 00:02:59,340
plans data discovery OS helps towards

71
00:02:56,790 --> 00:03:01,140
and the people who get their bug

72
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:04,110
reported to them just resolve it faster

73
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:06,089
and and as shown and service and

74
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:07,860
academic survey's and and there are

75
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:09,599
market material for the bike police have

76
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:12,870
some stuff but hacker one and borrowed

77
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:16,380
less leads to M faster resolution of

78
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:18,389
bugs not mentioned Ania so bestowed late

79
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:20,609
include are these additional ones I've

80
00:03:18,389 --> 00:03:26,400
got myself so supporting references

81
00:03:20,609 --> 00:03:27,870
isn't mentioned as much and the is all

82
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,519
but asking him just a little bit

83
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:32,100
footnote and then you've also got

84
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:33,480
potential commercials but of course bug

85
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:35,340
bounties you don't really know what's

86
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:37,170
going on behind the curtain so you can't

87
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:39,420
give up all the time good manners cost

88
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:41,309
nothing don't bear that that's kind of

89
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:43,410
self-explanatory and then finally

90
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:45,480
grandma Lee premium now put us on here

91
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:48,450
as a hope to try and get a sponsorship

92
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:50,399
offer grammar because it's really good

93
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:54,119
but also because it can get our point

94
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:56,220
that M easier to read vonabell reports

95
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:58,230
are actually result faster as well and

96
00:03:56,220 --> 00:04:00,420
what sounds quite self-explanatory but

97
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:03,209
it's something it comes up and academics

98
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:07,048
always quiet about but we don't love and

99
00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:09,630
last kind of a perfect world where we'll

100
00:04:07,049 --> 00:04:11,609
get what we want and learn from em from

101
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:14,099
nice and mesh mats exists so you don't

102
00:04:11,609 --> 00:04:16,289
get that you'll get they got so the

103
00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:18,719
guards got the void of details which

104
00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:20,880
self it's partly you've got bag ponies

105
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,680
which is quite a funny town so it's like

106
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,969
people doing both ponies and thanking

107
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:26,880
the phone the vulnerability or they find

108
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:27,810
a very mundane vulnerability they can be

109
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,630
really exploited

110
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:33,389
it's not worth I'm gonna throw the

111
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:35,700
castle but it'll beg for money and then

112
00:04:33,389 --> 00:04:37,770
a more exclusive version of us is

113
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:40,880
blackmail obviously this happens a lot

114
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:44,849
more and Mulvaney's because the monetary

115
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:46,560
reward than you can can use that so

116
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:49,770
that's what happened with uber without a

117
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:51,840
10 key maximum bigger what know that 100

118
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:53,940
grand basically and lastly which is

119
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,650
quite a sad way nothing as in foreign

120
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:58,919
languages that's just gonna sad reality

121
00:04:55,650 --> 00:05:00,900
of the worldwide kind of bitch about

122
00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:03,090
Bernie's it's an infeasible to hire

123
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:05,549
people who speak all the major languages

124
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:07,320
- then who can't do all the

125
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:08,760
vulnerabilities then she asked them and

126
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:11,550
they send them to the companies make

127
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:14,190
sure about and we moved on till the

128
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:16,710
worldwide and her heart's ability both

129
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:19,229
major platforms have about over 300

130
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:22,169
thousand accounts from over a hundred

131
00:05:19,229 --> 00:05:23,729
companies and then I've gained impact a

132
00:05:22,169 --> 00:05:26,430
couple India

133
00:05:23,729 --> 00:05:29,039
what you got 30 percent of the

134
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:35,430
population of a fill ecosystem on just

135
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:37,470
one on for one platform and I'm factor

136
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:43,380
Egypt and Argentina a factor at least

137
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:45,570
because these have the 17 points X 25

138
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:49,169
point - and for a points X which so that

139
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:51,780
the kind of multiplication about the

140
00:05:49,169 --> 00:05:54,330
median wage for software engineers this

141
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:56,159
is a bet they're wield marking I'm not

142
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:59,250
really fond of it myself because I

143
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,990
station on money and by individuals and

144
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:02,789
bug berries isn't it taken I can't do it

145
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:05,010
but brain is no everybody can afford

146
00:06:02,789 --> 00:06:09,000
fancy blue cars and go drive in London

147
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:11,520
mantra and the facts over here on the

148
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,810
Left gain a pointer so so you have the

149
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:15,150
Irish pair for the vulnerability is

150
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:16,919
about $500 that includes all the way

151
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:18,840
from your critical one is there just

152
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:20,760
mundane ones then you have only a

153
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:22,979
thousand hackers on this one platform

154
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:24,690
have earned over five thousand pound or

155
00:06:22,979 --> 00:06:26,400
five thousand dollars now so this goes

156
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:29,250
farther than place and the other dozen

157
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:31,799
America and so you have to paint furnace

158
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:33,360
there and then over a hundred hacker so

159
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:35,580
I came for them event over a hundred

160
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,919
grand and to hackers of end over a

161
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:39,539
million so it's one platform or 300,000

162
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:41,669
people and all two of people around over

163
00:06:39,539 --> 00:06:43,560
a million and this is worth

164
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:46,470
about fourteen point four percent of

165
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:48,890
that population what can fill time now

166
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:52,320
if you break their numbers it means that

167
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:54,240
97.5 have never received the bounty have

168
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:56,580
never been able to sail a vulnerability

169
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,890
to one of these platforms and that's

170
00:06:56,580 --> 00:07:00,120
quite a scary fact when you have 3000 or

171
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:03,150
your faint was pretty hundred thousand

172
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:05,190
people how can it was not the glimmer of

173
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:07,289
hope as of largest companies that have

174
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:11,040
been used so far only sex plus a half of

175
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:12,900
the four photos of Hobbs mm but FS keeps

176
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:16,830
on growing is it necessarily a good

177
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:20,760
thing as do more I more eyes mean the

178
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:22,590
bear and the answer is no and really

179
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:24,420
academic studies of kind of find out

180
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:27,239
there's a power law but I'm gonna put my

181
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:30,840
hands up I got an in out of my maths

182
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:32,640
classes school like a bank job I was I

183
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:34,560
don't know never I've killed so I don't

184
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:36,539
really understand what Parolo means but

185
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,910
I think it's something like does like

186
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:40,950
critical mass so there's like a point

187
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:42,840
where it hours and basically means that

188
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:45,450
if you get too many people looking at

189
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:47,849
your website and didn't above but he's

190
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:49,020
it's too many reports which then has a

191
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:51,570
knock-on effect for the implementation

192
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:53,880
and of the resolution you have too few

193
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:55,590
participants then you have very narrow

194
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:58,620
coverage of vulnerabilities from the

195
00:07:55,590 --> 00:08:00,750
what they can do but also very narrow or

196
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:03,210
very sparse coverage of your actual

197
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:04,980
organization and that can lead to the

198
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:06,659
worst case scenario which is have your

199
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:09,720
own about binary system anything again

200
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:12,450
popping is and people just aren't cement

201
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:14,940
and because you're secure that case of

202
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:16,830
the folks sense of security so you have

203
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:18,510
to manage Bob and ease and people who

204
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:19,740
interact with your system which grew

205
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:21,840
quite hard when they're all over the

206
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:25,470
world and another thing that complicates

207
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:27,330
is ha Hitler unity I can never say that

208
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:30,090
what this well is just a fancy academia

209
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:32,039
work for diverse every hacker is

210
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:33,539
definitely some people who really good

211
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:37,130
SQL injection so they were very good at

212
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:39,478
crosshedges captain I'm good neither and

213
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:41,340
but that's gonna place until what you

214
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:43,979
need to understand of people that are

215
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:45,390
interacting above your company they some

216
00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:49,170
people jackhole traits and some people

217
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:52,650
are one-trick ponies so one survey can

218
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:55,569
have that effects are that each analyzed

219
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:58,640
eighty-two bugbear programs and

220
00:08:55,570 --> 00:09:02,570
2520 hunters and they then fight three

221
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:04,610
archetypes so you have this triangle

222
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:06,770
which is adapted from the survey if your

223
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:09,830
specific hackles up here and they're

224
00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:13,010
people that focus on one project usually

225
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:16,150
due to debate the product or they're

226
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:17,930
like no organization then you have your

227
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:19,790
nonspecific which is very

228
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:22,339
self-explanatory they don't pack to one

229
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:24,980
specific organization they will go

230
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:28,460
across and the one kin a methodology

231
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:31,490
across many more and many organizations

232
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:34,060
on these ecosystems are less active and

233
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:37,040
the corner so that is the mean lets your

234
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:39,619
97.5% which talked about earlier these

235
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,910
people are really some about pennies and

236
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:46,850
if they are they'll give them one in the

237
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:49,850
same done so the nonspecific or the

238
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:51,860
motivation for these as obviously by

239
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:53,810
means for no specific people but for

240
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:55,880
specific ones it's got to be more

241
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:57,979
extrinsically focused they care about

242
00:09:55,880 --> 00:10:00,590
actually getting awarded off the company

243
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:02,210
beyond money they want to be and the

244
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:04,070
hall of fame they want to know their

245
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:05,630
security team they want to have a

246
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:07,970
personal communication with them and

247
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:09,650
when you don't do that you risk the

248
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:13,640
chance of them selling it to the black

249
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:15,590
market which is quite an Hallman and i

250
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,910
survey that has been done like a year

251
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:19,640
ago

252
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:21,319
so come back to non specific ones that

253
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:22,640
removes focused on money and i said

254
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,930
we're gonna dabble in our second

255
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:26,270
economic feeling when it comes to

256
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:29,209
balboni's and that is a sort of Saint

257
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:32,870
Petersburg paradox basically this is

258
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:35,480
just fancy term for the only taking an

259
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:38,480
expected value you do stupid decisions

260
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:39,650
and as a shouldn't I can say I've done

261
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,810
many things

262
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:43,880
hence why I got the Mega Buster last

263
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:47,750
night and get a backup tonight can't

264
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:49,820
afford a plane and when it comes to bout

265
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:52,640
bang is that means that we will think

266
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:54,770
that if we go to aware that every spin -

267
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:57,199
or I say our organization then we're not

268
00:10:54,770 --> 00:11:00,260
gonna get money there's not enough water

269
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:02,150
of the whale campaign and and ii can

270
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:04,610
assure this I've worked on here I've

271
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:06,860
staggered these two reports are just our

272
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:08,300
examples I've taught one is github and a

273
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:10,760
spot - slack and

274
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:13,550
we take for example the the slack but

275
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:16,520
Bernie came up first and there's a big

276
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:18,500
spike this is a civil paradox and then

277
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:20,390
we have the second one it starts our

278
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:23,240
weekly are over you can see how that

279
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:25,370
dies off and then that's one then packs

280
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:27,860
up this happens across your hacker one

281
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:29,300
is about crowds people jump to all the

282
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:30,980
programs and therefore you have a big

283
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:34,150
windfall and then everybody goes away

284
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:37,310
that his are struggling to retain in

285
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:44,510
active vulnerable a people smell fun

286
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:46,520
bellies and king of regularly so mostly

287
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:48,350
this happens to nonspecific who knows is

288
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:50,030
because they believe that obviously the

289
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:52,010
what money so they believe that

290
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:53,870
portfolio diversification it was a

291
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:56,360
return on investment for adopting a new

292
00:11:53,870 --> 00:12:00,410
methodology which is straight grammarly

293
00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:02,180
premium and so now you're going on to

294
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:04,280
kind of the conclusion of that this

295
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:05,780
basically can be seen these two things I

296
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:07,699
brought up this impels paradox the

297
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:10,189
hacking worldwide an information much

298
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:12,290
much can be seen as a consequence of gag

299
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:13,820
economy because we chased the money we

300
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:14,990
want this I'm at first we don't want to

301
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:18,110
deal with chip locations

302
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:19,520
I can also be seen as the downside of of

303
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:20,870
the diversity of hackles because we

304
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:22,939
think they were not good enough then

305
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:23,960
past I was and room that we're not gonna

306
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:26,390
find the front about it if someone

307
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:27,710
hasn't found first and then also per bug

308
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:28,910
Bernie management on the size of people

309
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:30,230
who organize that they're not

310
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:33,560
interacting with the community they're

311
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:36,080
not having a correspondence and they

312
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:38,300
don't retain participants so as a

313
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:41,990
solution to all of us and academic

314
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:44,089
research down so that as no and no one

315
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:46,280
really knows the they've suggested

316
00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:49,100
things but as you can imagine one

317
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:50,750
getting D off of M operating companies

318
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:54,470
is quite hard cuz it's security related

319
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:57,110
and they don't want to rock the boat

320
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:59,420
they're getting quite a nice P right now

321
00:12:57,110 --> 00:13:01,070
and a lot of people are anxious about

322
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:04,610
baby so there's no reason they want to

323
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:06,440
make it there and but what they kind of

324
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:08,090
experiment well academic kind of said is

325
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:10,750
terrified school Chris is just the

326
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:13,430
gamification of the symbols paradox

327
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:15,790
every week will release a different part

328
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:18,349
of our organization that you get em

329
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:20,599
we'll just a limited releases so one

330
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:21,710
week it will be ones of the main the

331
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:25,150
next week will think

332
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:27,590
the school and all its private programs

333
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:29,930
because obviously if you're increasing

334
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:31,460
the scope every week when you that means

335
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:32,989
that some parts your website aren't

336
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:34,820
being checked at all until very late

337
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:36,500
alone so you're the private programs to

338
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:37,970
make up for that but private programs

339
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:40,130
cost a lot of money because your again

340
00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:41,960
the best hackers on a premium to come

341
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:45,500
and test yours over what they usually do

342
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:47,030
I mean it could be totally something

343
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:49,280
totally different because we don't

344
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:51,410
actually know of anything because no

345
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:54,920
one's ever implemented or experimented

346
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:56,839
on security but Bernie's but let's hope

347
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:58,579
there may be a solution which is yet to

348
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:59,860
be discovered or been discussed and the

349
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:03,650
openness could all be probably behind

350
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:05,270
Silicon Valley's cause dolls and so good

351
00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:07,579
a reference is the skin of the safety

352
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:09,560
for the talk and there's two kind of

353
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:12,530
names again I wanna put it here so zone

354
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:15,949
number seven and I think he's up number

355
00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:18,079
nine as well that's guys doing us that I

356
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:19,910
know there's a PhD in brain install

357
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:21,580
economic philia comes from because I

358
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:25,160
wasn't small enough think of myself and

359
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:28,700
I name you've got that's one number five

360
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:30,020
which is an interview of ke the one with

361
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:32,330
the pen kill you would have seen talk

362
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:34,939
with vulnerability of my bug brain use

363
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:36,890
before and these are really good ones

364
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:38,270
can look over and discuss cuz they are

365
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:42,050
the more cutting edge of everything

366
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:43,520
I've referenced here and that's that

367
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:44,630
there was a massive potential for

368
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:48,439
further academic research and about

369
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:50,180
Bernie's although and it's I've said

370
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:51,650
it's quite hard to get the Ireland off

371
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:54,650
or how to come the reasonable

372
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:56,240
conclusions that wraps up my ramblings

373
00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:56,990
hopefully even left with some ongoing

374
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:00,040
problems

375
00:14:56,990 --> 00:15:00,040
I've been Jamie

376
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:11,769
[Applause]

377
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:13,750
any questions thanks for the for the

378
00:15:11,769 --> 00:15:16,170
presentation and for a review of

379
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:18,699
actually ecosystem from both sides the

380
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:21,370
participant and the company actually

381
00:15:18,699 --> 00:15:24,399
taking the back bounty what's your view

382
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:25,420
on actually possibly on a statement that

383
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:27,880
basically the background is also

384
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:29,889
misunderstood as a method of improving

385
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:32,019
security and misunderstood by the

386
00:15:29,889 --> 00:15:33,279
participants themselves not to judge

387
00:15:32,019 --> 00:15:35,860
because obviously the companies have

388
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:42,310
fear is that something am I ready for it

389
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:45,100
you know should I let it go but there is

390
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:46,989
also it seems misunderstanding in how

391
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:48,339
basically the participants approach the

392
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:49,720
back bounties and how that translates

393
00:15:48,339 --> 00:15:51,699
that it's you know self-fulfilling

394
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:54,819
prophecy and a vicious loop what what if

395
00:15:51,699 --> 00:15:58,508
you on this one so I'll have to say that

396
00:15:54,819 --> 00:16:00,939
the marketing about bees and how we kind

397
00:15:58,509 --> 00:16:02,470
of seer and the community is like

398
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:05,079
something really cool to brag about and

399
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:06,850
to look at it is quite harmful because

400
00:16:05,079 --> 00:16:08,290
we jump on it and we think that all

401
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:10,389
these are prior and people come through

402
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:12,610
uni that's a path they should go down if

403
00:16:10,389 --> 00:16:14,889
you're a bear pen tester and then for

404
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:16,600
companies they think as a solution to

405
00:16:14,889 --> 00:16:17,819
pen test and we don't need pen testers

406
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:20,550
if you've got all these people are not

407
00:16:17,819 --> 00:16:25,180
supposedly hacking or trying tackers and

408
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:27,760
and it says the compassionate article of

409
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:32,370
potential people just not understanding

410
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:35,439
but it should be that and to provide

411
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:38,860
supplementary security to mature

412
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:40,240
organizations if you're not and if

413
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:41,410
you're not mature if you're not being

414
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,790
around you don't have as internal

415
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:46,269
security team then there's no point

416
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:48,399
around the bobbin at all and and when it

417
00:16:46,269 --> 00:16:50,260
comes to pain testers and people want to

418
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:53,649
be pen testers yeah it's good to get to

419
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:55,959
learn and try a trade but em it's not

420
00:16:53,649 --> 00:16:58,589
something to really hang your hat on as

421
00:16:55,959 --> 00:16:58,589
a normal job

422
00:16:59,069 --> 00:17:09,309
question on the right I will get my

423
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:13,600
steps in hello

424
00:17:09,309 --> 00:17:16,480
thanks to the talk hi Sam hello Jamie

425
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:17,740
yeah I was just no I have no idea who

426
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:20,620
this guy is

427
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:25,449
Weegee right yeah I was just wondering

428
00:17:20,619 --> 00:17:27,938
um do you think overall that the way the

429
00:17:25,449 --> 00:17:29,980
bug bounty systems currently are are a

430
00:17:27,939 --> 00:17:31,870
good thing like on the scale that

431
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:33,610
they're being used currently or do you

432
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:36,850
think they should be kind of cooled back

433
00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:39,040
and maybe tested a bit more before being

434
00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:40,480
deployed on such a massive scale I think

435
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:42,100
if you don't test them in the public

436
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:44,080
then you're never going to get an actual

437
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:46,389
potential what its gonna be like and

438
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:50,980
eventually and what I've got a nose like

439
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:53,470
sex percent of the of the Forbes 2000

440
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:55,450
and if they get the rest or a majority

441
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:57,760
of that then it's got to be what Toth

442
00:17:55,450 --> 00:18:00,880
right now and some people got said that

443
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:03,280
or inventor Hank it will be interesting

444
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:05,590
to see the can awaits bail over because

445
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:07,750
mostly Western companies are going to

446
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:10,209
put ponies right now and we've yet to

447
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:13,300
see if like any other kinda cultures of

448
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:17,770
the Akita which is kind of a interesting

449
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:21,040
take on it and overall Angus ternal key

450
00:18:17,770 --> 00:18:24,040
as long as we don't kind of buy into all

451
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:26,320
the marketing propaganda

452
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:28,240
pom toe as of late there's also other

453
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:30,639
kinda interesting companies so I spoke

454
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:32,770
to COBOL and full set today they do pain

455
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:34,690
testing as a service which came the

456
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:36,730
transition the way from bobbin is the

457
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:40,090
don't offenders in the service which can

458
00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:43,750
meet some happy medium and however

459
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:47,760
you're losing are in the potential scale

460
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:53,470
set up on Bennie's yeah good thanks

461
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:57,190
other questions hey do you all know each

462
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:59,110
other is that the deal okay yeah I

463
00:18:57,190 --> 00:19:02,110
recognize the shirts hi James

464
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:04,570
hi Jamie and senior solutions part of

465
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:06,040
your slide if you go buy one yeah and

466
00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:08,050
you put your private programs

467
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:09,490
yeah see you in your answering Sam's

468
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:10,960
question you are saying the best way for

469
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:13,690
a competition to stand their weaknesses

470
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:16,150
is to act like they're kind of late into

471
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:17,740
the wild parting a private program and

472
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:19,450
are we going to see more of an increase

473
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:20,679
in like the kind of epic games scenario

474
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:22,300
where we have exclusive kind of

475
00:19:20,679 --> 00:19:23,980
companies taking on this kind of thing

476
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:25,928
and then McGrath they're maybe not gonna

477
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:27,669
get that eclipse is very targeted based

478
00:19:25,929 --> 00:19:30,020
in the Tesla's a ban but was it

479
00:19:27,669 --> 00:19:32,809
defensive on a private program an Indian

480
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:33,950
pain testing as a service and when

481
00:19:32,809 --> 00:19:36,950
you're doing private programmers are

482
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:38,450
getting the best people and is known for

483
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:39,800
these private programs before they go

484
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:41,480
public that they'll leave the

485
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:44,120
low-hanging fruit so the community can

486
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:46,340
come in and just out take some part of

487
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:48,350
the cake and when it comes to private

488
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:50,059
programs as well your pain are that

489
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:52,219
close my money for the people that we

490
00:19:50,059 --> 00:19:55,910
know drive fancy blue cars and post a

491
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:57,770
bit went well and that's just kind of

492
00:19:55,910 --> 00:20:00,970
problem offer has to be public so you

493
00:19:57,770 --> 00:20:04,010
