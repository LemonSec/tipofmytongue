1
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:07,649
thanks very much for joining us we are

2
00:00:06,029 --> 00:00:09,719
the beer partners we're here to talk

3
00:00:07,649 --> 00:00:12,509
about organizations that claim they

4
00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:14,340
taking security seriously what in fact

5
00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:16,049
they do quite the opposite and we're

6
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:19,050
also here to talk about some examples of

7
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:20,730
good practice that are out there we've

8
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:21,900
got a couple of friends so they need no

9
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:23,220
introduction themselves but they're

10
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:26,848
gonna join us in a little while around

11
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:32,519
so so we'll kick off is anybody in the

12
00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:36,269
room under the age of 18 yeah okay

13
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:38,360
there's always one mental age so here we

14
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:45,239
carry a parental advisory because we do

15
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:47,610
some of it one of us does tend to say I

16
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:53,099
say all right that's just why I say okay

17
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:54,600
okay so that's why we carry the parental

18
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:57,420
advisory so there might be a bit of

19
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:59,699
swaying but the will make every effort

20
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:01,320
to keep it in context to the talk okay

21
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:06,539
if any of you start swearing then that's

22
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:07,740

and the bear farmers do have their own

34
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:53,850
Twitter account you probably see as we

35
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:55,890
do propaganda shit out from there from

36
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:58,110
time to time we had an APB bought bro

37
00:01:55,890 --> 00:02:00,330
we're apt Bock for a while which really

38
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:02,820
did upset and scary people

39
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:05,340
it wasn't the intention it was hashtag

40
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:07,350
just for fun and we have a website which

41
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:09,030
we don't keep up-to-date whatsoever so

42
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:12,120
we have a website you did we have a

43
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:13,560
lesson so on WordPress when it comes to

44
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:22,200
redundant websites on ghost

45
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:23,970
I heard it's unhackable we have a slide

46
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:27,320
around that took the topic in a little

47
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:27,320
while and the websites down

48
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:32,970
so what I'll go through this and think

49
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:34,950
so are we in the real world so Chrissy

50
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:37,109
does physical security I call it closed

51
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:38,040
reception but I really didn't

52
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:40,920
necessarily know what that means

53
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:43,799
physical security and friendly hacking

54
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:44,850
you do a lot of stuff I work for an ISP

55
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:48,240
in the north of England calls an

56
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:49,950
internet so we a medium-sized

57
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:52,530
organization and I run the security

58
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:54,179
analysis team so I'm a defender I've

59
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:56,910
sent a lot of emails we'll get on to

60
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:58,350
that in a second John's of security

61
00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:00,810
champion for his organization back in

62
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:05,280
Belgium so he spends a good word about

63
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:08,610
everything we do in his a defender

64
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,810
manager and then email irate Allah

65
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:13,080
didn't talk about the emails about yeah

66
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:14,730
yeah and he provides great in self so if

67
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:16,380
you know in who know his background its

68
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:18,840
Canadian intelligence poetry it's all

69
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:20,850
yeah so he's got a lot of us half of my

70
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:23,489
rock-and-roll stories you've got the

71
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:24,510
best stories really Sean you're a

72
00:03:23,489 --> 00:03:27,510
security champion in your own

73
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:33,810
organization and Andy is a friendly

74
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:36,780
hacker a hot-shit reports ok fitting

75
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:41,310
that a certain organization has a stand

76
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:43,890
outside awkward and we try to come in

77
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:46,110
quietly but clearly that's not gonna

78
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:47,458
happen it didn't happen but if you see

79
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:48,900
any of our talks earlier in the year

80
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:50,670
throughout the first six months of the

81
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:54,360
year we do tend to discuss Facebook

82
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:55,769
quite a lot and we don't do it just

83
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:57,209
because we want to pick on face but we

84
00:03:55,770 --> 00:04:00,780
do it because they're constantly in the

85
00:03:57,209 --> 00:04:02,430
news for egregious practice okay so you

86
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:04,260
don't really need to spend too far away

87
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:05,989
from social media all the news platforms

88
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:08,280
to find that's Facebook of lost data

89
00:04:05,989 --> 00:04:09,420
Facebook have made a really carnal

90
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:11,190
decision at the very top of the

91
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:13,720
organization around privacy and that

92
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:16,149
goes on all the time and the

93
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:19,000
the quote there that I took from an

94
00:04:16,149 --> 00:04:20,440
email that Mark Zuckerberg sent to

95
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:25,000
senior execs who's way back was that

96
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:26,440
privacy is a social norm of the past and

97
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,770
I think that seems to be we see evidence

98
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:31,390
of that evidence in support of map and

99
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:35,979
as a consequence the current perception

100
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:38,320
is that Facebook is evil call their

101
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:40,690
lawyer came out last week and said that

102
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:44,110
nobody using social media should have

103
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:45,580
any expectation of privacy because if

104
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:47,770
they read the terms conditions because

105
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:49,870
we all do they'll see that actually they

106
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:52,090
seek our permission to do whatever they

107
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:53,620
want with our personal data that may

108
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:55,869
well be right when it's written down but

109
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:56,980
a no one ever reads the season sees we

110
00:04:55,870 --> 00:05:01,150
know that Apple's T's and C's

111
00:04:56,980 --> 00:05:05,520
I don't read the T's and C's in a back

112
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:07,630
pack packing our receipts Moschino stuff

113
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:09,789
but then there's a moral argument about

114
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:12,100
it and their lawyer said that we can all

115
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:13,720
go and that comes a little bit after

116
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:14,590
Mark Zuckerberg said the opposite like

117
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:17,950
you said that we should be taking

118
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:20,200
privacy and security more seriously so

119
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:21,640
the the higher echelons of that company

120
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:23,020
are diametrically opposed will each

121
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:26,650
other philosophically and I think that's

122
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:28,419
not great so when we talk about faithful

123
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:30,460
we talk about the organization at large

124
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:31,900
and it's senior executives and some of

125
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:33,520
its philosophical directions and

126
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:35,229
decision making what we're not talking

127
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,099
about is the security engineering and

128
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:37,690
the good people at work for the

129
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:40,110
organization of which there are many

130
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:43,450
were the guys are at that table there

131
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:45,430
those guys out there great guys yeah so

132
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:47,789
a quick show of hands and we like to do

133
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:49,990
this and who's got a Facebook account

134
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:51,970
you'd have to tell as well who it is

135
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:56,290
what is well since that's quite a few me

136
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:58,780
I've got one I use it who deleted their

137
00:05:56,290 --> 00:06:02,260
Facebook account in light of things that

138
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:03,609
have gone on okay not soon not too many

139
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:06,360
I don't know how many hundred people are

140
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:10,900
in the room but that's quite low number

141
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:12,940
ten percent yes who's thinking about

142
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:14,950
getting rid of their Facebook account in

143
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:17,200
the context of hashtag delete facebook

144
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:18,700
so again not too many and I see

145
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,780
arguments about we get involved in

146
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:21,190
discussions about this and I think

147
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:23,890
really it's about understanding your own

148
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:26,650
threat profile the other day and I use

149
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:27,969
my Facebook to chat with mates and share

150
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:29,948
pictures and cat memes and stuff like

151
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:32,290
that but I do that on squared C if you

152
00:06:29,949 --> 00:06:33,940
follow me on to it ile you'll know so

153
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:35,770
understand you threat model but also

154
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:37,449
understand that to a large extent

155
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:39,609
Facebook does not take your security

156
00:06:37,449 --> 00:06:42,009
seriously as an organisation and you

157
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:43,840
guys want to comment well it's just I

158
00:06:42,009 --> 00:06:47,919
have a super depressing life so I don't

159
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:50,369
exactly want to have it on Facebook not

160
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:53,560
to mention your rookies Lord oh yeah you

161
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:55,479
know I think you came under the point

162
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:57,940
and I think you know Sean said it best

163
00:06:55,479 --> 00:07:01,810
what's your quote about Facebook that if

164
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:04,270
it's free is that your quote I get the

165
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:07,840
two confused to look like brothers and

166
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:08,109
I'm shit with names although that's my

167
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,849
cue

168
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:12,039
yeah the quiz essentially if the player

169
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:14,080
if the product is if the platform is

170
00:07:12,039 --> 00:07:15,550
free year of the product is the same for

171
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,830
anything separate where's the simple

172
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:18,940
link tennis is here for social media

173
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:24,400
simple pornhub it's the same for every

174
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:29,320
business you are the product success is

175
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:30,909
that speaking that doesn't calm so it

176
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:33,099
turns out that actually privacy is a

177
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:34,240
pain you Mark Zuckerberg wallet because

178
00:07:33,099 --> 00:07:37,690
I know if you read it in the news

179
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:39,430
recently and Facebook of put aside or

180
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:42,490
made it a profit adjustment between

181
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:46,120
three and five billion US dollars to pay

182
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:48,639
a Federal Trade Commission fine against

183
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:51,130
levy of all their practice around

184
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:52,930
privacy so that's kind of I'm realizing

185
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:55,330
that financially it will harm them

186
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:57,190
ultimately and you think well three or

187
00:07:55,330 --> 00:08:00,159
five billion in the context of the value

188
00:07:57,190 --> 00:08:02,260
of Facebook might not be much money but

189
00:08:00,159 --> 00:08:04,690
in the old scheme of things finds we

190
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:06,219
were seeing around this book I see a

191
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:09,520
level finds at four to five hundred

192
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:11,530
thousand dollars so we are starting to

193
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:13,510
see some pretty serious financial

194
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:17,679
penalties hitting these organizations

195
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:20,620
Sean also shareholders and investors and

196
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:22,360
that do not like seeing fans issued

197
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:25,570
against companies because obviously

198
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:28,000
should at last so again that's something

199
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:30,340
that should hopefully well I'm not

200
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,039
advocate of trying to bury businesses

201
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:36,699
but provide incentives to do the right

202
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:38,480
thing and treats deal with morals and

203
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:39,940
that property and ethic

204
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:43,120
[Music]

205
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:45,160
yeah and also with Facebook and Google

206
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,900
and some of these big companies they

207
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:49,329
make this kind of money within minutes

208
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:50,730
or hours you're finding them and they

209
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:53,740
don't really care it's kind of like a

210
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:55,630
more of a outlook of how they look but

211
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:57,850
well I think we could do is perhaps

212
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:59,890
restrict them so where they've got their

213
00:08:57,850 --> 00:09:01,210
ads in a certain country suppling from

214
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:03,970
having their ad revenue coming in or

215
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:05,380
stop them from being I guess within

216
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:13,630
Europe if they've got the GDP our to

217
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:16,150
fall back on so yeah okay we're about to

218
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:17,460
finish hammering Facebook but again it

219
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:20,319
goes about four point I made earlier

220
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:21,700
excuse me about their lawyer can't quite

221
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,720
agree with them as an organisation he's

222
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:26,710
defending the fact that they should

223
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:28,660
really be perfectly a liberty to do what

224
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:30,430
they're doing well I think to one of the

225
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:33,310
aspects of this is it's running straight

226
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:35,050
into the entire concept of the GDP are

227
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:36,910
so at some point they're going to be

228
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:38,770
showdown right there's going to be a

229
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:40,420
whole bunch of supervisory authorities

230
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:41,949
on one side and there's give me a

231
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:44,709
Facebook lawyer on the other side and

232
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:47,050
it's gonna come to a head and and it's

233
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:48,520
it's not just Facebook the the most

234
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:52,300
startling thing I heard about the other

235
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:54,400
day was that Google has written an email

236
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:56,770
parser for anyone that's on the Gmail

237
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:58,660
platform all right and what this email

238
00:09:56,770 --> 00:10:01,300
parser does is it looks for evidence of

239
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:03,430
something that you bought I like a

240
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:05,709
receipt and it stores that information

241
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:07,479
away and this wasn't disclosed to

242
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:09,610
anybody using the Gmail platform that

243
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:11,740
that was going on and so we're starting

244
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:14,080
to see more and more of these ways that

245
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:16,360
your personal private information the

246
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:19,090
things that you buy are scrutinized by

247
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:22,480
these companies and then they profit off

248
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:25,360
of that information that you never gave

249
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:28,960
a right to them to sell to a third party

250
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:31,440
or to use you know to win an election or

251
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:33,760
any of those things yeah absolutely

252
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,870
and so we said we'd stop panning twice

253
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,640
booked that's exactly what we're gonna

254
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:38,050
do and we're gonna go someone else

255
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:42,790
hummed in the air or shower

256
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:44,109
who's this fella Jack Dorsey right so he

257
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:45,699
came out with a wonderfully

258
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:47,020
philosophical statement years ago about

259
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:51,180
I just want to build stuff that really

260
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:51,180
simplifies our base human interaction

261
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:56,060
but I think that was him saying that we

262
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:57,770
want to get more people connected and

263
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:59,420
that really was the fundamental basis in

264
00:10:57,770 --> 00:11:02,030
what started Facebook that they're

265
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:04,130
stalking but it makes you wonder it

266
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:07,130
makes me wonder around where did that

267
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:10,450
message or that belief get lost I got

268
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:13,820
lost in profitability and shareholder

269
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:15,140
values and all that custom but again you

270
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:18,620
know we talked about masses of data

271
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:22,390
being lost they lost a Twitter 330

272
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:25,190
million records in 2018 personal data

273
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:27,319
and I wonder and I said this in a couple

274
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:31,730
of our talks whether we become over time

275
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:33,470
a little bit desensitized if the numbers

276
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:35,840
aren't in the at least hundreds of

277
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:37,880
millions and billions and squillions and

278
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:40,730
gazillions that seems to only make the

279
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:43,970
news these days but I used to work in

280
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:46,730
local authority for a large council in

281
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:48,650
the north of England and we had a root

282
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:52,250
and branch investigation if a single

283
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:54,439
child record was lost or a USB stick

284
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:56,750
with a couple of kids records was lost a

285
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:58,730
left in a taxi and that would often

286
00:11:56,750 --> 00:12:00,290
result in serious disciplinary action

287
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:01,820
and that was before anybody really

288
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:04,790
understood about the depth perception

289
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:06,800
implications and stuff like that so I

290
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:10,069
care about one record if that can cause

291
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:11,780
harm or a disadvantage to individual we

292
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:14,900
try my touch on submission a little one

293
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:18,260
so Ian's got a little story to tell and

294
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:20,839
I'm just gonna push the book yeah so

295
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:22,550
first America really interesting

296
00:12:20,839 --> 00:12:24,620
scenario there and actually I'm gonna

297
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:29,180
get one of my other beer fires to jump

298
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:32,330
into that huge company huge amounts of

299
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:34,339
data all of it basically publicly

300
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:36,410
available what was the vulnerability I'm

301
00:12:34,339 --> 00:12:38,530
not super technical anymore I used to

302
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:40,130
know a lot about windows 2003 server

303
00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:43,459
well what is it

304
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:46,640
where there's like no the I dorm was the

305
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:48,650
attack vector and essentially this

306
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:51,380
allowed you to incrementally index and

307
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:54,140
see all of those records to the tune of

308
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:57,050
what was 85 million eight hundred eighty

309
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:59,360
five mil 885 of columbian records all of

310
00:12:57,050 --> 00:13:02,949
the information you would need to do

311
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:05,290
email phishing identity impersonation

312
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:06,910
mortgage transfers

313
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:09,189
any of those type of things or even

314
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:11,649
extract money using those nefarious

315
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:13,690
tactics of the immigration police are

316
00:13:11,649 --> 00:13:16,839
coming for you and you need to go and

317
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:18,850
buy a whole bunch of Apple pay pay cards

318
00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:23,139
in order to not get arrested immediately

319
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:26,009
so this is fuel to the fire and really

320
00:13:23,139 --> 00:13:27,819
detailed information histories of

321
00:13:26,009 --> 00:13:31,870
properties that you've owned and sold

322
00:13:27,819 --> 00:13:33,069
like is a massive haul and and the point

323
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:37,060
that I'm trying to make about this is

324
00:13:33,069 --> 00:13:40,269
that the issue did not lie here I think

325
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:44,649
with the intentions of the organization

326
00:13:40,269 --> 00:13:46,959
this happened as a result of a pressured

327
00:13:44,649 --> 00:13:49,410
IT environment you guys might all be

328
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:52,029
able to kind of like agree with this a

329
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:53,649
high-pressure IT environment where the

330
00:13:52,029 --> 00:13:57,459
business said we're going to the cloud

331
00:13:53,649 --> 00:13:59,740
make it work and the IT guys started

332
00:13:57,459 --> 00:14:01,719
disabling security until it worked so

333
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:03,970
that they could say project delivered on

334
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:06,370
time and on budget let's go to the next

335
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:08,709
thing so the question really becomes as

336
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:12,279
if that's what IT did to deliver this

337
00:14:08,709 --> 00:14:14,739
project the security team there's some

338
00:14:12,279 --> 00:14:19,480
negligence there you know where was the

339
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:22,810
pen test where was the audit even you

340
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:24,910
know wait so this is where we're going

341
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:27,160
with this in terms of this is a business

342
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:27,939
failure and not an IT or IT security

343
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:32,079
failure

344
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:35,370
yeah the thing with that is that we see

345
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:38,050
that often if you can count you can hack

346
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:40,360
literally and you have this amount of

347
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:42,490
data and this is yeah like Froy is

348
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:44,680
giving workshops Scott is doing them as

349
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:47,829
well now this is basic security

350
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:50,229
knowledge first of all you have to you

351
00:14:47,829 --> 00:14:51,790
need to have skilled people so train

352
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:54,430
them and the second thing there was a

353
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:56,380
very good remark you made that you

354
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:58,479
should have found that even before a pen

355
00:14:56,380 --> 00:15:00,880
test this is security testing this

356
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,680
should be part of your life cycle not

357
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:05,980
not something that comes out of a pen

358
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:09,699
test event as this for the special cases

359
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:12,430
the more difficult ones but not for yeah

360
00:15:09,699 --> 00:15:15,849
just incremental number that's insanity

361
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:17,260
and you should never yeah as a security

362
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:19,890
team you should never agree with that

363
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:23,230
this is basic security

364
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:24,880
yep I'm sure so I'm going to read the

365
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:26,770
top part out you can read that

366
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:29,110
yourselves but what it roughly

367
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:31,240
translates doing in our parlance is we

368
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:37,780
take your security seriously but

369
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:39,820
evidently not so if somebody hand him a

370
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:49,829
mic I'd like to welcome mr. Troy hunt

371
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:51,820
for the stage I couldn't do that I

372
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:55,450
couldn't do that not a chance

373
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:57,400
so Troy and we know a bit about breaches

374
00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:59,620
but I think it's fair to say that you're

375
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:01,300
recognized as somebody that knows a hell

376
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:02,260
of a lot more than we do so what we'd

377
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:03,250
like to get is a little bit of your

378
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:05,080
insight about your current understanding

379
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:06,840
of air your current thoughts on the

380
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:10,020
subject and why you think it's heading

381
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:12,280
we're all screwed basically

382
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:14,800
hey can I give everyone stickers well

383
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:15,939
I'm here yeah plus I get to throw stuff

384
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:30,250
at the audience and it's all kind of

385
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:35,890
fence around they're all for you tonight

386
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:37,720
on so we're all screwed yeah yeah what

387
00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:41,020
am i up to seven point seven billion was

388
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:42,670
it last year yeah we had a we had a

389
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:45,579
shout out listen couple of months ago we

390
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:48,430
had a something like there were three

391
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:49,840
records the human put live on the on the

392
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:51,520
earth that had been written a breach

393
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:53,650
that we knew about but we chatted about

394
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:55,449
and you said money faster lower the

395
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:57,490
number and you reckon it was probably

396
00:16:55,450 --> 00:17:00,220
ten per living person on the planet and

397
00:16:57,490 --> 00:17:01,920
some so I guess that the raw numbers in

398
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:06,160
heavy beam powers were seven point seven

399
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:07,119
billion records so just put in context

400
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:09,580
as obvious there's not that many people

401
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:11,770
there are sixteen records that's me

402
00:17:09,579 --> 00:17:14,740
because I'm in Dropbox and LinkedIn and

403
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:16,200
stuff like that so you know that's sort

404
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:18,280
of part of the front like one person

405
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:20,530
ends up propagating their data at

406
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:22,480
multiple times over and then in terms of

407
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:24,639
unique email addresses owns about four

408
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:26,110
billion or something and and that's kind

409
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,550
of weird too because in my mind I don't

410
00:17:26,109 --> 00:17:29,020
know if are there four billion people

411
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:31,860
themed a Larissa's how many people on

412
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:34,269
internet but two or three or something

413
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:35,320
some number of billions but then like

414
00:17:34,269 --> 00:17:37,809
you end up with multiple email addresses

415
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:40,570
so the various data have a been pined is

416
00:17:37,809 --> 00:17:42,158
my work email address and my personal

417
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:43,658
email address we both need OB database

418
00:17:42,159 --> 00:17:45,909
so you end up with multiple email

419
00:17:43,659 --> 00:17:47,379
addresses multiple instances and then we

420
00:17:45,909 --> 00:17:48,519
see a lot of data breaches as well this

421
00:17:47,379 --> 00:17:50,980
is serve a lot of crap in them like a

422
00:17:48,519 --> 00:17:52,509
lot of fabricated addresses particularly

423
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:54,820
some of the data aggregators like I

424
00:17:52,509 --> 00:17:56,679
later I think was something like you

425
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:58,600
know let's say it was Apollo to i/o one

426
00:17:56,679 --> 00:17:59,769
of these aggregators it just takes a

427
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:02,620
whole bunch your data from different

428
00:17:59,769 --> 00:18:04,269
places places like you know when you

429
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:05,649
sign up to that survey to win the cruise

430
00:18:04,269 --> 00:18:07,450
and then you wonder why you didn't win

431
00:18:05,649 --> 00:18:09,100
the cruise but you've read the terms and

432
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:10,649
conditions beforehand it was like we may

433
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:14,350
take your data and sell it to people

434
00:18:10,649 --> 00:18:19,119
none of you read that wait there's no

435
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:20,559
cruise this is the thing what they take

436
00:18:19,119 --> 00:18:22,029
your data and then they aggregate it in

437
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:23,769
the seller and one of the interesting

438
00:18:22,029 --> 00:18:26,590
things from some of those data breaches

439
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:28,210
is there's people on ever been poned who

440
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:30,039
work in organizations they get domain

441
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:32,350
search results so they'll you know

442
00:18:30,039 --> 00:18:33,700
they'll work for Acme core and I'll load

443
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:36,309
something like a polo and they get this

444
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:39,009
email which is like here's all the email

445
00:18:36,309 --> 00:18:41,019
addresses that were in Acme core on your

446
00:18:39,009 --> 00:18:43,330
domain and they're like but I don't have

447
00:18:41,019 --> 00:18:45,190
sales at marketing at and a lot of these

448
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:47,860
organizations just fabricate these

449
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:49,749
addresses so of that sort of four

450
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:51,270
billion unique email addresses is also a

451
00:18:49,749 --> 00:18:54,119
whole bunch of junk in there as well so

452
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:56,499
[Music]

453
00:18:54,119 --> 00:18:58,178
here's a really good graphic and I kind

454
00:18:56,499 --> 00:19:02,110
of know this exists because you used it

455
00:18:58,179 --> 00:19:04,539
in your coronis UDP our briefing do you

456
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:06,100
go so personally I find this really

457
00:19:04,539 --> 00:19:08,710
impactful at work or what I'm doing

458
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:10,748
talks internally because everybody I in

459
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:12,100
my organization has probably been in at

460
00:19:10,749 --> 00:19:15,730
least one of these things you want these

461
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:18,029
blobs that we see Twitter I mentioned

462
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:22,480
earlier that 330 million Marriott hotels

463
00:19:18,029 --> 00:19:25,440
then you're in there right several times

464
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:28,600
probably but it's impactful diagrams

465
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:31,450
it's using them yes it's a really useful

466
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:33,699
tool to highlight the problem and I

467
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:34,509
think it's you said Troy you know is it

468
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:36,759
getting any better

469
00:19:34,509 --> 00:19:38,649
no it's not in fact it's getting much

470
00:19:36,759 --> 00:19:40,240
worse right so I got a correct John

471
00:19:38,649 --> 00:19:42,250
something he said before Twitter didn't

472
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:45,000
lose their data they they made a lot of

473
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:45,000
backups of it

474
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:50,300
they're never gonna lose it now like if

475
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:52,730
they lose it legitimate job I'll restore

476
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:54,470
it for them yeah if anyone's to say this

477
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:56,150
this is from a site called informations

478
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:57,770
beautiful so if your google informations

479
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:59,390
beautiful data breaches and it's kind of

480
00:19:57,770 --> 00:20:00,350
cool like that the bubbles are animate

481
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:04,370
and stuff like that

482
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:06,949
I doing some media stuff this morning at

483
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:08,479
the the other conference and though like

484
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:10,550
you know a data breach is getting worse

485
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:11,630
so yeah because there's lots of really

486
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:13,280
good reasons well they're getting worse

487
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:15,500
so number one there's like more data

488
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:17,389
than ever before like we've all seen

489
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:19,220
stats about how much information humans

490
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:21,710
create like every day well you know

491
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:24,560
we're just creating a lot more of it the

492
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:25,880
cloud two-hands the cloud has kind of

493
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:28,669
made the whole thing a lot worse as well

494
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:30,320
insofar as it's so easy now for anyone

495
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:31,940
just to stand up anything publicly

496
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:33,820
facing so there's so many data breaches

497
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:37,250
we've seen now which is like MongoDB

498
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:39,560
elasticsearch Amazon s3 publicly facing

499
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:42,260
without authentication because you know

500
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:43,700
it's easy right and logging turned off

501
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:48,440
so you don't even know who might have

502
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:50,270
got it yeah that's the other painful

503
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:53,270
thing let my so time out they only know

504
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:54,710
when it's like I tweet and I go hey does

505
00:20:53,270 --> 00:21:00,260
anyone have a security contact anyone's

506
00:20:54,710 --> 00:21:01,520
like this isn't gonna be good alright so

507
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:01,970
we're seeing all these data breaches in

508
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:04,820
IOT

509
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:06,440
so I writes one jeez a few weeks ago

510
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:09,169
with with Ken Munroe as well about

511
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:11,240
watches and and that was ID or - so

512
00:21:09,170 --> 00:21:13,160
watches where you could track your

513
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:15,320
children because that sounds like a

514
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:16,790
great idea doesn't watches with GPS is

515
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:18,649
to track your children and you can make

516
00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:20,540
calls to the API and just increment the

517
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:22,310
number and pull back another child or

518
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:23,629
reposition a child or set yourself as

519
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:26,149
the parent of the child so that you can

520
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:27,680
then call the child and the phone has

521
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:29,750
got like zero interaction that's fine

522
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:30,680
the watch and has has actually has

523
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:33,200
anyone got one of these you've got like

524
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:35,870
a kids tracking watch so no I don't want

525
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:37,400
to admit it now cuz you know but always

526
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:39,020
wonder like what's the point they're

527
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:40,520
getting the watch for the child because

528
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:41,540
if you're gonna kidnap the child

529
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:45,170
wouldn't you just take the watch off

530
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:48,280
them yeah and I appreciate this sounds

531
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:48,280
like I've thought about it way too much

532
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:53,090
and then you could do stuff like if

533
00:21:51,530 --> 00:21:54,649
you're the parent you can call them and

534
00:21:53,090 --> 00:21:57,020
it will automatically answer because

535
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:58,330
what if I imagine like what if someone's

536
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:59,710
kidnapped the child and have tied

537
00:21:58,330 --> 00:22:01,570
up and put them in the back of a van and

538
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:02,980
I can't reach it to answer like how

539
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:09,789
fucked up is this we have to get to this

540
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:12,010
point there's far too much okay all

541
00:22:09,789 --> 00:22:15,129
right so the kids watches the cloud

542
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:16,960
Patino got a cloud pit no good

543
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:20,380
so cloud pits are connected teddy bears

544
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:22,539
and the know what could go wrong so they

545
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:24,070
exposed all of their MongoDB data

546
00:22:22,539 --> 00:22:25,269
publicly space and without a password

547
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:27,610
and then they had all the kids voice

548
00:22:25,269 --> 00:22:29,980
recordings in a publicly facing Amazon

549
00:22:27,610 --> 00:22:32,049
s3 bucket with obfuscated names but all

550
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:34,899
the metadata to the file locations was

551
00:22:32,049 --> 00:22:36,668
in the Mongo and it's it's all publicly

552
00:22:34,899 --> 00:22:39,219
facing and we like we didn't have

553
00:22:36,669 --> 00:22:41,649
recordings of children before in that

554
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:43,029
fashion like I remember when I was a kid

555
00:22:41,649 --> 00:22:44,649
if my parents wanted to record me I had

556
00:22:43,029 --> 00:22:46,510
to like get up a tape player thing and

557
00:22:44,649 --> 00:22:48,070
the microphone and all that and now it's

558
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:49,330
like a kids in their bed just talking to

559
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:51,070
the teddy bear and it's on the internet

560
00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:52,870
so like all of these are just

561
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:54,820
compounding that the prevalence of which

562
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:56,260
data is collected and then making it

563
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:58,139
easier to expose and we're getting into

564
00:22:56,260 --> 00:23:01,120
more places yeah great

565
00:22:58,139 --> 00:23:02,830
ok so we talked earlier about the

566
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:06,309
consequences of these data breaches and

567
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:08,019
hacks going on and equifax are now the

568
00:23:06,309 --> 00:23:10,450
chickens are coming home to roost with

569
00:23:08,019 --> 00:23:13,210
Equifax and they've had a lot of value

570
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:15,070
wiped off their organization in yeah so

571
00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:18,309
that this one was really interesting so

572
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:20,918
we saw two congressional reports and as

573
00:23:18,309 --> 00:23:24,908
well as a report in the UK on Equifax we

574
00:23:20,919 --> 00:23:26,590
saw the CEO of Equifax hauled in front

575
00:23:24,909 --> 00:23:30,370
of Congress which doesn't really look to

576
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:33,519
be very fun at all and then the most

577
00:23:30,370 --> 00:23:37,779
interesting thing happened suddenly the

578
00:23:33,519 --> 00:23:40,929
bond rating company went after them and

579
00:23:37,779 --> 00:23:42,940
lowered their credit score and this this

580
00:23:40,929 --> 00:23:44,350
was really interesting because it's the

581
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:46,840
first time it's happened it's first time

582
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:50,168
a bond rating company has lured a credit

583
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:52,240
score as a result of their spend to

584
00:23:50,169 --> 00:23:55,029
clean up the horrific breach because I

585
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:57,039
think they're now closing it on or have

586
00:23:55,029 --> 00:23:59,470
exceeded a billion dollars one point

587
00:23:57,039 --> 00:24:01,990
four billion point four billion in costs

588
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:05,409
associated this breach so finally the

589
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:08,500
real financial realities of data breach

590
00:24:05,409 --> 00:24:10,909
were felt at now being charged as a

591
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:13,549
higher risk client to

592
00:24:10,909 --> 00:24:16,249
or even more money to fix your shoddy

593
00:24:13,549 --> 00:24:17,869
security so the other thing that's very

594
00:24:16,249 --> 00:24:20,599
interesting is when you're a giant

595
00:24:17,869 --> 00:24:23,809
company you try to sell your corporate

596
00:24:20,599 --> 00:24:25,939
debt to other people and the amount of

597
00:24:23,809 --> 00:24:28,489
money and interest that's paid is based

598
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:30,830
on your credit rating and now they're

599
00:24:28,489 --> 00:24:33,739
risky so it's even more expensive for

600
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:37,239
them to sell their corporate debt this

601
00:24:33,739 --> 00:24:40,909
will put a really interesting spin on

602
00:24:37,239 --> 00:24:43,879
the cost of data breach if now we see

603
00:24:40,909 --> 00:24:46,399
the credit markets reacting negatively

604
00:24:43,879 --> 00:24:49,519
which will truly impact the share value

605
00:24:46,399 --> 00:24:49,939
as you can see in the company right

606
00:24:49,519 --> 00:24:52,369
there

607
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:54,200
so really interesting just we're going

608
00:24:52,369 --> 00:24:57,199
to see the bond market wake up and go oh

609
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:59,539
you know what shoddy cybersecurity is I

610
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,830
shall now be punished yep agreed and the

611
00:24:59,539 --> 00:25:02,359
last part is the first point you made

612
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:03,649
that Moody's downgraded them from Sables

613
00:25:02,359 --> 00:25:05,059
and additive now that's the kind of

614
00:25:03,649 --> 00:25:06,799
behavior you see happen to countries

615
00:25:05,059 --> 00:25:08,389
okay that's so that's that's pretty bad

616
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:11,359
shit okay

617
00:25:08,389 --> 00:25:13,879
yep I just want to add one thing so when

618
00:25:11,359 --> 00:25:16,309
you take into account that as well as

619
00:25:13,879 --> 00:25:19,309
the cost those cost of them this all

620
00:25:16,309 --> 00:25:22,700
resulted from a simple fix was just

621
00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:24,139
updating the patchy struts so if you

622
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:25,609
look at it from that point of view it

623
00:25:24,139 --> 00:25:27,559
wasn't like something major that would

624
00:25:25,609 --> 00:25:31,189
take months and months to fix this was

625
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:33,590
something really trivial in a sense not

626
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:36,200
always that trivial but in terms of

627
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:38,359
spent to fix it you're not talking

628
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:42,919
minions yeah leave it yeah agreed

629
00:25:38,359 --> 00:25:44,658
okay so we'd like to pass the mic sir

630
00:25:42,919 --> 00:25:45,270
mr. Scott helm and welcome into the

631
00:25:44,659 --> 00:25:45,960
station

632
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:48,799
[Music]

633
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:52,770
[Applause]

634
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:56,340
Thank You Troy we'll be seeing you again

635
00:25:52,770 --> 00:25:57,840
in a few minutes all right thank you

636
00:25:56,340 --> 00:26:00,000
Scott now what we'd like to do here is

637
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:02,010
allow Scott to share some of his

638
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,440
insights around the encrypted web and

639
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:06,539
the ongoing battle that is encrypting

640
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:07,679
the web so he's got some fantastic

641
00:26:06,539 --> 00:26:09,539
insights I'm sure he'd like to share

642
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:11,760
with us and Shawn's got some interesting

643
00:26:09,539 --> 00:26:13,650
opinions he'd like to share back but

644
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:16,980
we'll make it clear we're all on the

645
00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:19,650
same side so Scott yeah so the encrypted

646
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:20,909
web thing for me I think like the number

647
00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:23,130
one point always comes right to me if we

648
00:26:20,909 --> 00:26:24,299
were to redesign the web today and I say

649
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:25,140
like we could go back to square one and

650
00:26:24,299 --> 00:26:27,570
start this again from the beginning

651
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:30,059
would we just have quite default

652
00:26:27,570 --> 00:26:31,408
encryption would that be the the stance

653
00:26:30,059 --> 00:26:34,020
would we be like oh hey you know we

654
00:26:31,409 --> 00:26:35,370
could have the option of HTTP and HTTPS

655
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:37,470
and I honestly think that if we were to

656
00:26:35,370 --> 00:26:39,539
rebuild it now and and reset to zero we

657
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:41,730
just start with an encrypted network

658
00:26:39,539 --> 00:26:44,669
because that would be like the smart

659
00:26:41,730 --> 00:26:46,590
choice so I think you know what we're

660
00:26:44,669 --> 00:26:47,730
doing right now is essentially fixing

661
00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:49,678
that kind of design flaw in the

662
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:52,140
beginning that the network wasn't secure

663
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:54,630
and that was largely based around the

664
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:57,210
trust we had so who's who can go back

665
00:26:54,630 --> 00:27:00,870
and think of the web like way back in

666
00:26:57,210 --> 00:27:06,179
the early days why into the late 90s no

667
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:06,570
test the room now haiti's okay that's

668
00:27:06,179 --> 00:27:08,940
right

669
00:27:06,570 --> 00:27:10,168
so like wait it was a small place right

670
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:11,280
like things were very different back

671
00:27:10,169 --> 00:27:13,140
then it was a very trusted environment

672
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:14,520
we had like the internet phonebook where

673
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:16,049
you could go look up an IP address and

674
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:17,730
see people's like name and actual

675
00:27:16,049 --> 00:27:19,918
physical address and who they were and

676
00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:21,240
now I have toasters and scales in my

677
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:22,919
house with internet connections and

678
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:25,409
we've just gone like this full

679
00:27:22,919 --> 00:27:27,090
revolution away from what the

680
00:27:25,409 --> 00:27:29,190
environment originally was so for me

681
00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:31,678
this is not you know where we're

682
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:33,630
deploying HTTPS so like protect people

683
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:35,429
to which it does but we're deploying it

684
00:27:33,630 --> 00:27:37,679
to fix the original issue that we didn't

685
00:27:35,429 --> 00:27:39,390
have encryption in the first place

686
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:41,820
there's no scenario that I can think of

687
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:43,500
where deploying encryption make

688
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:45,178
something worse nor is there a scenario

689
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:47,400
that I can think of where it won't

690
00:27:45,179 --> 00:27:51,270
protect you against at least something

691
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:52,799
so we continue to remove barriers we've

692
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:55,649
got things like let's encrypt with free

693
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:57,210
SSL you can get certificates for no

694
00:27:55,649 --> 00:27:59,580
financial cost now just the minimal

695
00:27:57,210 --> 00:28:01,140
technical cost and the performance

696
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:02,820
just been completely washed away you

697
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:04,440
know maybe like late 90s early noughties

698
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:06,570
we could make the performance argument

699
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:08,100
but nowadays the cost is essentially

700
00:28:06,570 --> 00:28:11,070
zero and actually most of the time we

701
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:14,580
can go faster on HTTPS than HTTP web

702
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:16,740
apps so for me nowadays this is just

703
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:18,600
kind of a given we need to like this set

704
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:19,650
the clock back to zero and say right you

705
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:21,300
know we just need to go and crimp the

706
00:28:19,650 --> 00:28:23,130
whole network and then we can start

707
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:25,530
worrying about like all of these just

708
00:28:23,130 --> 00:28:27,870
wide variety of attacks that we could

709
00:28:25,530 --> 00:28:29,670
get rid of it but while we're trying to

710
00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:33,449
do that right we have this kind of

711
00:28:29,670 --> 00:28:37,170
argument okay and Shaun you've got a

712
00:28:33,450 --> 00:28:37,680
real honest in geology so what is this

713
00:28:37,170 --> 00:28:41,070
about

714
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:43,310
yeah this was about trust if I and wire

715
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:46,139
did they made it to the slides just

716
00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:49,980
because they jumped yeah they quote

717
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:53,790
tweeted sweet I did with arguments and

718
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:56,760
tweeted it was about some company we had

719
00:28:53,790 --> 00:29:00,300
their lesson crip certificate expired

720
00:28:56,760 --> 00:29:02,430
and I quote we don't say ok automate all

721
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:04,950
things make sure that this doesn't

722
00:29:02,430 --> 00:29:07,380
happen there's automation so you don't

723
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:12,480
have to this doesn't have to happen and

724
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:17,640
then if I hold it he'll start okay

725
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:21,450
Melvin let's say infographic about the

726
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:24,840
false economy of certificates and also

727
00:29:21,450 --> 00:29:29,100
that the be8 British Airways Act was due

728
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:31,320
to certificates we all know that British

729
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:35,100
Airways Act was due to third party

730
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:36,840
compromise and Sean yeah literally I

731
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:39,409
tweeted a lot I mentioned some people

732
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:44,669
and Chung ripped all their arguments

733
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:46,920
yeah that a tear them apart so yeah so

734
00:29:44,670 --> 00:29:49,710
one thing I think is really important

735
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:51,930
when you try to get security in that out

736
00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:55,140
is give the route information try be as

737
00:29:51,930 --> 00:29:58,520
honest as possible if you try to market

738
00:29:55,140 --> 00:30:01,470
something join put out false information

739
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:03,720
and that's kind of what they were doing

740
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:05,850
there that there was a lot of things

741
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:07,740
that were saying will compete completely

742
00:30:05,850 --> 00:30:11,280
inaccurate I mean the headline there is

743
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:12,450
Oh good example with BA it was a

744
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:14,129
JavaScript

745
00:30:12,450 --> 00:30:17,850
absolutely nothing to do with the

746
00:30:14,129 --> 00:30:20,998
certificates and that thing just really

747
00:30:17,850 --> 00:30:23,009
browsed me up I mean that comes back to

748
00:30:20,999 --> 00:30:25,739
our point earlier where we need to do

749
00:30:23,009 --> 00:30:28,259
things morally and ethically so your

750
00:30:25,739 --> 00:30:32,190
business on the things that it can do

751
00:30:28,259 --> 00:30:34,889
rather than false information yeah yeah

752
00:30:32,190 --> 00:30:36,690
if I may chime in the thing is my

753
00:30:34,889 --> 00:30:38,879
opinion at least if you call out

754
00:30:36,690 --> 00:30:41,129
companies for this kind of behavior I

755
00:30:38,879 --> 00:30:44,730
think that's a good thing why because

756
00:30:41,129 --> 00:30:47,129
other people who maybe don't understand

757
00:30:44,730 --> 00:30:50,789
all technical details they will just

758
00:30:47,129 --> 00:30:53,789
believe them one other important thing I

759
00:30:50,789 --> 00:30:56,279
often see is that support employees from

760
00:30:53,789 --> 00:30:59,190
companies get called out and even get

761
00:30:56,279 --> 00:31:01,320
abused online and then that's that's not

762
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:03,629
cool honestly that's not cool you can

763
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:06,269
you can be not okay with something a

764
00:31:03,629 --> 00:31:08,248
company does but always think what the

765
00:31:06,269 --> 00:31:10,950
person was just doing the the Twitter or

766
00:31:08,249 --> 00:31:13,409
the other support and that's that's

767
00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:15,299
important to see don't be a dick okay

768
00:31:13,409 --> 00:31:16,859
can I just like yeah reaffirm that point

769
00:31:15,299 --> 00:31:19,379
so I go quite a bad reputation online

770
00:31:16,859 --> 00:31:21,330
for being like MTC a anti certificate

771
00:31:19,379 --> 00:31:22,859
authority because I'm constantly holding

772
00:31:21,330 --> 00:31:25,350
things like this apart and and it's not

773
00:31:22,859 --> 00:31:27,239
I'm not like anti CA or like Rage

774
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:28,949
Against the Machine or whatever people

775
00:31:27,239 --> 00:31:30,239
say is this what you kind of picked up

776
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:31,649
on now it's that they're they're

777
00:31:30,239 --> 00:31:34,379
spreading this information someone will

778
00:31:31,649 --> 00:31:35,219
read that and believe it essentially

779
00:31:34,379 --> 00:31:36,840
because it's like well why would this

780
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:38,340
organization why in this infographic

781
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:42,869
especially if it comes from a thought

782
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:44,220
leader so yeah it's this you know that's

783
00:31:42,869 --> 00:31:45,749
the reason for me like this is why I

784
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:47,070
spend so much time on this especially in

785
00:31:45,749 --> 00:31:49,019
the CIA ecosystem pulling these things

786
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:50,519
apart and just breaking it down to

787
00:31:49,019 --> 00:31:52,350
technical points not because I don't

788
00:31:50,519 --> 00:31:53,190
like them I mean I don't like them

789
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:55,049
because what they've done but not

790
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:57,029
because I have some inbuilt dislike so

791
00:31:55,049 --> 00:32:00,509
you know it is about correcting these

792
00:31:57,029 --> 00:32:05,970
facts okay if somebody mentioned

793
00:32:00,509 --> 00:32:08,309
unhackable earlier so yeah and it speaks

794
00:32:05,970 --> 00:32:10,289
to the point about making bold and in

795
00:32:08,309 --> 00:32:14,970
substantiate claims about the security

796
00:32:10,289 --> 00:32:18,179
posture of your product bit 508 out are

797
00:32:14,970 --> 00:32:21,320
all products that were destroyed

798
00:32:18,179 --> 00:32:24,600
rather than publicly by n chess partners

799
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:27,178
represented here by handing over there

800
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:29,340
so you wanna say a quick few words about

801
00:32:27,179 --> 00:32:31,620
mr. shitty I've gotta make southern yeah

802
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:34,199
yeah don't claim shit's unhackable

803
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:37,320
basically as the that's the TLDR but

804
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:42,419
essentially fire was was endorsed by

805
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:45,480
that's kind of here it was it was said

806
00:32:42,419 --> 00:32:48,179
to be a super-secure unhackable Bitcoin

807
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:50,460
wallet and within about well they will

808
00:32:48,179 --> 00:32:55,019
agree about a day it was torn apart by

809
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:56,940
tyranny date so at under tyranny and

810
00:32:55,019 --> 00:32:59,399
cyber Gibbons on the Twitter sphere at

811
00:32:56,940 --> 00:33:01,679
Turkey apart and basically went through

812
00:32:59,399 --> 00:33:03,479
all the claims that I had said like

813
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:05,070
always got limited viewing I can go and

814
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:07,529
I can see it's a dollar so that's the

815
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:09,120
bullshit and oh it's a super secure

816
00:33:07,529 --> 00:33:10,889
device actually they took out a part it

817
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:13,469
was using media tech which is like a

818
00:33:10,889 --> 00:33:16,500
really cheap Android device that was

819
00:33:13,470 --> 00:33:18,509
bill chef is they said it wasn't a phone

820
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:22,470
it had SIM card slots hopefully not

821
00:33:18,509 --> 00:33:24,330
telephone and would wash it and then on

822
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:26,159
to Pandora and some of you might have

823
00:33:24,330 --> 00:33:28,168
seen I was on the BBC Drive my rate book

824
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:33,120
are let me not go fucking Google it's

825
00:33:28,169 --> 00:33:34,500
great for one day the BBC took us to an

826
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:36,479
interview that we got to hack shit

827
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:38,669
basically and essentially Pandora were

828
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:42,090
claiming that they had an unhackable car

829
00:33:38,669 --> 00:33:45,830
alarm because who wants to connect their

830
00:33:42,090 --> 00:33:48,299
cars Internet and make sure that yeah

831
00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:56,720
yeah I'm gonna speed things up just a

832
00:33:48,299 --> 00:34:01,740
little bit so Beth I did repent a bit

833
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:05,090
and we like that the tweet was kinda

834
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:09,780
like yeah we fucked up right

835
00:34:05,090 --> 00:34:11,960
don't use unhackable and then last week

836
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:14,280
this came back with the same sort claims

837
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:19,230
we've spent a lot of time there now on

838
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:21,599
their 37th CTO CEO somebody and they're

839
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:26,969
making the same bold statements again

840
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:29,129
just just don't do it so the good news

841
00:34:26,969 --> 00:34:30,299
is that there are people out there doing

842
00:34:29,129 --> 00:34:33,230
good things and there are organizations

843
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:36,899
that actually give a shit and they do

844
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:38,190
honest keeper our privacy enough a day

845
00:34:36,899 --> 00:34:42,629
security on the web

846
00:34:38,190 --> 00:34:45,059
so passwords do us with our problem and

847
00:34:42,629 --> 00:34:47,668
they remain a problem and there will

848
00:34:45,059 --> 00:34:51,260
remain a problem for a long time and we

849
00:34:47,668 --> 00:34:54,029
see lots of novel alternatives passwords

850
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:57,510
but from a usability point of view and

851
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:59,609
I'm thinking about my mum who's 80 she's

852
00:34:57,510 --> 00:35:01,799
not gonna get beyond a username and

853
00:34:59,609 --> 00:35:06,140
password and for many people in a

854
00:35:01,799 --> 00:35:08,700
similar sort context yes so we have to

855
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:12,150
espouse responsible password management

856
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:14,189
I think first and foremost we do have to

857
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:16,470
have the MFA discussion and we do have

858
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:21,510
to press organisations that can support

859
00:35:16,470 --> 00:35:23,339
NFA to roll out as an optional tool for

860
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:25,289
users that are aware and familiar and

861
00:35:23,339 --> 00:35:27,779
savvy enough to implement NFA for

862
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:30,599
themselves and we should encourage those

863
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:35,690
users to implement NFA ok so that's my

864
00:35:30,599 --> 00:35:38,190
take on it any other good points just so

865
00:35:35,690 --> 00:35:40,440
it doesn't help when the bigger firms

866
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:42,510
actually don't make whole job easier so

867
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:45,839
they put password length restrictions

868
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:47,549
for example Microsoft and even some of

869
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:50,339
the big ones that like Microsoft may

870
00:35:47,549 --> 00:35:52,009
even produce patents when they're

871
00:35:50,339 --> 00:35:54,299
actually generating a password for you

872
00:35:52,010 --> 00:35:55,349
which is something not very good and

873
00:35:54,299 --> 00:35:58,160
when it comes to the two-factor

874
00:35:55,349 --> 00:36:00,690
authentication as well they're actually

875
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:02,038
when it comes to shared email boxes if

876
00:36:00,690 --> 00:36:04,200
you've got shared email boxes in your

877
00:36:02,039 --> 00:36:06,930
organization make sure that you can't

878
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:08,700
log in to office 365 because guess what

879
00:36:06,930 --> 00:36:11,848
you need two factor authentication on

880
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:12,960
those also sometimes and the pickle

881
00:36:11,849 --> 00:36:15,000
could I say so she doesn't read aren't

882
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:16,410
help in are they yeah I mean the hi by

883
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,359
the fact that well we've got sprawling

884
00:36:16,410 --> 00:36:20,308
software architecture implementations

885
00:36:18,359 --> 00:36:21,990
are huge and it makes it really

886
00:36:20,309 --> 00:36:23,430
difficult but what makes life really

887
00:36:21,990 --> 00:36:25,529
difficult for our organization is when

888
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:28,020
that date is looted to the tune millions

889
00:36:25,529 --> 00:36:30,779
and millions of accounts well it could

890
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:33,329
be implemented so it's just one more

891
00:36:30,779 --> 00:36:35,220
thing on passwords an mfa using things

892
00:36:33,329 --> 00:36:37,170
like password manager and something I

893
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:39,288
really love to see more often as we're

894
00:36:37,170 --> 00:36:42,539
both well within North

895
00:36:39,289 --> 00:36:44,430
UTF tokens photo because not only do

896
00:36:42,539 --> 00:36:47,339
they the help prevent against the the

897
00:36:44,430 --> 00:36:48,538
password weak passwords and and that

898
00:36:47,339 --> 00:36:50,578
kind of thing but they're also going to

899
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:51,569
help against things like fishing google

900
00:36:50,579 --> 00:36:53,519
there's

901
00:36:51,569 --> 00:36:57,359
for all the employees were UTF tokens

902
00:36:53,519 --> 00:36:59,249
and to date I think this is for true not

903
00:36:57,359 --> 00:37:05,880
one of their employees have suffered a

904
00:36:59,249 --> 00:37:07,109
fishing success for fishing the tent so

905
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:09,359
these are some of the things that

906
00:37:07,109 --> 00:37:10,828
organizations that are that do care are

907
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:13,859
doing so they're running things like

908
00:37:10,829 --> 00:37:15,900
responsible disclosure policies and show

909
00:37:13,859 --> 00:37:19,199
hands who's familiar with the security

910
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:22,259
dot txt standard okay it's quite a few

911
00:37:19,199 --> 00:37:23,670
people so it's the deployment of a

912
00:37:22,259 --> 00:37:26,069
simple text file onto your web

913
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:27,989
application that points somebody that

914
00:37:26,069 --> 00:37:30,269
finds a book to how to tell you about it

915
00:37:27,989 --> 00:37:31,859
in a responsible fashion it's a really

916
00:37:30,269 --> 00:37:33,359
simple thing to do you'd have to write a

917
00:37:31,859 --> 00:37:35,279
lot of policy around responsible

918
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:36,328
disclosure you just have to put

919
00:37:35,279 --> 00:37:39,180
something out there that guides

920
00:37:36,329 --> 00:37:40,979
somebody's to tell you about it and if

921
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:43,259
they do tell you about it then it's kind

922
00:37:40,979 --> 00:37:44,759
of incumbent on you to fix it if they

923
00:37:43,259 --> 00:37:46,109
cared enough to tell you and not to hack

924
00:37:44,759 --> 00:37:49,589
you that I think you need to care enough

925
00:37:46,109 --> 00:37:50,578
to so to turn that book around severity

926
00:37:49,589 --> 00:37:53,160
based on severity

927
00:37:50,579 --> 00:37:58,769
craphead and not withstanding leave me

928
00:37:53,160 --> 00:38:01,279
alone but yeah be clear and make it make

929
00:37:58,769 --> 00:38:03,959
it really easy for people to gain such

930
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:06,449
so we've got a slide dedicate to our

931
00:38:03,959 --> 00:38:09,629
newest bear farmer miss Christy Morgan

932
00:38:06,449 --> 00:38:13,019
and that's around looking at the

933
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:14,579
researchers yeah so and I recently did a

934
00:38:13,019 --> 00:38:16,558
talk around this so it's just a very

935
00:38:14,579 --> 00:38:18,539
light high-level couple of the points

936
00:38:16,559 --> 00:38:20,150
there are some international standards

937
00:38:18,539 --> 00:38:22,619
that are there to actually help

938
00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:24,059
researchers but these international

939
00:38:22,619 --> 00:38:26,190
standards out there like the ISAs

940
00:38:24,059 --> 00:38:27,989
they're very much aimed at the companies

941
00:38:26,190 --> 00:38:30,719
that they're written for they leave a

942
00:38:27,989 --> 00:38:32,099
lot of room for what is a researcher

943
00:38:30,719 --> 00:38:35,160
supposed to do when they come to a

944
00:38:32,099 --> 00:38:38,910
company and things don't go right

945
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:41,519
one of the more reports rather than

946
00:38:38,910 --> 00:38:42,959
standard that I found was sir in America

947
00:38:41,519 --> 00:38:44,879
now those guys are really good

948
00:38:42,959 --> 00:38:46,558
if you eat their report that they've

949
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:49,369
done around responsible exposure

950
00:38:46,559 --> 00:38:51,299
coordinated disclosure you'll find that

951
00:38:49,369 --> 00:38:54,449
they've actually written it for the

952
00:38:51,299 --> 00:38:57,420
researchers because we need support and

953
00:38:54,449 --> 00:38:58,650
advice and help be backed up there's

954
00:38:57,420 --> 00:39:01,079
some changes in the law I know some of

955
00:38:58,650 --> 00:39:02,950
the NCC guys we're trying to get a lot

956
00:39:01,079 --> 00:39:04,829
of people talking about the CMA

957
00:39:02,950 --> 00:39:06,669
Acton sin if that can be changed at all

958
00:39:04,829 --> 00:39:08,260
when I've spoken to some other

959
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:09,700
researchers they've said that we have to

960
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:11,050
be quite careful because when they

961
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:13,509
change the law they don't always change

962
00:39:11,050 --> 00:39:18,280
it in the best for our own benefit

963
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:19,570
always and yeah I mean appreciate if

964
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:21,550
someone's knocking on your door and tell

965
00:39:19,570 --> 00:39:23,320
you you've got a problem no I like them

966
00:39:21,550 --> 00:39:25,030
in and speak to them is far too often

967
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:27,339
I've got researchers coming to me now

968
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:29,109
and telling me basically these guys

969
00:39:27,339 --> 00:39:31,060
being pricks to me all that just goes to

970
00:39:29,109 --> 00:39:34,960
me and you know it's not not really fair

971
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:36,670
is it I just want to add something

972
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:39,280
because I've had this time and time

973
00:39:36,670 --> 00:39:41,650
again where you afford something as

974
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:45,970
Chrissy said yeah they get radio silence

975
00:39:41,650 --> 00:39:48,730
or no response sorry a response but then

976
00:39:45,970 --> 00:39:51,129
a guy silenced all and companies need to

977
00:39:48,730 --> 00:39:52,990
realize that researchers coming to them

978
00:39:51,130 --> 00:39:54,550
with these findings is not a criticism

979
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:57,040
of that company

980
00:39:54,550 --> 00:39:59,230
everyone has forced take it on as a good

981
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:00,339
thing you've not ended up in the media

982
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:03,369
for the wrong reasons

983
00:40:00,339 --> 00:40:05,410
fix it work with the research give him a

984
00:40:03,369 --> 00:40:07,900
thank you doesn't always have to be many

985
00:40:05,410 --> 00:40:10,149
a simple thank-you goes a long way and

986
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:12,040
doing that will help strengthen your

987
00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:15,099
relationship with that community and

988
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:16,060
make things better for your company one

989
00:40:15,099 --> 00:40:18,520
less thing on that as well we've

990
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:20,950
actually seen companies recently the

991
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:22,720
hard breaches and deal with the

992
00:40:20,950 --> 00:40:25,180
disclosure and then the fix so well that

993
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:26,439
they actually come out looking good like

994
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:27,940
the one that the one example that always

995
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:30,250
sticks in my mind was cloud fly with

996
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:31,359
cloud leads and you know that first CD

997
00:40:30,250 --> 00:40:32,890
owned company if you aren't familiar you

998
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:34,540
can read the details but that that could

999
00:40:32,890 --> 00:40:36,240
have been like a devastating issue but

1000
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:38,349
they just dealt with it so well and

1001
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:40,270
transparently and quickly you know

1002
00:40:38,349 --> 00:40:41,650
actually you know what okay I don't mind

1003
00:40:40,270 --> 00:40:43,000
using this company because I know when

1004
00:40:41,650 --> 00:40:45,970
things eventually do go wrong they're

1005
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:48,910
gonna nail the fakes so yeah I think

1006
00:40:45,970 --> 00:40:50,980
this is really important sorry so I'll

1007
00:40:48,910 --> 00:40:53,440
just kind of say done this test on a few

1008
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:57,130
other venues right if you've heard of

1009
00:40:53,440 --> 00:41:00,220
the Equifax breach majority of room he's

1010
00:40:57,130 --> 00:41:03,069
heard of a discuss breach are only a

1011
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:04,959
handful yeah I just want to add one

1012
00:41:03,069 --> 00:41:07,359
thing about this because the saddest

1013
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:11,200
thing in the world happened as a result

1014
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:13,029
of irresponsible disclosure so I don't

1015
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:14,439
know if you followed on Twitter the

1016
00:41:13,030 --> 00:41:16,640
sandbox escaper

1017
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:19,790
saga other

1018
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:23,359
I would say angry possibly mentally ill

1019
00:41:19,790 --> 00:41:27,110
person who dropped a series of zero days

1020
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:30,290
that were easily weaponized into very

1021
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:32,510
serious malware at the same time calling

1022
00:41:30,290 --> 00:41:36,170
out the FBI and the American government

1023
00:41:32,510 --> 00:41:40,720
I feel like that was a giant cry for

1024
00:41:36,170 --> 00:41:44,480
help and it was a very sad moment in

1025
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:47,080
irresponsible disclosure because doing

1026
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:49,700
that in that fashion to me is

1027
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:52,370
essentially like trying to get the US

1028
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:56,720
military to carry out your suicidal

1029
00:41:52,370 --> 00:42:00,109
wishes we have a precedent for this a

1030
00:41:56,720 --> 00:42:03,020
different dude by the name of trick who

1031
00:42:00,110 --> 00:42:04,400
is with team poison and started a little

1032
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:06,950
something but they called the cyber

1033
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:08,840
caliphate who took a selfie in front of

1034
00:42:06,950 --> 00:42:12,680
a recognizable landmark and was

1035
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:14,240
vaporized by a Predator drone so even

1036
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:16,700
though the paper said this is like the

1037
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:19,970
first time so many blah blah know if you

1038
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:21,109
do the history and you understand what

1039
00:42:19,970 --> 00:42:23,390
is at stake

1040
00:42:21,110 --> 00:42:25,460
you're responsible disclosure can lead

1041
00:42:23,390 --> 00:42:28,660
to physical violence at security

1042
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:31,190
conventions we saw that one we saw and

1043
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:33,710
possibly your untimely demise

1044
00:42:31,190 --> 00:42:36,800
just just to be clear the the physical

1045
00:42:33,710 --> 00:42:38,630
act at the conference that didn't the

1046
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:40,820
passenger three responsible disclosure

1047
00:42:38,630 --> 00:42:41,990
yeah but then they were irresponsibly

1048
00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:45,800
hit in the face

1049
00:42:41,990 --> 00:42:48,979
I believe this all right we got we got

1050
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:51,560
15 minutes left okay just them fix you

1051
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:54,980
stuff all right so do pen testing and

1052
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:56,810
test you processes test you people don't

1053
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:58,100
be afraid to get into external auditing

1054
00:42:56,810 --> 00:42:59,450
done yeah don't be afraid to get

1055
00:42:58,100 --> 00:43:01,130
Authority and to come and talk to you

1056
00:42:59,450 --> 00:43:04,009
about what you need to do to be a better

1057
00:43:01,130 --> 00:43:05,360
organization a quick view people with

1058
00:43:04,010 --> 00:43:07,820
the tools and the knowledge and the

1059
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:09,560
expertise to carry out repairs and do

1060
00:43:07,820 --> 00:43:12,740
the right things design and build stuff

1061
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:14,840
securely to begin with so these guys do

1062
00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:16,970
the half you sell first stuff which is

1063
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:18,950
something that Troy conceived many years

1064
00:43:16,970 --> 00:43:20,180
ago that got me an application security

1065
00:43:18,950 --> 00:43:22,310
in the first place and I've been quite

1066
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:27,859
public about that you're running courses

1067
00:43:22,310 --> 00:43:28,910
right this year okay so Glasgow London

1068
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:31,880
so see so

1069
00:43:28,910 --> 00:43:33,680
you wanna know more about that very

1070
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:35,930
important you can't blame people if they

1071
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:37,580
don't know that applies to whether

1072
00:43:35,930 --> 00:43:40,279
you're a software developer network up

1073
00:43:37,580 --> 00:43:41,900
designer network engineer or an operator

1074
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:45,790
on a sweater again okay

1075
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:47,840
let's just be clear about how Ivan pwned

1076
00:43:45,790 --> 00:43:50,000
everyone in the room is probably being

1077
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:52,400
pwned how many in the room should gun

1078
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:57,860
show of hands has proved it by using

1079
00:43:52,400 --> 00:44:01,040
this application yeah self validating

1080
00:43:57,860 --> 00:44:03,470
that I think it's fair enough so till

1081
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:04,850
there are stickers around Troy managed

1082
00:44:03,470 --> 00:44:07,819
to throw them out at people better than

1083
00:44:04,850 --> 00:44:12,310
we threw our swag out at Leeds lost

1084
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:14,840
somebody also now down a bit now I

1085
00:44:12,310 --> 00:44:16,759
thought you're here because you want to

1086
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:18,890
get involved in the community you want

1087
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:20,300
to talk to people though fighting the

1088
00:44:18,890 --> 00:44:22,250
same battles you're fighting have the

1089
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:23,990
same anxiety the same aspirations that

1090
00:44:22,250 --> 00:44:25,640
you have you wouldn't be here if you

1091
00:44:23,990 --> 00:44:27,439
want to learn new stuff or you want to

1092
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:29,210
interact with people that are on the

1093
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:33,380
same side as you so that's really

1094
00:44:29,210 --> 00:44:37,280
important sharing information hmm a

1095
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:38,840
breach isn't an if it's a when some of

1096
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:40,760
you will work for organizations that

1097
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:43,280
have already been breached but you don't

1098
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:46,460
yet know about it okay so don't live

1099
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:49,760
under the Troy might dot don't live

1100
00:44:46,460 --> 00:44:51,380
under the misapprehension that never

1101
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:54,250
happened to us because it will and when

1102
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:57,770
it does it'll feel a bit like that okay

1103
00:44:54,250 --> 00:44:59,570
so your organization but it's important

1104
00:44:57,770 --> 00:45:02,060
that you don't panic it's important that

1105
00:44:59,570 --> 00:45:03,710
you've prepared so it'll feel like that

1106
00:45:02,060 --> 00:45:07,460
in everyone's head and we do all fuck up

1107
00:45:03,710 --> 00:45:10,370
right regularly but there is a little

1108
00:45:07,460 --> 00:45:12,590
toolkit that you can you can use to help

1109
00:45:10,370 --> 00:45:15,710
you through so again it's about planning

1110
00:45:12,590 --> 00:45:18,500
it's about Incident Response so it sets

1111
00:45:15,710 --> 00:45:20,180
it there is a bit of an analogy around

1112
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:21,380
the bereavement curve when you've had a

1113
00:45:20,180 --> 00:45:24,440
data breach and that's something that

1114
00:45:21,380 --> 00:45:27,560
Troy's written about spoken about don't

1115
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:29,750
blame the other guy you probably failed

1116
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:32,750
which allowed the attacker to succeed

1117
00:45:29,750 --> 00:45:35,870
that's more often than not the the

1118
00:45:32,750 --> 00:45:38,210
scenario that we that we find seek

1119
00:45:35,870 --> 00:45:40,220
support so again if you've got a cert in

1120
00:45:38,210 --> 00:45:42,560
your country in the UK we have the NCIC

1121
00:45:40,220 --> 00:45:42,839
very capable bunch of people that move

1122
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:44,490
on

1123
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:46,140
leaps and bounds in what they're

1124
00:45:44,490 --> 00:45:48,839
available to do what their capabilities

1125
00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:53,339
are in recent times go out through the

1126
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:55,590
authorities so the ICO okay you need to

1127
00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:57,840
notify these guys anyway you've got a 72

1128
00:45:55,590 --> 00:46:00,690
hour window from discovering a breach to

1129
00:45:57,840 --> 00:46:03,000
notify the authority and if you are a

1130
00:46:00,690 --> 00:46:05,580
Tele telecommunications company or your

1131
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:07,920
process data is that kind of wake you've

1132
00:46:05,580 --> 00:46:09,779
got 24 hours that's not a long time to

1133
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:11,490
get your information in order and go out

1134
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:14,880
to your wrist and your data protection

1135
00:46:11,490 --> 00:46:16,740
authority but when you do notify your

1136
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:19,140
ICO or equivalent they can actually

1137
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:20,700
parachute in some really clever people

1138
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:23,190
to help you out to help you through it

1139
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:24,509
to help you with the the PR the incident

1140
00:46:23,190 --> 00:46:26,940
management getting getting right

1141
00:46:24,510 --> 00:46:29,880
messages and for the public don't be a

1142
00:46:26,940 --> 00:46:31,890
talk talk okay so what happened to

1143
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:33,870
figure it all out do your analysis do

1144
00:46:31,890 --> 00:46:36,029
your forensics speak to people don't

1145
00:46:33,870 --> 00:46:37,560
blame people yeah just engage the right

1146
00:46:36,030 --> 00:46:39,450
people and understand what the problem

1147
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:41,940
was because if you understand you've

1148
00:46:39,450 --> 00:46:43,770
learned a lesson and you can introduce

1149
00:46:41,940 --> 00:46:45,360
it the right controls the right

1150
00:46:43,770 --> 00:46:49,380
technology the right processes right

1151
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:51,570
where nasteria leave it happening yeah

1152
00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:54,570
and take it on the chin because it's

1153
00:46:51,570 --> 00:46:54,900
happened and move on and you'll feel

1154
00:46:54,570 --> 00:46:57,000
better

1155
00:46:54,900 --> 00:47:00,270
and you and your customers and you users

1156
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:01,800
will feel better as well so we've got

1157
00:47:00,270 --> 00:47:06,090
nine minutes left I'm going to just

1158
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:07,530
quickly blast it so North High drove

1159
00:47:06,090 --> 00:47:09,620
they were a great example of an

1160
00:47:07,530 --> 00:47:11,700
organization that really you messed up

1161
00:47:09,620 --> 00:47:14,880
but they did everything really

1162
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:16,950
reasonable in that power to keep

1163
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:19,530
messages going out to shareholders to

1164
00:47:16,950 --> 00:47:21,359
customers to people that cared they side

1165
00:47:19,530 --> 00:47:23,250
channels on Azure websites it was really

1166
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:26,400
in the scheme of things it was a pretty

1167
00:47:23,250 --> 00:47:28,440
cool response they did a good job okay

1168
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:31,800
who knows what one of these is hey

1169
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:34,530
that's mine my next question was hands

1170
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:37,430
up who's got one so there's a backstory

1171
00:47:34,530 --> 00:47:40,420
to that and well talking about stories

1172
00:47:37,430 --> 00:47:42,848
[Laughter]

1173
00:47:40,420 --> 00:47:44,650
we hear that the the cock cam has a

1174
00:47:42,849 --> 00:47:46,119
particularly good resolution and you

1175
00:47:44,650 --> 00:47:49,569
took a few pictures that you didn't

1176
00:47:46,119 --> 00:47:51,190
share so but yeah I mean cock I'm going

1177
00:47:49,569 --> 00:47:52,839
back to this they was for research

1178
00:47:51,190 --> 00:47:56,349
purposes of course

1179
00:47:52,839 --> 00:47:57,640
yeah they had had a problem and again

1180
00:47:56,349 --> 00:47:59,589
twittery actually Cameron Rowe got

1181
00:47:57,640 --> 00:48:01,058
involved but they handled it really well

1182
00:47:59,589 --> 00:48:05,078
in fact the diversity this company very

1183
00:48:01,059 --> 00:48:06,460
quickly and then online course oh well I

1184
00:48:05,079 --> 00:48:09,420
see those guys I'm gonna have to do this

1185
00:48:06,460 --> 00:48:09,420
again so sorry

1186
00:48:10,049 --> 00:48:17,109
alright so in talk very briefly about

1187
00:48:14,099 --> 00:48:20,470
sandbox escaper earlier on so we won't

1188
00:48:17,109 --> 00:48:22,450
revisit that example but what we need to

1189
00:48:20,470 --> 00:48:24,390
do is make it clear that you know you

1190
00:48:22,450 --> 00:48:27,160
don't just drop 0 days on the we're not

1191
00:48:24,390 --> 00:48:28,450
because you pissed at the world there

1192
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:32,049
are different ways you can go about

1193
00:48:28,450 --> 00:48:33,308
getting you issues dealt invented that's

1194
00:48:32,049 --> 00:48:36,009
what this community tends to be all

1195
00:48:33,309 --> 00:48:38,470
about and in doing that if you do choose

1196
00:48:36,010 --> 00:48:40,750
to drop a 0 days then you are opening

1197
00:48:38,470 --> 00:48:42,459
yourself up to a lot of criticism and at

1198
00:48:40,750 --> 00:48:46,119
the Center for law enforcement to be on

1199
00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:49,680
the case and in tricks case vaporized by

1200
00:48:46,119 --> 00:48:53,200
Tennessee yeah that's kind of extreme

1201
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:57,538
don't make false claims so if you think

1202
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:57,538
your products in hackable just think it

1203
00:49:01,650 --> 00:49:08,829
somebody like Ken Monroe all the guys at

1204
00:49:04,299 --> 00:49:11,109
PT PR and you see any also works PGP

1205
00:49:08,829 --> 00:49:13,150

1206
00:49:11,109 --> 00:49:14,710

1207
00:49:13,150 --> 00:49:16,569
thanks for providing us an unlimited

1208
00:49:14,710 --> 00:49:18,099
supply of material for our talks you

1209
00:49:16,569 --> 00:49:24,069
just need to be clear the beer farmers

1210
00:49:18,099 --> 00:49:26,230
site is not unhackable think very long

1211
00:49:24,069 --> 00:49:27,880
and hard before considering daxing

1212
00:49:26,230 --> 00:49:31,809
people whose privacy and anonymity

1213
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:34,500
they'd rather have preserved I'll leave

1214
00:49:31,809 --> 00:49:36,880
that hanging I heard that I heard that

1215
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:38,680
it's a little bit of respect the end of

1216
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:40,599
the day we're all here I like to think

1217
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:42,879
the majority was a here because we care

1218
00:49:40,599 --> 00:49:44,470
so when people having a bad day or

1219
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:45,940
saying things that are at odds with your

1220
00:49:44,470 --> 00:49:48,160
opinion then just come with that slack

1221
00:49:45,940 --> 00:49:50,049
and I'm guilty this as well so you know

1222
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:52,029
you just need to be a little bit more

1223
00:49:50,049 --> 00:49:53,660
mindful of people and accept if you

1224
00:49:52,029 --> 00:49:56,480
punch a cat then all

1225
00:49:53,660 --> 00:49:58,399
Cave everybody daxing you for that yeah

1226
00:49:56,480 --> 00:50:00,319
they recorded it on video and then they

1227
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:02,930
arrested the Doyle douchebag I was

1228
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:04,520
awesome not punching the cat that wasn't

1229
00:50:02,930 --> 00:50:06,200
awesome no it was a bad thing it's

1230
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:07,640
arresting the douchebag yeah I was a

1231
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:08,779
training course recently where a

1232
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:10,700
colleague of mine came out with

1233
00:50:08,780 --> 00:50:12,589
something he'd heard which was very

1234
00:50:10,700 --> 00:50:14,390
individual but you meet they're having a

1235
00:50:12,589 --> 00:50:16,880
personal battle or more that you know

1236
00:50:14,390 --> 00:50:19,368
nothing about and I thought that was

1237
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:20,630
really an important point I took it was

1238
00:50:19,369 --> 00:50:22,880
the most valuable thing I took from the

1239
00:50:20,630 --> 00:50:24,500
training course because it's right don't

1240
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:29,270
judge people and don't assume everyone's

1241
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:41,420
having a good day so we've been the bear

1242
00:50:29,270 --> 00:50:43,309
farmers see you the bar but wait hang on

1243
00:50:41,420 --> 00:50:48,650

1244
00:50:43,309 --> 00:50:52,819

1247
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:59,089
were busy at the mapping last year

1248
00:50:58,010 --> 00:51:00,410
looking at all the shit that had been

1249
00:50:59,089 --> 00:51:01,578
happening on the Internet of the people

1250
00:51:00,410 --> 00:51:03,618

1251

for standing a water thing until

1279
00:52:19,540 --> 00:52:24,130
foreseeable times HotList app was the

1280
00:52:22,660 --> 00:52:28,660
bit fire clip so while it's still

1281
00:52:24,130 --> 00:52:31,060
available to buy on Black Bull pier the

1282
00:52:28,660 --> 00:52:34,029
hacker collective mistakenly known as

1283
00:52:31,060 --> 00:52:35,410
cyborg isn't a sniper Gibbons also

1284
00:52:34,030 --> 00:52:38,380
sometimes somehow called

1285
00:52:35,410 --> 00:52:40,330
over soft I did read out probably could

1286
00:52:38,380 --> 00:52:43,390
sell but it was a bunch of people and

1287
00:52:40,330 --> 00:52:45,310
attorney overstaffed tautology

1288
00:52:43,390 --> 00:52:48,970
yeah butch colleges in the room is right

1289
00:52:45,310 --> 00:52:51,190
there nice dogs really get some really

1290
00:52:48,970 --> 00:52:52,810
clever people who took took a bit prior

1291
00:52:51,190 --> 00:52:54,910
to task in demonstrate that you could

1292
00:52:52,810 --> 00:52:58,600
play doom on I try think that that was a

1293
00:52:54,910 --> 00:53:00,279
cool thing I saw doom up the info center

1294
00:52:58,600 --> 00:53:04,089
ox time sells a book called infoset

1295
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:09,850
Rockstar but running is ecommerce site

1296
00:53:04,090 --> 00:53:16,500
over HTTP DCI was fixed it it is fixed

1297
00:53:09,850 --> 00:53:19,630
it even even redirects now right anyway

1298
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:21,550
fingers in their ears Dave Winer we've

1299
00:53:19,630 --> 00:53:24,490
avoided the term anti-vaxxer and so I

1300
00:53:21,550 --> 00:53:26,770
just said it their fees on some bloke

1301
00:53:24,490 --> 00:53:28,479
but he's got very strong opposite

1302
00:53:26,770 --> 00:53:31,720
opinions around the encrypted web and

1303
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:32,320
while you were doing that Cambridge on

1304
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:34,029
let's go

1305
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:37,500
bear in mind this was January so they

1306
00:53:34,030 --> 00:53:39,850
were still in the news Zuckerberg

1307
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:43,840
Marriott because they really did lose a

1308
00:53:39,850 --> 00:53:45,700
lot of data my date and finally the

1309
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:47,940
golden cowbell Award which was in our

1310
00:53:45,700 --> 00:53:49,899
opinion worth

1311
00:53:47,940 --> 00:53:51,400
issuing to Troy because in our opinion

1312
00:53:49,900 --> 00:53:53,200
not just because he's here because we

1313
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:55,450
did say in January long before we got

1314
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:58,000
him to come join us but we think it was

1315
00:53:55,450 --> 00:53:59,919
individually a lot you know mall and

1316
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:01,420
many in terms of furthering the cause of

1317
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:03,580
information security both for

1318
00:54:01,420 --> 00:54:08,110
individuals and for businesses so for

1319
00:54:03,580 --> 00:54:11,620
