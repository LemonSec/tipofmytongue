1
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:07,140
hi everyone welcome to my talk

2
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:08,670
oh yeah and leave his tape on mobile

3
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:11,010
dangerous for the looking girl so just a

4
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:13,710
bit of a mouthful to say I must have met

5
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:16,198
um a little bit of background about how

6
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:18,779
this talk came about I went to security

7
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:22,020
a few months ago with a colleague and I

8
00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:23,759
met I bumped into Andy and David you

9
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:26,310
start talking about b-sides and possibly

10
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,410
doing a talk and I said to them I want

11
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:30,720
to do a talk after my dissertation but

12
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:33,420
after a few beers they did persuade me

13
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:36,390
to do this talk now so anyway I helped

14
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:38,129
me out but this so quick run through

15
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:39,960
what my talks and if you bow these are a

16
00:00:38,129 --> 00:00:41,910
few points that I've expanded on a

17
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:43,079
little bit it's quite steep learning

18
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:45,239
curve because I didn't really have a

19
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:47,520
talk before so I wanted to go except

20
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:50,788
it's like working on it quite a lot and

21
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,620
I will speak learning curve for this but

22
00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:54,270
first thing I wanted to look at was why

23
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:56,190
do people actually read their devices

24
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:57,870
and I quite a lot positives initially I

25
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:59,160
thought was a bad thing I thought people

26
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:00,089
like if you've rooted your device you're

27
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,319
opening yourself up to a lot of

28
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:05,309
vulnerabilities but actually you can

29
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:07,560
them you can definitely make your hats

30
00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:09,149
later so you you can increase the

31
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:11,400
privacy you can get liberate of a lot of

32
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:13,500
the bloatware on your device and you can

33
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:15,360
install cool themes and third-party apps

34
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:17,369
if you want to do that I mean how many

35
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:21,180
of you in the audience has an Android

36
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:23,729
device cool how many of you have rooted

37
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:25,110
your Android device so a lot of you

38
00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:26,130
probably knew what you were doing when

39
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:28,080
you're rooting your device especially

40
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:29,610
here but some people they don't

41
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,840
necessarily know what they're doing and

42
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:33,179
they could be speedy installing custom

43
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:35,040
themes and new roms and you can't be

44
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:36,299
cool things that but you could also open

45
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,340
up your talk to possibly you could

46
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:40,229
probably thought you could possibly

47
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:42,259
break your device which I did experience

48
00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:44,220
first time when I was testing things and

49
00:01:42,259 --> 00:01:46,049
also you can see that some of the apps

50
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:49,250
won't work because in case you install a

51
00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:52,229
third-party app it could be a bower and

52
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:56,100
you could open your your device up turn

53
00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:59,009
more cool so first I looked at how you

54
00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:01,890
actually real device so there are two

55
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:03,719
ways I found so far there were ones

56
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:05,969
immanuel immanuel way and then I saw

57
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:09,449
that you can install apps when you were

58
00:02:05,969 --> 00:02:11,099
rooting your device so when I went to

59
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:13,780
root my device the device I had a

60
00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:16,089
samsung Jeffrey that really rubbish that

61
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:19,000
want to do it on my iPhone I tried to

62
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:20,500
install Kingo root and one click and one

63
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,959
click root the one think great you had

64
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:24,520
to pay for the Kingo root it didn't

65
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:25,840
actually work on my device and I wanted

66
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:28,480
to see how you'd be able to read a

67
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:32,230
device manually anyway so I give a try

68
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:34,540
and I installed 12 recovery image so

69
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:38,488
when i went to root it I went into

70
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:41,079
fastboot mode and it still installed the

71
00:02:38,489 --> 00:02:43,270
recovery image and then I ended up going

72
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:44,950
through and they're installing the

73
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:47,860
binary so I you super see although my

74
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:49,480
disc is more of a newer version that

75
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:51,580
people use and when it's a recovery mode

76
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:53,980
and still that binary and basically

77
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:55,450
installing the superuser binary can then

78
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:57,160
enable you to go out for religious tea

79
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:59,410
applications and you could do cool

80
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:01,000
things like customize your firmware on

81
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:02,560
your device or anything like that I

82
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,600
thought was really interesting actually

83
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,190
before I did the talk I thought up it

84
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:07,690
could be it could be a danger obviously

85
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:09,220
and I've changed my mind a lot on the

86
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:10,540
site if you know what you're doing you

87
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:11,830
could do some really cool things you can

88
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:13,780
improve the battery life of your device

89
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:16,060
and things that Seth had enough it's

90
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:17,709
that firstly first I set up my lab

91
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:19,299
really could be around theory it's not

92
00:03:17,709 --> 00:03:21,910
enough install I didn't really notice

93
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:24,579
tearing I had a PI pi 0 which had

94
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:28,269
terrible processing power so I came to a

95
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:30,760
PI 3 B+ and worked a lot better just a

96
00:03:28,269 --> 00:03:32,680
quick setup I mean I had a Peyser had

97
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:34,600
one us people and I was lugging my mouse

98
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:37,000
taking out plug in my keyboard taking it

99
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:38,560
out and I plugged my phone it was like I

100
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,690
can't actually run any commands on my

101
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,670
phone because for my phone and connector

102
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:45,780
because she didn't have enough people so

103
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:48,160
I had a USB port splitter and got that

104
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:49,420
and the whole idea behind this talk was

105
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:51,280
the fact that I've been seeing a lot of

106
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:53,980
these USB ports around charging USB

107
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,630
ports on my plays and buses and whatnot

108
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:57,100
and I think this is a possible attack

109
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:58,989
vector here because if you plug your

110
00:03:57,100 --> 00:04:00,430
device into this random USB port you

111
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:02,799
don't necessarily know what's going to

112
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:05,320
happen so the whole idea behind this was

113
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:07,420
programmatically rooting your device and

114
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:09,519
I did feel a lot like this when I

115
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:10,630
started looking into it because there's

116
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:12,459
a lot of there's a lot of reasons why

117
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:14,500
you can't and security is actually quite

118
00:04:12,459 --> 00:04:16,600
high on your devices so for example when

119
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:18,640
you plug your device in it's the USB

120
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:20,440
does USB debugging after that pop up on

121
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:22,150
the screen that comes up you have to

122
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:23,469
physically real device as well press

123
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:27,700
buttons and manual questions and whatnot

124
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:28,960
and yeah human human input is needed so

125
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:30,430
you do have a pop oh you have to press

126
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,890
okay and whatnot that's our that's

127
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:36,730
that's an issue so I've decided to try

128
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:38,080
and find ideas to work around that but

129
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:39,970
first I want to see what you could do

130
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:42,010
when you plug your device into it u.s.

131
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:44,170
people when it's not rooted some issue

132
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:46,300
say there's a quick disclaimer here is

133
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:49,180
that if you plug your device into a USB

134
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:53,470
for charging port if a PI was behind

135
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:55,390
this thought then what could happen and

136
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:56,680
I played around with you dev rules to

137
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:59,110
interrupt and kernel detect when a

138
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:01,180
device is plugged in I've create a shell

139
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:02,620
script to kick off screen recording

140
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:04,720
which is quite cool thing so if you do

141
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:06,910
adb shell you can scream and call your

142
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:09,820
device was quite a few ifs and buts they

143
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:11,620
would the code that I wrote here you can

144
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:14,680
see the vendor ID text the device and

145
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:16,600
keeps off the PI script you have to have

146
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:18,040
a specific vendor ID for it to kick off

147
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:20,080
in the background and always it's very

148
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:22,300
simple code and there's a lot I want to

149
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:25,210
develop on it from this but basically of

150
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:26,680
course screen and you can capture it so

151
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:29,229
it maximum is about three minutes but

152
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:30,850
you could possibly capture passwords and

153
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:33,160
you can see that's showing up there

154
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:34,990
and you could also see emails or

155
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:37,240
sensitive documents and I thought I was

156
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:38,710
quite interesting but I little that idea

157
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,970
that if you did plug that device and you

158
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:41,770
don't know what's happening because the

159
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:43,390
user doesn't see it necessarily you have

160
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:46,210
to make sure that the device is unlocked

161
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:49,060
and the USB debugging enabled first

162
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:51,669
actually watch well one of the issues

163
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:53,920
because the USB debugging pop-up came up

164
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:56,530
I was thinking what's a good way to work

165
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:57,460
around that so I had to play around with

166
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:59,320
a business card

167
00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:01,810
device and I went through about five of

168
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:04,360
them because of all them broke but you

169
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:05,530
can automate the keyboard on the battle

170
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:07,540
pretend like it's a human interface

171
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:10,419
device and automate some of the steps so

172
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:12,520
here I've just got gif of the code

173
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:14,470
working now on the side and you can see

174
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:15,849
it's switching and pressing ok and if

175
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:17,980
this develops a little bit further you'd

176
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:19,240
be able to kind of cancel out the pop

177
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:22,000
out because imagine if you plug the

178
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:23,410
device into this USB port this runs and

179
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,330
it's just sending the codes and you can

180
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:27,370
automate a lot of this alright and the

181
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:32,260
pie could be something for and you could

182
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:33,400
also you could also crack passwords they

183
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:36,990
take a really long time I didn't really

184
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:40,599
try it was something I'd like to develop

185
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:42,010
so initially I had a look at third

186
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:45,400
epps as well because i was one of the

187
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:47,230
issues behind it and there was one

188
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:49,179
called a fake snap to act i looked into

189
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:50,650
you and if you were someone like a grand

190
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:53,500
mal for example they had a fun and they

191
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:56,560
installed a this app this app could

192
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:59,230
possibly with the permissions go back

193
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,730
network and also steal the credentials

194
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:02,950
and it used to be in the Google Play

195
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:04,750
Store it's taken down now but it's so

196
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:07,270
easy cuz this is the newbies talk you

197
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:09,390
could just download the apk file and you

198
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:13,690
could install it under file to listen

199
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:16,060
like so being a newbie that I am I

200
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:18,370
decided to try and create an apk file

201
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:21,730
using easy split which is basically pass

202
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:23,140
the NSF console and asteroid and I had a

203
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:26,590
look at trying to install that onto my

204
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:29,440
device so I used the ADB Android

205
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:32,440
debugging bridge to automate the install

206
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:36,370
on the back of the with my PI and you

207
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:39,040
plug it in and when I when I plugged it

208
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:40,630
in I actually lost the apk file I don't

209
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:42,010
know how and I checked it I tried to

210
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:43,210
understand it what an uninstall try to

211
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:44,920
install it was saying it was already

212
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:47,710
installed so if I know what happened

213
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:49,300
there but that was were the things I

214
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:50,919
think if you manage to install it and

215
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:53,410
kick it off then it would run in the

216
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:55,420
background and you'd be able to exploit

217
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:57,310
it in prerov as TCP connection with the

218
00:07:55,420 --> 00:08:00,310
payload so if you imagine you've plugged

219
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:01,630
your device in and you can install the

220
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:02,890
apk file and they might click on it

221
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:05,290
through some social engineering or

222
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:06,640
possibly and attend I saw I had little

223
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:08,830
million zillion tech st. fully

224
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:10,390
understand but these can kick off in the

225
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:11,289
background if you run the ABB shell come

226
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:13,360
on

227
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:14,830
if you automated that for a basket when

228
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,840
it's plugged in and you develop real

229
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:19,510
kicked off that you'd be able to create

230
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:22,270
this reverse TCP capture TCP connection

231
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:23,950
to the PI and then from that SSH so he

232
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:25,810
could be like hacker in a cafe or

233
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:28,000
something SSH into the PI that's hidden

234
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:29,830
disguised and then you'd be able to

235
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,270
access all these files on this rooted

236
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:33,159
device for example that has been plugged

237
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:34,929
in and then would really be none the

238
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:37,270
wiser otherwise you'd have to make sure

239
00:08:34,929 --> 00:08:41,079
that you've unlocked the device again

240
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:43,478
and got rid of all the popups so because

241
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:45,700
the install the apk file didn't fully

242
00:08:43,479 --> 00:08:47,260
work out to ours like well how it was

243
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:49,660
this apk file actually doing in the

244
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:51,390
background so I used apktool just to

245
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:54,209
pull out some of the files of the

246
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:55,830
a PK that had been generating them SF

247
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:58,620
consoles so I wanted to see how it was

248
00:08:55,830 --> 00:09:00,600
working and basically had all these

249
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:02,520
permissions and it's someone installed

250
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:04,020
this apk files like clicking yes and

251
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:05,850
granted all these permissions you

252
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:07,260
basically had a bug on your class this

253
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:09,420
is really interesting has something I

254
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:11,160
really want to look into as well so

255
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:13,620
there's a lot of ideas because I really

256
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:15,540
wanted to do some I just yeah so you've

257
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:17,160
got all these machines and I also had to

258
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:19,319
play around with the smiley files and

259
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:21,209
this tool called x2 just so I had a look

260
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:22,440
in that R and X teacher and I opened up

261
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:24,600
some the Smarty file so I could read

262
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:27,060
them in Java they're too far that

263
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:29,610
definitely will have a future

264
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:31,680
a few quick mentions but I wanted to say

265
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:33,510
with there's a lot of cool things

266
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:35,280
already out there in terms of just

267
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:37,350
storing a device I guess so you've got

268
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:39,630
the USB killer this short circuit said

269
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:40,740
itself uses your phone and kills it

270
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:42,689
completely so imagine if you're a

271
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:44,130
businessman or whatever a new plug your

272
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:45,510
device into this u.s. people and it

273
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:47,100
kills your phone that's basically

274
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:49,260
basically your life as a lot of people

275
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:50,520
have phones these days and it's Freder

276
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:52,439
as well I'm pretty sure there was a talk

277
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:54,840
on that earlier and if you've rooted

278
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:56,640
your data device for example and you've

279
00:09:54,840 --> 00:10:00,690
installed Freder and you've used it to

280
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:02,610
pretend that you're not rude then you

281
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:04,340
can install third-party malicious app

282
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:06,810
and that will get all the accesses lara

283
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:09,930
break out the sandbox environment and

284
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:11,939
cause bit damage so freely could be a

285
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:14,930
nice eye patches are quite interesting

286
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:17,430
but a lot too much depending on time

287
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:18,839
yeah so I wanted to mention iOS because

288
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:20,930
I didn't play around with it's a bit of

289
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:23,040
a gray area because it's close sauce I

290
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:24,959
didn't look into the vulnerabilities of

291
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:27,990
it however there's a exploit database

292
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:28,890
for this you can find online I've got

293
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:31,080
I'm pretty sure there's a link in my

294
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:33,840
description you can come and talk about

295
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:36,870
you would yeah it's not just Android

296
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:38,550
devices that are vulnerable and part of

297
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:40,650
the futures I do want to look into this

298
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:42,180
a bit further and I'd lovely like a 2.90

299
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:44,220
of something where I've actually like

300
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:45,449
research into a lot because I didn't

301
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:47,640
have too much time to research into this

302
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:49,470
one so I'm interested in mobile malware

303
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:51,780
are we searching to that and I love the

304
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:53,580
automation size behind it so the whole

305
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:55,410
idea of this was automating the exploits

306
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:58,890
when you plug your device into the PI so

307
00:10:55,410 --> 00:11:00,300
I'd like to work oh yeah that's pretty

308
00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:01,660
much a joke so if you have any questions

309
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:03,280
because it might not been so cool

310
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:05,230
a little bit I'm supporting out there

311
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:08,130
please ask away because I could probably

312
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:11,260
explain better in a conversation muscle

313
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:16,450
the guy all the way in the back yeah use

314
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:18,220
the microphone probably creating the

315
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:20,560
dizzy squat device I said it looks at

316
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:22,120
such a small slide but I spent days just

317
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:24,459
trying to get this automation to work

318
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:26,260
alright plug this keyboard into my phone

319
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:27,820
as five pressing the keys I thought I

320
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:30,040
tried all to make these steps actually

321
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:31,990
the best because you can see it working

322
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:33,910
as soon as you plugged it in and it's so

323
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:35,890
satisfiying on you actually managed to

324
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:37,719
get that working and I'd love to develop

325
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:39,640
it so you could create bad USB with

326
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:40,720
these cities box just plug it in and

327
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:43,180
imagine what you could do with your

328
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:47,530
phone then yeah that's probably one of

329
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:49,569
the most other questions remember the

330
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:53,290
old days when ADB was the assembler

331
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:59,320
debugger geez I'm sorry comments

332
00:11:53,290 --> 00:12:04,420
thoughts it's not a question is this

333
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:05,800
hand I swear he did do you have any boss

334
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:07,390
security I'd love to hear your thoughts

335
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:10,240
on this because as you can see it's a

336
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:12,160
very like a lot of ideas and I've still

337
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,450
a long way to go with this I please just

338
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:17,350
like comment approached me because I'm

339
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:19,630
really open to learning more about it so

340
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:20,980
the USB device he showed up there the

341
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:22,870
little thing was that actually like a

342
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:24,910
rubber ducky or something equivalent so

343
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:27,670
I got these did you spot devices they're

344
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:30,160
like not cough Arduinos I bought a load

345
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:32,829
of them and I love them just didn't work

346
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:35,079
because I just clearly not sure exactly

347
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:36,580
so I got the idea of a bad yet I had the

348
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:38,280
idea about USB I don't want to try and

349
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:40,540
create something enough paramount code

350
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:42,339
initially because I've got to experience

351
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:43,900
this I wanted to pull files off the

352
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:45,430
device and then move them onto us piece

353
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:47,920
it wasn't really close or I haven't

354
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:49,839
managed to get working but I did just

355
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:51,160
end up using it to send commands to the

356
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:57,190
phone and it literally works straight

357
00:12:51,160 --> 00:13:01,870
away Gabe hiding in the back I need for

358
00:12:57,190 --> 00:13:06,340
another 10,000 steps today just welcome

359
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:08,110
down the plane when you fly home talking

360
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:10,930
about the requirement to have the device

361
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:13,660
ID did you do anything with it

362
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:15,459
attempting to automatically identify the

363
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:17,079
device to

364
00:13:15,459 --> 00:13:18,489
grab the device I'd even say a database

365
00:13:17,079 --> 00:13:20,439
or something is that something you've

366
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:22,240
looked at as possible no I didn't it

367
00:13:20,439 --> 00:13:23,589
could definitely be possible in my head

368
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:26,279
I thought if it was actually going to

369
00:13:23,589 --> 00:13:28,300
become a working so it doesn't take the

370
00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:30,399
work that's when I was testing that it's

371
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:32,469
obviously my practice having a load of

372
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:34,449
you dev rules but I initially looked I

373
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:36,519
spent a lot of time looking at gvfs and

374
00:13:34,449 --> 00:13:38,769
the where it was mounted and seeing if I

375
00:13:36,519 --> 00:13:40,720
could alter anything like that so when

376
00:13:38,769 --> 00:13:43,300
it's plugged in if it detects a device

377
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:45,189
like that I did ibly I could definitely

378
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:47,649
look them to work I was thinking a lot

379
00:13:45,189 --> 00:13:50,170
of vendor IDs but it's hard but it's

380
00:13:47,649 --> 00:13:51,759
very specific to one device whereas

381
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:52,809
there are different types of devices out

382
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:54,670
there and there's different ways of

383
00:13:52,809 --> 00:13:57,249
routing the devices and it's it's very

384
00:13:54,670 --> 00:14:03,878
varied so yeah be something I'd want to

385
00:13:57,249 --> 00:14:05,559
look into sure yeah okay the universe

386
00:14:03,879 --> 00:14:06,999
the interactive the couzo the kernel and

387
00:14:05,559 --> 00:14:12,040
so much sound for a thermostat

388
00:14:06,999 --> 00:14:15,040
godlessness interprets it it detected

389
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:17,498
again oh so basically with the you

390
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:19,059
Devils it like it has common but it's

391
00:14:17,499 --> 00:14:20,980
not it's not really a listener yes it's

392
00:14:19,059 --> 00:14:22,899
a mere listener and it talks to the turn

393
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:25,600
on the kernel does that send the Kamaria

394
00:14:22,899 --> 00:14:28,119
but yeah it's the device that way so

395
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:29,829
when I was testing it I run LS USB to

396
00:14:28,119 --> 00:14:31,929
find out what the vendor ID was in the

397
00:14:29,829 --> 00:14:33,579
product ID and then wiped it that way

398
00:14:31,929 --> 00:14:34,990
and originally I was thinking you'd have

399
00:14:33,579 --> 00:14:36,910
to use the vendor ID in the product ID

400
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:38,559
in the rules file so we had to kick

401
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:40,899
anything off but actually could limit it

402
00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:42,279
to the vendor ID and when I was - it was

403
00:14:40,899 --> 00:14:43,389
getting when I was testing it

404
00:14:42,279 --> 00:14:45,819
I will you because you had to have it

405
00:14:43,389 --> 00:14:47,829
unlocked and then also USB debugging

406
00:14:45,819 --> 00:14:49,179
they would I was testing it and I

407
00:14:47,829 --> 00:14:50,739
managed to get it to kick off the shell

408
00:14:49,179 --> 00:14:51,970
script to bring up a browser so I knew

409
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:55,299
it was working

410
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:59,160
how does she do it say yeah Cecily I do

411
00:14:55,299 --> 00:14:59,160
have that probably such a little better

412
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:03,329
excellent thank you very much
