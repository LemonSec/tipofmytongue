00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:04,719
of you about have asked about since

148
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:06,400
there is no after-party this year so if

149
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,240
you asked about how we could continue

150
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:10,209
the discussion

151
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:12,610
feel free the closest is the lady

152
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:13,720

happen

160
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:35,020
it's their kindness and generosity ver

161
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:39,550
