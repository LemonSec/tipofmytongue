1
00:00:02,959 --> 00:00:10,650
so hi yeah my name is Franzen Cruz so I

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:12,870
came from Philippines and I'll be

3
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:15,179
discussing about forensic aid in Windows

4
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:19,859
artifacts so investigation without event

5
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:21,570
lags so okay stated with probably

6
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:23,970
Michael um I saw like seven years

7
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:25,948
working experience so yeah I came from

8
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:29,400
Philippines and now working in Qatar

9
00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:31,399
from middle is I'm working as a senior

10
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:35,550
security analyst and part of

11
00:00:31,399 --> 00:00:36,690
nation-state team their core member of

12
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:38,879
cyber security which is a training

13
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:42,170
center in Philippines as well and then

14
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:44,789
I'm a former college instructor and some

15
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:45,260
Apple bets that sometimes doesn't make

16
00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:49,950
sense

17
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:52,260
sometimes so we're going to discuss some

18
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:55,430
Windows artifacts that are kind of

19
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:59,099
important from forensics perspective

20
00:00:55,430 --> 00:01:02,699
it's not everything that I put here

21
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:05,220
because there's also some files that we

22
00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:06,899
need like there's forensic value of it

23
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:09,090
but I didn't put it because I have a

24
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:11,729
limited time like user assist recycle

25
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:13,740
beans cetera I just pick up the most

26
00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:16,080
fast and I've been using when it comes

27
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:19,439
to investigating or analysis and

28
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:22,950
analyzing some case or incidents to be

29
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:24,750
the L&K files we fetch some cash so shop

30
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:27,479
backs and register keys so it's not just

31
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:32,220
for the blue teamers out there but also

32
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:34,679
hopes but also it is also essential to

33
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:37,619
the pen testers because they just

34
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:41,220
normally delete windows event flags that

35
00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:43,470
we normally know about the fact is

36
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:45,679
there's there's more to life than

37
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:48,630
Windows Event lags so we can also

38
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:50,670
perform timeline analysis and contact

39
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:53,490
some reports by not using the Windows

40
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:59,909
Event locks but just using the Windows

41
00:01:53,490 --> 00:02:03,390
artifacts so yeah so have you have you

42
00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:07,049
ever feel like in the morning sitting

43
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:09,690
down on the stock room and then like

44
00:02:07,049 --> 00:02:12,030
leaving a cup of coffee and then there's

45
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:12,990
like Windows machine that you need to be

46
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:16,430
forensic aid

47
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:19,430
and there's no event flags that is there

48
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:22,440
that's like the best feeling ever right

49
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:26,010
so yeah so if you're a professional

50
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:28,859
hacker you you just probably like trying

51
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:31,109
to get the next big case and then that

52
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:33,510
would be like one thing you can do is to

53
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:35,370
just remove everything like remove the

54
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:37,859
artifacts that you're there to become

55
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:40,880
more stealthy so in the physical world

56
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:47,070
it's like of the CCTV camera footage

57
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:49,920
some hairs footprints blood camera

58
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:52,200
whatever and the digital world it's more

59
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:54,480
like it all boils down to the logs

60
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:57,299
itself so Windows is really a fan of

61
00:02:54,480 --> 00:03:01,200
logs it keeps on getting different logs

62
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:05,030
even a PowerShell different applications

63
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:08,070
now especially the windows 8 above so

64
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:09,960
yeah it's kind of mind blow for the

65
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:14,160
stock analyst to regenerate or to

66
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:16,440
analyze every Lux that is there so yeah

67
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:18,150
it's gonna be a big case so yeah Windows

68
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:20,820
artifacts so let's just start with the

69
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:24,870
LNK files and the files it's like more

70
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:28,109
of a shortcut thing so it's basically we

71
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:30,360
use this us to get the metadata of it

72
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:32,460
because there could be alike there could

73
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:36,480
be a lot of forensic value of it so for

74
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:38,250
example there's like a USB or network

75
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,709
share that has been removed to the

76
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:43,350
machine but you need to get that files

77
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:44,820
or if that existing on that environment

78
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:49,440
or on that Windows machine so you can

79
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:51,870
just get that on the LNT files so it's

80
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:53,579
location will be here user profile

81
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:56,580
update or roaming Microsoft Windows and

82
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:59,640
resent so you can just get those energy

83
00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:01,020
files and then get the metadata of it by

84
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,559
using some tools that I'll be showing

85
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:03,420
you later

86
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:05,280
it's not hands-on because you know I

87
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:07,470
have a limited time so I just took some

88
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:12,270
screenshots of it and then make use of

89
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:15,240
it so I tried getting some screenshots

90
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:17,940
of it on my machine so as you can see I

91
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:20,640
just do a dir and under Windows

92
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:22,560
environment and then get everything here

93
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:24,570
so some of the files here was deleted

94
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,280
already on my machines but still there

95
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:27,750
so the forensic

96
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:32,609
value of etiquette files are really

97
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:36,240
great so yeah one of the tools that I've

98
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:38,580
been using was from Eric Zimmerman if

99
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,590
you're a forensic guy or like in the

100
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:43,770
security world you probably know who's

101
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:46,830
Eric Zimmerman is so he he created a lot

102
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:51,180
of tools mainly for the forensics so I

103
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:53,760
viv a quick rundown of this tool by

104
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:55,830
using a vacuum and so as you can see on

105
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:58,680
the argument there that there's this - -

106
00:04:55,830 --> 00:05:01,349
CSV so you can just import that file to

107
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:03,060
CSV and the result will be the file name

108
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:06,120
so as you can see there

109
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:08,280
oops okay as you can see there that

110
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:10,770
there's a lot of time stamps there that

111
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:14,070
could be essential or very beneficial

112
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:18,570
for the forensics analysis the target

113
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:20,969
create AB and whatever so I've like I've

114
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:24,060
highlighted some of the suspicious

115
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:26,430
things like we can we can say that if

116
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:30,270
ever I am just a marketing guy that

117
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:32,990
doesn't really into tech why does I need

118
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:36,180
to have exploitation which will be there

119
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:39,600
why does why why do I need to have a

120
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:41,400
download files like apt 40 really so

121
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:45,960
it's kind of like interesting stuff

122
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:48,239
there right so the next one will be the

123
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:52,020
prefetch file so probably most of you

124
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:57,780
guys know this thing so Windows creative

125
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:59,580
this files just - - when you're when

126
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:01,169
you're running in applications then

127
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:02,760
there could be a cache of that so

128
00:06:01,169 --> 00:06:04,140
probably in the second time that you run

129
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:07,320
that applications it would be more

130
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:09,690
smooth and more fast and every time you

131
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:11,849
load in applications so you can just

132
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:15,810
check that prefetch files on this

133
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:18,360
location and we can also use this when

134
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:21,539
it comes to investigating something so

135
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:22,740
for example there's a file or

136
00:06:21,539 --> 00:06:26,430
application that has been deleted

137
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:29,630
already and we can use prefetch files as

138
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:31,950
as an evident that these malicious

139
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:36,140
executable or binary has been run on

140
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:38,820
that machine even if it was deleted so

141
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:40,190
yeah I use the wind prefetch view as a

142
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:43,199
tool

143
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:45,719
so you just google it and also there's a

144
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:49,199
tool from Eric Zimmerman as well for

145
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:51,840
prefetched viewer so I cited a few

146
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:54,180
example here kinda interesting so let's

147
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:56,280
say that yeah I'm a marketing guy why do

148
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:59,910
I need like BitTorrent or ftk imager

149
00:06:56,280 --> 00:07:02,068
there even if I deleted that one so look

150
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:04,949
looks kinda interesting for me alright

151
00:07:02,069 --> 00:07:07,440
that exe is a rich repair which can be

152
00:07:04,949 --> 00:07:12,090
used to extract the account management

153
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:15,110
some some hive Wireshark why do I need

154
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:19,289
white shark and bean hacks or either Pro

155
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:21,180
so it could be really beneficial they're

156
00:07:19,289 --> 00:07:24,870
very helpful if we're conducting and

157
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:27,270
investigations and stuff I'm cash so

158
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:30,960
there's like a funny thing about kam

159
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:33,479
cash so when I read some CTF way back in

160
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:37,469
some online resources so there's an easy

161
00:07:33,479 --> 00:07:39,960
level bear on the forensics category and

162
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:44,009
then I kept on buying my head for like

163
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:46,530
an hour I guess I can't find the much

164
00:07:44,009 --> 00:07:48,780
quality is the flag and then I just find

165
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:50,758
out that it's all the patents that DB so

166
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:52,409
I just need to use it too and then it

167
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:56,610
was just there you just have to use that

168
00:07:52,409 --> 00:07:58,289
tool so yeah if you if you look at this

169
00:07:56,610 --> 00:08:02,310
how's the DB you're kind of familiar on

170
00:07:58,289 --> 00:08:05,699
that icon so if you try to make a feel

171
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:07,500
film thumbnail view on different

172
00:08:05,699 --> 00:08:10,949
pictures and the Windows environment it

173
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:12,719
creates a file known as x that DB and

174
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:15,360
then you can really extract that

175
00:08:12,719 --> 00:08:17,610
metadata even if those pictures have

176
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:20,009
been deleted on your machine so it can

177
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:23,130
be used by the law enforcement incident

178
00:08:20,009 --> 00:08:25,219
responders and forensic ators especially

179
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:28,440
if you're working on a child pornography

180
00:08:25,219 --> 00:08:30,300
if that guy said that she doesn't even

181
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:33,208
have any child pornography pictures on

182
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:35,310
his machine but if you know or you you

183
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:38,728
see that there's a times that DB there

184
00:08:35,309 --> 00:08:41,939
you can eventually prove that there's

185
00:08:38,729 --> 00:08:43,890
like some suspicious photos there okay

186
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:45,720
but it's not really a big picture but

187
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:49,550
it's just a thumbnail view but it could

188
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:52,440
be great for your forensic report so

189
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:53,459
yeah so it's all the creative here on

190
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:56,339
this

191
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:58,110
location so I put those locations here

192
00:08:56,339 --> 00:09:00,480
because I think it would be helpful for

193
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:03,029
us like on the blue team inside soft

194
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:08,610
forensics or in businesses and responder

195
00:09:03,029 --> 00:09:10,890
to make use of these locations so I got

196
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:13,589
an example here so you probably know

197
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:15,480
this logo so this is a tor browser so I

198
00:09:13,589 --> 00:09:20,010
use the time cache viewer on my machine

199
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:21,810
and then white shark so on my first part

200
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:25,770
of my talk I said that let's assume that

201
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:28,349
I'm a marketing guy so you can or we can

202
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:30,720
assume that why why the hell this

203
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:33,180
marketing guy has a tor browser on his

204
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:35,430
machine or even a white shark so you can

205
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:40,410
just prove that by just getting a face

206
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:45,000
thumbnail view office machine and then a

207
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:49,250
shell back so I watched a lot of

208
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:52,440
thoughts about shell bags so it's really

209
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:55,740
really a complicated artifact that you

210
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:57,900
can really use for your report or if

211
00:09:55,740 --> 00:10:00,690
you're investigating something so for

212
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:03,240
example if you're managing are trying to

213
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:08,310
access different files network shares

214
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:09,990
via Windows Explorer or even USB or if

215
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:12,270
you change some controls and control

216
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:16,050
panels you can just probably track that

217
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:19,439
out using the shell bags so yeah you can

218
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:22,349
use it cool bye of course Eric Zimmerman

219
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:24,720
as well so there's a fine good tool

220
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:26,820
there for shell bags that you can track

221
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:34,200
down those activities that I will show

222
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:38,250
to you later yeah this is one example of

223
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:40,680
that so from here from the desktop the

224
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:42,839
user try to have a files in the

225
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:46,589
Downloads folder this is internal suit

226
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:48,329
and somehow debug and a very good

227
00:10:46,589 --> 00:10:50,850
there's like a fake point there even if

228
00:10:48,329 --> 00:10:53,130
was deleted if you try to extract the

229
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:54,750
user class that tab and then get into

230
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:56,939
the shell back Explorer you can still

231
00:10:54,750 --> 00:11:00,120
see it there that there's a fake point

232
00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:02,400
folder there so yeah you can make an

233
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:07,080
evidence out of it and make an context

234
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:10,230
of it you can see here also that a user

235
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:12,330
try to configure Windows Firewall power

236
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:14,279
options and systems recovery so if

237
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:16,589
you're a marketing guy why why would you

238
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:18,769
just wake of those configuration or

239
00:11:16,589 --> 00:11:22,970
options and open your machine so

240
00:11:18,769 --> 00:11:22,970
probably something is going on there

241
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:27,899
all right so John place is well

242
00:11:26,339 --> 00:11:29,850
technically it's just like the frequent

243
00:11:27,899 --> 00:11:32,700
if you notice the Windows environment

244
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:35,399
like there's a frequent features there

245
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:37,980
that if you use some of applications

246
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:39,959
that you currently or mostly resent the

247
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:42,779
applications that you use you can just

248
00:11:39,959 --> 00:11:44,910
spin that out on the frequent or on the

249
00:11:42,779 --> 00:11:47,850
recent tab or features and Windows

250
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:50,370
environment so there's also a files that

251
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:54,269
generates on that one that you can try

252
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:57,029
to look on this file location so you may

253
00:11:54,269 --> 00:11:58,829
track down if you're investigating an

254
00:11:57,029 --> 00:12:01,200
image or a machine you can just check

255
00:11:58,829 --> 00:12:04,410
what are those applications that

256
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:07,550
commonly run by a user or by your

257
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:10,860
suspect by using the Japanese artifacts

258
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:15,420
so every jump list or every application

259
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:18,230
has its own application ID so it's too

260
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:22,500
many to mention but I just have this

261
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:25,770
browser applications here it looks like

262
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:27,450
an empty 5 hash but it's not so yeah if

263
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:30,930
you wanted to have a full this you can

264
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:33,420
just go on this link and then try to

265
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:38,459
figure out what are the application IDs

266
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:40,949
depending on the application all right

267
00:12:38,459 --> 00:12:44,060
so I try to get the Chum please on my

268
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:51,660
machine as well by just doing dir so

269
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:54,989
yeah it looks like this one okay so I

270
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:57,000
use accomplice Explorer by again Eric

271
00:12:54,990 --> 00:13:01,560
Zimmerman which is a great guy

272
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:03,660
so on this part I try to extract more of

273
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:08,000
them there's more sense of doing this

274
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:11,430
because a marketing guy that tried to

275
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,800
explore a websites that is dealing with

276
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:15,750
some hacking stuff then you may just

277
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:18,420
find out like okay so he tried to go to

278
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:20,399
Metasploit calm or even carry that org

279
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:20,819
for what if your marketing guy are you

280
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:25,559
going to

281
00:13:20,819 --> 00:13:27,988
on your machine and made fun of it so it

282
00:13:25,559 --> 00:13:33,868
makes a lot of sense to make this and

283
00:13:27,989 --> 00:13:36,179
evidence as well on your report Windows

284
00:13:33,869 --> 00:13:38,100
registry so we're all familiar with

285
00:13:36,179 --> 00:13:40,529
Windows registry and it's kind of

286
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:42,509
mind-blowing that there's a lot of

287
00:13:40,529 --> 00:13:45,539
informations that we can get on the

288
00:13:42,509 --> 00:13:49,069
Windows registry side so yeah there

289
00:13:45,539 --> 00:13:52,769
could be different hives there hkz are

290
00:13:49,069 --> 00:13:56,789
it's mainly used for configuration

291
00:13:52,769 --> 00:13:58,529
information of the application side HTC

292
00:13:56,789 --> 00:14:03,089
you it's actually the profile that is

293
00:13:58,529 --> 00:14:05,459
current in black on as hklm it's more of

294
00:14:03,089 --> 00:14:07,619
the software as well as the hardware

295
00:14:05,459 --> 00:14:11,099
part of the thing so you can get a lot

296
00:14:07,619 --> 00:14:14,399
of information there which is an HP you

297
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:16,259
it's actually it contains information of

298
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:19,019
all the loaded users within that machine

299
00:14:16,259 --> 00:14:21,089
and then the last would be the HPCC it

300
00:14:19,019 --> 00:14:21,660
contains a lot of informations about the

301
00:14:21,089 --> 00:14:24,509
hardware

302
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:26,488
during this startup so basically a lot

303
00:14:24,509 --> 00:14:29,789
of information was there and one of the

304
00:14:26,489 --> 00:14:35,100
favorite artifacts that a forensic 8 or

305
00:14:29,789 --> 00:14:38,639
a must-have so yeah there's these are

306
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:40,379
the forensic value of it so that's like

307
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:42,659
what I've discussed and the devices

308
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:45,239
mounted it can also be tracked down so

309
00:14:42,659 --> 00:14:47,699
for every USB devices or even in effort

310
00:14:45,239 --> 00:14:49,769
shares you can also check that one using

311
00:14:47,699 --> 00:14:54,269
a registry explorer or you can just

312
00:14:49,769 --> 00:14:58,829
check the registries I've cited some of

313
00:14:54,269 --> 00:15:01,619
my favorite links on the registry

314
00:14:58,829 --> 00:15:03,618
Explorer or in the register keys so let

315
00:15:01,619 --> 00:15:07,199
me just try to look at this one

316
00:15:03,619 --> 00:15:09,659
particularly on the start run you may

317
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:12,238
check what are the applications that has

318
00:15:09,659 --> 00:15:14,549
been run during the startup type URLs

319
00:15:12,239 --> 00:15:18,089
what are the type what either URLs that

320
00:15:14,549 --> 00:15:19,649
have been used by the user all installed

321
00:15:18,089 --> 00:15:26,339
programs and as well as the market

322
00:15:19,649 --> 00:15:28,859
drivers next could be another run so

323
00:15:26,339 --> 00:15:31,159
there's a lot of malware that keeps on

324
00:15:28,859 --> 00:15:34,319
hiding on the author end so for us to

325
00:15:31,159 --> 00:15:35,170
for them to just run even after the

326
00:15:34,319 --> 00:15:38,920
reboot

327
00:15:35,170 --> 00:15:42,729
our funding services and then also

328
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:47,920
services here some user last user login

329
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:50,470
information here and that's wrap up my

330
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:57,569
presentation so any questions don't

331
00:15:50,470 --> 00:16:01,199
bother with the image so any questions

332
00:15:57,570 --> 00:16:01,199
comments thoughts questions

333
00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:11,680
great presentation I I was quite

334
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:14,199
interested in the tool something to show

335
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:17,170
the hidden streams do have one I'm sorry

336
00:16:14,199 --> 00:16:21,579
was that again hidden streams here

337
00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:24,310
screen streams or streams I didn't put

338
00:16:21,579 --> 00:16:26,589
that one but I watched some videos of

339
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:28,750
that I'm not particularly sure about the

340
00:16:26,589 --> 00:16:32,649
tool that they've been using to just get

341
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:35,620
the streams but I believe that the

342
00:16:32,649 --> 00:16:37,420
github profile of Eric there's like it's

343
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:39,760
all there but it's in a command line not

344
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:42,760
in the GUI side to detect those streams

345
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:44,260
on that machine so yeah I can take no

346
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:47,890
advantage just get back to you to know

347
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:49,689
specific name of that tool does anyone

348
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:52,769
have an idea where there's a tool that

349
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:52,769
would show hidden streams

350
00:16:52,899 --> 00:17:06,160
when internal system journals camera was

351
00:16:59,649 --> 00:17:08,829
this in terminal doesn't show okay other

352
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:10,120
questions it's a it's always great when

353
00:17:08,829 --> 00:17:13,359
you can turn to the audience and say

354
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:14,889
does anyone know of a tool that does and

355
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:16,299
not only are there three of them but

356
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:17,949
people will argue about whether or not

357
00:17:16,299 --> 00:17:20,049
it works it works right it doesn't work

358
00:17:17,949 --> 00:17:22,569
well etcetera etcetera it's all good you

359
00:17:20,049 --> 00:17:29,280
could tell they the system was evolving

360
00:17:22,569 --> 00:17:32,649
other questions comments thoughts ideas

361
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:34,389
okay one in the battle like I said I'm

362
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:36,250
gonna get my steps and and I know you

363
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:41,200
couldn't read the slides from back here

364
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:43,809
quit complaining oh good hi and if Eric

365
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:47,200
Zimmerman gave up tomorrow what tool set

366
00:17:43,809 --> 00:17:48,790
would you use so it could be a lot of

367
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:52,600
thought that Eric Superman

368
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:56,770
maybe that made my life very easily but

369
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:59,889
for me it's like my favorite one would

370
00:17:56,770 --> 00:18:01,180
be the register Explorer so yeah that

371
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:04,660
helps me a lot during my day-to-day

372
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:07,720
investigations and yeah there's a couple

373
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:12,580
of those that I didn't mention but yeah

374
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:18,790
