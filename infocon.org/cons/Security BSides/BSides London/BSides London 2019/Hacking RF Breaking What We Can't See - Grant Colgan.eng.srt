1
00:00:02,179 --> 00:00:08,010
so my name is grant and I'm a technical

2
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:10,920
consultant for a information assurance

3
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:12,870
company in Northern Ireland I'm not

4
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:14,129
there I'm not here on their behalf or

5
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:17,100
anything like that they asked me to be

6
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:19,710
here this is just something I enjoy

7
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:22,410
doing a meantime so they will be getting

8
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:25,980
on the advertisement from me and I'm

9
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:29,759
also an amateur radio operator and which

10
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:31,080
a lot of people think is you know an old

11
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,730
guy sitting in a shack talking to

12
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:34,920
another old guy in a shack few miles

13
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:37,099
away and I can see where you get that

14
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:39,420
are you from there is a bit of that but

15
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:41,430
the the main goal of amateur radio as a

16
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:44,100
hobby is electronics and experimentation

17
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:45,930
just using radios and which again is

18
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:48,390
where I got a lot of my knowledge from

19
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:50,070
for this talk over Twitter there if you

20
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:53,370
want to follow me I don't do a lot on it

21
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:55,500
but go ahead YouTube because of course I

22
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:58,828
do YouTube because any excuse to not do

23
00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:00,690
a real job the key point there is my

24
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:01,980
email address if you have any questions

25
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:05,128
you want to contact me that's the best

26
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:07,460
way to get me and these details will be

27
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:10,200
up at the end anyway so go get them

28
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:12,449
so starting off as wanna talk briefly

29
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:17,700
what is RF no it was a quick show of

30
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:19,259
hands who here has hacked RF before okay

31
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:23,930
yeah more than what I was expecting kill

32
00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:27,119
and so who here has hacked Wi-Fi

33
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:28,920
everyone okay if you put your hand up

34
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:31,049
for Wi-Fi you should have put your hand

35
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:35,939
up for RF they're the same thing

36
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:38,970
any wireless communication is our F so

37
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:40,919
that's Bluetooth Wi-Fi RFID all that if

38
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:44,908
it communicates wirelessly it is really

39
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:46,530
your frequency and I not send this to

40
00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:48,149
say okay yes that's just a new thing

41
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:49,350
that you can call Wi-Fi whenever you're

42
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:52,729
attacking it just to make it sound

43
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:55,649
cooler I am specifically omitting and

44
00:01:52,729 --> 00:01:57,630
Wi-Fi from this talk because you could

45
00:01:55,649 --> 00:01:59,520
go into any cybersecurity conference

46
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:00,929
around the world and there'll be someone

47
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,969
up here talking about how to bridge

48
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:08,360
Wi-Fi so I'm specifically avoiding that

49
00:02:02,969 --> 00:02:10,378
topic and so whenever you think of it as

50
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:12,270
RF whenever you start thinking of it

51
00:02:10,378 --> 00:02:13,440
instead of just Wi-Fi or Bluetooth or

52
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:17,640
whatever whenever you start thinking

53
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:21,120
as as RF communications there are a lot

54
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:22,200
of tools right there that can make your

55
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,470
life a lot easier

56
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:27,179
now I know I said I was admitting Wi-Fi

57
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:31,530
and some of you might recognize that

58
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:36,060
bottom on yeah I know but the one on the

59
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:38,820
top it'll be your right is an SDR a

60
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:41,670
software-defined radio they're very

61
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:44,100
cheap or about 20 quid or so they're not

62
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:45,480
expensive and they allow you to listen

63
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:47,250
to the airwaves that gives you the

64
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:49,500
ability to look and see what's going on

65
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:52,290
around you the pineapples up there

66
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:54,420
because that is all it is it is an SDR

67
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:56,160
but it has some program and another

68
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:58,459
hardware and there to make it more

69
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:02,730
suited to Wi-Fi but at its core it's

70
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:04,140
software-defined radio with the SDRs a

71
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:06,209
lot of attackers will use them for

72
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:08,070
information gathering because they're

73
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:10,500
cheap they're throwaway and they don't

74
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:13,500
need a sophisticated hand testing device

75
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:16,500
like the hack RF one which is about 200

76
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:17,940
quid and the cheap SDR is only allow you

77
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:21,209
to listen they don't allow you to listen

78
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:23,130
and transmit the dear ones the hack RF

79
00:03:21,209 --> 00:03:25,680
one for example allows you to transmit

80
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:27,690
as well which is useful for the likes of

81
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:31,020
us we want to try and break things in a

82
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:33,989
legal way but for an actual attacker he

83
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:36,720
wants to I don't know unlock your car or

84
00:03:33,989 --> 00:03:38,520
do whatever and that's too expensive

85
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:42,120
they're going to use an SDR and build a

86
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:45,050
small kit using an Arduino or some

87
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:51,950
device thereof they're very easily built

88
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:54,120
now a lot of these attacks have

89
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:56,880
relationships to cybersecurity attacks

90
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:58,739
so in this case replay and repeater

91
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:01,590
attacks basically man-in-the-middle

92
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:03,570
attacks and in some cases quite

93
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:06,660
literally there is a guy standing in

94
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:08,340
between you and the device you want to

95
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:13,680
get with an SDR lifting all of the

96
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:16,858
communications so a replay attack is as

97
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:19,290
it's signs you capture a signal and you

98
00:04:16,858 --> 00:04:21,719
replay at a later date and there's a

99
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:24,090
surprising amount of equipment

100
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:25,260
particularly industrial equipment that

101
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:27,638
is vulnerable to this type of attack

102
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:29,099
moreso than what you might imagine

103
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:31,539
a lot of Koreans and I have

104
00:04:29,099 --> 00:04:33,460
remote-control devices to operate in

105
00:04:31,539 --> 00:04:34,659
four three three megahertz which I'm

106
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:37,239
sure probably means nothing to you but

107
00:04:34,659 --> 00:04:38,949
it's a very common bond and it's very

108
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:41,650
cheap to get em transmitters and

109
00:04:38,949 --> 00:04:43,689
receivers for and there's a company who

110
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:46,568
took the transmitters and receivers I'd

111
00:04:43,689 --> 00:04:49,210
have a Korean and attached it to a Lego

112
00:04:46,569 --> 00:04:50,409
set to demonstrate that even though the

113
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:52,210
remote controls are sitting over there

114
00:04:50,409 --> 00:04:55,719
but they could sit on their laptop with

115
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:57,849
a SDR transmitter and be able to move

116
00:04:55,719 --> 00:05:00,520
that Korean and all they've done is

117
00:04:57,849 --> 00:05:02,680
they've sat and pressed on the remote

118
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:04,568
pressed up with a nasty are sitting

119
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:06,969
there and captured that signal and see

120
00:05:04,569 --> 00:05:08,919
if that the press down they've captured

121
00:05:06,969 --> 00:05:10,900
that signal and they've just labeled the

122
00:05:08,919 --> 00:05:13,650
file they've labeled okay that file

123
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:16,840
means up that file means down that's it

124
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:18,250
they then went to the company who

125
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:20,830
manufactures these and says look we were

126
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:22,389
able to do this here's her notes and the

127
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:24,669
company did a great thing as all

128
00:05:22,389 --> 00:05:28,529
companies do they said I know that can't

129
00:05:24,669 --> 00:05:31,750
be done our stuffs encrypted you're like

130
00:05:28,529 --> 00:05:33,400
okay and this brings me on to a very key

131
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:35,259
point with RF communications on whenever

132
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:38,109
you think of them like this encryption

133
00:05:35,259 --> 00:05:40,469
does not help you if it is doing a

134
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:43,690
single command and it is sending a code

135
00:05:40,469 --> 00:05:45,879
even if that code is encrypted you don't

136
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:48,219
need to know because the Tran the

137
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:50,169
receiver the device in the Korean it

138
00:05:48,219 --> 00:05:51,879
knows how to decrypt it all you're doing

139
00:05:50,169 --> 00:05:54,719
is taking that signal and pass an honor

140
00:05:51,879 --> 00:05:57,849
elite earlier it's a very easy attack um

141
00:05:54,719 --> 00:05:59,919
there are mitigations to help it ideally

142
00:05:57,849 --> 00:06:02,378
a ruling code so making sure that it's

143
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:05,849
not the same code that you're sending

144
00:06:02,379 --> 00:06:08,080
these time but with all Grid and

145
00:06:05,849 --> 00:06:09,430
defenses someone's worked out a way

146
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,609
around it and I talked about that in a

147
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:14,860
bit

148
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:17,860
a repeater attack again it's houses

149
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:19,330
signs it's like a Wi-Fi access point in

150
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:22,810
your house that teach your Wi-Fi signal

151
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:24,758
booster and transmits it again it's

152
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:26,080
exactly the same and there's new defense

153
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:28,150
against this there are companies that

154
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:31,089
will tell you there is there's not

155
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:33,068
because you are not actually tracking

156
00:06:31,089 --> 00:06:35,080
the device I've got another slide on it

157
00:06:33,069 --> 00:06:39,250
we choose it in a lot better detail

158
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:41,529
later on but whenever you take the

159
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:43,059
signal and you transmit it on the

160
00:06:41,529 --> 00:06:45,099
receiver is looking for a signal it is

161
00:06:43,059 --> 00:06:47,259
not looking for the device which is

162
00:06:45,099 --> 00:06:49,419
something people seem to deviate from

163
00:06:47,259 --> 00:06:50,529
they think oh it's tricking it because

164
00:06:49,419 --> 00:06:52,869
the keys not really there

165
00:06:50,529 --> 00:06:54,009
say to unlock your car it doesn't matter

166
00:06:52,869 --> 00:06:57,039
the car doesn't care whether the keys

167
00:06:54,009 --> 00:06:58,119
there it's looking for a signal key

168
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:59,469
could be 10 miles away

169
00:06:58,119 --> 00:07:02,049
as long as it's getting the signal that

170
00:06:59,469 --> 00:07:04,808
it's expected it'll open so in my mind

171
00:07:02,049 --> 00:07:06,419
it's not really a trick it's showing the

172
00:07:04,809 --> 00:07:12,579
car what it wants it's a freak of the

173
00:07:06,419 --> 00:07:14,558
technology so I said in the replay

174
00:07:12,579 --> 00:07:18,249
attacks there's a way around it with a

175
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:20,889
ruling code now this device here is

176
00:07:18,249 --> 00:07:21,849
called a rule jam that was made by a

177
00:07:20,889 --> 00:07:25,419
very intelligent guy

178
00:07:21,849 --> 00:07:27,339
I cannot remember his name and he came

179
00:07:25,419 --> 00:07:31,329
up with this and this helps defeat

180
00:07:27,339 --> 00:07:32,889
ruling codes so in your car car keys are

181
00:07:31,329 --> 00:07:37,599
a common use of ruling codes whenever

182
00:07:32,889 --> 00:07:39,429
you press the unlock button it'll send a

183
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:42,429
signal to the car and it'll be for sake

184
00:07:39,429 --> 00:07:43,899
of argument zero zero one car sees that

185
00:07:42,429 --> 00:07:46,089
signal goes cool that's what I want to

186
00:07:43,899 --> 00:07:48,279
say crosses off less moves off you press

187
00:07:46,089 --> 00:07:50,199
the key fob again it goes okay sense

188
00:07:48,279 --> 00:07:52,149
zero zero two we're going to keep

189
00:07:50,199 --> 00:07:56,019
changing through a predefined list of

190
00:07:52,149 --> 00:07:58,449
air codes simple enough and that will

191
00:07:56,019 --> 00:08:00,479
defeat most common replay attacks of

192
00:07:58,449 --> 00:08:05,129
just capturing the signal and send on

193
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:07,808
but what you can do here a car and most

194
00:08:05,129 --> 00:08:09,699
common types of receivers have a wide

195
00:08:07,809 --> 00:08:12,459
receive window they have a wide window

196
00:08:09,699 --> 00:08:15,189
on the frequency that they look up now

197
00:08:12,459 --> 00:08:17,439
they have to do this because of varying

198
00:08:15,189 --> 00:08:20,529
things but the common one is

199
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:22,299
manufacturing and deviations so if you

200
00:08:20,529 --> 00:08:25,029
have again we'll stick with the car you

201
00:08:22,299 --> 00:08:26,769
have a manufacturer that prints I work

202
00:08:25,029 --> 00:08:27,399
prints I love my print them right these

203
00:08:26,769 --> 00:08:30,549
days who knows

204
00:08:27,399 --> 00:08:31,629
they manufacture three keys and they're

205
00:08:30,549 --> 00:08:33,848
all meant to transmit in the same

206
00:08:31,629 --> 00:08:35,649
frequency for the same car because of

207
00:08:33,849 --> 00:08:38,469
variations in the manufacturing process

208
00:08:35,649 --> 00:08:40,419
and other deviations they will all

209
00:08:38,469 --> 00:08:42,909
transmit on very slightly different

210
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:46,990
frequencies either side of what they're

211
00:08:42,909 --> 00:08:48,939
expecting and over time the components

212
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:50,920
will break down become old and so that

213
00:08:48,939 --> 00:08:53,620
will also cause frequency drift so to

214
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:55,329
mitigate this cars have a wide window so

215
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:56,529
that your car key doesn't suddenly

216
00:08:55,329 --> 00:08:57,910
stop working on you because it's

217
00:08:56,529 --> 00:09:01,329
slightly drifted out of its listen

218
00:08:57,910 --> 00:09:03,368
window because it does this we can

219
00:09:01,329 --> 00:09:05,888
attack it because in the world of radio

220
00:09:03,369 --> 00:09:07,809
generally speaking the strongest signal

221
00:09:05,889 --> 00:09:08,920
wins I know there's maybe some RF

222
00:09:07,809 --> 00:09:10,868
engineers I there he just started

223
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:12,819
twitching when I said that but as a

224
00:09:10,869 --> 00:09:15,910
general rule of thumb the strongest

225
00:09:12,819 --> 00:09:18,459
signal will win in that case what you

226
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:21,100
have is you have a device that has two

227
00:09:18,459 --> 00:09:23,859
transmitters and a receiver and whenever

228
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:26,230
it gets signal in its Rosa a jamming

229
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:28,600
signal somewhere on that and receive

230
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:31,149
bandwidth the car has to check that

231
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:32,709
signal it can't ignore it because it's a

232
00:09:31,149 --> 00:09:35,139
stronger signal so it's what it cares

233
00:09:32,709 --> 00:09:37,089
about then in the other bombs you'll

234
00:09:35,139 --> 00:09:39,399
have your other receiver set to the

235
00:09:37,089 --> 00:09:41,259
specific frequency of the key foe so

236
00:09:39,399 --> 00:09:44,019
you'll have gotta know your SDR or

237
00:09:41,259 --> 00:09:46,179
whatever you're using to look for the

238
00:09:44,019 --> 00:09:48,429
specific signal that not frequent or

239
00:09:46,179 --> 00:09:49,809
that key fobs coming in on and you can

240
00:09:48,429 --> 00:09:52,149
narrow your transmitter down on that

241
00:09:49,809 --> 00:09:54,040
because you're not constrained by mass

242
00:09:52,149 --> 00:09:56,319
manufacturing the frequency is not going

243
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:58,118
to drift that much from one key press to

244
00:09:56,319 --> 00:10:00,549
another so you can narrow right and on

245
00:09:58,119 --> 00:10:02,439
and in that case they're gonna be a

246
00:10:00,549 --> 00:10:03,669
massive jamming signal beside you and

247
00:10:02,439 --> 00:10:05,410
provided it's not bleeding over into

248
00:10:03,669 --> 00:10:05,769
your frequency your receiver doesn't

249
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:08,738
care

250
00:10:05,769 --> 00:10:11,649
you're not jammed so you send by the

251
00:10:08,739 --> 00:10:14,379
jamming signal and you capture the key

252
00:10:11,649 --> 00:10:15,879
fob signal know everything and that's

253
00:10:14,379 --> 00:10:19,149
all well and good but the car doesn't

254
00:10:15,879 --> 00:10:20,290
opener so what do you do well the

255
00:10:19,149 --> 00:10:22,299
person's gonna press the key fob again

256
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:24,309
or don't think about working press it

257
00:10:22,299 --> 00:10:26,259
again same thing happens again the

258
00:10:24,309 --> 00:10:28,029
jamming signal goes up and you capture

259
00:10:26,259 --> 00:10:29,669
the next signal again will say you've

260
00:10:28,029 --> 00:10:31,989
captured zero zero one on the first one

261
00:10:29,669 --> 00:10:34,299
second signal comes in at zero zero to

262
00:10:31,989 --> 00:10:36,610
what your device then does as it drops

263
00:10:34,299 --> 00:10:39,189
the jamming signal and transmit zero

264
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:40,839
zero one it transmits the old coot that

265
00:10:39,189 --> 00:10:43,719
you captured which as far as the car is

266
00:10:40,839 --> 00:10:44,529
concerned is a legitimate code because I

267
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:46,720
hasn't seen it before

268
00:10:44,529 --> 00:10:48,610
and you've got another code in storage

269
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,079
that you can use and that keeps going

270
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:51,699
for as many times as they keep pressing

271
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:54,069
that button you will keep cycling

272
00:10:51,699 --> 00:10:56,019
through and unlock in the car as far as

273
00:10:54,069 --> 00:10:58,748
the person the user victim what are we

274
00:10:56,019 --> 00:11:01,149
gonna call them is concerned it only

275
00:10:58,749 --> 00:11:02,019
field unlocked once which I mean let's

276
00:11:01,149 --> 00:11:03,160
face it how many times have you done

277
00:11:02,019 --> 00:11:04,629
that you press the button lowest times

278
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:06,789
you've gone right up beside it that's

279
00:11:04,629 --> 00:11:10,290
not the deal I mean no one would bat an

280
00:11:06,789 --> 00:11:13,329
eye it's a very easy

281
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:14,560
we're getting rounded but as soon as

282
00:11:13,329 --> 00:11:15,939
you're ready you can just go up and you

283
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:18,219
can lift the device because it's gonna

284
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:21,430
be a cheap device I think I taught up

285
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:24,639
you can make one for about four pounds

286
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:26,349
ish if you're that way inclined and you

287
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:29,470
just stick it somewhere near the car so

288
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:31,120
in the wheel arch or somewhere like that

289
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:32,410
you can duct-tape it in there have it

290
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:35,709
sitting whenever you're ready you can

291
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:38,500
come lift the device hit a button on the

292
00:11:35,709 --> 00:11:39,939
car unlocks and you're away there's very

293
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:41,410
little you can do about that there are

294
00:11:39,939 --> 00:11:46,019
some companies that are working on ways

295
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:46,019
of fixing that I have not seen a funkier

296
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:53,410
so hopefully this works this is an

297
00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:55,509
example of a replay sorry a repeater

298
00:11:53,410 --> 00:12:00,759
attack which I'm sure some of you might

299
00:11:55,509 --> 00:12:03,519
have seen guy there is going up to the

300
00:12:00,759 --> 00:12:04,720
house with a receiver and the other guy

301
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:06,699
is standing close to the car with a

302
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,829
transmitter and all this is is a very

303
00:12:06,699 --> 00:12:11,620
simple receive and transmitter system

304
00:12:08,829 --> 00:12:13,899
with a directional antenna so he's

305
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:16,449
standing there and he will we have that

306
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:18,699
in front of the house and the door in

307
00:12:16,449 --> 00:12:21,819
the round that area until he gets a

308
00:12:18,699 --> 00:12:24,969
signal his mitt as you'll see will stand

309
00:12:21,819 --> 00:12:27,189
next to the car with the transmitter and

310
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:29,170
as far as the car is concerned at seeing

311
00:12:27,189 --> 00:12:31,480
the signal that it needs and this car in

312
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:33,370
particular I believe is a mercy at least

313
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:35,800
so he'd be very sort of losing his

314
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:37,029
keyless start keyless entry so not only

315
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:39,069
could the unlock the car that could

316
00:12:37,029 --> 00:12:44,050
start it and drive off didn't need the

317
00:12:39,069 --> 00:12:45,819
keys no west midlands police yes it's

318
00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:47,800
them god bless them they did try and

319
00:12:45,819 --> 00:12:49,870
give a bit of advice in this they said

320
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:52,089
the only way to stop this is by putting

321
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:57,730
your car keys in a metal container

322
00:12:52,089 --> 00:12:59,620
I mean they tried strictly speaking

323
00:12:57,730 --> 00:13:03,220
they're not completely wrong they're

324
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:06,759
just slightly wrong the the frequency

325
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:08,829
that these use is usually UHF some of

326
00:13:06,759 --> 00:13:11,500
them Tesla in particular also has a

327
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:13,750
two-factor authentication which uses low

328
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:16,540
frequency and high frequency or well low

329
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:17,920
frequency on UHF but again a two-way

330
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:19,360
communication it just means you have to

331
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:22,479
have two receivers and transmitters on

332
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:25,000
each end and you still get in with you

333
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:28,240
hf the more things you can put in its

334
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,769
way the better essentially so just

335
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,389
putting it in a we metal container and

336
00:13:29,769 --> 00:13:33,730
putting upside your door they're still

337
00:13:31,389 --> 00:13:36,820
gonna get up easily still well within

338
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:38,470
range your best bet if you must have a

339
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:40,750
keyless start keyless entry car which I

340
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:45,220
would not recommend is either one turn

341
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:46,510
it off or put it upstairs have it up on

342
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:48,910
the second floor of your house that way

343
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:50,199
for one it will take them longer because

344
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:51,370
they'll be scan and packing forward on

345
00:13:50,199 --> 00:13:55,719
the ground floor trying to find it and

346
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:56,860
if they do want to start scanning up if

347
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:59,079
they think you've maybe got on the

348
00:13:56,860 --> 00:14:00,820
second floor it's then got another wall

349
00:13:59,079 --> 00:14:03,279
and floor to get through to get the

350
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:06,490
signal so if we keep it far away from

351
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:08,350
things you can help mitigate this but

352
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:11,260
again I just wouldn't have a keyless

353
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:16,810
start method car because once it starts

354
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:18,610
you're not stopping up don't we say no

355
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:21,699
no okay

356
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:24,730
jamming which is a denial of service

357
00:14:21,699 --> 00:14:27,279
attack similar to the rule jam it is

358
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:31,029
technically a replay and jamming device

359
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:33,100
rule in the one I did want to bring an

360
00:14:31,029 --> 00:14:36,100
actual jamming device with me here today

361
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:38,290
to show you how every jamming devices

362
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:41,560
are illegal and I have permission to

363
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:44,439
from Afghan the office communication to

364
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:47,560
do experiments with jamming devices

365
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:49,930
under very strict criteria so I message

366
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:52,029
them I send them an email and said look

367
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:54,910
I'm gonna talk I would really like to

368
00:14:52,029 --> 00:14:56,199
bring a jamming device with me to show

369
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:58,930
them you know how easy they are to build

370
00:14:56,199 --> 00:15:01,089
and not to educate you how to build

371
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:03,430
jamming devices but you know I'm sure

372
00:15:01,089 --> 00:15:05,980
how easy they are to build and the

373
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:07,660
makeup off them and they replied fairly

374
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:09,010
quickly saying yeah okay well that that

375
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:10,209
shouldn't be a problem we just need to

376
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:11,560
make sure that you have you know loop

377
00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:14,260
our levels and you don't leave it on for

378
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:15,939
very long worth the talk I said I'll ask

379
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:17,649
cool-ass brilliant Edison London and

380
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:20,529
they replied almost instantly

381
00:15:17,649 --> 00:15:23,110
she's never a good thing they replied

382
00:15:20,529 --> 00:15:24,550
almost instantly and different no you're

383
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:25,350
not bringing a jamming device into the

384
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:28,779
middle of London

385
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:30,190
okay cheers guys so what I done was I

386
00:15:28,779 --> 00:15:32,470
set up my SDR in the house

387
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:33,250
software-defined radio this is the sort

388
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:34,420
of

389
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:37,060
there are many different it's a software

390
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:38,649
for and looking at the spectrum but this

391
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:40,989
is the one that I use this generally

392
00:15:38,649 --> 00:15:43,149
will hi they look and I recorded my

393
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:49,449
jamming device no bear but it's

394
00:15:43,149 --> 00:15:51,579
terrifying to look up that's it that is

395
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:55,719
it that is what a jamming signal looks

396
00:15:51,579 --> 00:15:58,569
like a signal strong enough to overpower

397
00:15:55,720 --> 00:16:00,459
the signal that you're targeting no that

398
00:15:58,569 --> 00:16:03,579
is very loop are because to stay within

399
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:05,888
my licensing right I have to have loop

400
00:16:03,579 --> 00:16:07,149
art and I can't show a high par one

401
00:16:05,889 --> 00:16:11,800
because this has been recording some of

402
00:16:07,149 --> 00:16:17,470
them are calm might see it so this is a

403
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:20,019
little par one and surprisingly I mean

404
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:23,170
that is probably less than 300

405
00:16:20,019 --> 00:16:25,000
milliwatts if it's very low par but that

406
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:27,759
if I put that in between me and my car

407
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,889
it will stop me unlock in my car all it

408
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:31,689
is is a signal that is enough to

409
00:16:29,889 --> 00:16:33,100
interrupt the signal that you're wanting

410
00:16:31,689 --> 00:16:34,899
to sound so it doesn't need to be

411
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:35,079
overpowering it just needs to get in its

412
00:16:34,899 --> 00:16:38,920
way

413
00:16:35,079 --> 00:16:40,689
enough now as I said damming devices are

414
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:42,939
illegal and they're illegal for very

415
00:16:40,689 --> 00:16:44,469
good reason because they're

416
00:16:42,939 --> 00:16:46,389
indiscriminate you have a lot of people

417
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:48,309
who say that jamming devices are illegal

418
00:16:46,389 --> 00:16:51,100
because the man wants to keep a track

419
00:16:48,309 --> 00:16:52,750
off yeah these people obviously don't

420
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:54,579
understand how they work because if

421
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:57,009
someone was one to track you and you

422
00:16:54,579 --> 00:16:58,449
turned on the jamming device I'll be

423
00:16:57,009 --> 00:17:01,079
able to see you very very quickly you

424
00:16:58,449 --> 00:17:03,790
would be lit up like a Christmas tree

425
00:17:01,079 --> 00:17:05,559
isn't it now they are illegal because

426
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:07,030
they're indiscriminate so you Jam one

427
00:17:05,559 --> 00:17:10,149
signal you don't know what else you're

428
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:11,319
jamming also with homemade ones like

429
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:13,569
this one you will see my amazing

430
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:16,389
construction you will say that there's

431
00:17:13,569 --> 00:17:18,879
lead on other frequencies that's because

432
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:21,250
it was pretty me I have wires that are

433
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:23,669
not properly insulated running from the

434
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:26,799
Arduino which I used to make it and to

435
00:17:23,669 --> 00:17:28,900
the the transmitting device all an

436
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:31,539
antenna is is a wire so all of those

437
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:33,190
wires effectively become and small

438
00:17:31,539 --> 00:17:35,200
antennas which is how you get the bleed

439
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:36,730
over on these other frequencies so

440
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,900
people making a pearly constructed

441
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:40,240
jamming device even if they are

442
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:42,429
intending to only block this one signal

443
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:44,980
so it's okay I won't be interfering with

444
00:17:42,429 --> 00:17:46,690
everyone else they could be the signal

445
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:47,470
could be bleeding over into another part

446
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:52,179
and you don't know what it could be

447
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:53,230
interfering with this well keep playing

448
00:17:52,179 --> 00:17:54,129
but we don't need to see that because

449
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:55,419
that's all it is

450
00:17:54,129 --> 00:17:57,629
oh by the way that is a hello world

451
00:17:55,419 --> 00:18:02,559
program that is what is sounding there

452
00:17:57,629 --> 00:18:04,418
yeah so how do I see really at this to

453
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:06,000
cyber security and why should any of you

454
00:18:04,419 --> 00:18:08,860
actually listen to me anymore and care

455
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:11,169
well for the personal side of things

456
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:13,658
the rise of IOT devices and cheap IOT

457
00:18:11,169 --> 00:18:15,279
devices specifically and Raspberry Pi

458
00:18:13,659 --> 00:18:17,110
projects that people make in home

459
00:18:15,279 --> 00:18:18,580
automation that they do DIY style

460
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:20,559
they're pulling libraries off the

461
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:21,340
internet to do this stuff and even

462
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:24,370
though these libraries might be

463
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:25,590
encrypted again as I said earlier depend

464
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:27,610
on what you're doing with that signal

465
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:30,939
encryption doesn't help you I can still

466
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:34,360
capture it and send it on contactless

467
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:36,580
cards this is a this is a I mean you're

468
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:37,809
borderline in the RFID RFID is still

469
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:40,840
radio communication but I'm trying to

470
00:18:37,809 --> 00:18:42,879
avoid common methods of attack but with

471
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:44,139
that one in particular you don't even

472
00:18:42,879 --> 00:18:45,610
need to build something for that if you

473
00:18:44,139 --> 00:18:47,019
go to PayPal and ask them for a

474
00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:48,879
contactless card reader they will

475
00:18:47,019 --> 00:18:50,799
happily send you want and you can just

476
00:18:48,879 --> 00:18:52,209
set that to whatever you want and if

477
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:54,460
you've been to the subway here in London

478
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:55,629
you're very close to people you have one

479
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:56,980
of them in your hand you start to swipe

480
00:18:55,629 --> 00:18:57,840
from back pockets you can lift a lot of

481
00:18:56,980 --> 00:19:00,850
money very quickly

482
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:02,678
that's RF it's just you're getting a

483
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:06,699
project product that was already built

484
00:19:02,679 --> 00:19:08,740
for that purpose the RF ringing Andrea

485
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:12,460
it was actually a bracelet there was a

486
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:14,440
guy I believe he was American who set up

487
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:16,120
some home automation in his house and

488
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:19,149
put a brace on that just constantly sent

489
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:22,899
out a small wireless signal on I believe

490
00:19:19,149 --> 00:19:25,449
it was 2.4 gigahertz and it unlocked his

491
00:19:22,899 --> 00:19:27,340
front door so whenever he got hosted

492
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:29,110
here whenever he got close to his door

493
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:31,570
it unlocked for him so he could open it

494
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:34,000
in a way and happy days I believe he was

495
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:35,710
at least had a couple of brain cells

496
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,750
because he had a switch on the inside

497
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:39,370
that he could use to turn it off and

498
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:43,840
lock the door whenever he was in the

499
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:47,258
house so I mean well done you tried but

500
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:50,439
I think he had this for about a year

501
00:19:47,259 --> 00:19:52,539
before people or someone twigged onto

502
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:54,039
what he was doing maybe someone who had

503
00:19:52,539 --> 00:19:55,690
an SDR kicking about and noticed every

504
00:19:54,039 --> 00:19:57,639
time he walked past the got a signal

505
00:19:55,690 --> 00:20:00,559
they'll wonder what was so radiant about

506
00:19:57,639 --> 00:20:02,629
him and they realized what he was doing

507
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:05,360
and it leaked somewhere someone else got

508
00:20:02,629 --> 00:20:07,129
ahold of it and someone key him with the

509
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:08,870
signal unlock this door and emptiness

510
00:20:07,129 --> 00:20:09,769
house and they're even kind enough to

511
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:13,939
lock the door behind them with a

512
00:20:09,769 --> 00:20:15,440
different signal so this is a DIY aspect

513
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:16,840
he was very shocked by this because

514
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:20,659
again he was like oh but it's encrypted

515
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:22,908
it doesn't help you the fun stuff in

516
00:20:20,659 --> 00:20:23,840
business RFID security tags so I'm

517
00:20:22,909 --> 00:20:26,240
talking about the ones that you'd use

518
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:27,980
the end of your office if you just have

519
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:29,840
an RFID security tag that you swipe in

520
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:31,700
and go in there's no keypad that can be

521
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:34,100
captured you can put a device near I'm

522
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:35,360
sure you've all heard of it and you put

523
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:37,610
a device near that captures it because

524
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:39,408
those cards don't change the signal

525
00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:41,209
stays the same or the the code that they

526
00:20:39,409 --> 00:20:43,580
transmit is the same so if you don't

527
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:46,159
have two factor authentication ie card

528
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:48,408
key code someone could left out and it's

529
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:51,889
very easy to print a new card I'm bugger

530
00:20:48,409 --> 00:20:54,549
off and they've got access drones rooms

531
00:20:51,889 --> 00:20:56,809
are a funnel there was an explosion of

532
00:20:54,549 --> 00:20:58,850
companies and businesses getting drones

533
00:20:56,809 --> 00:21:00,918
a while ago whenever they sort of a come

534
00:20:58,850 --> 00:21:02,029
and cheap like funeral directors buying

535
00:21:00,919 --> 00:21:03,440
up drones because they thought they were

536
00:21:02,029 --> 00:21:06,070
cool and thought we can have it carry

537
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:10,159
the casket or something I don't know I

538
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:12,230
think now they find their place a lot of

539
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:14,299
architectural and building work use it

540
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:16,279
for getting photos and look it's a

541
00:21:14,299 --> 00:21:19,009
places that would usually be a hard

542
00:21:16,279 --> 00:21:21,350
thing to get rooms are also susceptible

543
00:21:19,009 --> 00:21:24,169
to replay attacks although they are a

544
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:26,418
bit more difficult to do technically

545
00:21:24,169 --> 00:21:27,950
speaking they're also a vulnerable to

546
00:21:26,419 --> 00:21:31,399
German attacks but a lot of high-end

547
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:33,200
rooms have the system in place if they

548
00:21:31,399 --> 00:21:35,299
lose the signal or circuit in a signal a

549
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:38,360
aren't familiar with they will either

550
00:21:35,299 --> 00:21:39,529
stop or land so I mean yeah you can stop

551
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:41,508
someone flying uploading with two

552
00:21:39,529 --> 00:21:42,860
battery dies or something but jamming

553
00:21:41,509 --> 00:21:45,230
attacks generally don't do much other

554
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:47,748
than annoyance but that's denial of

555
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:50,029
service relates annoyance isn't but will

556
00:21:47,749 --> 00:21:53,119
replay attacks you need a larger sample

557
00:21:50,029 --> 00:21:54,499
set so you could sit with an SDR and you

558
00:21:53,119 --> 00:21:56,629
can watch someone fly in their drone and

559
00:21:54,499 --> 00:21:58,129
you can capture all their signals and

560
00:21:56,629 --> 00:22:00,230
all you're looking for is that whenever

561
00:21:58,129 --> 00:22:02,649
the drone goes up and you see a signal

562
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:05,480
you can associate that signal with up

563
00:22:02,649 --> 00:22:07,518
that's all you need to do and you can

564
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:10,369
gain control of it now the granularity

565
00:22:07,519 --> 00:22:12,950
comes in because of the joystick that

566
00:22:10,369 --> 00:22:14,550
they used to fly drones they could be up

567
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:16,500
and slightly left or

568
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:19,050
and slightly to the right or you know

569
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:20,370
vice versa because of that you need to

570
00:22:19,050 --> 00:22:22,560
get a large sample set you need to be

571
00:22:20,370 --> 00:22:24,479
there for a while and get a lot of files

572
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:26,610
so that you knew for certain whenever

573
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:28,140
you press up on the signal that you've

574
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:29,520
captured and labeled up then it actually

575
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:31,980
does go up and it doesn't start flying

576
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:35,040
off to the side this is where geometers

577
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:38,280
can come in because the sorry I was

578
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:39,690
probably like and because the GPS

579
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:43,050
devices in them are usually hard to

580
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:44,520
remove for the specific purpose of being

581
00:22:43,050 --> 00:22:47,610
difficult to stay so they can't just get

582
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:48,690
it and rip the GPS out of it so what

583
00:22:47,610 --> 00:22:50,360
people have started doing they've been

584
00:22:48,690 --> 00:22:52,920
getting these sample sets of

585
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:54,270
communications flying the drone over to

586
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:57,510
somewhere where they've got someone set

587
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:59,250
up with a jamming device for GPS the

588
00:22:57,510 --> 00:23:01,470
drone flies into that the GPS signal is

589
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:03,540
lost and they just keep the GPS with the

590
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:05,220
drone the GPS jammer with the drone

591
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:06,270
until they get a to work bench where

592
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:10,080
they can strip it down and remove the

593
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:13,050
GPS they've got it they've guy well 300

594
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:14,879
pound drone a terabytes laughing they

595
00:23:13,050 --> 00:23:17,340
can also do it for just destruction and

596
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:18,420
industrial sabotage is a big thing with

597
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:23,310
this stuff because a lot of the

598
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:26,270
industrial kit is large so in some cases

599
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:30,659
they may just do it to crash the device

600
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:31,860
security cameras only wireless security

601
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:33,600
cameras I'm not talking about the wired

602
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:35,760
ones but I have seen far too many

603
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:38,610
companies that don't have hard wired

604
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:40,860
security cameras the wireless security

605
00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:42,600
cameras operate on 2.4 gigahertz which

606
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:44,159
some of you may know is the Wi-Fi range

607
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:47,689
again I'm not going to talk about Wi-Fi

608
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:49,770
look that's the range they work in

609
00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:51,420
intercepting up so trying to do a replay

610
00:23:49,770 --> 00:23:53,250
attack doesn't really work there's new

611
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:55,980
commands being sent it's just data it's

612
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:59,010
you know video feeds but what it is

613
00:23:55,980 --> 00:24:00,360
susceptible to is a jamming attack so if

614
00:23:59,010 --> 00:24:02,820
you have a business that you want to rob

615
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:04,379
for whatever reason and you know that

616
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:06,929
they have wireless security cameras you

617
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:09,570
have a jamming device that block so 2.4

618
00:24:06,930 --> 00:24:12,300
gigahertz you turn that on their cameras

619
00:24:09,570 --> 00:24:14,429
will not work no it's not like you've

620
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:16,290
seen in the films where it's a shot of a

621
00:24:14,430 --> 00:24:17,910
hallway a guy walks into the hallway

622
00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:19,379
turns the device on and he disappears

623
00:24:17,910 --> 00:24:21,030
but the hallway still there that's

624
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:23,460
bollocks it's not camouflage it doesn't

625
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:25,560
make you predator ok

626
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:28,750
if you've noticed on your digital TV

627
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:30,370
whenever you get a storm or something

628
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:32,770
and signal gets interrupted on its and

629
00:24:30,370 --> 00:24:35,050
like those black squares and it gets

630
00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:36,850
juddery that's what happens you just

631
00:24:35,050 --> 00:24:40,360
interfering with the signal to the point

632
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:41,949
where possibly not useful and so this

633
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:43,540
person come in do what they want and

634
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:44,800
anywhere they go within range of these

635
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:47,350
security cameras the signal will be

636
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:48,370
corrupted no it's not foolproof they

637
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:50,020
could still get an off the other they

638
00:24:48,370 --> 00:24:51,790
get a picture or get an image of someone

639
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:54,460
but it does make life a lot more

640
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:56,260
difficult ruin dust real equipment I

641
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:57,370
talked about in the earlier slide the

642
00:24:56,260 --> 00:25:00,760
only other one that I want to talk about

643
00:24:57,370 --> 00:25:01,510
is a JCB those you don't know JCB or any

644
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:04,810
Americans here

645
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:07,990
JCB is a digger a big hefty bit of

646
00:25:04,810 --> 00:25:10,690
industrial equipment and someone I don't

647
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:12,310
know who decided a good idea to put

648
00:25:10,690 --> 00:25:13,810
remote controls in them so that their

649
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:16,149
workers don't need to actually get into

650
00:25:13,810 --> 00:25:18,010
the JCB to drive around I don't know who

651
00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:21,280
thought that would be a good idea but

652
00:25:18,010 --> 00:25:23,470
someone did because of this using replay

653
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:25,660
attacks someone captured all of the code

654
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:30,220
that they wanted left a device in the

655
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:31,810
JCB with a 4G dongle and they sat in

656
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:39,130
their bedroom and they drove this JCB

657
00:25:31,810 --> 00:25:41,409
around a carpark these attacks had said

658
00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:44,680
Industrial sabotage that's a prime

659
00:25:41,410 --> 00:25:46,510
candidate for these also I'm not going

660
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:48,130
to and I tried to think of another way

661
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:49,840
of saying terrorist attacks because

662
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:51,820
we're all bored to death with them and

663
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:54,070
all the media is talking about them but

664
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:55,800
it is an it is an option they can get

665
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:59,560
control some very heavy equipment and

666
00:25:55,800 --> 00:26:00,639
just drive a JCB down Main Street it's

667
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:03,040
very easy to do and it can be very

668
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:10,420
destructive to infrastructure and people

669
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:12,940
who gets in the way no this is a fun one

670
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:16,390
I did want to do a live demo at this

671
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:19,660
point however bringing all my equipment

672
00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:20,740
over here by an easyJet flight I didn't

673
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:22,390
really want to have a conversation with

674
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:23,650
the security guy about what all this RF

675
00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:24,460
hacking equipment is and why I'm

676
00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:28,780
bringing on a planner

677
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:30,280
I want to do avoid that so I put this in

678
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:31,450
this could be a talking of itself but I

679
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:33,470
want to talk about it briefly because it

680
00:26:31,450 --> 00:26:36,030
terrifies me to the

681
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:38,070
for anyone who doesn't know biohacking

682
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:41,310
is the practice of implanting

683
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:43,740
electronics in your body for whatever

684
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:45,240
reason and it started off with people

685
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:46,560
putting magnets in their fingers so that

686
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:48,420
they could feed magnetism I'm feeling

687
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:50,419
magnetic waves again I don't know why

688
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:54,740
you would want to do this but people did

689
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:55,860
with the rise of small electronics and

690
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:57,870
YouTube

691
00:26:55,860 --> 00:27:00,419
I guess people have started doing this

692
00:26:57,870 --> 00:27:04,320
more prolifically with RF communication

693
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:06,810
devices to make RFID readers and other

694
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:08,760
wireless communication devices there was

695
00:27:06,810 --> 00:27:11,159
a guy it was a BBC documentary I think

696
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:12,750
and there was a guy who had this in his

697
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:15,360
implanted in the back of his hand

698
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:17,910
much like these guys except they're lit

699
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:20,040
up for some reason where he could use

700
00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:23,070
this to unlock his bike and start his

701
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:27,060
motorbike it's terrifying

702
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:28,439
no electronics in your body are not a

703
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:33,000
new thing by any stretch the imagination

704
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:35,370
PS makers are very common robotic arms

705
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,330
are also becoming a lot more common and

706
00:27:35,370 --> 00:27:38,189
I thought that this is an issue that

707
00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:39,810
should be at least looked at in some

708
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:41,730
point because you would like to think

709
00:27:39,810 --> 00:27:44,490
that the professional side of implants

710
00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:46,650
and so like the peacemakers done by the

711
00:27:44,490 --> 00:27:50,640
hospital's you would like to think that

712
00:27:46,650 --> 00:27:52,350
they would have security probably not I

713
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:54,960
think a lot of people be out of a job if

714
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:58,919
companies didn't they should but there

715
00:27:54,960 --> 00:28:00,780
you are now with these devices and with

716
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:02,790
the implants it's the DIY part I'm

717
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:04,680
worried about because people are putting

718
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:06,770
these devices into their body to make

719
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:09,330
life easier for whatever reason and

720
00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:11,280
they're making their bodies hackable I

721
00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:13,770
knew that sounds very dystopian and like

722
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:15,540
something you would see in a film but it

723
00:28:13,770 --> 00:28:17,760
is the kiyose they are putting wireless

724
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:19,800
communication inside their body now for

725
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:21,870
the most part and at least at the minute

726
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:23,639
this is RFID so that they can swipe in

727
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:27,000
and swipe out there's no real direct

728
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:28,400
communication with their body but I

729
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,530
think the possibility is there as

730
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:33,090
bionics and robotics advanced people are

731
00:28:31,530 --> 00:28:34,710
gonna start doing DIY things because

732
00:28:33,090 --> 00:28:35,879
that's what people want to do they want

733
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:37,950
to try things themselves

734
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:41,010
and I think it's going to get to the

735
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:42,780
point or potentially you could have a

736
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:45,990
hacker who could kill someone

737
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:47,428
no I know you're saying I

738
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:49,350
just talking them and I go by people

739
00:28:47,429 --> 00:28:52,080
driving JCB's down Main Street would

740
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:53,850
that not to kill people yes yes that is

741
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:56,939
that is an option of where a hacker

742
00:28:53,850 --> 00:28:59,159
could kill someone but in my mind this

743
00:28:56,940 --> 00:29:00,630
would be more targeted it's say for sake

744
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:03,920
of argument in PS maker that is

745
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:06,120
potentially vulnerable to an RF attack

746
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:08,490
someone could actively stop the peace

747
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:09,989
maker or make it go haywire if the

748
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:12,540
correct securities are not in place

749
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:13,950
it's a targeted attack it's not

750
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:15,750
indiscriminate it's not like driving a

751
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:18,540
JCB Diamond Street because you find a

752
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:21,000
script online and all let's try it out

753
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:24,090
it's targeted if you want that person

754
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,380
dead so I think biohacking

755
00:29:24,090 --> 00:29:27,120
a key and this could be a talking of

756
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:28,860
itself but I think that's something that

757
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:32,939
will become more of an issue in the

758
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:34,020
future and well hopefully I'm long dead

759
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:39,660
before it becomes an issue because I

760
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:58,980
don't wanna deal with it and that's it

761
00:29:39,660 --> 00:30:01,020
any questions either of you sagen yeah

762
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:04,710
yes that is that is that is a way around

763
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:06,210
it but again if you have it depends on

764
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:08,040
on what way you mean timing a lot of

765
00:30:06,210 --> 00:30:11,750
them don't do real time so they don't

766
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:14,070
know I sent their signal at this time

767
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:15,059
they could do there isn't any reason but

768
00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:16,800
it's probably going to cost that's

769
00:30:15,059 --> 00:30:19,020
cheaper to not have to keep our real

770
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:21,570
clock and so a lot of them just stick to

771
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:24,360
a a predefined set of codes that they

772
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:33,210
then cycle through but yes that is a way

773
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:38,669
to get round it yet not a thing it just

774
00:30:33,210 --> 00:30:41,580
transmit yeah no I I think I mentioned

775
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:43,679
Tesla Tesla have a two factor

776
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:45,449
authentication they have a low frequency

777
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:48,120
signal that goes out from the car to the

778
00:30:45,450 --> 00:30:49,530
key and then that then triggers the key

779
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:51,780
to go okay that's a signal I want to say

780
00:30:49,530 --> 00:30:53,970
and then it it then transmits it but

781
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:55,260
again all you need is a transmitter and

782
00:30:53,970 --> 00:30:57,059
receiver on both ends because that

783
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:59,210
signal will always be coming out of the

784
00:30:57,059 --> 00:30:59,210
car

785
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:17,070
that's fun stuff Eris yeah that's that's

786
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,240
a fun one I had I had many phone

787
00:31:17,070 --> 00:31:18,830
conversations for that drone thing and

788
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:21,120
Gatwick

789
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:22,800
yes they could have got got rid of that

790
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:26,520
but the problem is they brought in the

791
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:28,649
army to do it and they just didn't have

792
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:29,760
the kit to do that types of things if

793
00:31:28,650 --> 00:31:31,470
they had the kit yes they could have

794
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:33,750
took control of our drum potentially and

795
00:31:31,470 --> 00:31:37,830
landed it but they just they just don't

796
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:39,929
have the kit to do it so yeah as far as

797
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:41,399
I close she need to be it depends and

798
00:31:39,929 --> 00:31:44,010
you can get a directional antenna and

799
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:45,540
which a good example is if you ever seen

800
00:31:44,010 --> 00:31:47,010
the ones on top of your house the sort

801
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:47,280
of ones with the weak spines coming out

802
00:31:47,010 --> 00:31:49,530
of it

803
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:51,120
that's a yogi' antenna which is

804
00:31:49,530 --> 00:31:53,970
directional and if you have one of them

805
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:55,439
if you out either the drone or the

806
00:31:53,970 --> 00:31:57,240
person probably the person is easier

807
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:58,590
because they're standing still and you

808
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:10,770
could be quite far away and still pick

809
00:31:58,590 --> 00:32:13,230
up the signal a similar talk I said ya

810
00:32:10,770 --> 00:32:19,170
know I am that's the law it speak to me

811
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:24,380
after I'll happily worry of that yeah to

812
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:24,380
make the a repeater device much the cost

813
00:32:26,690 --> 00:32:33,990
I think from Amazon not that I bought or

814
00:32:30,929 --> 00:32:38,280
built one you can get enough parts to

815
00:32:33,990 --> 00:32:40,020
build a bike tan for by 10 quid but

816
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:41,910
usually the the parts are that cheap

817
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:44,879
that you buy them in bulk you get like a

818
00:32:41,910 --> 00:32:47,580
box of 10 repeaters or receivers and

819
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:49,020
transmitters and it's just an Arduino or

820
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:51,389
if you're willing to do something a bit

821
00:32:49,020 --> 00:33:01,790
more complicated Raspberry Pi would work

822
00:32:51,390 --> 00:33:01,790
as well yeah they're not expensive yeah

823
00:33:04,010 --> 00:33:11,340
yeah you can listen listening is yep yep

824
00:33:08,390 --> 00:33:13,450
yeah I said there they're only worried

825
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:14,679
about people transmitting and the only

826
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:16,510
that the radio a people trans money is

827
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:17,830
interference someone who is transmitting

828
00:33:16,510 --> 00:33:19,870
he doesn't know what they're doing they

829
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:22,330
could block loads of different signals

830
00:33:19,870 --> 00:33:23,620
and cause havoc and especially if you're

831
00:33:22,330 --> 00:33:25,659
near an airport that could be very very

832
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:28,830
bad so you can listen find an SDR is

833
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:52,300
perfectly fine to buy and have a listen

834
00:33:28,830 --> 00:33:56,830
yep oh so for like smart cars you mean

835
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:58,419
that sort of communication and yeah I

836
00:33:56,830 --> 00:34:00,820
don't know I haven't seen enough about

837
00:33:58,420 --> 00:34:03,820
their the the smart cars communication

838
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:05,649
going back and forward and it depends

839
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:08,110
what you want to do because the replay

840
00:34:05,650 --> 00:34:11,740
and repeater attacks only work generally

841
00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:14,950
with commands so with a smart car if

842
00:34:11,739 --> 00:34:16,330
it's a driving and it has a signal that

843
00:34:14,949 --> 00:34:18,609
a car in front of it is slowing down

844
00:34:16,330 --> 00:34:21,779
really quickly it doesn't get sent a

845
00:34:18,610 --> 00:34:24,940
signal over Wireless to stop that's in

846
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:26,169
the computer of the car itself so the

847
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:27,880
only signal of that car would actually

848
00:34:26,168 --> 00:34:29,799
be receiving would be there's something

849
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:31,900
coming really quickly you need to do

850
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:33,490
something about it and if they were

851
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:34,929
sending commands that way then yeah you

852
00:34:33,489 --> 00:34:38,649
could you could get in with a replay

853
00:34:34,929 --> 00:34:43,960
attack or Jam yeah jamming um is is also

854
00:34:38,650 --> 00:34:45,429
a possibility with them you can any any

855
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:47,770
wireless communication regardless you

856
00:34:45,429 --> 00:34:49,030
can jam up as as a rule of thumb if you

857
00:34:47,770 --> 00:34:55,350
can get more part of on it you can jam

858
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:55,350
it doesn't matter what it is yeah

859
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:03,640
to broadcast on certain frequencies

860
00:35:01,530 --> 00:35:06,820
it depends what you're doing to be

861
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:08,680
honest if you want to em transmit and

862
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:10,300
broadcast and do experimenting things

863
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:11,859
get your how much your radio license the

864
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:14,350
foundation one is very easy to get and

865
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:16,120
it's a simple exam that you said it's

866
00:35:14,350 --> 00:35:17,740
just like what do you do to not

867
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:19,630
interfere with people that's that's

868
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:21,669
basically what you need to remember and

869
00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:23,020
then that will give you near enough all

870
00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:25,930
of the bands still allow you to transmit

871
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:27,280
and you could email them and ask for

872
00:35:25,930 --> 00:35:30,339
permission for a very

873
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:49,960
perfect frequency and they might put

874
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:51,220
them in oh yeah Tolu yeah completely

875
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:53,490
yeah you could you can set up a device

876
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:56,379
in there and have it relay to a device

877
00:35:53,490 --> 00:36:01,000
wherever you want in some cases you can

878
00:35:56,380 --> 00:36:03,820
even have it connect to say a 4G dongle

879
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:06,400
and have a go to an SPL or not an SQL

880
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:07,780
yes an SQL Server for you and just dump

881
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,790
the data up there somewhere and you can

882
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:11,590
access it wherever you want

883
00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:18,160
yes yeah if you can get it nearby you

884
00:36:11,590 --> 00:36:20,430
can lift down anyone yeah yeah so thank

885
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:20,430
you very much

886
00:36:22,290 --> 00:36:50,710
there is one more question you're going

887
00:36:29,050 --> 00:36:52,720
to be the last one sir yeah it depends I

888
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:54,880
am currently looking into that to see if

889
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:56,470
there is a way and because if you have a

890
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:58,180
directional antenna you do get quite a

891
00:36:56,470 --> 00:36:59,770
lot of DN on it so you can point it out

892
00:36:58,180 --> 00:37:02,470
it but you're still somewhat limited by

893
00:36:59,770 --> 00:37:04,750
how much power the actual devices but no

894
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:07,270
so good antenna to receive is only going

895
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:08,560
to help you so much so yeah I'm in the

896
00:37:07,270 --> 00:37:10,720
midst of the minute to see if there is a

897
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:12,250
way of sitting on a rooftop somewhere

898
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:14,919
and just scan on the street and lift an

899
00:37:12,250 --> 00:37:20,150
RFID codes I'll get back to you on that

900
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:24,809
one yeah okay thanks

901
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:24,809
[Applause]
