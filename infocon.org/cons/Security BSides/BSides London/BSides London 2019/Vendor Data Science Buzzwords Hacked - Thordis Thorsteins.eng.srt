1
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:08,820
okay so I'm hello my name is xxx stuff

2
00:00:06,629 --> 00:00:11,489
things and don't worry you will not need

3
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:14,219
to repeat that but I am a security data

4
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:16,049
scientist from panacea and as he said

5
00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:19,050
today I'm here to talk to you about data

6
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:24,119
science buzzwords and how to see through

7
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:26,580
them so to start off I'm just gonna

8
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:29,429
bring up a few statements taken off the

9
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:31,229
websites of real companies and asked to

10
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:32,910
bring these off I just want you to think

11
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:37,079
critically about what these statements

12
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:39,569
actually mean so first one company one

13
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:41,640
is a leading artificial intelligence

14
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:44,040
vendor that offers targeted machine

15
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:46,140
learning applications which optimize the

16
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:52,140
bridge between digital and offline

17
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:53,820
channels pretty self-explanatory I mean

18
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:56,430
feel free to if you have some guesses

19
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:57,809
feel free to to shout out but it's not

20
00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:08,908
necessary I'm not putting anyone on the

21
00:00:57,809 --> 00:01:13,020
spot - yeah that was kind of more what I

22
00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:16,159
was leaning towards company 2 is the

23
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:18,780
only provider of global real-time

24
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:20,729
unlimited information and insights

25
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:23,729
driven by leading artificial

26
00:01:20,729 --> 00:01:26,070
intelligence again very obvious what

27
00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:26,610
this company does and then my favorite

28
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:28,889
one

29
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:31,380
learn how automated machine learning

30
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:33,299
supercharged is your analytics efforts I

31
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:35,520
don't know exactly what they mean by

32
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:38,460
supercharges but I quite like like the

33
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:40,649
way they face this so and I don't know

34
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:43,289
about you guys but I mean I do data

35
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:44,700
science for a living and I still don't

36
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:49,259
really have any idea about what they

37
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:51,000
mean by these statements and I mean that

38
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:52,590
that being said this doesn't tell us

39
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,590
anything about how good these companies

40
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:57,149
are they very well may have a fantastic

41
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:59,310
product underneath her head under the

42
00:01:57,149 --> 00:02:01,259
hood but the problem is that they're

43
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:03,840
just not revealing anything about what

44
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:06,780
they do how they do it or how well they

45
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:09,000
do whatever they do and this kind of

46
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:11,430
stemmed from the fact that bus words are

47
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,360
created to impress not necessarily to

48
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:16,120
give any information away

49
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:18,340
they often create this disillusion that

50
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:20,770
by sounding more complex things are

51
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:24,550
necessarily better but obviously that is

52
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:26,740
not always the case at all and I mean I

53
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:28,420
think we probably all been guilty of

54
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:30,400
falling for this at some point I can

55
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:32,589
definitely say yesterday I was walking

56
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,810
around in faux sack and I saw a lot of

57
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:36,700
headings that weren't it was very

58
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:38,620
ambiguous with the companies did but I

59
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:41,140
still found myself very compelled going

60
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:43,000
to go towards the booths that had some

61
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:46,239
kind of short impressive sounding

62
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,040
phrasing sleek font and I mean that's

63
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:49,270
that's completely fine as I say

64
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:50,829
sometimes the company is actually

65
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:52,360
already doing something very valid but

66
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:54,820
it's just important to think critically

67
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:56,560
about what they're doing and actually

68
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:59,470
asking about anything that isn't clear

69
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:01,090
because if someone can't explain what

70
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:06,580
they do without relying on buzzwords

71
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:08,980
that's a huge warning sign so hmm I'm

72
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:10,840
gonna focus on three let's say

73
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:14,470
celebrities from the data science

74
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:19,120
passwords world and the first one off is

75
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:21,489
they two driven now this I think a lot

76
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,780
of companies use this and what it

77
00:03:21,489 --> 00:03:26,709
essentially means it's just that they

78
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:28,810
use fate to do whatever they do and to

79
00:03:26,709 --> 00:03:30,220
me at this point this actually seems a

80
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:32,440
little bit redundant when we're talking

81
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:33,970
about security applications because I

82
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:36,040
think it's difficult to find

83
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:37,930
applications that don't use any data so

84
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:39,609
it's more kind of this phrase is used

85
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:42,459
more to impress rather than actually

86
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:43,959
tell you anything and so the key things

87
00:03:42,459 --> 00:03:46,840
to ask when someone says they've got a

88
00:03:43,959 --> 00:03:49,570
day to driven application is what date

89
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:51,459
are they using and how are they using

90
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:52,840
their data because that's what's going

91
00:03:51,459 --> 00:03:56,459
to differentiate between a good

92
00:03:52,840 --> 00:04:01,450
application and one that isn't as good I

93
00:03:56,459 --> 00:04:03,370
think the most commonly used data

94
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:04,988
science bosphorus these days have to be

95
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:08,110
artificial intelligence and machine

96
00:04:04,989 --> 00:04:10,180
learning and it's gonna differ quite a

97
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:12,400
lot depending on who you ask what

98
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:13,810
definitions you're gonna get even if you

99
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,329
ask the experts you get slightly

100
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:19,540
differing opinions so I've included this

101
00:04:16,329 --> 00:04:21,160
slide for context and just to explain

102
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:22,990
that the language that I'm using for the

103
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:25,060
purpose of this presentation is the

104
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:26,350
language that's kind of most commonly

105
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:28,600
agreed-upon in the industry

106
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:31,270
so that is that machine learning is a

107
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:34,720
subset of artificial intelligence and

108
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:36,669
and so as I go on

109
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:39,010
I'm actually just gonna focus on

110
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:40,750
artificial intelligence specifically but

111
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:42,820
just keep in mind that anything I say

112
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:44,230
about AI you can also use the same

113
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:47,170
techniques whenever someone says

114
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:49,300
something about machine learning so that

115
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:53,350
brings us to password number two which

116
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:56,650
is a I powered and this can mean a whole

117
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:58,870
host of things best-case scenario is

118
00:04:56,650 --> 00:05:01,450
that they've got some high quality data

119
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:03,010
or high quality models that the using

120
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:06,789
where appropriate to make the

121
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:09,219
application better however in a huge

122
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:11,830
number of cases that's not the case at

123
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:15,430
all research recently actually showed

124
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:17,590
that 40% of EU startups that are

125
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:20,620
classified as being in the a AI space

126
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:22,810
actually have nothing to do with AI or

127
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:26,590
don't use it in any measurable way

128
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:29,050
anyway so you also have cases when there

129
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:30,580
is some machine learning element and but

130
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:32,170
it's mostly been included for marketing

131
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:33,940
purposes so it's not like it's actually

132
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:35,650
making application any better but

133
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:37,780
they're sort of trying to tack onto this

134
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:39,419
thus the machine learning is cool and

135
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:43,479
that they're doing something intelligent

136
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:45,250
so they've included it just to impress

137
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:48,070
rather than actually return back to

138
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:49,090
results and then this the weirdest case

139
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:52,810
when they actually don't have anything

140
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:55,060
to do with AI and so I'd say the most

141
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:58,020
important thing and to remember when

142
00:05:55,060 --> 00:06:01,240
anyone says anything about using AI is

143
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:05,080
just not to get too impressed but

144
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:06,670
remember that AEI is a tool an AI it's a

145
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:08,919
tool that's very powerful when used

146
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:11,620
correctly but it is also only a tool

147
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:14,260
it's not a magic fix or solution like

148
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:15,910
it's often perceived to be it's often

149
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:18,250
marketed like you can just throw any

150
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:19,780
data at any problem and magically you'll

151
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:21,160
get the correct answer at the other side

152
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:24,309
and that's obviously not the case

153
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:26,710
there's a lot of prerequisites for it

154
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:28,090
even makes sense to use AI so first of

155
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:30,849
all you have to have a well-defined

156
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:32,650
problem so if anyone says to do an AI

157
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:34,300
but it doesn't sound like the problem

158
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:37,870
they're trying to solve is well-defined

159
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:39,010
then you can immediately out roll that

160
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:39,880
they're actually doing anything to do

161
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:44,890
with AI

162
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:46,690
and and to use a very very popular

163
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:49,539
phrase in the data science community

164
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:51,400
rubbish in rubbish out which just means

165
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:53,590
that the quality of the model you have

166
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:55,510
is only ever going to reflect the

167
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:57,849
quality of the data you use to train

168
00:06:55,510 --> 00:07:00,400
your model on so if you using data

169
00:06:57,850 --> 00:07:02,290
that's not expensive enough that has

170
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:04,179
biases you're not accounting for

171
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:06,010
properly then the model is going to be

172
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:10,390
hugely flawed and this is something that

173
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:15,010
needs to be taken into account the last

174
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:19,000
one is advanced analytics and as we saw

175
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:20,770
on the graph before this is the kind of

176
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,650
this is the one that's widest pit scope

177
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:25,840
and what it essentially means it's just

178
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:28,960
that it's more basic no sorry more

179
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:31,299
advanced than basic analytics and I mean

180
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:33,760
this contains things such as artificial

181
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:35,860
intelligence machine learning but it

182
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:37,990
also contains things like particularly

183
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:40,840
well constructed graphs or a very

184
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:42,400
advanced visualization so the thing you

185
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:44,979
need to ask when someone says they do in

186
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:50,169
advanced analytics is what do you mean

187
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:53,260
what sort of advanced analytics to round

188
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:54,760
the talker I've prepared a buzzword

189
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:57,099
cheat sheet so you have something to

190
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:59,500
take away from this talk so you can be

191
00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:02,170
armed next time you're presented with a

192
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:03,400
very fancy sounding statement sounds

193
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:04,900
very intelligent like they're doing

194
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:07,359
something very cool but you also don't

195
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:08,950
really know what they're doing and to

196
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:11,230
help me demonstrate the use of this

197
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:13,539
cheat sheet I'm gonna rely on one of the

198
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:16,420
statements from our first from the first

199
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:17,980
light so there's a lot of things about

200
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:20,500
this statement that's we loosely covered

201
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:22,030
earlier that are not clear at all so the

202
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:25,140
first thing I would ask if someone said

203
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:27,969
this to me which is what do you mean and

204
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:29,409
get them to break it down into simpler

205
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:30,880
terms because if they know what they're

206
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:33,370
doing they should be able to phrase it

207
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:35,380
in a way that's easier to understand and

208
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:37,419
so if they say anything like trust me

209
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:39,610
it's a I then just stay clear that's

210
00:08:37,419 --> 00:08:43,718
that's not someone you wanna get

211
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:46,090
involved with then diving a bit deeper

212
00:08:43,719 --> 00:08:47,890
how specifically do you use I mean I

213
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:49,030
guess in this case machine learning but

214
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:51,550
you can use this for any of the other

215
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:52,660
passwords and this is because as I said

216
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:54,939
earlier

217
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:57,069
assess the prea requirements that need

218
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:59,710
to be met for it even to make sense to

219
00:08:57,070 --> 00:09:01,570
use machine learning so you need to

220
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:03,490
understand what problem are they trying

221
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:05,560
to solve and have they taken into

222
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:09,910
consideration the limitations of these

223
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:12,160
approaches why did you choose to use

224
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:13,990
this technique so machine learning here

225
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,880
and this is getting to us have they

226
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:18,280
actually considered the limitations or

227
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:19,930
have this sort of just used it for the

228
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:21,730
sake of using it because everyone else

229
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:25,359
is doing it and they wanted to get on

230
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:29,110
that bus as well how was the model

231
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:31,750
trained and this is quite key because it

232
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:33,490
as I said earlier the model is never

233
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:35,710
going to be faster than the quality of

234
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:38,620
the data that was used to train the

235
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:40,630
model on so if there are any biases in

236
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:45,370
the data they haven't accounted for and

237
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:47,620
if they've trained it without taking

238
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:49,960
into consideration the some security

239
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:53,080
flaws so for example neural networks

240
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:55,720
often store information that they train

241
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:57,250
on so for specific use cases you

242
00:09:55,720 --> 00:10:00,340
actually wouldn't want to use this at

243
00:09:57,250 --> 00:10:01,840
all so you need to know how they train

244
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:05,590
the model and whether they train to

245
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:07,900
correctly for the use case they have can

246
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:10,060
I validate the decisions being made now

247
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:12,640
this one is not actually always going to

248
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:14,739
be possible to validated and for example

249
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:16,480
with neural networks it is always going

250
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:18,160
to be a bit of a black box you don't

251
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:20,500
have full visibility and what's going on

252
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:24,339
but that also means that that will not

253
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:26,770
be in applicable approach for say making

254
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:28,210
important security decisions because you

255
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:31,000
know for those you need to have

256
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:32,470
visibility on what's happening so when

257
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,150
you have a question like that we are

258
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:35,620
trying to solve this you need to make

259
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:38,800
sure that you can validate was being

260
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:40,990
done and then lastly a bit of a

261
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:43,990
technical one how do you minimize false

262
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:45,490
positives or false negatives so this one

263
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:48,280
is going to depend a little bit on the

264
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:50,410
question but for some cases it's going

265
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:52,810
to be very costly to falsely predict the

266
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:54,219
positive or negative so say for example

267
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:55,869
if you were working in healthcare and

268
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:58,660
you were predicting whether someone had

269
00:10:55,870 --> 00:11:01,060
a specific disease it would be quite bad

270
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:03,130
to falsely say you don't have it whereas

271
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:03,540
if you falsely say that a few more

272
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:06,209
people

273
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:09,240
have it and actually do that's gonna the

274
00:11:06,209 --> 00:11:12,779
results of that is going to be not as

275
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:15,480
bad so you need to know whether they've

276
00:11:12,779 --> 00:11:19,980
taken into consideration how to minimize

277
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:22,440
the cost I guess so if you take one

278
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:24,600
thing away from this presentation it's

279
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:26,459
that you shouldn't worry about asking

280
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:29,310
tech questions even if you feel like the

281
00:11:26,459 --> 00:11:32,399
sound leave don't find yourself getting

282
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:34,199
so impressed and so intimidated by these

283
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:35,819
statements that you just don't question

284
00:11:34,199 --> 00:11:36,810
at all and you just say oh these people

285
00:11:35,819 --> 00:11:38,399
sound like they definitely know what

286
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:41,819
they're doing they've used all their all

287
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:43,050
the cool words and I'm just you know I'm

288
00:11:41,819 --> 00:11:45,389
not going to give away that I don't know

289
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:49,290
what these things mean so ask about

290
00:11:45,389 --> 00:11:51,959
anything that's unclear and that kind of

291
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:53,550
rounds it up and does anyone have any

292
00:11:51,959 --> 00:11:55,500
questions I think that's that's

293
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:57,508
wonderful by the way trust me that's a

294
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:59,130
term we use in Texas it means you're

295
00:11:57,509 --> 00:12:01,170
about to get hosed for a lot of money

296
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:11,760
and we're not going to do anything that

297
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:13,740
we claim any questions this is awesome

298
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:17,579
thank you so much how do you how do you

299
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:19,170
get past so when someone tells you the

300
00:12:17,579 --> 00:12:20,609
answer to one of those questions is oh

301
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:22,670
I'm going to have to get my data

302
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:25,740
scientist in here to explain that to you

303
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:27,810
so yeah so that's probably gonna be a

304
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:29,279
the case a lot of the times and a lot a

305
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:30,540
lot of cases they won't even want to

306
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:32,490
give you the questions with the answers

307
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:34,199
so what you need to take into account is

308
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:36,209
how important is it to you to know these

309
00:12:34,199 --> 00:12:39,120
answers so I think you know definitely

310
00:12:36,209 --> 00:12:41,459
try to push try to press for the answers

311
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,630
because someone in the organization

312
00:12:41,459 --> 00:12:44,518
should have the answers you know

313
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:46,740
obviously if you're like Oh tell me the

314
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:48,000
secret tell me the exact model you're

315
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:56,069
using they're not gonna want to tell you

316
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:57,779
that but yeah sorry just for the record

317
00:12:56,069 --> 00:13:00,930
so as a follow-on to that do you

318
00:12:57,779 --> 00:13:02,939
consider the number of layers and the

319
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:06,449
model of a neural network to be

320
00:13:02,939 --> 00:13:08,160
proprietary personally no some cases

321
00:13:06,449 --> 00:13:09,689
people with because a lot of the times

322
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,779
the models underneath the hood actually

323
00:13:09,689 --> 00:13:14,459
aren't that complicated at all so

324
00:13:11,779 --> 00:13:16,529
companies don't want to reveal how

325
00:13:14,459 --> 00:13:18,060
simple their answer is just cuz it be so

326
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:20,839
see for other people to pick it off but

327
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:23,459
you know it shouldn't be the case though

328
00:13:20,839 --> 00:13:25,139
yeah usually when so makers makes a

329
00:13:23,459 --> 00:13:26,609
comment like I need to talk to my data

330
00:13:25,139 --> 00:13:28,499
architect and they've been selling the

331
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:31,160
product for a while it means that they

332
00:13:28,499 --> 00:13:36,600
haven't got a clue and you know exactly

333
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:41,100
next question so your data scientists

334
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:43,649
right so do you think that someone in

335
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:46,680
the future a I will take over the world

336
00:13:43,649 --> 00:13:49,920
sorry that somewhere in the future

337
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:53,189
AI will take over the road dominate the

338
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:54,899
road so this is a hot topic and I

339
00:13:53,189 --> 00:13:57,089
probably got to be careful about how

340
00:13:54,899 --> 00:13:58,470
answer this person yes I mean at some

341
00:13:57,089 --> 00:14:00,449
point in the future so I'm a

342
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:01,470
mathematician so I kind of when you say

343
00:14:00,449 --> 00:14:03,508
at some point I'm kind of thinking

344
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:05,879
indefinite time so yes at some point

345
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:07,649
they probably going to in our lifetime I

346
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:10,050
actually don't think so just because I

347
00:14:07,649 --> 00:14:12,209
think we're quite far from getting

348
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:16,079
anything that's actually intelligent so

349
00:14:12,209 --> 00:14:19,050
we have we made huge progress and making

350
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:21,569
machine learning algorithms that solve

351
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:24,059
specific tasks very very well so you

352
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:26,759
know for example it makes image

353
00:14:24,059 --> 00:14:29,569
classification that's one and that we

354
00:14:26,759 --> 00:14:31,680
made a huge progress on but those

355
00:14:29,569 --> 00:14:34,170
algorithms they wouldn't automatically

356
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:36,329
decide to learn French or pick up a

357
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:39,029
political opinion which is what's

358
00:14:36,329 --> 00:14:41,250
required for actual intelligence and I

359
00:14:39,029 --> 00:14:42,990
think that machines are gonna need a

360
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:45,089
level of intelligence to actually take

361
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:46,949
over the world so yeah how do you think

362
00:14:45,089 --> 00:14:47,970
so you might have mind just to stop

363
00:14:46,949 --> 00:14:50,250
there we don't think there'll be

364
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:54,059
intelligence to take over politics in

365
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:55,709
the world I speak French and I've got

366
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:59,569
political opinions but I don't want to

367
00:14:55,709 --> 00:14:59,569
take over the world other questions

368
00:15:01,589 --> 00:15:05,279
what do you do if you assuming you don't

369
00:15:03,389 --> 00:15:06,629
know anything about sort of the data

370
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:09,059
science side of stuff you still want to

371
00:15:06,629 --> 00:15:11,399
understand whether that's snake oil if

372
00:15:09,059 --> 00:15:12,629
they come back to you and say old trying

373
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:15,209
bamboozle you is like oh it's a

374
00:15:12,629 --> 00:15:17,610
seven-layer WI like gamma we've trained

375
00:15:15,209 --> 00:15:19,559
on the WTF data set or something how do

376
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:21,179
you cut through that to actually

377
00:15:19,559 --> 00:15:22,829
understanding what they're doing I'd say

378
00:15:21,179 --> 00:15:25,379
just used to cheat you'd ask them very

379
00:15:22,829 --> 00:15:26,729
simple questions and try to get beyond

380
00:15:25,379 --> 00:15:29,189
because it's not really gonna matter

381
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:29,939
what exact model they need they use but

382
00:15:29,189 --> 00:15:31,108
what's gonna matter

383
00:15:29,939 --> 00:15:33,389
is whether they've taken into

384
00:15:31,109 --> 00:15:35,069
consideration the limitations of their

385
00:15:33,389 --> 00:15:36,419
approach and whether whether they

386
00:15:35,069 --> 00:15:38,969
actually have whether you think they

387
00:15:36,419 --> 00:15:43,379
have access to date that's of

388
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:44,970
significant quality whether just how

389
00:15:43,379 --> 00:15:46,799
well they've thought about the problem

390
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:48,359
and how well they can explain why

391
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:51,299
they're doing what they're doing and why

392
00:15:48,359 --> 00:15:53,939
it works so that goes with your

393
00:15:51,299 --> 00:16:01,858
corollary if they ever say well I don't

394
00:15:53,939 --> 00:16:03,598
think you would understand just a

395
00:16:01,859 --> 00:16:07,949
comment isn't it's not much different

396
00:16:03,599 --> 00:16:09,149
when they say blockchain power yeah I

397
00:16:07,949 --> 00:16:11,728
mean that should have been on there as

398
00:16:09,149 --> 00:16:15,379
well but I had to I had to restrict this

399
00:16:11,729 --> 00:16:18,959
go okay any other questions

400
00:16:15,379 --> 00:16:21,679
no go once twice Thank You wonderful

401
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:21,679
