1
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:08,940
thank you so much everyone I want to

2
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:10,830
start by thanking b-sides London for

3
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:13,410
welcoming us here thank you to the

4
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:15,809
sponsors the organizers and of course to

5
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:18,869
you all for coming along and listening

6
00:00:15,809 --> 00:00:22,230
to Kevin and myself talk about building

7
00:00:18,869 --> 00:00:24,900
a Champions program in an organization

8
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:27,960
we're going to cover what a cyber

9
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:31,769
security champions program is how you

10
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:33,930
build one why they are a good idea what

11
00:00:31,769 --> 00:00:36,390
you can do to engage people keep them

12
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:38,070
motivated we're going to talk about some

13
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:40,829
ideas of how to measure whether your

14
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:43,440
champions program is going well or not

15
00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:45,690
and some of the pitfalls some of the

16
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,160
things that can go wrong so we're gonna

17
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:49,289
try and cover you know a nice

18
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:51,690
introduction to champions there'll be

19
00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:53,760
some time at the end for questions so

20
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:56,370
whether you have never heard of a

21
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,899
champions program whether you are

22
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:59,788
thinking of running one whether you're

23
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:01,190
running one already hopefully there'll

24
00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:04,290
be something that you take away from

25
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:07,649
what Kevin and I have to say today to

26
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:09,270
help you so to start we're gonna

27
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:14,909
introduce ourselves

28
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:16,590
yeah well as you can see this is us so a

29
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:18,810
little bit about me I've worked for

30
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:19,890
Hargreaves Lansdown for about two and a

31
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:23,159
half years now

32
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:25,590
I am the cyber risk manager he's

33
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:27,180
formerly information security actually

34
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:28,950
change the drug tights with just because

35
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:32,790
cybers a little bit more sexiest to use

36
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:34,770
as a as a name right and the reason why

37
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:37,890
we're doing this is because when you

38
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:40,350
look at defense technology only goes

39
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:42,360
part of the way because let's face it

40
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:45,119
phishing emails are the easiest way to

41
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:47,450
breach any organization right where is

42
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:50,460
that debatable okay you've got green ooh

43
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:52,439
so jess you want to say a little bit

44
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:54,780
about yourself so I've spoken to besides

45
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:56,639
London a few times but if you're not

46
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:58,590
familiar with me I'm one of the

47
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,400
cofounders of side gender together with

48
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:02,860
FC and

49
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:04,390
I'm talking about this because my work

50
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:07,270
is always on the human side of

51
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:09,449
cybersecurity so generally working on

52
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:12,280
awareness raising behavioral change

53
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:15,040
cultural issues around cybersecurity in

54
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:17,740
organizations and I've worked with a few

55
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:20,769
clients who either were establishing a

56
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:22,960
new champions program or looking to have

57
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:26,320
a more successful champions program and

58
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:29,200
so Kevin and I we share this interest in

59
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:30,640
culture in Champions and decided to come

60
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:35,679
and share some of the stuff that we've

61
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:39,269
learned with you all today so a little

62
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:42,340
bit of background on Hargreaves Lansdown

63
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:45,100
as this is a bit of a case study so

64
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:46,990
auguries Lansdowne is Britain's number

65
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:49,299
one private investment and super market

66
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:52,450
if you like okay we started here not buy

67
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:55,240
that today see one by two friends in a

68
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:58,660
bedroom and the business grew very very

69
00:02:55,240 --> 00:03:01,290
very quickly you have around five

70
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:04,810
million clients with almost 100 billion

71
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:08,010
pounds of assets under management I do

72
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:08,010
sleep at night all right

73
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:14,079
the point of telling you this is that

74
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:16,450
Hargreaves grew so quickly there was a

75
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:19,270
lot of work to do I felt when I got

76
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:23,049
there two and a half years ago I felt

77
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:25,570
tackling this in a traditional way would

78
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:28,360
not have worked so engagement with

79
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:30,160
people in the organisation and building

80
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:32,739
a team of champions was something I

81
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:37,359
embarked on which I worked together with

82
00:03:32,739 --> 00:03:39,220
Jess on and we see this a lot so genta a

83
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:42,610
lot of our clients will have grown

84
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:45,190
really quickly and so they're trying to

85
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:47,050
think about how they manage culture how

86
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:50,380
they communicate effectively with people

87
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:53,680
how they try and encourage positive

88
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:56,500
behavioral change so site enter I run

89
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:58,690
together with FC and we work on the

90
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:01,599
human technical and the physical sides

91
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:04,060
of cyber security we like to say that

92
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:08,018
Maine's or areas of work alike the three

93
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:11,079
T's so we do testing physical technical

94
00:04:08,019 --> 00:04:12,670
and cultural assessments we do training

95
00:04:11,079 --> 00:04:14,079
all sorts of different types of training

96
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:17,228
we do lots of speaking about

97
00:04:14,079 --> 00:04:18,789
cybersecurity as well aside from this we

98
00:04:17,228 --> 00:04:20,228
do lots of other stuff and as I've

99
00:04:18,789 --> 00:04:21,820
already said one of the things that I've

100
00:04:20,228 --> 00:04:24,219
helped some of our clients with is

101
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:25,810
building these champion programs making

102
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:27,820
sure that they're effective

103
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:30,669
so we're talking about champion programs

104
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:35,500
today and you may have a question what

105
00:04:30,669 --> 00:04:38,469
is a champions program just a quick show

106
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:41,099
of hands who runs or who has a champions

107
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:44,889
program running in their organization

108
00:04:41,099 --> 00:04:47,969
okay could you view wonderful alright so

109
00:04:44,889 --> 00:04:50,979
from my perspective what is cyber

110
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:53,949
champions program it's made up of your

111
00:04:50,979 --> 00:04:56,289
most loyal staff your biggest fans and

112
00:04:53,949 --> 00:04:59,289
they're very very helpful they want to

113
00:04:56,289 --> 00:05:02,740
be part of security for whatever reason

114
00:04:59,289 --> 00:05:05,800
whatever their motivations are one of

115
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:07,509
the things I don't do is hold back when

116
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,860
it comes to my champions I want them

117
00:05:07,509 --> 00:05:12,880
involved okay

118
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:14,620
so yes my boss I report to the C so for

119
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,120
Hargreaves which makes things handy when

120
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:19,570
I need to get something signed off get

121
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:22,780
some money but I get them sitting with

122
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:24,729
him shadowing for the day alright they

123
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:28,210
get involved with the physical security

124
00:05:24,729 --> 00:05:30,490
guys if I've got my PCI DSS auditor on

125
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:33,460
I'll bring them in and get them involved

126
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:35,409
let them see exactly how operates get

127
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:37,388
them to understand the reason why it's

128
00:05:35,409 --> 00:05:40,380
important to have everybody

129
00:05:37,389 --> 00:05:42,759
understanding their remit in security

130
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:45,070
for the stock we have a stock in our

131
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:48,070
Greaves I get the guy sitting with the

132
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:50,169
salt for maybe a few hours of the day if

133
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:52,090
there's any type of incidents or red

134
00:05:50,169 --> 00:05:55,539
team or purple team I get them involved

135
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:58,989
to a point and also get them involved in

136
00:05:55,539 --> 00:06:00,880
penetration testing so we've also got

137
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:02,919
risk and we work with fraud so there's

138
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:04,210
quite a few teams and what want them to

139
00:06:02,919 --> 00:06:06,070
do is have an appreciation and

140
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:06,849
understanding of how the teams connect

141
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:09,789
and

142
00:06:06,849 --> 00:06:11,319
also having the champions there made up

143
00:06:09,789 --> 00:06:13,449
of different people there just like

144
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:15,639
being okay but everybody's got a

145
00:06:13,449 --> 00:06:17,259
slightly different interest so I open up

146
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:19,809
the doors so it's not just information

147
00:06:17,259 --> 00:06:23,860
security they can get involved in any

148
00:06:19,809 --> 00:06:25,599
part of the system and I think it's a

149
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:28,360
great way of doing that Hargreaves

150
00:06:25,599 --> 00:06:30,399
because the champions generally in an

151
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:33,009
organization will be people as kevin has

152
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:34,449
said who have an interest in security

153
00:06:33,009 --> 00:06:37,389
for one reason or another

154
00:06:34,449 --> 00:06:39,069
so with clients that have never had a

155
00:06:37,389 --> 00:06:41,080
champions program before or people

156
00:06:39,069 --> 00:06:43,599
who've never come across the term the

157
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:45,429
way I like to describe it is a bit like

158
00:06:43,599 --> 00:06:46,599
kind of thinking of health and safety

159
00:06:45,429 --> 00:06:48,008
and your health and safety

160
00:06:46,599 --> 00:06:50,619
representatives throughout an

161
00:06:48,009 --> 00:06:53,559
organization it's just the same but with

162
00:06:50,619 --> 00:06:55,089
cybersecurity so I've found in some

163
00:06:53,559 --> 00:06:56,860
clients it will be people who ask the

164
00:06:55,089 --> 00:06:59,229
questions of the security team people

165
00:06:56,860 --> 00:07:00,459
who report a lot of incidents people who

166
00:06:59,229 --> 00:07:03,188
want to know more about personal

167
00:07:00,459 --> 00:07:05,050
security and asking some advice on that

168
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:07,929
there are people that can make great

169
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:11,649
champions I've also found in a couple of

170
00:07:07,929 --> 00:07:13,448
clients people who have actually found

171
00:07:11,649 --> 00:07:16,119
security difficult and who have

172
00:07:13,449 --> 00:07:18,639
complained about security they actually

173
00:07:16,119 --> 00:07:21,339
can turn into great champions because

174
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:23,379
that people who want to engage and if

175
00:07:21,339 --> 00:07:25,659
you can get them to engage as champions

176
00:07:23,379 --> 00:07:27,490
they're usually really good at then

177
00:07:25,659 --> 00:07:32,349
going ahead and kind of flying the flag

178
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:34,899
for security so one interest that Kevin

179
00:07:32,349 --> 00:07:36,490
and I really share is around culture and

180
00:07:34,899 --> 00:07:38,259
we want to talk a little bit about

181
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:40,869
culture because the champions program

182
00:07:38,259 --> 00:07:42,879
can be really effective in positively

183
00:07:40,869 --> 00:07:46,809
influencing the security culture of an

184
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:49,449
organization so culture is one of those

185
00:07:46,809 --> 00:07:51,669
terms that can sound a little bit wooly

186
00:07:49,449 --> 00:07:53,649
but we're hearing a lot about culture

187
00:07:51,669 --> 00:07:56,889
over the last year in terms of security

188
00:07:53,649 --> 00:07:59,679
if you're not that familiar with you

189
00:07:56,889 --> 00:08:02,619
know working with cultures and culture

190
00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:05,018
in general is basically a way of life is

191
00:08:02,619 --> 00:08:08,079
the customs the beliefs usually of a

192
00:08:05,019 --> 00:08:11,409
particular group in society and usually

193
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:14,110
those cultures are represented through

194
00:08:11,409 --> 00:08:16,839
rituals through art through customs

195
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:18,360
through food when it comes to

196
00:08:16,839 --> 00:08:20,500
organizational culture

197
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:22,510
there's been loads of studies of

198
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:25,470
organizational culture what that means

199
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:27,700
what it looks like and essentially

200
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:30,940
organizational culture can be understood

201
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:32,919
as the values and beliefs that underpin

202
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:36,010
the behaviors of people in your

203
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:37,929
organization so the culture is kind of

204
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:40,419
something that emerges through how

205
00:08:37,929 --> 00:08:42,159
people behave which is based on what

206
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:45,400
they believe is the right thing the

207
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:47,470
right way to be and organizational

208
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:49,959
culture is really influential when it

209
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:52,750
comes to security in all sorts of ways

210
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:55,450
for example if you have a culture of

211
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:56,470
fear where people are particularly

212
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:59,200
punished

213
00:08:56,470 --> 00:09:01,120
you know if they click on a link or if

214
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:03,460
there's an incident involving them and

215
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:05,200
information security if you have that

216
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:07,630
kind of culture of fear where people are

217
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:09,220
very worried about security then what

218
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:12,640
you're gonna see is people hiding

219
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:14,350
incidents people not reporting stuff so

220
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:17,410
culture and security are really

221
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:19,870
important everything from how technical

222
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:21,219
controls are implemented through to

223
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:24,010
things like reporting of incidents

224
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:26,589
you're gonna see a huge impact on how

225
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:27,760
security operates coming from the

226
00:09:26,589 --> 00:09:32,050
culture that you have around

227
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:35,350
cybersecurity and so culture is really

228
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:37,959
important because it can influence you

229
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:40,600
know how you bring about change programs

230
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:42,339
when it comes to security it influences

231
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:44,470
your development cycle and whether

232
00:09:42,339 --> 00:09:46,210
security is built into that whether

233
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:49,630
there's good communications between the

234
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:52,360
teams and to extend that you have

235
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:54,130
insider incidents and to the extent that

236
00:09:52,360 --> 00:10:00,339
you know about them the extent to which

237
00:09:54,130 --> 00:10:02,350
they're reported McAfee now sorry

238
00:10:00,339 --> 00:10:07,750
hasslein so following on from what Jay

239
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:10,180
said cultures take time to change and

240
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:14,440
you can measure it in months probably

241
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:17,020
years it takes to change mindsets up

242
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:20,650
what's the point what's the point in

243
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:22,720
having security champions I think having

244
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:25,780
security champions enables a two-way

245
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:27,220
conversation so you can get metrics from

246
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:29,540
anywhere in the business and try and

247
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:31,190
measure the successes of what you do

248
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:33,439
we're in an industry which is very very

249
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:35,149
difficult to quantify so we don't

250
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:40,389
produce widgets all we do is ask for

251
00:10:35,149 --> 00:10:42,740
money and you say can we have X amount

252
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:44,480
and then the response is well what we

253
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:49,069
get for our money what are you spending

254
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:51,589
on well we won't get a breach okay so is

255
00:10:49,069 --> 00:10:53,329
that constant battle asking for money

256
00:10:51,589 --> 00:10:55,550
and trying to understand where the value

257
00:10:53,329 --> 00:10:57,290
is having a champions program really

258
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:58,699
does help you do that you get a good

259
00:10:57,290 --> 00:11:01,939
feedback because you get an aggregated

260
00:10:58,699 --> 00:11:04,189
view from the business exactly what the

261
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:06,350
business perceived security to be

262
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:08,360
whether it's negative whether it's

263
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:10,430
positive and those issues can be

264
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:13,009
highlighted depending on where the areas

265
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:15,399
that the champion sit and we'll go into

266
00:11:13,009 --> 00:11:19,399
that a little bit more in just a while

267
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:22,819
but it's it's really key to understand

268
00:11:19,399 --> 00:11:25,310
that they're not the police you know you

269
00:11:22,819 --> 00:11:26,719
want to get these guys operating at an

270
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:29,479
effective level where they just

271
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,829
seamlessly blend in you know and I think

272
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:32,509
that's really really important just to

273
00:11:30,829 --> 00:11:35,089
get the right results out of it as well

274
00:11:32,509 --> 00:11:37,310
it's such an important point I've seen

275
00:11:35,089 --> 00:11:39,230
some people who think are great will

276
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:41,060
have a champions program because then

277
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:43,699
we'll have people out there who can tell

278
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:46,369
on everyone else and who can report back

279
00:11:43,699 --> 00:11:48,709
and that's not really the way that you

280
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:51,199
want to approach it it should be about

281
00:11:48,709 --> 00:11:55,250
having a healthy culture and being able

282
00:11:51,199 --> 00:11:57,529
to listen as kevin has said often people

283
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:59,930
feel like communications from

284
00:11:57,529 --> 00:12:02,000
information security go one way you know

285
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:02,859
and they're often told what to do with

286
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,120
security

287
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:06,800
this way having a champions program

288
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,990
you're giving people a voice you're

289
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:11,329
you're giving them a face in their

290
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:13,550
department someone they can go to with

291
00:12:11,329 --> 00:12:15,859
their concerns with their questions with

292
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:18,709
their worries and that is a really

293
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:20,660
healthy message to send that we as

294
00:12:18,709 --> 00:12:24,619
information security are listening to

295
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:27,050
the business it also is a really great

296
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:30,740
way of scaling up what you're trying to

297
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:33,258
do in information security so it's a

298
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:35,149
question I commonly get organizations

299
00:12:33,259 --> 00:12:37,880
that maybe don't have a lot of resource

300
00:12:35,149 --> 00:12:40,399
when it comes to cyber security you know

301
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:41,830
don't have big teams find it very

302
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:43,840
difficult to get their messages

303
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:46,060
out there one great thing to do is to

304
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:48,270
think about champions program because

305
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:51,579
there you're really being able to

306
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:53,500
amplify your messages you have people

307
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:55,300
out there in the business who know the

308
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:57,430
business who are known to their

309
00:12:55,300 --> 00:13:00,069
colleagues who can take forward your

310
00:12:57,430 --> 00:13:02,349
messages and relay them to the people

311
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:04,900
around them so it's a fantastic way of

312
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:07,600
being able to scale up and for me it

313
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:10,180
taps really effectively into the notion

314
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:11,800
of social proof so social proof if

315
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:13,089
people have seen my presentations before

316
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:15,760
you might have heard me talk about it

317
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:18,610
the social proof is basically the idea

318
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:22,210
that we mimic behavior that we see from

319
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:23,830
other people so if for example that this

320
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:25,780
has been a study University of

321
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:28,930
Pennsylvania and they recently found

322
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:31,569
that if 25 percent of a group start

323
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:33,790
behaving in a particular way the rest of

324
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:36,430
the group are very likely to follow and

325
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:38,310
mimic that behavior so if a quarter of

326
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:40,239
you get up and walk out the room now

327
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:43,780
Kevin and I are basically going to be

328
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:47,440
talking to ourselves more likely we're

329
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:50,020
gonna follow as well because it's kind

330
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:52,570
of human nature to think oh they must

331
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:54,699
know something that I don't they must

332
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:57,640
know the schedule better than me maybe

333
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:59,320
they've heard a fire alarm maybe you

334
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:01,540
know there's some reason why that

335
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:04,030
percentage of people are all behaving in

336
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:07,089
a particular way I'm gonna follow so

337
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:10,030
that's social proof and social proof is

338
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:12,760
most effective when the person modeling

339
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:15,430
the behavior is someone we admire or we

340
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:16,840
can relate to so by having people out in

341
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:19,060
the business as champions

342
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:21,220
you've got people out there that

343
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:23,020
colleagues recognize that they relate to

344
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:25,240
you know they know the work that they're

345
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:27,189
doing they're familiar and so you're

346
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:30,070
kind of tapping into the idea of social

347
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:33,940
proof as a way of really scaling up and

348
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:35,380
amplifying your messages and this idea

349
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:37,750
of culture that we've been talking about

350
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:39,790
as I said have heard more and more about

351
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:41,010
this in the industry over the last

352
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:43,449
couple of years which has been

353
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:45,460
absolutely fantastic to see people

354
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:49,240
starting to recognize the importance of

355
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:51,760
security culture one thing I do is I'm

356
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:52,339
the chair of an organization called Club

357
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:55,069
Caesar

358
00:14:52,339 --> 00:14:59,059
we're a members group non-commercial

359
00:14:55,069 --> 00:15:02,360
about 200 information security leaders

360
00:14:59,059 --> 00:15:05,209
in the UK in Europe and Beyond a members

361
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:08,059
of clip see so and one thing we do is we

362
00:15:05,209 --> 00:15:10,609
get the CSO's together about 60 of them

363
00:15:08,059 --> 00:15:13,069
every year and we ask questions of them

364
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:14,540
the results are all anonymous and it's a

365
00:15:13,069 --> 00:15:17,540
way of us just finding out what's

366
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:19,969
happening inside security from that

367
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:21,860
group's perspective so one question we

368
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:24,949
always ask them is what are the hot

369
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:26,689
topics on your radar and this year this

370
00:15:24,949 --> 00:15:28,758
was this was the question these were the

371
00:15:26,689 --> 00:15:31,099
possible answers and we saw an

372
00:15:28,759 --> 00:15:33,649
overwhelming majority picking security

373
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:36,199
culture as the number one hot topic for

374
00:15:33,649 --> 00:15:37,819
them the thing that they buy a hot topic

375
00:15:36,199 --> 00:15:39,859
we mean something they're starting to

376
00:15:37,819 --> 00:15:41,628
think about something they're aware that

377
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:44,329
they should be working on their

378
00:15:41,629 --> 00:15:47,959
priorities for the coming year so we can

379
00:15:44,329 --> 00:15:49,790
see that culture is really important to

380
00:15:47,959 --> 00:15:52,069
see so it's really important to the

381
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:54,410
security industry and a champions

382
00:15:52,069 --> 00:15:59,378
program is a great way of trying to

383
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:59,379
influence culture in a positive way so

384
00:15:59,829 --> 00:16:05,628
quick show of hands who has something

385
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:07,550
like this a cybersecurity day which runs

386
00:16:05,629 --> 00:16:12,319
annually in their organization just a

387
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:15,069
quick show of hands okay so a few of you

388
00:16:12,319 --> 00:16:17,059
for the ones that don't is brilliant

389
00:16:15,069 --> 00:16:19,149
because what it does is it promotes

390
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:21,709
information security cybersecurity

391
00:16:19,149 --> 00:16:23,629
whatever you want to call it security it

392
00:16:21,709 --> 00:16:26,029
promotes it all right it brings it into

393
00:16:23,629 --> 00:16:28,699
the limelight and this is where I get my

394
00:16:26,029 --> 00:16:31,699
Champions to show off their wares okay

395
00:16:28,699 --> 00:16:34,639
so they get involved with the planning

396
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:38,089
the running of the event we do all sorts

397
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:40,429
of stuff ok run several different

398
00:16:38,089 --> 00:16:42,829
stations with different games and the

399
00:16:40,429 --> 00:16:46,490
guys will man the stations do some

400
00:16:42,829 --> 00:16:49,279
password cracking lock-picking phishing

401
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:51,009
email test I've I've been poned and all

402
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:53,449
sorts of different cyber security days

403
00:16:51,009 --> 00:16:56,720
they also get involved with distribution

404
00:16:53,449 --> 00:16:59,269
of material now I have around about 60

405
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:02,750
to 80 champions at the moment they are

406
00:16:59,269 --> 00:17:03,800
spread quite evenly amongst the business

407
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:04,849
so what we've got course

408
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:07,609
Center there's probably a higher

409
00:17:04,849 --> 00:17:09,589
population but we've got a small detail

410
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:11,780
of about ten people in the finance team

411
00:17:09,589 --> 00:17:14,359
we've probably got one or two for

412
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:16,220
example so they represent their areas

413
00:17:14,359 --> 00:17:18,050
and getting them to hand out things like

414
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:21,500
these little badges which is the things

415
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:23,990
I want them to focus on right wear your

416
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:26,300
badge don't click malicious links all

417
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:29,300
right use your Windows key and L for

418
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:30,470
locking figure out what the objectives

419
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:33,169
aren't the requirements for your

420
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:35,420
organization and get them out there it

421
00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:37,070
gives them really really good presence

422
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:38,390
in the business it shows the business

423
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:40,129
that value that they're getting out of

424
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:42,380
security functions or rather than just

425
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:44,300
been a figure on the payroll or actually

426
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:46,250
adding value by leveraging the other

427
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:49,700
people in their department and it also

428
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:51,770
gives them that familiarity so in terms

429
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:53,809
of conveying messages your champions can

430
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:55,280
convey convert the message to language

431
00:17:53,809 --> 00:17:57,559
that you're the local team will

432
00:17:55,280 --> 00:18:00,760
understand rather than you just speaking

433
00:17:57,559 --> 00:18:00,760
in tech terms all the time

434
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:06,650
the fantastic thing about champions

435
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:09,678
programs is you can make this model fit

436
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:11,809
according to the resources you have the

437
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:13,760
kind of organization you have your

438
00:18:11,809 --> 00:18:14,570
requirements and what you want to get

439
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:17,809
out of it

440
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:20,960
so there's completely different models

441
00:18:17,809 --> 00:18:23,690
depending on the context and your

442
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:25,100
particular organization depending on

443
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:26,630
your budget there's all sorts of

444
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:28,580
different things you can do and I've

445
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:30,950
seen this approach taken in

446
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:32,960
organizations that have really small

447
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:35,090
security teams and really limited

448
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:37,669
budgets through to organizations that

449
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:39,740
have really large security teams and a

450
00:18:37,669 --> 00:18:41,690
fantastic really healthy budget to play

451
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:44,960
with there's lots of different things

452
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:47,570
that you can do some of the benefits are

453
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:51,080
that you will engage with your champions

454
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:53,030
to build threat models and help you to

455
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:54,230
understand you know the kind of threats

456
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:56,510
that the different parts of the

457
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:59,210
organization are facing you can have

458
00:18:56,510 --> 00:19:02,480
champions involved in security reviews

459
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:04,460
in research and development I have seen

460
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:05,840
some organizations have champion

461
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:08,660
programs that are very kind of bug

462
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:11,770
bounty heavy and that have kind of a

463
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:13,880
hack the organization kind of approach

464
00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:15,340
one approach that I've seen really

465
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:17,050
successful in organization

466
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:18,610
that have a limited budget is a

467
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:21,190
train-the-trainer one

468
00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:23,860
so essentially you you know if you have

469
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:26,140
a really small team and you have very

470
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:28,300
limited constraints around raising

471
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:31,330
awareness then you have one person in

472
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:34,360
the security team who trains some of the

473
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:36,730
champions trains them not only in kind

474
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:38,290
of some security material but also how

475
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:40,870
to deliver that how you want it

476
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:43,870
delivered and then those champions go on

477
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:45,760
and train other champions and it's

478
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:48,090
almost like a waterfall kind of tree

479
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:52,090
effect where you're building on top of

480
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:54,159
each other in terms of the network it's

481
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:56,620
a really good way of developing best

482
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:57,940
practice enhancing decision-making you

483
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:59,949
know making sure you're listening to the

484
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:01,710
business lots of different things that

485
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:05,260
you can do with your champions program

486
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:06,790
depending on the needs so I've said

487
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:10,090
there's lots of different approaches

488
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:12,250
some approaches will make being a

489
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:14,530
champion kind of part of somebody's job

490
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:17,260
description and will actually pay them

491
00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:19,480
for it others it won't be part the job

492
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:21,010
description and this is more common it

493
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:23,620
will be something that people take on

494
00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:26,200
and kind of a volunteer capacity and

495
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:27,909
these approaches have pros and cons you

496
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:29,860
know obviously if you're able to make it

497
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:32,350
part of somebody's job description if

498
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:34,000
people are able to get paid for it then

499
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:36,490
that's really good in terms of

500
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:39,010
recruiting people it can be more

501
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:40,600
attractive to some people it's something

502
00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:42,070
that people feel more comfortable with

503
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,879
because it's part of their job

504
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:43,990
description

505
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,410
you know they know they're gonna have

506
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:49,540
the time for it it's something official

507
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:51,550
but they may not be intrinsically

508
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:52,870
motivated you know these are people who

509
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:55,210
are doing it because they're getting

510
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:56,500
paid because it's you know it's part of

511
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:59,050
their time is part of their job

512
00:20:56,500 --> 00:21:00,850
description so that's a good thing but

513
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:03,280
it has the limitations sometimes in

514
00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:05,980
terms of whether they genuinely want to

515
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:08,020
be doing it if you're not able to pay

516
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:09,880
people which is more common and if

517
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:12,129
you're asking people to volunteer for

518
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:14,110
this position then it can be harder to

519
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:16,720
recruit people but certainly not

520
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:19,629
impossible but the people that you do

521
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:21,490
get signing up to be champions are doing

522
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:23,770
it because they want to you know because

523
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:25,750
they're really motivated so engaging

524
00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:26,690
with those individuals and sort of

525
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:29,120
long-term rich

526
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:31,280
mention of those people is going to be

527
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:33,709
stronger so depending on your options

528
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:35,090
there's pros and cons and there's no

529
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:37,070
one-size-fits-all

530
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:39,020
there's no necessarily right or wrong

531
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:40,879
way of doing this it's just about

532
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:46,910
understanding what's right for you and

533
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:49,070
for your organization so in terms of

534
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:51,530
recruitment and actually establishing

535
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:53,659
the process from scratch that's pretty

536
00:21:51,530 --> 00:21:59,060
much it and you can find this on a wasp

537
00:21:53,660 --> 00:22:01,030
okay being heavily regulated in a

538
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:05,090
heavily regulated industry

539
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:07,820
you've got FCA gdpr PCI DSS yada yada

540
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:09,290
yada it's really really key for us to

541
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:12,200
make sure we're training people and

542
00:22:09,290 --> 00:22:14,000
giving awareness throughout the year and

543
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:17,540
what I've done is I've mandated that

544
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:19,400
information security actually does the

545
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:22,070
induction or as part of the initial

546
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:24,320
first-day induction that also puts an

547
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:27,409
emphasis on the importance of security

548
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:29,870
so you know within the morning within an

549
00:22:27,410 --> 00:22:33,200
hour these new recruits are engaging

550
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:35,449
with me and guess what this is a perfect

551
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:37,610
time for me to pitch so I talked about

552
00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:40,370
all the activities that we do as a

553
00:22:37,610 --> 00:22:42,169
collective and security I try and make

554
00:22:40,370 --> 00:22:46,280
it sound really interested in exciting

555
00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:48,020
and why I often get the end of that is

556
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:51,350
someone going come come I hear a little

557
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:55,430
bit more and that's my recruitment

558
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:56,929
process now to establish it obviously

559
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:59,540
I've got people who have been there for

560
00:22:56,930 --> 00:23:02,420
a while I spoke to senior management

561
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:05,389
they backed the idea I'd actually asked

562
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:08,180
some of the directors to become security

563
00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:10,340
champions some of those positions are

564
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:12,470
delegated or white did achieve was a

565
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:14,330
really good mix of people throughout the

566
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:17,360
business to represent each and every

567
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:19,909
department so you cannot walk into my

568
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:21,979
company without seeing a champion

569
00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:26,750
somewhere in one of the teams that you

570
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:29,960
can refer to so the first thing in terms

571
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:32,290
of identifying for me I like to go all

572
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:33,900
out so I have like I said somebody each

573
00:23:32,290 --> 00:23:36,960
department

574
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:39,179
and then defining the actual role what

575
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:42,150
what is it you are trying to achieve I

576
00:23:39,179 --> 00:23:44,370
always ask that question so sometimes

577
00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:45,990
people can have champions were champions

578
00:23:44,370 --> 00:23:47,639
sake but there's going to come a point

579
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:49,740
where you need to keep maintaining that

580
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:51,779
relationship and that interest so it's

581
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:54,090
really important to have your objectives

582
00:23:51,779 --> 00:23:55,650
set out in the terms of reference so

583
00:23:54,090 --> 00:23:57,959
people understand exactly what they're

584
00:23:55,650 --> 00:24:00,120
getting engage with their managers and

585
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:01,289
support them to do their jobs you get

586
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:03,239
them to understand that this is just

587
00:24:01,289 --> 00:24:05,309
part of their job and not additional

588
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:07,289
there's nobody wants extra work to do do

589
00:24:05,309 --> 00:24:10,710
they alright at least I don't know

590
00:24:07,289 --> 00:24:13,320
anyway and nominate the actual champions

591
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:15,539
as well so how do you identify them well

592
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:17,908
I've already mentioned recruiting but

593
00:24:15,539 --> 00:24:19,169
who do you talk to amongst all different

594
00:24:17,909 --> 00:24:21,480
peer groups so throughout the business

595
00:24:19,169 --> 00:24:23,429
that talk in that language who shows

596
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:25,080
more interest than was to engage with

597
00:24:23,429 --> 00:24:27,809
you are you having those conversations

598
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:29,520
with them to understand whether they

599
00:24:27,809 --> 00:24:31,260
want to join the team have you had

600
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:33,389
people apply for jobs and not been

601
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:37,049
successful those are also really good

602
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:38,789
candidates to look at and then you have

603
00:24:37,049 --> 00:24:40,740
to look at your communications channel

604
00:24:38,789 --> 00:24:42,240
because if I'm honest with you none of

605
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:45,000
this stuff is just straightforward and

606
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:46,710
easy okay everybody has a different job

607
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,600
to do they're working at different times

608
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:51,330
they prefer to communicate in different

609
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:56,908
ways and you have to kind of understand

610
00:24:51,330 --> 00:24:59,520
that so we use wiki's we use emails we

611
00:24:56,909 --> 00:25:01,470
use confluence pages we use all sorts of

612
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:03,658
different ways to communicate we also

613
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:06,870
have team meetings I'll do lunch and

614
00:25:03,659 --> 00:25:08,610
learns to be honest with you there's not

615
00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:10,199
much I wouldn't do for my champions

616
00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:12,979
because in showing that time and

617
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:15,929
commitment is really important to invest

618
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:19,140
as I've said about the wiki pages having

619
00:25:15,929 --> 00:25:20,520
a really strong knowledge base now you

620
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:22,260
may have people in your business that

621
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:24,779
want to become a champion but don't

622
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:26,549
necessarily have the confidence they

623
00:25:24,779 --> 00:25:28,610
think it's too technical I don't want to

624
00:25:26,549 --> 00:25:31,770
get involved I don't understand IT

625
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:33,209
actually try and simplify it for them

626
00:25:31,770 --> 00:25:35,970
and give them that confidence because

627
00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:38,370
what do you relieve them to do report

628
00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:41,250
back on any issues problem areas that

629
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:44,280
you want to target things that you want

630
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:45,990
to fix in the organization so try and

631
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:47,369
understand exactly what you're trying to

632
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:50,529
achieve

633
00:25:47,369 --> 00:25:52,629
and maintaining the interest so you do

634
00:25:50,529 --> 00:25:56,259
all the hard work and then you get to a

635
00:25:52,629 --> 00:25:57,369
point where it almost becomes boring and

636
00:25:56,259 --> 00:25:59,590
what you're gonna do that's have another

637
00:25:57,369 --> 00:26:01,840
champions mean again right who's found

638
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:02,889
the Bri or how many breaches in you try

639
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:06,939
and make it a little bit more dynamic

640
00:26:02,889 --> 00:26:08,979
and actually have your team become you

641
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:12,090
can have a little core team of champions

642
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:14,649
let them suggest what activities to do I

643
00:26:12,090 --> 00:26:18,249
do different things so I can bring

644
00:26:14,649 --> 00:26:19,869
champions to conferences they get

645
00:26:18,249 --> 00:26:21,190
involved with penetration test like I

646
00:26:19,869 --> 00:26:23,350
said and get them sitting amongst

647
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:25,239
different teams as well and we have a

648
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:27,820
different calendar of events so we bring

649
00:26:25,239 --> 00:26:29,409
in guest speakers you do learn from

650
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:31,359
those we do all different types of

651
00:26:29,409 --> 00:26:33,669
things just to keep up their level of

652
00:26:31,359 --> 00:26:35,049
interest and then ask them ask them if

653
00:26:33,669 --> 00:26:36,700
they getting bored ask them if they want

654
00:26:35,049 --> 00:26:38,230
to do something different and put it on

655
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:40,149
the table and just have that constant

656
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:45,940
two-way dialogue so you've got a really

657
00:26:40,149 --> 00:26:48,639
rich relationship so this isn't me by

658
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:52,389
the way these are the champions as I've

659
00:26:48,639 --> 00:26:54,189
said often you are finding people as

660
00:26:52,389 --> 00:26:56,379
champions who aren't gonna be

661
00:26:54,190 --> 00:27:00,009
financially rewarded for taking on this

662
00:26:56,379 --> 00:27:02,168
role and so then you're thinking about

663
00:27:00,009 --> 00:27:04,450
how to engage and motivate people who

664
00:27:02,169 --> 00:27:07,179
are taking on this responsibility on top

665
00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:09,460
of what they already do so you're

666
00:27:07,179 --> 00:27:12,519
looking for people who have an interest

667
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:14,409
in security I doing a lot of awareness

668
00:27:12,519 --> 00:27:16,929
raising for clients I often find people

669
00:27:14,409 --> 00:27:20,289
will come at the end of a session and

670
00:27:16,929 --> 00:27:21,820
ask questions about personal security so

671
00:27:20,289 --> 00:27:24,100
they'll ask me about you know they're

672
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:26,019
worried if they're Gmail's been hacked

673
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:27,340
if their instagrams been hacked they're

674
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:29,440
worried about their kids they're

675
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:32,949
wondering how they can stay safe at home

676
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:35,109
and these people are ideal for being

677
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:37,480
champions because they're individuals

678
00:27:35,109 --> 00:27:38,830
who you know they're not experts in

679
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:41,259
security that's not what you're looking

680
00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:43,389
for for a champion they're people who

681
00:27:41,259 --> 00:27:45,129
are motivated to find out more they're

682
00:27:43,389 --> 00:27:48,039
interested in finding out more and

683
00:27:45,129 --> 00:27:50,168
they've got an intrinsic reason for

684
00:27:48,039 --> 00:27:51,580
wanting to be a champion if you're a

685
00:27:50,169 --> 00:27:53,040
champion you know you're going to be

686
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:54,929
exposed as

687
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:57,060
said two more learning you're going to

688
00:27:54,930 --> 00:27:58,710
be finding out more about security and

689
00:27:57,060 --> 00:28:02,129
then you're able to take that way and

690
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:04,320
apply it at home so finding the people

691
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:06,510
who are interested in security for

692
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:08,189
whatever reason whether it is people who

693
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:10,440
are interested because of their personal

694
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:12,570
lives people who maybe are thinking

695
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:14,670
about transferring to security at some

696
00:28:12,570 --> 00:28:16,740
point in their career people who have

697
00:28:14,670 --> 00:28:18,270
been involved in incidents and they've

698
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:20,550
heard that eyes opened as to how

699
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:22,050
important the security is these are all

700
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:23,550
people who you may want to follow up

701
00:28:22,050 --> 00:28:26,250
with and say you know would you be

702
00:28:23,550 --> 00:28:28,260
interested in being a champion in having

703
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:30,150
this opportunity to learn a bit more and

704
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:33,690
get a bit more experience about cyber

705
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:36,000
security it's really important to keep

706
00:28:33,690 --> 00:28:38,130
people engaged as kevin has said to make

707
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,230
sure that people feel that they're

708
00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:43,020
rewarded that they're welcomed that

709
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:44,730
they're included I think we're in a

710
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:46,770
fantastic opportunity with cyber

711
00:28:44,730 --> 00:28:49,410
security in general and particularly

712
00:28:46,770 --> 00:28:52,020
with champions in the awareness of this

713
00:28:49,410 --> 00:28:53,820
subject has never been higher in the

714
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:56,690
news people are constantly being

715
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:59,820
confronted with stories of data breaches

716
00:28:56,690 --> 00:29:01,800
vulnerabilities you know cyber attacks

717
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:03,780
are happening on companies we're having

718
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:06,030
companies talk about this stuff more and

719
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:09,810
more internally with seeing

720
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:12,870
cybersecurity as you know subjects in

721
00:29:09,810 --> 00:29:14,850
mainstream TV programs and films so

722
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:17,070
people are aware of security in a way

723
00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:19,020
that they weren't even a few years ago

724
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:21,480
and this means that people are more

725
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:23,040
interested in it they just don't know

726
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:26,820
where to go don't know how to find out

727
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:29,040
more so try and tap into that higher

728
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:31,169
level of awareness and interest in

729
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:41,750
security by approaching people about

730
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:44,430
being champions there's a carrot okay so

731
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:46,470
how do you motivate these champions I

732
00:29:44,430 --> 00:29:48,150
think one of the most important things

733
00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:50,250
is just simply to thank them for their

734
00:29:48,150 --> 00:29:51,630
efforts because thanks goes a long way

735
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:53,490
for some people they don't need much

736
00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:55,410
more than that but a little bit of

737
00:29:53,490 --> 00:29:57,660
recognition for the efforts as well so

738
00:29:55,410 --> 00:29:59,370
send an email take the time outs just

739
00:29:57,660 --> 00:30:00,990
drop an email to their line managers and

740
00:29:59,370 --> 00:30:02,850
let them know their engagements been

741
00:30:00,990 --> 00:30:04,789
appreciated and it's actually done some

742
00:30:02,850 --> 00:30:07,939
good as well

743
00:30:04,789 --> 00:30:10,710
company recognition so Amazon vouchers

744
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:12,869
don't cost too much if you've got some

745
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:14,549
budget figure out some things on rewards

746
00:30:12,869 --> 00:30:16,590
that you can give to your champions I

747
00:30:14,549 --> 00:30:18,590
might be really interested here's some

748
00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:23,100
of the ideas that you guys have as well

749
00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:24,600
so giving away goodies and just having

750
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:26,519
that chat amongst themselves and

751
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:32,459
communicating issues that they have is

752
00:30:26,519 --> 00:30:34,889
also really really good really cool

753
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:37,320
thing actually I was over in the States

754
00:30:34,889 --> 00:30:39,240
last year and I went to a conference

755
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:42,090
that was all about kind of awareness

756
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:44,730
dickie in higher education in terms of

757
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:47,220
cybersecurity and I was trying to a guy

758
00:30:44,730 --> 00:30:49,320
there who runs a champion program for a

759
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:51,600
university it's the university in the

760
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:53,879
states that has a lot of money but what

761
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:57,418
they do was sounded really cool every

762
00:30:53,879 --> 00:31:00,449
quarter he sends out a box of kind of

763
00:30:57,419 --> 00:31:02,190
champion goodies to the champions and it

764
00:31:00,450 --> 00:31:03,690
has in the kind of stuff that Kevin was

765
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:06,899
talking about earlier you know like

766
00:31:03,690 --> 00:31:09,990
maybe a post or some Flyers of the

767
00:31:06,899 --> 00:31:11,610
latest kind of security messages some

768
00:31:09,990 --> 00:31:14,100
kind of giveaways and things that they

769
00:31:11,610 --> 00:31:16,350
want to distribute out the organization

770
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:19,799
so these get sent every quarter to the

771
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:21,330
champions and what this guy does to make

772
00:31:19,799 --> 00:31:22,889
it kind of a little bit more interesting

773
00:31:21,330 --> 00:31:25,408
he was a sort of larger-than-life

774
00:31:22,889 --> 00:31:28,229
character a lot of personality really

775
00:31:25,409 --> 00:31:31,919
fun guy and so he films videos of him

776
00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:34,200
packing up the box and puts them on the

777
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:36,179
kind of intranet for the champions to

778
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:38,039
see and he said that the champions

779
00:31:36,179 --> 00:31:40,169
respond really well to that that it's

780
00:31:38,039 --> 00:31:42,240
almost like Christmas every quarter

781
00:31:40,169 --> 00:31:44,159
where they get to see him like packing

782
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:47,279
up this box and like ah here's the next

783
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:49,529
poster it's going in and kind of making

784
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:51,299
it sort of a whole fun thing so they're

785
00:31:49,529 --> 00:31:53,279
amped and they're ready to receive this

786
00:31:51,299 --> 00:31:55,559
box full of goodies that there then

787
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:58,169
excited about distributing out to people

788
00:31:55,559 --> 00:31:59,720
so I think I think you also spoke about

789
00:31:58,169 --> 00:32:02,879
some really good stuff earlier about

790
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:05,460
bringing in external speakers kind of

791
00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:07,529
giving your champions and some exclusive

792
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:10,320
content if they're people who are

793
00:32:07,529 --> 00:32:11,730
interested in security then giving them

794
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:13,350
a little bit of extra learning is you

795
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:15,120
said bringing them along to a conference

796
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:17,909
asking them if they want

797
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:19,409
to maybe do a certification if they want

798
00:32:17,910 --> 00:32:21,360
to actually get a qualification in

799
00:32:19,410 --> 00:32:23,820
security and maybe you're able to

800
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:25,620
support them in that something that just

801
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:28,350
offers them a little bit of extra

802
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:30,870
learning and helps add to their CV their

803
00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:32,879
professional development or support them

804
00:32:30,870 --> 00:32:35,100
in security at home I think there are

805
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:36,990
all great ways Sally and I think one of

806
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:39,149
the other things is not to forget

807
00:32:36,990 --> 00:32:41,970
exactly what you want these champions to

808
00:32:39,150 --> 00:32:44,040
achieve for you so share the successes

809
00:32:41,970 --> 00:32:45,960
of what you're asking them to do if

810
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:48,270
you've had a reduction in in breach

811
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:50,309
notifications or report or an increase

812
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:52,320
in reported fishes because people are

813
00:32:50,309 --> 00:32:53,879
taking more notice of the emails and

814
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:55,139
tell them that let them know they're

815
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:56,670
actually making a difference because

816
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:58,710
that's why they're with you in the first

817
00:32:56,670 --> 00:33:00,450
place so I think that's really yeah I

818
00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:02,580
think that's actually the most important

819
00:33:00,450 --> 00:33:03,840
point because champions are gonna be

820
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:06,689
people that want to have a positive

821
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:08,459
impact and so being able to communicate

822
00:33:06,690 --> 00:33:10,410
them to them that they're achieving that

823
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:11,850
is gonna be one of the most important

824
00:33:10,410 --> 00:33:14,340
things of actually keeping them engaged

825
00:33:11,850 --> 00:33:16,169
we're all busy people and you're

826
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:19,350
champions knowing that actually them

827
00:33:16,170 --> 00:33:21,390
spending the time committing to this is

828
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:23,129
actually working then I think what

829
00:33:21,390 --> 00:33:25,500
better reward can you give them but than

830
00:33:23,130 --> 00:33:28,500
that I've seen some other organizations

831
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:30,120
do kind of special champion mascots and

832
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:33,420
they've had the champions like pick the

833
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:35,149
mascot themselves and then that mascot

834
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:38,520
will go on to like mugs t-shirts

835
00:33:35,150 --> 00:33:40,050
whatever it might be stickers and that's

836
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:42,960
like a fun way of kind of building up

837
00:33:40,050 --> 00:33:45,750
that team dynamic I guess so goodies are

838
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:48,059
a good thing but I think the rewards in

839
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:49,710
terms of achievement and in terms of

840
00:33:48,059 --> 00:33:51,240
feedback to people's line managers

841
00:33:49,710 --> 00:33:55,710
that's probably going to be even more

842
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:58,080
effective than goodies so speaking of

843
00:33:55,710 --> 00:34:00,360
being effective how do you measure

844
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:02,189
whether the champions are working

845
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:04,260
whether it's a successful thing to do

846
00:34:02,190 --> 00:34:06,090
because obviously this is gonna be

847
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:08,310
taking up your time it's gonna be taking

848
00:34:06,090 --> 00:34:09,509
up their time and people always want to

849
00:34:08,310 --> 00:34:12,750
know you know how are we measuring

850
00:34:09,510 --> 00:34:14,730
security and what's actually working one

851
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:17,070
of the key things to do of course is

852
00:34:14,730 --> 00:34:18,330
checking in with your champions making

853
00:34:17,070 --> 00:34:20,730
sure you're trying to have regular

854
00:34:18,330 --> 00:34:22,560
conversations with them it keeps them

855
00:34:20,730 --> 00:34:24,030
interested but also it's a way of

856
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:26,850
hearing back from them what's working

857
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:28,030
what's not what support they need that

858
00:34:26,850 --> 00:34:31,960
maybe you're not provide

859
00:34:28,030 --> 00:34:34,240
at that time also when you have a

860
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:36,340
Champions program as Kevin said earlier

861
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:37,870
it's thinking about what behaviors in

862
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:40,060
the organization do you want to

863
00:34:37,870 --> 00:34:41,710
influence if you identify those

864
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:44,020
behaviors and then you shape your

865
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:46,210
communications around those I would

866
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:48,159
highly recommend doing a measurement of

867
00:34:46,210 --> 00:34:50,230
those behaviors before the champion

868
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:52,150
program starts or before they start

869
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:54,790
concentrating on your particular issues

870
00:34:52,150 --> 00:34:57,160
and then do a measurement after it's

871
00:34:54,790 --> 00:34:58,570
been rolling for sometime so thinking

872
00:34:57,160 --> 00:35:00,490
about the behaviors you want to see

873
00:34:58,570 --> 00:35:02,620
change and then measuring whether that

874
00:35:00,490 --> 00:35:05,080
actually happens is going to be the best

875
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:06,609
ways of getting that feedback there's

876
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:08,680
lots of different ways people often

877
00:35:06,610 --> 00:35:10,450
think kind of the human side awareness

878
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:12,609
behavior culture that's really hard to

879
00:35:10,450 --> 00:35:14,290
measure and that's not true that's a

880
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:16,090
myth there are lots of things you can do

881
00:35:14,290 --> 00:35:17,590
to measure whether your awareness

882
00:35:16,090 --> 00:35:19,780
initiatives are working whether

883
00:35:17,590 --> 00:35:22,090
behavioral change is happening whether

884
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:24,580
you're developing a more successful

885
00:35:22,090 --> 00:35:26,050
security culture there's plenty of

886
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:28,480
things out there that you can do if you

887
00:35:26,050 --> 00:35:30,130
want to talk to me about how we do that

888
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:33,490
scientist and I'm happy to talk about

889
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:35,080
that after this presentation but other

890
00:35:33,490 --> 00:35:37,330
things you can do of course is if it

891
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:39,759
you're incident reporting if you see

892
00:35:37,330 --> 00:35:42,069
your incident reports go up after you've

893
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:44,980
started a champions program then I would

894
00:35:42,070 --> 00:35:46,480
say that's a really good sign it's not

895
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:49,050
that you're having more incidents of

896
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:51,160
course it is that the champions are

897
00:35:49,050 --> 00:35:53,380
facilitating the feeding back of those

898
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:55,149
incidents what you're seeing is a

899
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:57,880
positive change in your culture where

900
00:35:55,150 --> 00:36:00,100
people feel more able to identify

901
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:08,280
incidents or more able to report them

902
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:10,480
and that's really effective pitfalls so

903
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:17,200
does anyone remember this game on my

904
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:19,090
show my age actually bought an Atari the

905
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:21,009
other day an old one penny me that's

906
00:36:19,090 --> 00:36:25,090
something different there are lots of

907
00:36:21,010 --> 00:36:27,160
pitfalls with this and just goes that

908
00:36:25,090 --> 00:36:28,870
suggests his comment about value for

909
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:30,580
money and benchmarking and showing

910
00:36:28,870 --> 00:36:32,569
exactly what the attractiveness of a

911
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:34,160
team is really important

912
00:36:32,570 --> 00:36:35,510
definitely try and catch up with Jess

913
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:37,040
about that because we've done the

914
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:39,800
benchmarking exercise which is fantastic

915
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:41,840
I could then give that report to the

916
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:43,610
exec and they know exactly what value

917
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:47,860
they're getting out of the business all

918
00:36:43,610 --> 00:36:47,860
right but in terms of engagement

919
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:52,370
checking with them regularly I literally

920
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:54,350
have a list of all my champions and I

921
00:36:52,370 --> 00:36:55,549
make a point of contacting each and

922
00:36:54,350 --> 00:36:58,460
every one of them face to face

923
00:36:55,550 --> 00:36:59,830
each month if I can I do my best just to

924
00:36:58,460 --> 00:37:02,840
do that

925
00:36:59,830 --> 00:37:05,000
they're too busy to engage and

926
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:06,530
everybody's got a day job how can you

927
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,480
build in what you're asking them to do

928
00:37:06,530 --> 00:37:11,540
as part of their role and an additional

929
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:13,340
thing so you can avoid that if you just

930
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:16,490
give them a little bit of your time

931
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:18,620
and if they're too overwhelmed well why

932
00:37:16,490 --> 00:37:20,419
are they overwhelmed what can you do to

933
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:22,069
reduce their stress maybe it's not right

934
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:24,080
for them maybe their jobs pressuring

935
00:37:22,070 --> 00:37:26,570
them or maybe what you're asking them to

936
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:28,700
do is way beyond and above what they're

937
00:37:26,570 --> 00:37:31,840
capable of doing so ensure that you're

938
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:34,640
measuring that as well

939
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:37,130
unable to answer questions is one of the

940
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:39,529
things I always get soon as I recruit a

941
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:41,290
champion they say to me well how am I

942
00:37:39,530 --> 00:37:43,640
going to answer technical questions a

943
00:37:41,290 --> 00:37:46,820
question for you is is it their job to

944
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:49,279
do that maybe it isn't but if you do

945
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:50,960
want them to what are you giving them so

946
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:53,810
I give them a confluence page for

947
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:55,610
example they can refer to it or I just

948
00:37:53,810 --> 00:37:57,560
say direct it to my team you don't have

949
00:37:55,610 --> 00:37:59,570
to answer everything we'll don't be

950
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:02,270
pressured you can park what you've been

951
00:37:59,570 --> 00:38:04,280
asked and then ask me later on and I'll

952
00:38:02,270 --> 00:38:07,120
answer it for you so you just take that

953
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:10,640
pressure off them just a little bit

954
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:13,040
champions acting like police I mean it

955
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:14,210
does anyone have an issue with champions

956
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:16,070
trying to throw their weight around the

957
00:38:14,210 --> 00:38:17,900
new organization I can't put my hand

958
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:19,640
though because I don't you you dude can

959
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:23,930
you share your example do you care to do

960
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:26,029
that you are not but you can understand

961
00:38:23,930 --> 00:38:28,399
how power can go to someone's head all

962
00:38:26,030 --> 00:38:29,840
right so it's just important to make

963
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:34,040
sure you're dealing with that from the

964
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:35,870
outset and you yourself if you run the

965
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:38,960
champions program like I do being

966
00:38:35,870 --> 00:38:40,370
overwhelmed with questions now if I

967
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:41,420
stick my head above the parapet and put

968
00:38:40,370 --> 00:38:43,040
my hand up and say I want to build

969
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:45,770
champions that's part of the job right

970
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:47,900
it's what I've signed up to

971
00:38:45,770 --> 00:38:50,030
but you can put things in place to help

972
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:52,850
myself like as I go back to a wiki or

973
00:38:50,030 --> 00:38:54,740
asking your team to help you out so you

974
00:38:52,850 --> 00:38:56,990
don't have to be the person that they

975
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:58,220
link in with all the time sometimes it's

976
00:38:56,990 --> 00:39:00,229
gonna be the seaso because I'm not

977
00:38:58,220 --> 00:39:02,359
around but make sure they've got someone

978
00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:04,700
to go to all the time if they need to

979
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:06,290
contact your team I think also having

980
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:07,819
them and I know this is something you do

981
00:39:06,290 --> 00:39:09,920
is having them as a network where they

982
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:11,990
can support each other so that they're

983
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:14,180
not always coming to you with their

984
00:39:11,990 --> 00:39:15,680
questions actually if they're getting a

985
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:17,870
question that they know someone else

986
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:19,700
another champion has had then they can

987
00:39:17,870 --> 00:39:20,380
reach out to each other communicate with

988
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:22,879
each other

989
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:24,650
independently of you that can take some

990
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:26,810
of the pressure off you to always be the

991
00:39:24,650 --> 00:39:28,430
one that they're coming to and having

992
00:39:26,810 --> 00:39:30,020
that mesh network so like I said getting

993
00:39:28,430 --> 00:39:33,859
the guys to sit with the pentest crew

994
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:35,450
the sock the physical security team get

995
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:36,830
those relationships established so they

996
00:39:35,450 --> 00:39:38,299
don't have to come to you if it's a

997
00:39:36,830 --> 00:39:40,220
physical issue they go to the physical

998
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:44,300
security guys and so on it's quite

999
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:46,009
simple so before we go to questions and

1000
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:48,020
I'm gonna warn you I've actually got a

1001
00:39:46,010 --> 00:39:50,300
question for all of you as well but

1002
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:51,590
before we get to that we just want to

1003
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:54,170
summarize what we've been talking about

1004
00:39:51,590 --> 00:39:55,940
today if you are running a Champions

1005
00:39:54,170 --> 00:39:57,860
program or if you're thinking about

1006
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:59,900
running one these were the key things

1007
00:39:57,860 --> 00:40:02,420
that we wanted you to kind of take away

1008
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:03,980
and think about planning and preparation

1009
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:06,200
is really important

1010
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:08,510
some people have spoken to me about

1011
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:10,669
champions program and they kind of think

1012
00:40:08,510 --> 00:40:12,140
it's like a silver bullet and it's not

1013
00:40:10,670 --> 00:40:14,150
that at all as Kevin said you know it

1014
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:16,819
does take hard work and it's gonna take

1015
00:40:14,150 --> 00:40:19,520
time for you to develop and turn into a

1016
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:21,380
success the more you plan the more

1017
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:23,780
you're able to you know think about the

1018
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:25,820
logistics of how it's gonna work the

1019
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:28,130
more you're able to prepare the more

1020
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:30,350
successful it will be so spend some time

1021
00:40:28,130 --> 00:40:32,900
upfront thinking about that thinking

1022
00:40:30,350 --> 00:40:35,210
about your organization also being

1023
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:36,920
really realistic about your time and how

1024
00:40:35,210 --> 00:40:39,140
much time you're going to be able to

1025
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:40,970
commit to this that's a really important

1026
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:45,170
thing to be honest about with yourself

1027
00:40:40,970 --> 00:40:47,149
up front as Kevin said motivation you

1028
00:40:45,170 --> 00:40:49,550
know how you motivate people what the

1029
00:40:47,150 --> 00:40:51,800
currents going to be because this is not

1030
00:40:49,550 --> 00:40:53,840
the kind of situation where a stick is

1031
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:55,230
gonna work you're not going to be able

1032
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:57,270
to really have a go

1033
00:40:55,230 --> 00:40:59,430
you're champions especially if they're

1034
00:40:57,270 --> 00:41:01,619
volunteers so you need to think about

1035
00:40:59,430 --> 00:41:03,690
actually what can you do to keep them

1036
00:41:01,619 --> 00:41:05,970
engaged how can you motivate them and

1037
00:41:03,690 --> 00:41:07,380
actually as Kevin said earlier one of

1038
00:41:05,970 --> 00:41:09,480
the most successful things with that is

1039
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:12,060
asking them what do they want why are

1040
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:13,740
they being a champion so what can you do

1041
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:16,049
to make sure that you reward them and

1042
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:17,669
keep them happy and also how are you

1043
00:41:16,050 --> 00:41:20,310
gonna measure it how are you gonna be

1044
00:41:17,670 --> 00:41:22,619
able to answer to the seaso or the board

1045
00:41:20,310 --> 00:41:24,390
or whoever it might be the rest of your

1046
00:41:22,619 --> 00:41:25,380
team as to whether this is actually

1047
00:41:24,390 --> 00:41:27,450
working

1048
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:29,940
think about your metrics and thinking

1049
00:41:27,450 --> 00:41:33,118
about that upfront means you can start

1050
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:36,150
measuring from the beginning no

1051
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:38,760
one-size-fits-all so Kevin's been able

1052
00:41:36,150 --> 00:41:40,890
to talk about the case study that he has

1053
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:42,750
in terms of Hargreaves Lansdown I've

1054
00:41:40,890 --> 00:41:45,420
seen lots of different approaches to

1055
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:47,580
this that for me is a really big benefit

1056
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:49,410
that no matter what organization you're

1057
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:51,359
dealing with there's gonna be a way of

1058
00:41:49,410 --> 00:41:54,390
tackling this that will be successful

1059
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:56,580
for you and it's a great way of scaling

1060
00:41:54,390 --> 00:41:59,009
up of reinforcing your efforts and of

1061
00:41:56,580 --> 00:42:00,600
trying to positively influence the

1062
00:41:59,010 --> 00:42:03,900
culture that you have around security

1063
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:05,940
it's also a chance to listen and this is

1064
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:08,850
something I mentioned Club C so earlier

1065
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:10,109
so I speak a lot with CISOs and it's

1066
00:42:08,850 --> 00:42:12,690
something that CISOs have been

1067
00:42:10,109 --> 00:42:15,090
increasingly saying to me they recognize

1068
00:42:12,690 --> 00:42:17,580
that security is no longer just about

1069
00:42:15,090 --> 00:42:20,609
telling people what to do that approach

1070
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:22,859
doesn't work we need to listen much more

1071
00:42:20,609 --> 00:42:24,569
than we talk and this is a really

1072
00:42:22,859 --> 00:42:27,390
effective way of being able to listen to

1073
00:42:24,570 --> 00:42:29,580
the business so they for us were the key

1074
00:42:27,390 --> 00:42:31,310
points about what we were trying to

1075
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:34,170
convey in terms of the champion program

1076
00:42:31,310 --> 00:42:36,660
we're really happy to take questions now

1077
00:42:34,170 --> 00:42:39,210
but I wanted to kick it off by asking a

1078
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:42,390
question of all of you so I was recently

1079
00:42:39,210 --> 00:42:44,670
speaking to the CEO of a really large

1080
00:42:42,390 --> 00:42:47,730
global company and this is a company

1081
00:42:44,670 --> 00:42:49,740
that wants to have more of a positive

1082
00:42:47,730 --> 00:42:51,600
impact in the community around them

1083
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:54,299
they're really aware of their corporate

1084
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:56,609
social responsibility and as a security

1085
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:58,830
team they have lots of money and they're

1086
00:42:56,609 --> 00:43:01,410
able to do some really cool stuff but

1087
00:42:58,830 --> 00:43:02,850
they're aware that you know the area

1088
00:43:01,410 --> 00:43:04,359
around them geographically the

1089
00:43:02,850 --> 00:43:05,799
organizations around them

1090
00:43:04,359 --> 00:43:08,650
don't have the same budget that they do

1091
00:43:05,799 --> 00:43:10,630
so they were asking me what can we do if

1092
00:43:08,650 --> 00:43:12,430
we're a company with a healthy budget

1093
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:14,759
and we're able to do loads of cool stuff

1094
00:43:12,430 --> 00:43:17,739
with security what can we do to have

1095
00:43:14,759 --> 00:43:19,599
outreach beyond this company what can we

1096
00:43:17,739 --> 00:43:23,019
do to actually be positive in the

1097
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:25,839
community and I thought what better than

1098
00:43:23,019 --> 00:43:27,368
a cross company champion program so we

1099
00:43:25,839 --> 00:43:29,170
always think about champions program or

1100
00:43:27,369 --> 00:43:31,869
I've always come across them where

1101
00:43:29,170 --> 00:43:33,430
they've been internal to a company where

1102
00:43:31,869 --> 00:43:35,910
it's been thinking about positively

1103
00:43:33,430 --> 00:43:38,618
influencing the security culture in that

1104
00:43:35,910 --> 00:43:40,989
organization but can we think about a

1105
00:43:38,619 --> 00:43:43,079
champions program that works across

1106
00:43:40,989 --> 00:43:46,180
companies so we're able to actually

1107
00:43:43,079 --> 00:43:48,700
scale up what we're trying to do so it's

1108
00:43:46,180 --> 00:43:50,440
not just about making one organization's

1109
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:52,569
safer and more secure which is of course

1110
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:55,269
a good thing but what can we do to

1111
00:43:52,569 --> 00:43:58,150
actually make many companies many

1112
00:43:55,269 --> 00:44:00,189
organizations more secure and so I was

1113
00:43:58,150 --> 00:44:03,279
interested whether people think that

1114
00:44:00,190 --> 00:44:04,809
could work if you think it could or it

1115
00:44:03,279 --> 00:44:07,239
couldn't I'd love to know your opinions

1116
00:44:04,809 --> 00:44:09,549
on it if you are interested in trying to

1117
00:44:07,239 --> 00:44:11,410
develop something like that then please

1118
00:44:09,549 --> 00:44:13,569
do reach out you know either speak up

1119
00:44:11,410 --> 00:44:16,569
now or come and find me after find me on

1120
00:44:13,569 --> 00:44:18,099
Twitter email me whatever it is but I'd

1121
00:44:16,569 --> 00:44:20,980
love to talk to people about maybe

1122
00:44:18,099 --> 00:44:22,690
trying to develop something like that so

1123
00:44:20,980 --> 00:44:24,789
happy to take opinions comments

1124
00:44:22,690 --> 00:44:29,589
questions on that or on anything that

1125
00:44:24,789 --> 00:44:31,539
we've spoken about today cool do we have

1126
00:44:29,589 --> 00:44:36,700
yeah we have a question at the front I

1127
00:44:31,539 --> 00:44:39,339
think there's a mic so often there are

1128
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:43,960
suggestions on the crowd I would imagine

1129
00:44:39,339 --> 00:44:46,328
that cross company can work but my goal

1130
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:49,089
is that the company into the community

1131
00:44:46,329 --> 00:44:51,309
first because there's less potential

1132
00:44:49,089 --> 00:44:54,849
cause with publishers that would be I

1133
00:44:51,309 --> 00:44:57,549
mean my what was going to have a tour

1134
00:44:54,849 --> 00:44:59,140
extent do you hazard speaker that in

1135
00:44:57,549 --> 00:45:02,170
your experience have there been any

1136
00:44:59,140 --> 00:45:04,150
problems about giving the access to the

1137
00:45:02,170 --> 00:45:07,750
champions government how do I deal with

1138
00:45:04,150 --> 00:45:13,250
it somebody that you don't want them

1139
00:45:07,750 --> 00:45:13,250
[Laughter]

1140
00:45:14,130 --> 00:45:19,230
it's not a challenge I've had and I'm

1141
00:45:16,770 --> 00:45:21,480
quite clear in my mindset why I want to

1142
00:45:19,230 --> 00:45:24,270
achieve so from the data everybody

1143
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:26,940
understands where they are so I tend to

1144
00:45:24,270 --> 00:45:29,820
have quite good successes with champions

1145
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:32,610
I think the key thing is to set out your

1146
00:45:29,820 --> 00:45:34,740
store formerly doors if you're not clear

1147
00:45:32,610 --> 00:45:36,570
in terms of the agenda I make everything

1148
00:45:34,740 --> 00:45:38,669
formal there's a terms of reference

1149
00:45:36,570 --> 00:45:40,530
everybody knows what to expect

1150
00:45:38,670 --> 00:45:42,210
ok so this isn't just a little thing

1151
00:45:40,530 --> 00:45:43,650
that I'm doing on the side and everybody

1152
00:45:42,210 --> 00:45:46,290
comes for a little bit of a sandwich and

1153
00:45:43,650 --> 00:45:48,420
a child cake that's not gonna cut it no

1154
00:45:46,290 --> 00:45:50,580
my environment is very heavily regulated

1155
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:53,280
so when I have my auditors come in

1156
00:45:50,580 --> 00:45:55,380
whether is ISO PCI I want to demonstrate

1157
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:57,600
that actually we're adhering and we're

1158
00:45:55,380 --> 00:46:01,260
very compliant by giving extra awareness

1159
00:45:57,600 --> 00:46:03,270
training so metrics are built in like I

1160
00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:05,220
said doing a cultural assessment to show

1161
00:46:03,270 --> 00:46:07,140
benchmarking where you were before to

1162
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:08,970
where you're trying to get to all those

1163
00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:10,170
things should be concentrated on and as

1164
00:46:08,970 --> 00:46:12,930
long as there's a really strong focus

1165
00:46:10,170 --> 00:46:16,590
and you don't just onboard anybody who

1166
00:46:12,930 --> 00:46:18,270
don't be desperate I think if you've got

1167
00:46:16,590 --> 00:46:19,740
four people wanted to be a champion you

1168
00:46:18,270 --> 00:46:21,300
know trying to get to a hundred do you

1169
00:46:19,740 --> 00:46:23,490
know what they're gonna deliver a lot

1170
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:25,320
more value for you with those four

1171
00:46:23,490 --> 00:46:27,120
people if you concentrate all you have

1172
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:29,190
on them than having on you know the

1173
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:30,750
other ninety six idiots in there running

1174
00:46:29,190 --> 00:46:32,190
around so I think it's just really

1175
00:46:30,750 --> 00:46:34,530
important to set your stall out and be

1176
00:46:32,190 --> 00:46:35,850
really clear yeah I completely agree I

1177
00:46:34,530 --> 00:46:38,130
think this is where the preparation

1178
00:46:35,850 --> 00:46:39,750
point is really important in a launching

1179
00:46:38,130 --> 00:46:41,310
a champion program without having an

1180
00:46:39,750 --> 00:46:43,680
idea of what you're trying to do what

1181
00:46:41,310 --> 00:46:45,900
you want from the champions if it's very

1182
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:47,580
vague and open that's more likely to

1183
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:49,890
lead to that kind of confusion about

1184
00:46:47,580 --> 00:46:51,480
what the role looks like and people may

1185
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:53,190
be delivering in a way that you didn't

1186
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:55,080
have in mind but if you put in the

1187
00:46:53,190 --> 00:46:56,580
preparation at the start of this is what

1188
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:59,009
the role is this is what it looks like

1189
00:46:56,580 --> 00:47:01,700
here's the terms of reference do you

1190
00:46:59,010 --> 00:47:04,260
sign up to that you are not the police

1191
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:06,960
yeah that's thinking that for me is the

1192
00:47:04,260 --> 00:47:08,610
key thing upfront and then you find that

1193
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:10,140
the people who engage with that are the

1194
00:47:08,610 --> 00:47:12,540
kind of champions that you're looking

1195
00:47:10,140 --> 00:47:14,790
for one last word is just to lead by

1196
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:17,190
example so set the example to follow

1197
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:18,210
because they're doing something that you

1198
00:47:17,190 --> 00:47:26,580
don't have a blue

1199
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:27,270
for necessarily sister question Oh mr.

1200
00:47:26,580 --> 00:47:38,098
Mike on please

1201
00:47:27,270 --> 00:47:39,509
that's the only fire engines and

1202
00:47:38,099 --> 00:47:41,460
therefore necessary services at what

1203
00:47:39,510 --> 00:47:43,830
level you have informative easily for

1204
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:47,369
themselves experience I'd like to you I

1205
00:47:43,830 --> 00:47:51,960
hope these regards for you Maya Pina the

1206
00:47:47,369 --> 00:47:54,619
Fox Company possible anywheres but as I

1207
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:56,880
think your your two primary barriers I

1208
00:47:54,619 --> 00:48:00,930
think one was touch with obesity my

1209
00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:02,490
hands for me but one needs I would

1210
00:48:00,930 --> 00:48:05,460
expect her soul are these issues they're

1211
00:48:02,490 --> 00:48:06,959
sweet heels for this versus tooth and

1212
00:48:05,460 --> 00:48:08,460
outsider looking at business pasta

1213
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:10,080
teases us to do there's legend uncle

1214
00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:11,700
dentist name of mother so they're gonna

1215
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:14,069
look at you is absolutely actually

1216
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:16,379
pursuing as opposed to cocaine surely

1217
00:48:14,070 --> 00:48:19,410
they don't have that I think you saw by

1218
00:48:16,380 --> 00:48:21,720
the community happy day architect west

1219
00:48:19,410 --> 00:48:23,609
coast's but the other one this is the

1220
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:25,649
one where highly disturbing awareness

1221
00:48:23,609 --> 00:48:28,730
name is most likely GDP honor this

1222
00:48:25,650 --> 00:48:31,710
negative is there a way to lose your

1223
00:48:28,730 --> 00:48:34,710
costume that's at least a lot even think

1224
00:48:31,710 --> 00:48:38,599
I do too when initiatives but beat

1225
00:48:34,710 --> 00:48:41,190
Maskull is you can't pedal see Tommy

1226
00:48:38,599 --> 00:48:44,040
effectively not such as long engines and

1227
00:48:41,190 --> 00:48:46,890
explosion years longer terms of effort

1228
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:48,990
cetera Ethier in so you gotta focus in

1229
00:48:46,890 --> 00:48:51,930
here people not necessarily useful often

1230
00:48:48,990 --> 00:48:53,640
Susan needs a new server to okay thank

1231
00:48:51,930 --> 00:48:56,940
you I appreciate every good points for

1232
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:59,640
true yes is the points really in terms

1233
00:48:56,940 --> 00:49:01,800
of sharing this region particular

1234
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:04,920
incidence and even particles cultural

1235
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:06,200
teeny particles particularly in supply

1236
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:09,000
mastectomy

1237
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:10,890
however I do you think the particular

1238
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:13,109
industry sort of third sector challenges

1239
00:49:10,890 --> 00:49:15,180
well mr. football run internal to engage

1240
00:49:13,109 --> 00:49:16,770
in that space because it's like general

1241
00:49:15,180 --> 00:49:18,990
operated since is horses and I already

1242
00:49:16,770 --> 00:49:19,960
do a lot of collaboration report in

1243
00:49:18,990 --> 00:49:24,910
other areas of there

1244
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:28,650
so it may be much more likely to get

1245
00:49:24,910 --> 00:49:31,839
that talkative kind of approach each

1246
00:49:28,650 --> 00:49:33,310
dress thank you yeah I appreciate that

1247
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:36,100
that probably makes more sense keeping

1248
00:49:33,310 --> 00:49:37,480
it sector specific in terms of the kind

1249
00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:40,529
of threat landscape and everything like

1250
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:43,120
that so yeah I appreciate that thank you

1251
00:49:40,530 --> 00:49:50,200
we have another question or comments

1252
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:52,029
here if you guys have any advice to come

1253
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:55,000
out sort of chocolatey where they

1254
00:49:52,030 --> 00:49:57,610
deferred into in terms of program or

1255
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:59,890
formalize it may be wrong but you found

1256
00:49:57,610 --> 00:50:02,530
that in your company there chat we both

1257
00:49:59,890 --> 00:50:04,569
say base protection champions health and

1258
00:50:02,530 --> 00:50:07,630
safety quite engagement so should that

1259
00:50:04,570 --> 00:50:18,220
knew there was a general perception that

1260
00:50:07,630 --> 00:50:20,640
an attack she may be necessarily yeah so

1261
00:50:18,220 --> 00:50:24,580
I have come across this challenge in

1262
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:27,069
previous life so a suggestion was made I

1263
00:50:24,580 --> 00:50:29,319
want though I had my security champions

1264
00:50:27,070 --> 00:50:30,760
and there were also risk champions then

1265
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:32,800
the Ford guys wanted to get four

1266
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:34,060
champions as well is just a champion

1267
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:36,550
overload really isn't it

1268
00:50:34,060 --> 00:50:38,650
so actually what we did is we sat down

1269
00:50:36,550 --> 00:50:41,380
and that what would it feel like the

1270
00:50:38,650 --> 00:50:44,830
core competencies and actually we were

1271
00:50:41,380 --> 00:50:46,060
able to merge the groups together and I

1272
00:50:44,830 --> 00:50:47,710
didn't think that's got to be possible

1273
00:50:46,060 --> 00:50:49,870
in every single organization it just

1274
00:50:47,710 --> 00:50:51,760
depends on the dynamics but it is

1275
00:50:49,870 --> 00:50:53,770
possible to have those conversations to

1276
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:56,560
see if you can actually get some mutual

1277
00:50:53,770 --> 00:50:57,910
gains so maybe try that approach yeah

1278
00:50:56,560 --> 00:50:59,680
I'm seeing that happening in another

1279
00:50:57,910 --> 00:51:01,870
organization right now where they

1280
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:03,220
currently have in a date of protection

1281
00:51:01,870 --> 00:51:04,990
champions and they're thinking about

1282
00:51:03,220 --> 00:51:06,939
broadening that outer security so

1283
00:51:04,990 --> 00:51:09,490
they're having those conversations right

1284
00:51:06,940 --> 00:51:11,560
now and I think that's all you can do is

1285
00:51:09,490 --> 00:51:13,689
try and really discuss well what are the

1286
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:15,549
aims what the objectives what are we

1287
00:51:13,690 --> 00:51:17,710
trying to achieve here and can we

1288
00:51:15,550 --> 00:51:19,750
collaborate on this rather than yeah

1289
00:51:17,710 --> 00:51:21,640
having a champ everyone was a champion

1290
00:51:19,750 --> 00:51:27,160
for something or the same people or all

1291
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:29,410
champions for everything do we have any

1292
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:31,649
other questions or comments

1293
00:51:29,410 --> 00:51:40,029
we have another wall at the front

1294
00:51:31,650 --> 00:51:42,940
doesn't like that's on its way so to

1295
00:51:40,030 --> 00:51:45,420
what extent to heaven see our new

1296
00:51:42,940 --> 00:51:47,410
champions Bourbons with actual

1297
00:51:45,420 --> 00:51:49,650
organizational structures for

1298
00:51:47,410 --> 00:51:52,240
information security and within

1299
00:51:49,650 --> 00:51:54,310
different business units very common

1300
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:56,740
would you have the champion work

1301
00:51:54,310 --> 00:52:00,000
alongside security officer in that

1302
00:51:56,740 --> 00:52:03,310
business unit and the other one is

1303
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:04,950
related to debt how does this relates to

1304
00:52:03,310 --> 00:52:06,850
a DevOps

1305
00:52:04,950 --> 00:52:08,500
environment where you're trying to get

1306
00:52:06,850 --> 00:52:12,880
there developers would be more secure

1307
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:15,520
who or monthly yeah so I'm gonna free

1308
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:18,520
plug a couple of things secure warrior

1309
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:20,800
an immersive labs I think those guys

1310
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:22,690
have a really good tools in terms of

1311
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:24,250
engaging developers and having that

1312
00:52:22,690 --> 00:52:26,650
language I didn't think it would be

1313
00:52:24,250 --> 00:52:28,300
appropriate for that for champions

1314
00:52:26,650 --> 00:52:31,150
necessarily unless they're already

1315
00:52:28,300 --> 00:52:32,980
developers and they understand to be

1316
00:52:31,150 --> 00:52:35,200
chucked into the why pull the lion's den

1317
00:52:32,980 --> 00:52:37,270
because I know a developers can be like

1318
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:39,939
right very passionate fantastic

1319
00:52:37,270 --> 00:52:53,740
creatures and could you just remind me

1320
00:52:39,940 --> 00:52:55,630
your first question again yeah we don't

1321
00:52:53,740 --> 00:52:57,399
really have it in that way so in terms

1322
00:52:55,630 --> 00:52:58,300
of what I do at h-hour I don't align it

1323
00:52:57,400 --> 00:53:01,030
in that way because we don't have

1324
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:03,640
security officers in that kind of makeup

1325
00:53:01,030 --> 00:53:05,770
but like I said what we do do or I have

1326
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:08,049
deliberately done is I've reached out to

1327
00:53:05,770 --> 00:53:11,620
the management / Department whether it's

1328
00:53:08,050 --> 00:53:15,430
HR marketing finance etc and I will

1329
00:53:11,620 --> 00:53:17,799
place all have nominated somebody who is

1330
00:53:15,430 --> 00:53:20,890
interested in doing it so I don't think

1331
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:23,140
is about making people do something is

1332
00:53:20,890 --> 00:53:25,660
about making them want to so a lot of my

1333
00:53:23,140 --> 00:53:27,970
job is about selling the the role to

1334
00:53:25,660 --> 00:53:29,379
them and trying to align it to exactly

1335
00:53:27,970 --> 00:53:31,629
what they're doing in that discipline

1336
00:53:29,380 --> 00:53:33,400
whether it is finance or marketing that

1337
00:53:31,630 --> 00:53:35,800
makes sense

1338
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:38,830
on that note I think we're out of time

1339
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:41,350
so I just want to thank you all thanks

1340
00:53:38,830 --> 00:53:42,640
to Kevin for us and yeah it's been a

1341
00:53:41,350 --> 00:53:44,250
pleasure speaking to all thanks for your

1342
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:48,379
time thanks for your attention
