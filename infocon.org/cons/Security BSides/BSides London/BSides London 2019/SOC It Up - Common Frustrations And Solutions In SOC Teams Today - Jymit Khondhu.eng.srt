1
00:00:02,149 --> 00:00:08,400
okay so suck it up common frustrations

2
00:00:05,609 --> 00:00:10,800
and solutions in soft teams today my

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:13,860
name is Jim itson condi that's my

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:15,240
Twitter handle con due to mostly use for

5
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:17,520
following repost thing I don't really

6
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:20,250
post a lot I've got a lot of content so

7
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:23,730
I'll get started straight into that bit

8
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:25,529
of a preamble into myself got a unique

9
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:26,310
names is very easy to find stuff about

10
00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:29,070
me online

11
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:31,140
please don't currently doing all things

12
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:34,469
blue team for a cloud computing and

13
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:37,250
hosting company fun fact

14
00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:39,450
recently back from sans Amsterdam

15
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:42,450
facilitating there that's good fun shout

16
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:44,399
out to Taz and Eva and my background is

17
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:47,309
one of open source software full stack

18
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:49,980
software support engineering with the

19
00:00:47,309 --> 00:00:53,039
likes of Zimbra logarithm knots open

20
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:54,148
source and then over to elastic but

21
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,010
there's been heaps of cybersecurity

22
00:00:54,149 --> 00:00:57,840
along the way I've done that I joined

23
00:00:56,010 --> 00:01:00,420
the street team o res Umbra responding

24
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:03,899
to vulnerability reports and internal

25
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:06,930
testing or things seem at logarithm and

26
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:10,200
elastic supporting logging as well as

27
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:13,740
few T analytics folks anyways here I am

28
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:15,630
and I'm here to tell you that just not

29
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:18,839
that impressed I'm someone that likes to

30
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:21,350
find areas of improvement and put those

31
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:25,380
forward not to complain but to exactly

32
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:28,169
improve improve improve the team improve

33
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:29,820
the tooling and just what we do day to

34
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:31,890
day so it doesn't become so mundane and

35
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:34,408
boring so I'm gonna be going over some

36
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:38,340
common frustrations I've got a fair few

37
00:01:34,409 --> 00:01:39,930
frustrations and confusion of solutions

38
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:42,180
at the end of it quite short at the end

39
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:45,390
to call a lot of content but over the

40
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:46,590
last over the last six months I've been

41
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:48,930
talking to friends peers even

42
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:52,170
interviewees and even a few instant

43
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:53,759
response folks at sans to find out what

44
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:55,290
what have they seen what they've

45
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:56,820
frustrated whether within their sock

46
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:59,159
teams or where they've worked or

47
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:00,779
contracted and you know Alette fatigue

48
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:05,780
old technology and budget constraints

49
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:05,780
have been saw the top tail and there

50
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:19,200
is it too early for cabbages I'll get

51
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:20,610
started so PSA by no means is this a

52
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:24,359
depiction of the soft team that I work

53
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:26,519
in right now and if your sock or your

54
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:28,709
your set team have any one or many of

55
00:02:26,519 --> 00:02:30,540
these it's not a problem as long as it's

56
00:02:28,709 --> 00:02:32,760
it's a thought process it's something

57
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:35,548
that's a work in progress and there's

58
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:37,679
some priorities aligned to these at the

59
00:02:35,549 --> 00:02:39,450
same time I can't possibly go through

60
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,670
everything today if you think there's

61
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:44,488
one or two particulars that I really did

62
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:46,399
miss out on please do mention me on

63
00:02:44,489 --> 00:02:49,889
Twitter but I'm more active on Linkedin

64
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:51,870
happy to have a conversation always so

65
00:02:49,889 --> 00:02:54,239
this the layer I'm gonna follow is just

66
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:56,909
frustration and what it is what does it

67
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:57,750
mean for the sock or the analysts and

68
00:02:56,909 --> 00:03:03,450
I'm going to start with legacy

69
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:04,980
technology not alert fatigue the legacy

70
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:07,260
technology being tooling or an

71
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:08,879
application that was created X amount of

72
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:10,429
years ago inside the organization and

73
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:13,260
it's a part of the day-to-day processes

74
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:14,760
for example at an asset management asset

75
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:18,060
management tool that you've got to log

76
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:20,280
into it's got a pretty slow UI could be

77
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:22,620
based in another region and it's got a

78
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:24,510
bit of a slow search so that's it's

79
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:27,419
something I've gotta log into you've

80
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:28,560
gotta have another tab open and it could

81
00:03:27,419 --> 00:03:30,959
be something that potentially needs to

82
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:34,980
fall under the SSO of the the internal

83
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:36,900
security alert fatigue are you inundated

84
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:41,280
with alerts I mean literally thousands

85
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:42,840
of alerts heaps of false positives they

86
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,879
could be low-level high quantity they

87
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:47,220
could be high severity level high

88
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:49,980
quantity and with that comes a potential

89
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:52,049
for a lack of enrichment what that means

90
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:54,768
for the stock and analyst is less

91
00:03:52,049 --> 00:03:57,030
downtime to do research and development

92
00:03:54,769 --> 00:03:58,440
automation of tasks as well as tooling

93
00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:00,269
you could have particular analysts that

94
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:02,629
are passionate for an area they might

95
00:04:00,269 --> 00:04:04,530
want to learn some Python or scripting

96
00:04:02,629 --> 00:04:06,780
and they can't do that because they're

97
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:08,549
just so inundated you have a higher turn

98
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:13,220
of analysts and that's expensive for not

99
00:04:08,549 --> 00:04:15,810
for an organization where mistake-prone

100
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:17,639
wanting to keep up with keep up with

101
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:19,589
alerts let's say your particular analyst

102
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:20,900
really likes fishing they're following a

103
00:04:19,589 --> 00:04:23,520
phishing campaign or they're filling a

104
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:23,729
following along with a particular apt so

105
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,340
they

106
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:28,170
I happened to do that as well as keep up

107
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:31,200
today or keep on top of all of their

108
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:32,370
day-to-day let's and this this actually

109
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:35,430
this could be there's two things that

110
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:37,260
could be a sign of is perhaps some of

111
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:39,120
those alerts need suppressing or

112
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:42,150
probably aggregating but I feel that's

113
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:44,190
more very architecture or engineering

114
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:45,330
side of things not so much sock

115
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:47,940
depending on now

116
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:50,039
the teams are set up and the other thing

117
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:52,050
is perhaps you need to on board more

118
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:59,040
analysts to low balance the number of

119
00:04:52,050 --> 00:05:00,660
alerts you can't get alert fatigue if

120
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,660
you just don't check their alerts right

121
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:06,870
that's fact all right on to lack of

122
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:09,870
enrichment oK you've got a setting set

123
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:11,160
the set this site here is you've got

124
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:12,540
them out whether you've got the IPS

125
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:14,040
you've got the ports you've got in half

126
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:15,810
that's great it's a good start

127
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:18,120
but nothing else and then we're talking

128
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:19,650
about yet another application you've got

129
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:22,320
to log in to another tab you could I

130
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:25,200
have open and wait this is transfer from

131
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:28,020
being more mistake-prone another example

132
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:30,060
being not being able to ingest DNS or

133
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:30,690
full packet capture into your single

134
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:33,510
pane of glass

135
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:35,820
due to sizing issues or costs we've all

136
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:38,250
heard of this before perhaps you can but

137
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:40,290
for a short of retention period what

138
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:43,350
this means for the sock and/or analyst

139
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:45,930
is especially for the first example is a

140
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:48,360
slower mean time to detect and a slower

141
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:50,280
mean time to respond yet another

142
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:53,610
application keeps more tabs and that's

143
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:56,219
just slowing down using so much RAM and

144
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:57,750
on the on the other example of DNS and

145
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:59,880
full packet capture you missing out on

146
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:01,860
that pre attack if we're talking might

147
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:03,690
for attack framework that pre attack

148
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:06,120
stage that reconnaissance you're not

149
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:08,310
getting those initiative IOC s to see

150
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:11,870
how they scanning how they're gonna

151
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:11,870
think about actually moving across there

152
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:19,020
on to outdated equipment and budget

153
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:21,150
constraint so I'm gonna couple some of

154
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:22,830
these up as I go along so you start the

155
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:24,900
new role you've been given a managed

156
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:27,090
machine that's three years old and it's

157
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:28,799
got with a bit of a flickering screen if

158
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:30,929
you're working with a US or a UK

159
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:33,510
keyboard layout and you've got another

160
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:34,620
for a DJ domain it's got funky european

161
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:35,880
characters in there and you've gotta

162
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:37,529
squint or you've got to really work it

163
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:40,259
out the equipment doesn't really

164
00:06:37,529 --> 00:06:41,519
help the speed of us working through the

165
00:06:40,259 --> 00:06:44,249
alert working through those through

166
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:46,259
those cases been nice for all of us to

167
00:06:44,249 --> 00:06:48,629
have you know juicy brand new machine 16

168
00:06:46,259 --> 00:06:50,849
gigabytes to crack on with sandbox and

169
00:06:48,629 --> 00:06:52,559
be producing reports for example what

170
00:06:50,849 --> 00:06:54,779
this means is immediately coming in

171
00:06:52,559 --> 00:06:56,639
being given that old machine in the back

172
00:06:54,779 --> 00:06:58,199
of your mind you're thinking I've put an

173
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:00,899
X next to this company already they've

174
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:03,299
give me old old machines I can't I can't

175
00:07:00,899 --> 00:07:05,429
work as efficiently as I can budget

176
00:07:03,299 --> 00:07:08,008
constraints means not the latest tools

177
00:07:05,429 --> 00:07:10,138
not the latest EDR all that course after

178
00:07:08,009 --> 00:07:13,709
ever now out there is using and not the

179
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:15,029
latest training and the goal is to keep

180
00:07:13,709 --> 00:07:17,219
all the analyst happy you keep them

181
00:07:15,029 --> 00:07:20,759
happy they keep the sob churning along

182
00:07:17,219 --> 00:07:23,308
next inexperienced peers and tribal

183
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:26,909
knowledge some socks or sets may have a

184
00:07:23,309 --> 00:07:29,489
tearing of analyst level one two three

185
00:07:26,909 --> 00:07:33,109
four four being the Yoder's the SMEs or

186
00:07:29,489 --> 00:07:35,489
a particular area of malware analysis

187
00:07:33,109 --> 00:07:40,109
reverse engineering forensics or even

188
00:07:35,489 --> 00:07:41,909
seem aficionados and it's not nice

189
00:07:40,109 --> 00:07:43,679
therefore sometimes with with newer

190
00:07:41,909 --> 00:07:45,299
folks the older folks missed eight that

191
00:07:43,679 --> 00:07:46,589
new guy didn't follow our SOP or that

192
00:07:45,299 --> 00:07:50,758
runbook they've they've missed something

193
00:07:46,589 --> 00:07:52,799
and she's not nice there they're all

194
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:56,939
they're always asking questions or

195
00:07:52,799 --> 00:07:59,459
making mistakes this slows down the team

196
00:07:56,939 --> 00:08:02,639
slows down case management and slowing

197
00:07:59,459 --> 00:08:04,110
down the sock those high number of

198
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:06,659
alerts that we're talking about

199
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:09,839
questions I think in my own opinion and

200
00:08:06,659 --> 00:08:11,549
I mention at the end is great that's how

201
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:13,649
we've all started and that's how we got

202
00:08:11,549 --> 00:08:15,109
to where we are and then tribal

203
00:08:13,649 --> 00:08:19,289
knowledge

204
00:08:15,109 --> 00:08:22,258
Shammi right so tribal knowledge of

205
00:08:19,289 --> 00:08:24,269
those means they want to be the Super

206
00:08:22,259 --> 00:08:27,209
Saiyan experts of those particular areas

207
00:08:24,269 --> 00:08:29,309
they could have an ego we've always all

208
00:08:27,209 --> 00:08:30,749
come across someone with an ego or who

209
00:08:29,309 --> 00:08:34,039
have also come across folks that are

210
00:08:30,749 --> 00:08:36,808
just so willing to share amazing folks

211
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:39,419
but those knowledge holders sitting on

212
00:08:36,808 --> 00:08:41,338
forums or Twitter like yes I've seen

213
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:44,550
that sure hash before or that's apt

214
00:08:41,339 --> 00:08:46,439
eighteen there now to unpack all the

215
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:51,060
malware's they know all the Olly debug

216
00:08:46,439 --> 00:08:52,230
shortcuts tribal knowledge another piece

217
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:54,989
that is they could just be

218
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:57,300
geographically or not available in that

219
00:08:54,990 --> 00:09:00,720
time zone to disseminate knowledge with

220
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:02,099
the junior engineers and I think this

221
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,110
holds back to unit analysts from

222
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:07,230
learning it creates a culture of not

223
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:09,930
sharing culture as well as in the work

224
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:12,000
space no one starts sharing knowledge

225
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:13,800
even if a junior analyst goes away and

226
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,839
learn something they don't feel that

227
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:19,979
they they're in an environment to share

228
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:21,810
that even wider inadvertently slowing

229
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:25,350
down the growth and strength of the sock

230
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:27,930
team on to the next lack of automation

231
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:31,110
lack of using the latest methodologies

232
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:33,180
and a lack of tooling I'm gonna set the

233
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:35,130
scene here you've got you've got one tab

234
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:36,870
where you're your seam is and your legs

235
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:38,850
have come in you've got another tab of

236
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:40,050
case management you've got another for

237
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:42,660
your run books where you've got your

238
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:44,310
instant response steps and it's all very

239
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:46,829
compartmentalize you haven't of log in

240
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:50,010
to so many yet another application some

241
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:52,110
you're just you're very prone to making

242
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:54,750
mistakes all of that could be your

243
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:59,790
automated save yourself 15 to 30 minutes

244
00:09:54,750 --> 00:10:01,310
of alert or case time and then on to not

245
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:04,079
using the latest methodologies

246
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:05,819
methodologies let's say you're not using

247
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:07,860
the latest cloud technologies container

248
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:10,410
security or technologies Maps not even

249
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:15,480
machine learning yet have you thought

250
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:17,010
about a zero trust model also tying this

251
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:20,040
in with budget constraints is are you

252
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:24,569
using the latest IDs and SM EDR DDoS

253
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:27,449
mitigation tools what this means for the

254
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:28,920
sock and or analysts is they're having

255
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:31,140
to put a lot more time and effort into

256
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:33,150
their day-to-day work without having

257
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:34,949
that automation there they're inundated

258
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:38,250
with alerts it's just it just piles on

259
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:40,260
it's not that great and for analysts

260
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:43,380
they don't just don't get and that much

261
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:45,240
exposure into the latest tooling then

262
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:46,770
they might personally feel that they're

263
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:48,810
not employable if they were to leave

264
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:50,370
that employer at that time they're not

265
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:52,920
just they're not working on all think

266
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:56,880
Lauer or things cloud all things sec

267
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:59,969
DevOps that we hear nowadays on to the

268
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:03,630
next this is one of my own personal not

269
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:04,470
personal but one i feel close towards is

270
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:06,810
a lack of communicate

271
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:09,750
in cohesion lack of threat intelligence

272
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:11,130
and a lack of purple teaming you've got

273
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:14,070
your red team running their hands their

274
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:15,540
normal operations sometimes they tell

275
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:18,720
you sometimes they don't tell you that

276
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:21,150
they're running a hunt that might give

277
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:23,340
you an IP address or SSO user so you

278
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:24,900
know that if you see that in your in

279
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:27,060
your scene you know what to look for

280
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:29,970
that's false positive that's cool your

281
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:31,229
blue team running business as usual but

282
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:33,690
all of this there's a lack of cohesion

283
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:34,830
communication and for me and I put this

284
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:39,270
in there most importantly is

285
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:42,240
collaboration I've seen something in the

286
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:44,360
last 12 months where there's been I owe

287
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:46,650
sees in the wild three days prior and

288
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:49,140
there's no threat intelligence or a red

289
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:52,079
team or any of that bought in to case

290
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:56,069
management's and then we saw scanning

291
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:57,810
and potential pre exploit due to that

292
00:11:56,070 --> 00:11:59,910
but if if we had that threat

293
00:11:57,810 --> 00:12:01,800
intelligence already whether it's by a

294
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:04,260
threat intelligence team by a red team

295
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:06,540
or even a proactive blue team a-- to go

296
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:08,910
in there grab those ILCs put those in a

297
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:10,140
case you're one step ahead you you want

298
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:15,510
to find the vulnerabilities before

299
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:20,730
others do all right quick Catterick I

300
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:22,770
think we okay now this is a nine weeks

301
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:26,340
old kitten named Zeus that my mom's

302
00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:28,470
babysitting I'm very I'm adorned in a

303
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:30,990
lot of cat stuff today take his love

304
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:33,260
cats okay I want to go into common

305
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:37,200
solutions I sort of pay these up and

306
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:40,530
given the time legacy tech use those

307
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:42,360
pain areas to drive budget okay it's

308
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:44,189
fine you're using legacy technology if

309
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:46,470
you got saw an old asset management

310
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:50,010
tools that you've got to log into it's

311
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:52,920
cool but make it work for you make it

312
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:54,569
drive the budget I stopped perhaps even

313
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:56,880
start looking and talking about his zero

314
00:12:54,570 --> 00:13:00,300
trust model inside of the the soccer

315
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:02,820
organization alert fatigue automate make

316
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:04,439
more time hire more analyst get

317
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:06,210
management into the trenches talking

318
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:07,710
with the analyst find out what the

319
00:13:06,210 --> 00:13:09,990
analysts like love what they're

320
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:13,260
passionate for and where they want to

321
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:15,510
grow in enrichment or a lack they are

322
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:17,430
wrong it is not too hard is you know

323
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:18,250
there's heaps of open-source technology

324
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:20,680
out there too

325
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:23,200
if you want to spin up a VPC and try out

326
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:26,229
a new cool osun's technology or feed and

327
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:27,550
just POC it talk talk to your folks in

328
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:29,170
the stock saying hey I did this in my

329
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:31,630
spare time I want to bring this into the

330
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:33,640
sock because you're so inundated with

331
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:35,050
alerts okay you have you're having to

332
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:38,199
use time outside of work and if your

333
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:42,099
working 1012 hours shift rotations it's

334
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:44,350
not that easy so be proactive old

335
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:46,930
equipment and budgets use those pain

336
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:49,960
areas for budget you've rather pay fifty

337
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:53,770
thousand pound pre breech for a tool or

338
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:58,120
technology or for analysts then five

339
00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:59,680
hundred k plus post next to do with the

340
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:03,370
junior peers and the traveled knowledge

341
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:04,839
teach grow learn goddammit as in you've

342
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:07,360
got to disseminate that knowledge how

343
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:10,090
else will the juniors learn or how they

344
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:14,050
become seeing as one day automation is

345
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:16,540
awesome automations efficiency take take

346
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:18,550
an analyst out of rota for one day let

347
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:21,880
them go learn and you'll get more tomato

348
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:23,079
something automating case management so

349
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:26,500
you don't waste fifteen minutes

350
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:30,130
copy paste to their case closed save

351
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:31,660
time efficiency perhaps even R&D into

352
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:33,760
machine learning for faster detection

353
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:37,260
and response giving this sock more time

354
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:40,420
to do all the good stuff fast response

355
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:42,819
purple teaming i think i'm gonna do talk

356
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:44,770

357
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:46,780
there just collaborate an aim for

358
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:48,610
greatness get the get the red and blue

359
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:50,860
team sitting together give them feedback

360
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:52,900
the red team run a hunt or whatever they

361
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:54,730
do have a five minute ten minutes zoom

362
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:56,050
calls slack send them over some

363
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:57,580
documentation this is what we found

364
00:14:56,050 --> 00:15:01,510
these are the IOC s

365
00:14:57,580 --> 00:15:04,000
do it aim for greatness over communicate

366
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:06,310
I've I've worked remote previously and

367
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,620
over communication and collaboration is

368
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:11,319
a good thing you're better over

369
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:13,210
communicating they're not in short

370
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:18,850
everyone's on the same page locally

371
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:20,500
regionally geographically so not that

372
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:22,840
someone wakes up in an ER or a pack one

373
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:24,970
day saying oh by the way we're replacing

374
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:28,780
our seam and you just found out about it

375
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:31,570
on the day not cool communicate and yeah

376
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:33,250
let's say ego more EQ

377
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:36,610
more empathy more whiteboarding more

378
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:39,490
sharing knowledge have patience teach I

379
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:41,260
like to disseminate knowledge as much as

380
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:45,070
I can I'm not that great we're still

381
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:46,870
learning but it's cool thing because if

382
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:48,370
you share the knowledge you feel like

383
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:51,940
you really feel that you really do know

384
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:56,940
