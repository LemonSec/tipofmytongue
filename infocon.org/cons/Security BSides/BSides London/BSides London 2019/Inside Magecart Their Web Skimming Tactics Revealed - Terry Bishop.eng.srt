1
00:00:02,389 --> 00:00:07,760
good afternoon everybody so yeah my

2
00:00:06,029 --> 00:00:09,420
session today I'm going to talk about

3
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:12,840
mage cart

4
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:14,490
maggot cart maiik are lots of people say

5
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:16,170
different things there's no official way

6
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:19,380
to say it so just stick with what you're

7
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:22,380
comfortable with and just really sort of

8
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:24,150
look into what they're doing how they're

9
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:26,009
doing it and the different groups that

10
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:28,740
are out there and how they're developing

11
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:36,030
over time in terms of the activity that

12
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:39,269
they're doing so I'll start by looking

13
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:42,899
at two of the most high-profile breaches

14
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:44,190
Ticketmaster and British Airways they're

15
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:48,629
good examples because they're both

16
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:51,120
different mechanisms for how they

17
00:00:48,629 --> 00:00:54,420
delivered the skimmers onto the

18
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:56,070
different sites so quickly broad cover

19
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:58,710
those then I'll take a look at the

20
00:00:56,070 --> 00:01:00,030
different groups how they're evolving

21
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:01,140
and what they're doing and a brief

22
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:05,369
update on some of the more recent

23
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:09,570
activity that we've seen sort of deviate

24
00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:15,090
out into browser-based injections sort

25
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:18,899
of topic on its own I think major cart

26
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:20,610
and card skimming is is in many ways

27
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:23,159
just sort of the tip of the iceberg it's

28
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:25,020
perhaps the easy to monetize activity

29
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:26,490
but there's lots of stuff that you can

30
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:30,420
do with browser injection so I'll take a

31
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:33,570
quick look at that then talk about the

32
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:37,560
different ways to detect or prevent it

33
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:39,149
and if we have time I'll be honest I

34
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:40,799
don't think I will have time with all

35
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:42,990
the other stuff I'm trying to cover live

36
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:45,960
we have time I'll try and run through a

37
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:47,220
risk like you spastic total solution to

38
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:49,770
show how we do some of the

39
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:52,048
investigations that lead us to finding

40
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:54,090
the infrastructure that sits behind the

41
00:01:52,049 --> 00:02:02,880
different groups that are carrying out

42
00:01:54,090 --> 00:02:05,939
these attacks so in June of last year

43
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,289
Ticketmaster hit the headlines they'd

44
00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:10,810
lost

45
00:02:07,289 --> 00:02:15,459
carelessness suppose 40,000 customers

46
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:17,980
credit card details and this caught the

47
00:02:15,459 --> 00:02:21,459
eye of the security research team at

48
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:25,599
risk IQ because it was the language that

49
00:02:21,459 --> 00:02:28,319
they used they talked about not a breach

50
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:31,149
of their systems not about you know

51
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:33,730
databases and passwords being salted and

52
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:35,500
hashed and so on but you know

53
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:37,720
specifically they talked about malicious

54
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:40,480
code embedded in a third party

55
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:45,970
technology on their website that led to

56
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:49,450
this breach it was on the website for

57
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:50,590
what four months in international

58
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:52,929
customers and I haven't seen any real

59
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:55,150
discussion about the overall impact to

60
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:57,430
their international customers but they

61
00:02:55,150 --> 00:03:00,099
talked about being on both sites for

62
00:02:57,430 --> 00:03:02,019
nine months so now these these

63
00:03:00,099 --> 00:03:04,359
injections are out there they sit on

64
00:03:02,019 --> 00:03:06,640
websites nobody notices they're just

65
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:11,769
quietly skinned credit card information

66
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:15,880
as they go oh take a source side step

67
00:03:11,769 --> 00:03:17,829
here to talk about how risk IQ operates

68
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:19,569
because I think it will help as I go

69
00:03:17,829 --> 00:03:21,850
into the analysis to understand a little

70
00:03:19,569 --> 00:03:23,349
bit of what we do this is a very busy

71
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:25,000
slide I apologize for that I'm only

72
00:03:23,349 --> 00:03:30,130
going to talk about the first half of it

73
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:34,389
but risk IQ spends its days crawling the

74
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:36,519
internet we've got hundreds of different

75
00:03:34,389 --> 00:03:39,099
proxy points around the world that our

76
00:03:36,519 --> 00:03:41,109
crawlers exit from to visit the sites on

77
00:03:39,099 --> 00:03:43,030
the Internet our goal is to crawl the

78
00:03:41,109 --> 00:03:44,980
whole of the Internet I have to be

79
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:46,180
honest and say that's quite a heady goal

80
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:49,328
and one that we haven't really reached

81
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:53,620
yet but by feeding information into the

82
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:57,489
system that's domain registrations

83
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:58,630
passive DNS records blacklist feeds and

84
00:03:57,489 --> 00:04:00,910
a whole bunch of other things

85
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:02,918
now crawlers set off at the beginning of

86
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:05,590
every day to go out and visit the web

87
00:04:02,919 --> 00:04:08,950
and they as they go they collect every

88
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:12,000
bit and byte that they encounter so the

89
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:16,180
full document object model of every site

90
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:18,010
certificates cookies trackers all of the

91
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:18,909
JavaScript that's important for what

92
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:20,010
we're going to talk about here today

93
00:04:18,909 --> 00:04:22,440
they

94
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:26,690
that information and they follow links

95
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:29,340
there we refer to them as virtual users

96
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:32,640
its headless browsing so we do present

97
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:35,130
ourselves as a sort of a human user if

98
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:37,440
you will we don't do a double you get on

99
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:39,420
the site and then leave will visit it

100
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:41,940
many times over the course of a day

101
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:44,690
clicking on different links so that our

102
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:48,270
behavior does not stand out as automated

103
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:50,000
and we do that because the stuff we're

104
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:52,650
really looking for the malicious stuff

105
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:57,600
sometimes has rules in it to detect

106
00:04:52,650 --> 00:05:00,359
automated analysis so by by behaving as

107
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:03,860
human users we're able to collect more

108
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:06,630
information and otherwise possible we do

109
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:08,010
about 2 billion page requests today to

110
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:10,440
give you an idea of the scale of what

111
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:13,230
we're doing and then that information

112
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:15,150
comes into those for the the

113
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:16,920
technical among you you'll notice that

114
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:18,870
the arrows on the cogs mean that the

115
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:20,250
cogs don't actually turn my apologies

116
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:23,640
for that someone pointed it out to me in

117
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:25,920
a presentation a couple weeks ago but

118
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:27,990
three functions that we do as the data

119
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:32,190
comes in from that crawling Network

120
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:36,450
first thing is we carry out the data

121
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:38,969
science piece and by that I mean we look

122
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:41,310
at the connectedness of all of the data

123
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:43,470
that we collect if we find a website

124
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:45,420
what other websites does it connect to

125
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:47,640
you know what refers to it and where

126
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:49,140
does it refer to if there's a

127
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:51,750
certificate on that site where else are

128
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:53,430
we seeing that certificate it's same

129
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:57,300
with cookies same with trackers and we

130
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:58,860
build out this sort of view of the web

131
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:01,350
in terms of the connectedness of

132
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:04,200
everything you see if any of you have

133
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:06,150
used passive total that's how we are

134
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:07,680
delivering that data within passive

135
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:11,849
total so that you can carry out those

136
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:13,140
investigations around infrastructure the

137
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:15,840
second part is that machine learning

138
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:18,120
piece so we will look at as we find

139
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:20,729
things and see different mission

140
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:22,560
malicious behaviors then we can start to

141
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:23,730
alert that so that we can tell our

142
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,280
customers we found something that's

143
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:28,380
relevant to them then the final cog is

144
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:32,210
the security research piece and that's

145
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:35,419
the team that did the research for the

146
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:37,130
major cut piece today and they are

147
00:06:35,419 --> 00:06:39,560
constantly looking for new threats new

148
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:40,940
problems so that they can not only build

149
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:42,860
them into our platform but also so that

150
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:48,290
we can talk about them at events like

151
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:50,240
this so coming back to Ticketmaster so I

152
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:53,690
said we're doing over 2 billion page

153
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:57,260
requests a day the breach was there for

154
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:59,750
about 90 days so we had somewhere in the

155
00:06:57,260 --> 00:07:01,969
region of 200 billion crawls of data to

156
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:03,860
go through I should say Ticketmaster not

157
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:06,550
a customer of risk IQ so it's not like

158
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:08,419
we were actively monitoring their code

159
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:09,680
so it's a bit of a challenge knowing

160
00:07:08,419 --> 00:07:11,630
where to start but the good news was

161
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,389
Ticketmaster had given us enough

162
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:17,570
information within their press release

163
00:07:13,389 --> 00:07:19,040
first of all the Ticketmaster UK was

164
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:23,150
compromised so we could focus on their

165
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:25,370
UK assets they talked about inventor the

166
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:28,580
fact that the script was actually hosted

167
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:30,080
on embeds the hardware and then the task

168
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:31,490
was really to go through looking at all

169
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:34,460
of the scripts that we found that were

170
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:39,050
Ticketmaster UK hosted on in benta let's

171
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:41,239
see what we can find and we use passive

172
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:43,940
total you can see just a quick snip

173
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:45,889
there showing the subdomain of

174
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:47,719
Ticketmaster on the inventor site we

175
00:07:45,889 --> 00:07:51,940
went and had a look at the cruel data

176
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:55,729
for Ticketmaster UK dot inventor and

177
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:57,530
this script here or there's this box

178
00:07:55,729 --> 00:08:01,610
I've called out in bento Jas

179
00:07:57,530 --> 00:08:03,169
Ticketmaster UK inventor calm that's the

180
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:05,000
one that caught our eye that was the one

181
00:08:03,169 --> 00:08:06,950
that seemed to be most interesting this

182
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,130
is what the script looks like or at

183
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:12,020
least on top of it I've put the major

184
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:13,639
car code in the red box but I think it's

185
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:15,159
also interesting to see the code that's

186
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:18,490
underneath it because that's not

187
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:21,200
obfuscated and that's always sort of a

188
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:24,139
sort of a red flag to us at least when

189
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:27,139
we see a mix of obfuscated and

190
00:08:24,139 --> 00:08:29,930
unobligated code in one place if we are

191
00:08:27,139 --> 00:08:32,510
not for scope that code then what we

192
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:37,010
found was 67 lines

193
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:39,319
it is a simple major card skimmer to be

194
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:41,838
fair nothing particularly outstanding

195
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:43,370
about it from our perspective I haven't

196
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:46,290
put all sixty lines there because the

197
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:48,190
the text would have got so small

198
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:51,400
even I wouldn't be able to read it

199
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:56,710
standing here but the box of outlines

200
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:59,590
the web f OTC e that's the exfil site so

201
00:08:56,710 --> 00:09:03,280
you go onto Ticketmaster you enter all

202
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:05,230
of your credit card details there's a

203
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:06,939
box somewhere on there probably saying

204
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:09,400
if you have any problems click here

205
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:12,130
that's the inventor code they were it

206
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:13,750
was a help function within the site you

207
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:15,340
don't have to use the help function to

208
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:17,170
activate it's just a simple fact that it

209
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:19,960
was on the payment page means that that

210
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:21,939
script was was loaded but as you enter

211
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:25,240
all of your details and when you hit

212
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:28,390
order checkout or one step' this wasn't

213
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:30,700
a custom script for Ticketmaster this

214
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:33,010
was just designed to catch as much

215
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:34,330
credit card information as possible so

216
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:36,910
there are keywords that they're looking

217
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:39,640
for in the script as soon as that word

218
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:45,069
is executed the the button is clicked

219
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:48,160
then the code is sent to web fo TCE so

220
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:52,060
that the information then be utilized by

221
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:54,670
the group that was doing this this was a

222
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:57,040
major use the news story Ticketmaster a

223
00:09:54,670 --> 00:10:01,030
well-known brand not just in the UK but

224
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:02,589
around the world at the potential for 10

225
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:04,270
million customers that's the traffic

226
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:06,100
that goes through the Ticketmaster site

227
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:08,860
but I guess not everybody that goes to

228
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:11,500
the site actually purchase purchasers a

229
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:14,410
ticket at the end of the of the visit

230
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:18,160
they got credit card number user name

231
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:20,170
expiry date and most importantly for me

232
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,969
the CVV number that's to me what gives a

233
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:24,189
credit card it's real value if you're

234
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:25,630
going to try and sell it on in one of

235
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:28,870
those dark web forms the previous

236
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:31,630
speaker was talking about I think what

237
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:33,220
is most interesting for me is the fact

238
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:35,530
that this all happens in the users

239
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:39,160
browser none of this was happening in

240
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:41,470
the Ticketmaster environment you know

241
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:43,449
they to a degree they have no visibility

242
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:44,890
of this whatsoever your web application

243
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:48,190
file was not going to pick this up your

244
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:50,949
file your a/v it's all happening on the

245
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:53,970
clients browser how do you detect that

246
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:57,070
activity and then this may be a

247
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:59,950
conversation for another event

248
00:10:57,070 --> 00:11:02,080
arguably Ticketmaster were not breached

249
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:03,580
it was a third party that script had

250
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:04,870
nothing to do with Ticketmaster other

251
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:06,910
than the fact that they were using it

252
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:07,990
now the debate goes they should have

253
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:11,800
done a better order on their third

254
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:14,070
parties of course but technically their

255
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:19,569
security was sound it was a third party

256
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:21,700
that got caught out switching to be a so

257
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:24,640
a couple months later we're in September

258
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:29,560
now another news article on the BBC

259
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:31,990
again this time 380,000 credit card

260
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:34,780
details are stolen in a much shorter

261
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:37,870
time frame and it's three weeks in this

262
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:41,680
case and again it caught the eye of our

263
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:44,320
research team because they didn't talk

264
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:47,020
about database breaches and now they'd

265
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:50,470
been sort of hacked it was a compromise

266
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:52,750
on their website so again and I should

267
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:54,970
say again be aid we're not a customer

268
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:57,400
risk IQ so it's not like we were looking

269
00:11:54,970 --> 00:12:01,330
to monitor their systems this is just

270
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:03,790
through our our crawling data let's have

271
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:08,260
a look see if we coul PA and and we'll

272
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:09,870
see what we find and we found this

273
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:16,450
script moderniser

274
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:21,100
2.6 dot 2 min je s the top snip shows

275
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:23,620
how that file looked before the the

276
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:25,270
breach date that was announced and it

277
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:29,740
pretty static script actually it hasn't

278
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:34,810
changed since 18th of December 2012 and

279
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:38,080
then surprise surprise an hour before

280
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:42,069
the date that ba announced that the hack

281
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:46,120
had ended we've got a new script being

282
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:48,250
uploaded to the be a site we saw that

283
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:50,350
we'll take a look at that we've

284
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:51,670
delegated this one and beautified it a

285
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:54,490
little bit more than the last one

286
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:57,689
22 lines of code that was all it took to

287
00:12:54,490 --> 00:13:00,460
steal those 300,000 credit card details

288
00:12:57,690 --> 00:13:04,900
it's it's quite nice it's much tidier

289
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:07,570
than the the Ticketmaster one they even

290
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:10,199
wrote it so this is specific to tube a

291
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:11,880
this isn't her this isn't a

292
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:15,150
a generic script that's why I wanted to

293
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:19,740
talk about the two examples but they

294
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:22,699
actually wrote this for both web

295
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:26,190
browsers and mobile devices the the be a

296
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:28,890
mobile app shares a lot of its

297
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:30,870
infrastructure with the with the website

298
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:34,800
so they've put in an additional four

299
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:35,940
touch component to the to the script so

300
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,410
that they can make sure they get some

301
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:41,760
many credit cards as possible not just

302
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:44,819
those on the web we've seen versions of

303
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:46,290
this that are 15 lines of code this was

304
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:49,020
slightly more complicated because ba

305
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:50,339
actually keep the the details of the

306
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:53,449
individual paying in a slightly

307
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:55,470
different place on the website to the

308
00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:57,930
terms of the rest of the credit card

309
00:13:55,470 --> 00:14:00,690
data but still quite nice the way

310
00:13:57,930 --> 00:14:03,630
they've done it and they exfil to be a

311
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:07,140
ways calm and this is just sort of worth

312
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:08,640
its own mention this is nothing to do

313
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:11,250
with British Airways but it's a great

314
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:13,770
copycat domain if you're looking at this

315
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:15,720
code either within the you know the be a

316
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:18,510
organization sort of scanning it looking

317
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:20,730
for any anomalies maybe if you are doing

318
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:22,710
some sort of monitoring on your browser

319
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:25,350
to you know prevent something like this

320
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:28,230
catching you I'm just not sure that you

321
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:33,030
would pick out the be a ways it's just a

322
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:36,510
really nice infringing domain registered

323
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:38,310
a week before or the cert well sorry

324
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:40,620
this snip this snip is from the week a

325
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:42,780
week previous so they obviously had this

326
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:46,340
access for you know this wasn't a

327
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:49,560
smash-and-grab this is a nicely planned

328
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:51,600
operation interesting that they

329
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:54,930
registered a legitimate certificate as

330
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:56,130
well why not use let's encrypt or a free

331
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:58,439
certificate you know these guys were

332
00:14:56,130 --> 00:15:03,689
really paying attention to what they

333
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:06,260
were doing yeah it's just I like it and

334
00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:08,730
that's mage card that's what they do

335
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:10,500
find a way onto a server I can't tell

336
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:14,700
you how inventive were hacked I can't

337
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:17,850
tell you what happened with BA all we

338
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:22,860
can do is say look scripts were inserted

339
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:24,350
into their infrastructure and people

340
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:28,460
just unwittingly

341
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:30,170
losing their credit card data what we do

342
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:33,560
know about mage cart they've been around

343
00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:36,979
since about 2014 we've been tracking

344
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:40,900
them actively since about 2015 they

345
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:46,190
started by playing on the server side

346
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:49,069
with the Magento payment system that's

347
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:51,670
where mage cart comes from you'll see

348
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:55,370
the sniff at the bottom says mage Jes

349
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:56,750
the mage and then tie that in with cart

350
00:15:55,370 --> 00:16:00,650
because it's a shopping cart and that's

351
00:15:56,750 --> 00:16:03,980
where you've got the name from it it's

352
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:05,630
more as we've seen more groups joining

353
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:08,240
the operation into more of an umbrella

354
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:09,800
term for this type of activity for

355
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:13,700
people doing credit card skimming on the

356
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:16,099
web and we have seen different activity

357
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:18,650
we've seen these sort of cards appearing

358
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:20,860
on on dark web forums in dump sites

359
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:24,620
we've also been able to track some

360
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:25,880
reshipping fraud behavior as well

361
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:27,470
but we haven't done a huge amount of

362
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:29,090
attribution on the actual individuals

363
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:31,370
themselves with left-outs of the people

364
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:32,780
who are expert so that our job is to try

365
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:36,440
and collect this data rather than to

366
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:39,500
analyze who's actually doing it but

367
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:42,890
drilling into the groups so as I say

368
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:43,880
Group one started by targeting actually

369
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:46,640
they started targeting vulnerable

370
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:48,350
Magento servers so they were looking for

371
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:49,790
just simple weaknesses in the system and

372
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:52,280
then starting to target them we

373
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:55,069
initially logged it as a keylogger they

374
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:57,410
were just tracking when numbers were

375
00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:58,940
being entered into the forms on a

376
00:16:57,410 --> 00:17:02,689
website at the point where you've

377
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:04,340
finished entering the the expiry date of

378
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:07,010
your car that's typically the last field

379
00:17:04,339 --> 00:17:08,929
on the credit card what you fill in then

380
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:11,510
the data would be X filled out to

381
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:13,700
another location in this case jjs save

382
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:16,670
got linked they didn't have as much

383
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:19,010
success on the server side pretty

384
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:21,470
difficult to break server-side

385
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:23,930
components and that's why we saw them

386
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:26,030
moved to the de client side it was much

387
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:28,910
more robust in terms of the the

388
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:32,740
insertion of the code and without

389
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:35,210
causing any additional problems you'll

390
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:37,850
be sharp ones among you will notice that

391
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:40,940
I've jumped from group 1 to group 3

392
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:43,429
grouped who we initially categorize the

393
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:45,320
the monetization activity of Group one

394
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:46,490
as a second group and then we brought

395
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:48,200
them together when we realized it was

396
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:51,200
actually the same operators doing the

397
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:55,070
same work so moving on to group three

398
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:57,470
these guys it sort of industrialized the

399
00:17:55,070 --> 00:18:00,770
process they built out forms for a large

400
00:17:57,470 --> 00:18:03,710
number of the of the different payment

401
00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:05,300
processing systems that are available if

402
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:10,010
you look at this code you'll see it's

403
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:14,149
got a way add yen rad web these are all

404
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:15,890
very common processing systems and just

405
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:17,840
to make it easier you know the keylogger

406
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:19,940
meant you'd have to do some parsing on

407
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:21,439
the data to find the the credit card

408
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:24,530
information within the data that you've

409
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:26,780
just pilfered by creating those forms

410
00:18:24,530 --> 00:18:30,590
they just make it much easier to bring

411
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:35,149
the data route group for entered the

412
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:39,169
market this is probably late 2017 we saw

413
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:45,100
these guys maybe early 2018 they came

414
00:18:39,170 --> 00:18:47,870
from the banking Trojan environment so

415
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:49,340
you know these guys have been doing this

416
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:51,500
for a long time they obviously realized

417
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:55,370
that there was low-hanging fruit here

418
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:57,740
and built out their capabilities the

419
00:18:55,370 --> 00:19:00,139
snip of code there shows that them doing

420
00:18:57,740 --> 00:19:01,940
counter analysis activity in their

421
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:04,370
JavaScript their original JavaScript

422
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:06,230
about fifteen hundred lines of code so

423
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:08,330
you know well I want to talk about

424
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:10,280
Ticketmaster that was 67 lines of code

425
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:12,530
this is much beefier not nearly as

426
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:15,740
efficient but interesting in how they

427
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:17,720
were doing timing analysis to see if it

428
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:22,100
was a machine looking at their code

429
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:24,910
rather than just a human victim if they

430
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:27,679
did detect machine analysis then they

431
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:33,200
they provide benign JavaScript rather

432
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:34,310
than the the the nasty stuff group five

433
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:38,420
these are the guys that caught

434
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:42,010
Ticketmaster out as I say they went for

435
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:45,590
a third party and the results were

436
00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:47,180
exceptional if you tally up the number

437
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:49,429
of sites that we found which have been

438
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:50,510
compromised by group five there's over

439
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:53,270
20,000

440
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:54,770
it's there you know some of them will be

441
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:57,680
low volume some of them at high volume

442
00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:59,650
but yeah they've just found a simple

443
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:01,850
script that they can insert into any

444
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:05,900
presumably vulnerable JavaScript it's

445
00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:07,639
out there it's in plugins so they've

446
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:09,920
only had to compromise where there

447
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:12,650
really is 10/10 systems and they've had

448
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:16,550
fantastic results from it 20,000 other

449
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:18,350
sites now running major car systems the

450
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:20,870
skimmer itself is nothing unusual it's

451
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:25,939
just the the attack vector went to mass

452
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:28,459
scale rather than rather than so it's

453
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:31,250
focused attacks group six is very

454
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:34,220
focused attacks we haven't seen a huge

455
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:37,480
number of sites compromised by these

456
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:39,230
guys but when they do it's usually big I

457
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:40,580
would have talked about this I don't

458
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:42,470
want to go into too much detail but just

459
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:46,310
to come back to that that'd be a ways

460
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:50,420
calm I love the way that their URL also

461
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:52,790
follows the the syntax coming from the

462
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:55,220
the legitimate be a site similar with

463
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:59,990
new egg new egg is a u.s. online

464
00:20:55,220 --> 00:21:02,120
shopping site new x.com if they followed

465
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:04,010
the capitalization from the legitimate

466
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:06,530
site it's just such a you know great

467
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:11,360
attention to detail I can't help but

468
00:21:06,530 --> 00:21:15,050
admire it group seven these guys caught

469
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:17,030
our attention simply because they're not

470
00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:19,720
doing the standard exfil they're using

471
00:21:17,030 --> 00:21:22,520
compromised domains legitimate domains

472
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:24,710
find that find a subdomain that they can

473
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:26,870
actually all the data to and then

474
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:29,030
transfer the data from there makes it

475
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:33,409
much harder for takedown to take place

476
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:36,980
we've been working with abuse CH and

477
00:21:33,410 --> 00:21:39,410
shadow server on a very regular basis as

478
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:41,150
we as we identify a new infrastructure

479
00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:43,850
being stirred up around any of the major

480
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:47,000
contactors we're working with them to

481
00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:48,560
carry out takedowns these guys are much

482
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,880
harder to do because the domain is

483
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:51,950
legitimate then you have to kind of

484
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:54,410
follow a you know contact an

485
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:56,690
organisation is this your domain who

486
00:21:54,410 --> 00:21:59,300
ministers it did you know you're being

487
00:21:56,690 --> 00:22:01,810
used as a mule blah blah blah it takes a

488
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:05,100
lot longer it's much harder to do

489
00:22:01,810 --> 00:22:09,730
that up to group seven took us up to

490
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:11,919
roundabout the end of last year since

491
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:15,880
then we've seen another six or seven

492
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:17,920
groups popping up and we're now starting

493
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:19,570
to get a little bit sort of more

494
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:21,670
detailed in terms of when we attribute

495
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:23,530
them it's just becoming too much work um

496
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:26,700
and following the attribution you know

497
00:22:23,530 --> 00:22:29,200
eight and ten in this group essentially

498
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:30,460
you know there is nothing new in what

499
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,410
they're doing other than the fact it's

500
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:33,850
new infrastructure so again we will work

501
00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:35,620
to take down their infrastructure but

502
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:36,939
we're not particularly tracking the

503
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:41,229
people who are just doing copycat of

504
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:43,060
everything else group 9 is is possibly

505
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:47,980
one of my favorites credit servility

506
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:55,419
group who actually posted about this for

507
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:57,850
this one so group three were compromised

508
00:22:55,420 --> 00:23:00,970
a site they were happily skimming the

509
00:22:57,850 --> 00:23:05,260
data was good this this is nice and then

510
00:23:00,970 --> 00:23:06,940
group nine compromised debt and you know

511
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:11,170
you'd think that they might coexist

512
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:16,060
peacefully but they didn't group nine

513
00:23:11,170 --> 00:23:17,860
changed their code so that whenever they

514
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:20,250
detected that the mage three activity

515
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:23,229
that's part of the group three activity

516
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:24,640
they generate a random number replace

517
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:26,500
one of the numbers in the credit card

518
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:30,550
with that random number and then send

519
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:34,720
that to group three there is no honor

520
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:37,629
among thieves the last speaker was

521
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:40,750
saying you know reputation is everything

522
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:42,760
on the dark web and if you can trash the

523
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:44,620
data that they're trying to sell you're

524
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:48,100
really working to take out your

525
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:50,370
opposition is just you know a love

526
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:52,870
lovely example that was found their

527
00:23:50,370 --> 00:23:56,229
group eleven

528
00:23:52,870 --> 00:23:57,909
this was vision direct vision direct

529
00:23:56,230 --> 00:24:00,490
when they announced that they'd been

530
00:23:57,910 --> 00:24:04,140
compromised said it was only the UK and

531
00:24:00,490 --> 00:24:06,220
one or two other sites we saw it on a

532
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:08,500
significantly more infrastructure I

533
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:11,440
think all of those listed there one of

534
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:15,330
eighteen is it we're all compromised at

535
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:18,340
the same time they introduced

536
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:20,949
more keywords I talked about one stuck

537
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:22,629
checkout and I come over the other while

538
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:26,380
buying out or something

539
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:27,670
these guys added admin account login and

540
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:30,520
password and this has been something

541
00:24:27,670 --> 00:24:32,290
that's been in the back of my mind ever

542
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:37,360
since we started talking about these

543
00:24:32,290 --> 00:24:38,830
injections is you know credit cards are

544
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:44,979
just a tip of the iceberg aren't they

545
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:50,980
what else could you collect any any site

546
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:55,690
that collects information and runs

547
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:57,640
JavaScript I suppose is is a is a target

548
00:24:55,690 --> 00:24:59,590
and these guys have just broadened that

549
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:00,580
reach so to say yeah we can collect

550
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:04,149
anything we don't know what we'll get

551
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:06,100
who knows but a lot of the injections

552
00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:08,610
that we're seeing you know we believe at

553
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:11,949
least they're automated and they're just

554
00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:15,370
pray and pray their code into whatever

555
00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:17,230
JavaScript they can why not why not see

556
00:25:15,370 --> 00:25:18,790
if you strike lucky with with some of

557
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:20,020
the account login information you never

558
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:22,720
know what might come back so I thought

559
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:24,240
that was an interesting development and

560
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:28,900
I wonder if we will see anybody else

561
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:29,680
sort of going further with that group

562
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:31,810
twelve

563
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:33,730
these guys are interesting I mean

564
00:25:31,810 --> 00:25:35,740
they're using script tags which we

565
00:25:33,730 --> 00:25:38,190
haven't seen in many of the other groups

566
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:42,280
it's much more plug-and-play

567
00:25:38,190 --> 00:25:44,560
they compromised ad the line AB company

568
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:46,030
and that got them again just great

569
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:49,300
coverage you can cover a huge amount of

570
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:52,870
ground if you're if people are actively

571
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:55,240
putting your compromised code onto on

572
00:25:52,870 --> 00:25:57,820
too many sites so nice coverage that

573
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:59,530
they achieved there and they broadened

574
00:25:57,820 --> 00:26:01,990
out into French in German now to date

575
00:25:59,530 --> 00:26:06,370
we've been seeing mainly English some

576
00:26:01,990 --> 00:26:07,960
some Latin American Spanish but these

577
00:26:06,370 --> 00:26:09,729
guys broadened it to French and German

578
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:10,390
as well so again we're seeing nice

579
00:26:09,730 --> 00:26:13,000
seeing a little bit more

580
00:26:10,390 --> 00:26:14,800
internationalization in terms of the the

581
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,150
targets that we're seeing why why

582
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:19,629
shouldn't the French and the Germans get

583
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:22,960
skimmed as well oh and that's just

584
00:26:19,630 --> 00:26:24,490
breaking out the script tag so Group

585
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:27,850
four I talked about these were the guys

586
00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:31,869
that came from the banking

587
00:26:27,850 --> 00:26:34,678
the Trojan environment have completely

588
00:26:31,869 --> 00:26:36,939
rewritten their code it's now 150 lines

589
00:26:34,679 --> 00:26:40,119
previously it was more of a fishing

590
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:41,529
overlay now they're they're doing you

591
00:26:40,119 --> 00:26:45,609
know what we considered to be more sort

592
00:26:41,529 --> 00:26:48,669
of mainline skimming they've really

593
00:26:45,609 --> 00:26:51,389
started to change their behavior they're

594
00:26:48,669 --> 00:26:54,039
now only putting five domains per IP

595
00:26:51,389 --> 00:26:55,840
they're going to more hosting providers

596
00:26:54,039 --> 00:26:58,210
than we've seen previously we think

597
00:26:55,840 --> 00:27:02,049
that's a direct result of the takedowns

598
00:26:58,210 --> 00:27:04,299
that we're doing the good news is that

599
00:27:02,049 --> 00:27:06,729
we're not using you're only using the

600
00:27:04,299 --> 00:27:08,320
infrastructure piece in the last the

601
00:27:06,729 --> 00:27:10,090
last step of the puzzle just to broaden

602
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:11,678
out what they're doing the initial

603
00:27:10,090 --> 00:27:13,928
detection has nothing to do with the

604
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:16,320
infrastructure so they can keep on

605
00:27:13,929 --> 00:27:19,960
running and hiding and shuffling but it

606
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:22,090
fortunately manages to get detected

607
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:23,619
anyway I was quite impressed that they

608
00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:25,779
started to include encryption in their

609
00:27:23,619 --> 00:27:27,970
new piece of code as well at least

610
00:27:25,779 --> 00:27:34,269
they're mindful of PCI DSS regulations

611
00:27:27,970 --> 00:27:37,779
so that that's good and this one this

612
00:27:34,269 --> 00:27:41,099
one's kind of hot hot off the press we

613
00:27:37,779 --> 00:27:43,179
saw a sudden dramatic spike in

614
00:27:41,099 --> 00:27:47,080
injections that we were detecting about

615
00:27:43,179 --> 00:27:48,789
two weeks ago I've put tens of thousands

616
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:50,859
and then possibly hundreds of thousands

617
00:27:48,789 --> 00:27:52,029
at this point in the investigation I

618
00:27:50,859 --> 00:27:54,099
couldn't tell if it was just the

619
00:27:52,029 --> 00:27:56,619
researcher getting excited or if it was

620
00:27:54,099 --> 00:27:59,979
genuine genuinely hundreds of thousands

621
00:27:56,619 --> 00:28:01,209
of site that were being impacted and we

622
00:27:59,979 --> 00:28:02,559
couldn't work out where the spike was

623
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:04,330
coming from the guys were sort of

624
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:06,428
starving so sort of pull the threads and

625
00:28:04,330 --> 00:28:09,609
seed so you see what the common factor

626
00:28:06,429 --> 00:28:13,599
was and it seemed that the JavaScript

627
00:28:09,609 --> 00:28:18,070
that was compromised in all of these

628
00:28:13,599 --> 00:28:20,229
different cases was being hosted on s3

629
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:21,580
buckets not just sorry I don't mean one

630
00:28:20,229 --> 00:28:22,869
JavaScript with all of the different

631
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:26,769
Java scripts that were being used with

632
00:28:22,869 --> 00:28:28,059
being hosted on different s3 buckets and

633
00:28:26,769 --> 00:28:32,320
so they started looking a bit further

634
00:28:28,059 --> 00:28:38,139
and then they kind of realized these s3

635
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:39,928
buckets are all world writable is that

636
00:28:38,139 --> 00:28:41,990
impossible

637
00:28:39,929 --> 00:28:45,179
I couldn't believe that I was watching

638
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:46,440
pull your presentation earlier and I was

639
00:28:45,179 --> 00:28:49,080
waiting for you to bring up a slide that

640
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:52,139
showed don't let your buckets be world

641
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:53,639
writable and I try to find a screenshot

642
00:28:52,139 --> 00:28:55,860
that showed where they would you know

643
00:28:53,639 --> 00:28:58,408
somehow default to be world writable

644
00:28:55,860 --> 00:29:01,469
people are hosting JavaScript that other

645
00:28:58,409 --> 00:29:03,779
people are using in s3 buckets which are

646
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:06,509
completely editable you download it

647
00:29:03,779 --> 00:29:12,210
insert your skimmer upload it back up

648
00:29:06,509 --> 00:29:14,009
and hey happy days right we're gonna go

649
00:29:12,210 --> 00:29:16,080
public with this not not with the names

650
00:29:14,009 --> 00:29:19,169
of the people infected but just to say

651
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:20,610
that for God's sake don't put world

652
00:29:19,169 --> 00:29:23,220
writable files on the internet unless

653
00:29:20,610 --> 00:29:24,809
you really really really mean to two of

654
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:29,789
the victims we've identified a prepaid

655
00:29:24,809 --> 00:29:33,960
credit card providers yeah this is it's

656
00:29:29,789 --> 00:29:35,340
great stuff right other updates just

657
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:36,659
sort of things that we've found you know

658
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:40,918
I try to keep a list of the things that

659
00:29:36,659 --> 00:29:43,649
are going on group seven these guys came

660
00:29:40,919 --> 00:29:46,019
from from the malware environment and

661
00:29:43,649 --> 00:29:47,248
they initially they started just doing

662
00:29:46,019 --> 00:29:52,230
this but they had a little look at doing

663
00:29:47,249 --> 00:29:53,999
malware drops so again another another

664
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:55,860
to a possible bacteria when you when

665
00:29:53,999 --> 00:29:57,779
you're when you're when you finally got

666
00:29:55,860 --> 00:30:00,360
a compromised site what else can you do

667
00:29:57,779 --> 00:30:02,730
other than just skim skim credit cards

668
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:04,709
we haven't really seen that evolve into

669
00:30:02,730 --> 00:30:06,389
anything other than their tests we just

670
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:07,740
saw changes in their code it showed what

671
00:30:06,389 --> 00:30:08,939
they were experimenting with maybe

672
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:11,789
they're now doing their experiments

673
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:13,860
offline we're not sure we saw text

674
00:30:11,789 --> 00:30:18,210
support scammers trying to join in that

675
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:19,709
was based off the infrastructure we saw

676
00:30:18,210 --> 00:30:22,409
the same infrastructure that's being

677
00:30:19,710 --> 00:30:25,139
used for tech support scams being used

678
00:30:22,409 --> 00:30:26,460
for skimming they weren't successful I

679
00:30:25,139 --> 00:30:29,039
guess that's why the tech support

680
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:30,059
scammers are not tech support is you've

681
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:33,330
got to know what you're doing in order

682
00:30:30,059 --> 00:30:35,549
to do this there's about 20 off the

683
00:30:33,330 --> 00:30:37,199
shelf skimmers now if you look in some

684
00:30:35,549 --> 00:30:39,059
of the difference or a dark web forums

685
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:41,999
different prices different availability

686
00:30:39,059 --> 00:30:44,249
different support available and we're

687
00:30:41,999 --> 00:30:46,049
seeing obviously the last couple weeks

688
00:30:44,249 --> 00:30:49,409
aside because it's been dramatically

689
00:30:46,049 --> 00:30:52,080
different but about 40 to 50 major car

690
00:30:49,409 --> 00:30:52,750
compromises a day I I think that's the

691
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:58,600
absolutely

692
00:30:52,750 --> 00:31:01,120
tip of the iceberg we are not targeting

693
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:02,980
our crawlers on payment pages we are not

694
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:05,860
out there looking for mage guys it's

695
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:07,809
just we keep finding it and it's our

696
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:10,209
estimate that if we were to target the

697
00:31:07,809 --> 00:31:12,730
crawlers to look for it specifically go

698
00:31:10,210 --> 00:31:14,970
for every payment page you can we reckon

699
00:31:12,730 --> 00:31:17,080
this would be up to the 500 mm mark

700
00:31:14,970 --> 00:31:20,289
we're just finding enough to keep us

701
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:24,960
busy we don't need any more but it's

702
00:31:20,289 --> 00:31:27,400
just interesting to see that so

703
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:28,990
vulnerabilities is the main one I think

704
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:30,340
in terms of how they're getting insert

705
00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:33,400
and the automated scripts that we're

706
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:35,559
seeing you know just either old or

707
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:38,860
vulnerable codes being used to carry out

708
00:31:35,559 --> 00:31:41,200
these injects injections third-party

709
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:46,299
scripts just broadens the reach that you

710
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:48,640
get as you as you compromise different

711
00:31:46,299 --> 00:31:51,970
scripts and then we are seeing focus

712
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:55,539
compromises also BPA will you know

713
00:31:51,970 --> 00:31:59,289
certainly a targeted very very specific

714
00:31:55,539 --> 00:32:02,200
and targeted compromise different levels

715
00:31:59,289 --> 00:32:04,150
of sophistication as I've said and then

716
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:06,280
different exfil processes although to be

717
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:09,059
fair we only releasing one group using

718
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:13,000
the proxy proxy process to deliver the

719
00:32:09,059 --> 00:32:15,129
deliver the code so broadening out as I

720
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:19,650
said at the beginning I think card

721
00:32:15,130 --> 00:32:24,210
skimming is there's only really one

722
00:32:19,650 --> 00:32:26,679
application of Java based injection

723
00:32:24,210 --> 00:32:30,220
there are all sorts of other things you

724
00:32:26,679 --> 00:32:31,870
can do form form jacking you know just

725
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:33,520
just gathering the data it's similar to

726
00:32:31,870 --> 00:32:36,010
card skimming but also cryptocurrency

727
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:39,610
miners we're not seeing a huge amount of

728
00:32:36,010 --> 00:32:41,799
Bitcoin mining at the moment nine months

729
00:32:39,610 --> 00:32:43,299
ago we were seeing a lot more I don't

730
00:32:41,799 --> 00:32:45,340
think that's because it's not difficult

731
00:32:43,299 --> 00:32:47,650
I don't think it's because people don't

732
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:49,899
want you know can't do it I think it's

733
00:32:47,650 --> 00:32:51,429
just the Bitcoin prices crashed nurse

734
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:53,020
just easier to monetize through other

735
00:32:51,429 --> 00:32:56,140
means at the moment and give Bitcoin

736
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:59,289
goes back in price then we will probably

737
00:32:56,140 --> 00:33:02,530
see more Bitcoin miners being inserted

738
00:32:59,289 --> 00:33:05,200
into different sites water-holding the

739
00:33:02,530 --> 00:33:08,799
snip on the right is an

740
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:14,590
example of a water-holding attack this

741
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:17,620
is an RFC edge case if you browsers

742
00:33:14,590 --> 00:33:19,959
don't worry so much about images as they

743
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:23,379
do about executable files if you can

744
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:28,260
insert a file an image file into a

745
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:33,190
webpage then it passes some of the

746
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:38,169
inspections in this case that snip was

747
00:33:33,190 --> 00:33:40,779
on a Ukrainian IT website and if you

748
00:33:38,169 --> 00:33:42,370
went to it maybe a Ukrainian IT

749
00:33:40,779 --> 00:33:43,889
administrator was having a tea break

750
00:33:42,370 --> 00:33:46,149
it's going to catch up on the news

751
00:33:43,889 --> 00:33:48,250
you're in the middle of reading a very

752
00:33:46,149 --> 00:33:50,830
interesting article on whatever it is

753
00:33:48,250 --> 00:33:52,179
and then SMB window pops up saying one

754
00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:53,408
of your connections has timed out you

755
00:33:52,179 --> 00:33:56,320
just want to quickly add your admin

756
00:33:53,409 --> 00:33:57,760
username and password and get back to

757
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:59,289
your cup of tea and your news article

758
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:03,039
and of course this is just fishing you

759
00:33:59,289 --> 00:34:04,870
know about information so just a good

760
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:06,549
example of a water holing attack and

761
00:34:04,870 --> 00:34:07,840
then just finger printers we see a lot

762
00:34:06,549 --> 00:34:11,409
of people just simply collecting

763
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:12,819
information for whatever means they may

764
00:34:11,409 --> 00:34:14,589
be using that data for whether it's

765
00:34:12,819 --> 00:34:16,690
traffic weary directors driving traffic

766
00:34:14,589 --> 00:34:19,089
to different places you know it's hard

767
00:34:16,690 --> 00:34:20,589
to work out I do see this as the new

768
00:34:19,089 --> 00:34:23,889
front line I think lots of people have

769
00:34:20,589 --> 00:34:28,599
invested huge time and resources in

770
00:34:23,889 --> 00:34:32,950
securing their data in their data

771
00:34:28,599 --> 00:34:35,050
centers and for good reason

772
00:34:32,949 --> 00:34:38,549
you know that that's probably the best

773
00:34:35,050 --> 00:34:40,780
place to start but it means that

774
00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:42,550
criminal groups are now looking at other

775
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:45,040
ways to steal information and I think

776
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:46,929
this is a great place to do it I was

777
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:49,639
talking to a friend the other day who

778
00:34:46,929 --> 00:34:50,819
was saying their mortgage application

779
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:54,609
[Music]

780
00:34:50,819 --> 00:34:57,069
this year was completely online two

781
00:34:54,609 --> 00:35:00,009
years ago I got a piece of paper that I

782
00:34:57,069 --> 00:35:02,440
had to sign and send back but you know

783
00:35:00,010 --> 00:35:04,900
all of that data is going through client

784
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:08,710
browsers which are not policed and

785
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:10,510
monitored in the same way as all of

786
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:16,150
those traditional systems that you would

787
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:18,580
find in major organizations so this data

788
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:22,180
is out there and it's available to be

789
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:23,590
to be taken I'm running out of time so I

790
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:27,910
need to speed up a little bit don't know

791
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:28,720
how I'm doing five minutes thank you so

792
00:35:27,910 --> 00:35:31,450
we were just looking at different

793
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:34,540
injection types the script tag that I

794
00:35:31,450 --> 00:35:35,950
showed you from major cart group 12 it's

795
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:37,420
just nice and easy it's plug and play

796
00:35:35,950 --> 00:35:41,049
makes it much easier to automate the

797
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:43,210
process of adding script tags the supply

798
00:35:41,050 --> 00:35:46,930
chain so the ticket master breach

799
00:35:43,210 --> 00:35:48,280
inventor that was just nicely done the

800
00:35:46,930 --> 00:35:50,109
third parties aren't necessarily a

801
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:52,030
security organization that you're

802
00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:55,000
targeting so it's just a nice way of

803
00:35:52,030 --> 00:35:57,300
breaking in putting those scripts at the

804
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:59,800
top or the bottom it's easier to detect

805
00:35:57,300 --> 00:36:02,680
but it's also least likely to break

806
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:04,780
anything I've seen a few examples in the

807
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:06,850
last month of scripts that have been

808
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:08,980
injected and broke the broke the script

809
00:36:06,850 --> 00:36:11,770
that they were trying to inject in so it

810
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:17,530
can go wrong if you try to get too too

811
00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:20,440
cute we do see them trying to put the

812
00:36:17,530 --> 00:36:22,870
injection into the executable scope

813
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:25,270
rather than you know making a mistake

814
00:36:22,870 --> 00:36:27,190
and only runs on certain occasions and

815
00:36:25,270 --> 00:36:36,580
bento would be a good example of that

816
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:38,470
that was customer help tool and if there

817
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:39,759
haven't been any executable scope they'd

818
00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:41,740
only be able to collect the credit card

819
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:43,450
details when someone was asking for help

820
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:45,459
and they probably get all of their

821
00:36:43,450 --> 00:36:48,100
conversation as well as the credit card

822
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:49,990
data function inlining is just quite a

823
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:52,089
nice way of doing it it's quite quite

824
00:36:49,990 --> 00:36:54,759
tidy just suddenly add a new function to

825
00:36:52,090 --> 00:36:57,160
an existing one and again much harder to

826
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:59,500
spot than the RFC educators the example

827
00:36:57,160 --> 00:37:02,200
I gave you at the beginning the watering

828
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:05,140
hole attack I'm super envious other

829
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:07,390
people that can read those RFC reports

830
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:09,460
in detail understand them and then find

831
00:37:07,390 --> 00:37:11,980
the vulnerabilities within them but

832
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:13,810
those people do exist and my respect to

833
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:17,710
them even if they're doing doing it for

834
00:37:13,810 --> 00:37:21,190
all the wrong reasons in terms of how

835
00:37:17,710 --> 00:37:24,100
can you protect yourself you know I

836
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:26,290
think I think I work for risk IQ we talk

837
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:29,290
about managing your external attack

838
00:37:26,290 --> 00:37:31,450
surface and that for me is the way to go

839
00:37:29,290 --> 00:37:32,380
here you need to understand what assets

840
00:37:31,450 --> 00:37:35,319
you've got I would

841
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:37,450
now whether you could say you know how

842
00:37:35,319 --> 00:37:39,549
many websites your organization actually

843
00:37:37,450 --> 00:37:41,950
has very much doubt that any of you

844
00:37:39,549 --> 00:37:44,259
could give me an accurate number and I

845
00:37:41,950 --> 00:37:47,348
think that's just as again the tip of

846
00:37:44,259 --> 00:37:48,880
the iceberg how many of you know what

847
00:37:47,349 --> 00:37:50,680
JavaScript you're hosting on your site

848
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:52,779
how much of that javascript is hosted

849
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:54,999
locally how much of it is by third

850
00:37:52,779 --> 00:37:58,450
parties how much of it is on world

851
00:37:54,999 --> 00:38:00,609
writable s3 buckets so you need to

852
00:37:58,450 --> 00:38:01,868
understand your external attack surface

853
00:38:00,609 --> 00:38:03,130
you need to manage that you need to

854
00:38:01,869 --> 00:38:04,509
bring it under control make sure

855
00:38:03,130 --> 00:38:06,130
everything is patched and not leave

856
00:38:04,509 --> 00:38:08,849
things out there which shouldn't be out

857
00:38:06,130 --> 00:38:12,729
there talking about JavaScript

858
00:38:08,849 --> 00:38:14,769
specifically iframes sandboxing a lot of

859
00:38:12,729 --> 00:38:15,729
people criticize BA not for not having

860
00:38:14,769 --> 00:38:19,328
iframes

861
00:38:15,729 --> 00:38:20,950
in operation on on the payment page I've

862
00:38:19,329 --> 00:38:23,170
seen a lot to talk about content

863
00:38:20,950 --> 00:38:25,538
security policy sub resource integrity

864
00:38:23,170 --> 00:38:28,150
checking all super good things they will

865
00:38:25,539 --> 00:38:30,970
definitely make it a lot harder to do

866
00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:32,819
this I also think that's much easier

867
00:38:30,970 --> 00:38:36,118
said than done

868
00:38:32,819 --> 00:38:38,859
the you know the complexity of a lot of

869
00:38:36,119 --> 00:38:40,749
web infrastructure now doesn't mean you

870
00:38:38,859 --> 00:38:42,880
can just flick this stuff on and go yeah

871
00:38:40,749 --> 00:38:44,709
we're done it we're much secure there

872
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:46,930
are projects behind us and significant

873
00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:49,359
you know forklift changes that need to

874
00:38:46,930 --> 00:38:52,660
be made to make these work I also worry

875
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:56,140
that for some of some of the breaches

876
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:59,348
that we've seen where the the code has

877
00:38:56,140 --> 00:39:02,049
been highly customized whether some of

878
00:38:59,349 --> 00:39:05,259
these these mechanisms can be bypassed

879
00:39:02,049 --> 00:39:08,170
as well we saw one group arguing with a

880
00:39:05,259 --> 00:39:11,979
web administrator in a document object

881
00:39:08,170 --> 00:39:15,309
model the it was infected the

882
00:39:11,979 --> 00:39:19,180
administrator removed it the the major

883
00:39:15,309 --> 00:39:20,680
card group said we put it back stop it

884
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:22,509
the next time they said you're very

885
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:24,819
naughty admins next time you do this we

886
00:39:22,509 --> 00:39:27,460
will delete your site if you have that

887
00:39:24,819 --> 00:39:30,130
much access access to it to a system

888
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:33,309
then these policies are probably not

889
00:39:30,130 --> 00:39:34,809
going to protect you and that brings me

890
00:39:33,309 --> 00:39:39,759
to my last point which is continuous

891
00:39:34,809 --> 00:39:42,039
auditing again you know ba was three

892
00:39:39,759 --> 00:39:44,739
months Ticketmaster was three months in

893
00:39:42,039 --> 00:39:45,200
the UK nine months in total we're seeing

894
00:39:44,739 --> 00:39:47,630
more

895
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:50,689
or of these I think last week Leicester

896
00:39:47,630 --> 00:39:53,330
City Football Club got popped anybody by

897
00:39:50,690 --> 00:39:56,740
a Leicester City football shirt in in

898
00:39:53,330 --> 00:40:00,310
May if you did check your credit card

899
00:39:56,740 --> 00:40:02,750
Forbes got popped the week before then

900
00:40:00,310 --> 00:40:04,790
you know we're seeing this all over the

901
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:07,790
place in these breeches are all there

902
00:40:04,790 --> 00:40:09,500
for weeks if not months you need to be

903
00:40:07,790 --> 00:40:12,560
monitoring for this on a regular basis

904
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:14,330
my shameless plug at the end use risk IQ

905
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:16,310
that's what we do we're really good at

906
00:40:14,330 --> 00:40:18,799
it

907
00:40:16,310 --> 00:40:20,299
so please do I'll be around for the rest

908
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:21,080
of the day please come and talk to me if

909
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:24,140
you want to know more about the

910
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:29,870
presentation or obviously how risk IQ

911
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:34,850
can help and my final piece on your bags

912
00:40:29,870 --> 00:40:37,910
is a big risk IQ logo under that as a

913
00:40:34,850 --> 00:40:39,230
promo code for passive total if you

914
00:40:37,910 --> 00:40:40,759
would like to do some of the

915
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:41,840
investigations you can put in some of

916
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:44,300
the domains that I've shared in

917
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:46,040
presentation today you can do some of

918
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:48,020
your own investigations with that promo

919
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:50,270
code and give you extra searches on

920
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:52,340
passive total thank you very much for

921
00:40:50,270 --> 00:40:55,070
your time today I don't know whether

922
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:56,240
I've got time for any questions there

923
00:40:55,070 --> 00:40:58,250
are any questions I'm happy to try and

924
00:40:56,240 --> 00:41:00,470
take them sorry I didn't warn you

925
00:40:58,250 --> 00:41:06,560
earlier did I to action with the

926
00:41:00,470 --> 00:41:09,830
microphones any questions was what you

927
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:12,170
saying we do these to use elizy is that

928
00:41:09,830 --> 00:41:14,569
simply checking the JavaScript has

929
00:41:12,170 --> 00:41:18,770
changed and learning when that happens

930
00:41:14,570 --> 00:41:22,280
so for our customers we crawl that that

931
00:41:18,770 --> 00:41:24,380
their their sites on at least a daily

932
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:26,180
basis looking for changes that take

933
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:30,410
place within that environment now we can

934
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:32,210
say if the JavaScript has changed we'll

935
00:41:30,410 --> 00:41:34,009
tell you about it one of the challenges

936
00:41:32,210 --> 00:41:36,140
we've found is the JavaScript changes a

937
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:37,550
lot and therefore you could you you run

938
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:40,430
the risk of getting a lot of noise so

939
00:41:37,550 --> 00:41:43,670
what we've what we've developed is is

940
00:41:40,430 --> 00:41:45,319
specific detection looking at malicious

941
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:47,420
activity and we will alert you when we

942
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:49,310
see malicious activity so you'll get an

943
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:51,860
audit report telling you what's changed

944
00:41:49,310 --> 00:41:53,980
on that maybe a daily or a weekly basis

945
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:56,349
depending on your appetite and then

946
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:58,900
when we see something like I've been

947
00:41:56,349 --> 00:42:03,910
talking about today occurring so you can

948
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:06,400
take more immediate action if you

949
00:42:03,910 --> 00:42:08,529
comment about the link between the VA

950
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:10,060
breach and the inventor stuff because

951
00:42:08,530 --> 00:42:11,589
the better stuff includes loads of

952
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:14,470
creative cedras doesn't it

953
00:42:11,589 --> 00:42:16,799
I'm sorry could you comment on the link

954
00:42:14,470 --> 00:42:18,970
between the be a breach and the Benza

955
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:22,720
scripts because the adventure scripts

956
00:42:18,970 --> 00:42:32,430
include the agency G's in the list of

957
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:36,609
affected parts or is that news you mean

958
00:42:32,430 --> 00:42:47,649
the be a reusing inventor on their

959
00:42:36,609 --> 00:42:49,540
website so I do know that there were I

960
00:42:47,650 --> 00:42:52,030
think I think when we looked at it over

961
00:42:49,540 --> 00:42:56,550
30 different scripts running on the be a

962
00:42:52,030 --> 00:42:58,470
payment pages when we analyzed it I

963
00:42:56,550 --> 00:43:01,900
haven't looked at it in light of

964
00:42:58,470 --> 00:43:05,799
inventor and whether they were

965
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:07,089
potentially compromised two ways be

966
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:10,740
interesting to go back and take a look

967
00:43:07,089 --> 00:43:13,390
see if I can spot that they were

968
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:15,790
completely separate breaches if that was

969
00:43:13,390 --> 00:43:19,690
the case then that that's a fascinating

970
00:43:15,790 --> 00:43:24,060
byline to the story inventor you know

971
00:43:19,690 --> 00:43:28,750
came out in June and announced this ba

972
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:30,339
was after that we the attribution that

973
00:43:28,750 --> 00:43:33,760
we've given us is two very very

974
00:43:30,339 --> 00:43:37,000
different groups major cart groups six

975
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:38,319
are highly focused on you know specific

976
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:42,339
compromise they're not going for that

977
00:43:38,319 --> 00:43:44,079
broad brush approach but no I haven't

978
00:43:42,339 --> 00:43:45,730
seen that inventor was specifically on

979
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:47,589
the VA website I haven't thought to

980
00:43:45,730 --> 00:43:48,640
correlate that back but I'll go back and

981
00:43:47,589 --> 00:43:55,210
take a look it would be an interesting

982
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:56,920
thing to look for thank you right oh one

983
00:43:55,210 --> 00:43:58,900
more question go on if I've got time

984
00:43:56,920 --> 00:44:01,090
