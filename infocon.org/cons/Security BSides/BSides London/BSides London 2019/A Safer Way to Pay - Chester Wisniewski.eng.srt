1
00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:08,580
thank you good morning everyone I

2
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:11,219
apologize a few we're looking at the

3
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:12,480
guide and saw my photograph and thought

4
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:15,059
I was a bit younger that was before

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:18,060
brexit in gdpr and the Trump election

6
00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:20,549
and many other things but I briefly

7
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:22,349
talked just for a second about what I do

8
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:24,480
I have a pretty interesting job at sofas

9
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:25,830
and then I get to do research and come

10
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:29,130
to events like this all over the world

11
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:30,900
and unlike most of our folks that their

12
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:32,369
research is much more directed like the

13
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:34,589
focus obviously that work in our labs

14
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:37,019
are reverse engineering malware and

15
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:39,360
researching all the ecosystem around how

16
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:40,829
that works my job is a little bit

17
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,089
outside of that and I get to kind of

18
00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:43,680
look at the bigger picture and look at a

19
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:47,460
lot of other things that interact and

20
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:48,629
often may finance or move forward a lot

21
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:50,100
of the criminal stuff that we're trying

22
00:00:48,629 --> 00:00:52,500
to block with our products right so

23
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:54,960
things like IOT or in this case Payment

24
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:57,600
Systems in a way all have interactions

25
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,190
with our customers and fund and fuel

26
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,469
cybercrime often but they may not be

27
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:03,180
something that we're writing software to

28
00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:04,680
protect or selling a product about right

29
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:07,110
so my time team kind of looks at all

30
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:09,659
these things around the edges that

31
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:11,760
influence the stuff that we do and for

32
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:13,439
me that's all this particular stop at

33
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,450
the topic started five years ago I was

34
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:17,880
doing a lot of research back then on

35
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:19,920
malware scanning with credit card

36
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:21,600
skimming malware and it was a big

37
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,189
problem especially in the United States

38
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,020
as you know the target attack had just

39
00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:26,429
happened in America millions of credit

40
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:29,070
cards were being posted to the dark web

41
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:31,200
on a regular basis and we were seeing

42
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:33,000
lots and lots of the iterations of

43
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,799
interesting malware trying to steal

44
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,180
credit card data now that's mostly gone

45
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,590
away we don't really see much other than

46
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:39,869
you've probably heard about mage cart I

47
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:42,420
know in particular it be a here and the

48
00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:43,979
UK there is you know so there's a little

49
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:46,020
bit of activity still out there but most

50
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:47,909
of the credit card skimming malware was

51
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:49,950
gone but while I was doing that research

52
00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:51,780
I just ran across so many interesting

53
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:53,610
things that I had to kind of go down the

54
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:55,320
rabbit hole and figure out how the

55
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:56,909
entire payment systems actually work

56
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:58,860
from start to finish they're not very

57
00:01:56,909 --> 00:02:00,869
well documented there's they seem to be

58
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:02,549
intentionally office gated I present on

59
00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:03,570
all this originally at V sides Vancouver

60
00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:06,479
in 2014

61
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:07,740
and just really interesting things like

62
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:09,030
if you search for credit cards on

63
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:10,378
Twitter it's shocking how many you can

64
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:12,060
get for free

65
00:02:10,378 --> 00:02:12,880
people constantly post pictures of

66
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:15,880
credit and debit card

67
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:17,829
on Twitter including pins it's it's just

68
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:20,380
weird right and we've actually seen a

69
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:21,940
resurgence of old fashioned skimming

70
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:23,769
like literally rubbing pencils over

71
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:25,510
credit cards in taxi cabs and things

72
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:27,760
like this around the world rather than

73
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:29,230
using high-tech methods so there's just

74
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:31,570
all kinds of weird things going on but

75
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:32,649
how do these you know payment systems

76
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:36,310
work especially all these new things

77
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:37,600
because we've all got you know not only

78
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:39,670
do we have chip cards but we're going to

79
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:42,489
tap to pay we got pay wave we got pay

80
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:44,589
pass we've got you know in America

81
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:46,720
they've got venmo now you can you know

82
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:48,880
email people money and in China they got

83
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:50,859
Ally pay a you know Ally pay and WeChat

84
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:52,109
pay and there's lots of innovation

85
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:54,790
happening in payments

86
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:56,440
unfortunately I thought I'd start by

87
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:58,090
looking at what what is the impact been

88
00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:01,030
of this move away from the magnetic

89
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:03,370
stripe and toward EMV as it's known euro

90
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:05,020
card MasterCard and Visa that defined

91
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:06,880
the chip standards and I did this

92
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:08,710
presentation in Vancouver as well for

93
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:10,269
our b-sides and this was the numbers in

94
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:12,430
Canada it's pretty astounding the impact

95
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:15,880
that moving to chip has had in Canada we

96
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:18,460
adopted the new cards in 2008 so after

97
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:21,310
you but long before the Americans did we

98
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:24,340
can see that total fraud of all types

99
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:25,870
went from 245 million dollars a year to

100
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:28,210
67 and a half million dollars a year

101
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:30,010
after the introduction of the chip now

102
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:31,300
card-not-present fraud though doubled

103
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:33,250
which is of course what we would

104
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:35,260
consider mostly all online transactions

105
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:37,090
I mean I suppose a few of you may still

106
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:39,310
shop by catalog and call phone numbers

107
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:41,260
and give your credit card to agents but

108
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:43,360
almost all card-not-present transactions

109
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:45,640
these days are Amazon and things like it

110
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:47,410
and we are seeing a pretty dramatic

111
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:48,880
increase in the amount of online fraud

112
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:52,060
because it's gotten harder and harder to

113
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:53,350
do card-present fraud and I just found

114
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:55,150
there are some interesting stats so I

115
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:57,640
had to do a lot of digging around we're

116
00:03:55,150 --> 00:04:02,410
now doing 93% of our transactions in

117
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:03,609
Canada via chip cards and only 11% of

118
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:05,020
fraud was people literally trying to

119
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:07,740
make duplicate fake cards with like

120
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:11,080
stolen data they bought from criminals

121
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:12,340
now the UK publishes slightly different

122
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:16,090
stats so I wasn't able to do exactly

123
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:18,220
like for like but there is a government

124
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:20,019
website here that tracks financial fraud

125
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:20,979
that publishes a lot in numbers so I was

126
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:23,140
able to pull up a lot of it

127
00:04:20,978 --> 00:04:25,950
unfortunately here since the

128
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:28,080
introduction of chip in 2005 which is

129
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:30,570
that was one chip was mandated most of

130
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,580
you probably got chip cards in 2002-2003

131
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:34,380
so when that banks started issuing them

132
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:38,310
but it was required for merchants to

133
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:39,810
accept them in 2005 and it was 427

134
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:41,520
million pounds now total fraud now is up

135
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:44,580
to six hundred and seventy or 18 million

136
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:46,830
pounds and card-not-present fraud like

137
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:48,539
in Canada went up but not as much as it

138
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:51,030
did in Canada so it's kind of kind of

139
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:52,800
interesting to compare that I don't know

140
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:55,349
why that says in Canada I have a typo so

141
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:57,180
I will pretend that says in the United

142
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:59,460
Kingdom because that's what it means

143
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:01,140
that the number is correct the the the

144
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:04,979
the label is wrong as I copied the

145
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:08,810
previous slide and pasted it and only 6%

146
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:12,330
of fraud here was done via fraudulent or

147
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:14,970
copied cards and ninety-six percent is

148
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:17,280
well they don't measure UK specifically

149
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:18,780
and MasterCard and Visa measure what

150
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:21,690
they call Europe zone one which is

151
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:24,539
pretty much a EU Member States or Europe

152
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:27,030
zone two is the kind of affiliated EU

153
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:29,550
states that aren't quite you so Ukraine

154
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:30,929
for examples Europe zone two whereas

155
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:35,160
Europe zone one is pretty much every

156
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:38,510
European country that that you would

157
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:41,130
think of so kind of interesting you know

158
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:42,840
here's card-present fraud so we do see

159
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:44,610
the card-present part if we just take

160
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:47,070
that out and not the total fraud in the

161
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:50,850
UK there is a precipitous decline after

162
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:53,700
the introduction of the icc chips or the

163
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:57,030
EMV chips you know kind of leveled out

164
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:59,490
here after about 2011 card-not-present

165
00:05:57,030 --> 00:06:01,169
we could see slowly increasing over time

166
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:02,370
especially at the end of the chart so

167
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:04,560
this is really the preferred way to

168
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:05,580
commit credit card fraud these days not

169
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,930
trying to give you ideas if you're

170
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:11,700
looking to become a credit card fraud

171
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:13,590
ster but online is where it's at and

172
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:15,539
again the counterfeits just dropped

173
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:17,340
right off once everybody expected to see

174
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:18,600
a card with a chip I mean it's just it's

175
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:22,530
just - it's not that it's impossible

176
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:23,820
it's just too difficult not worth it you

177
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:27,000
always go for the low-hanging fruit as

178
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:28,980
we learn from the malware authors and in

179
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,390
the adoption in general it's pretty much

180
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:32,760
global now all right there's almost no

181
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:34,320
we're lagging behind except the United

182
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:36,150
States and that's its own bizarreness

183
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:38,750
and as soon as they catch up to us we'll

184
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:39,950
probably see the magnetic stripe go away

185
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:40,820
I'll talk about that a little bit more

186
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:42,650
of a tap because there's some

187
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:43,849
interesting things now one of the

188
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:47,630
problems with doing research in this

189
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:48,890
area is there's a lot of acronyms I mean

190
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:50,600
a lot of acronyms

191
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:53,060
it's just crazy amounts of acronyms and

192
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:56,120
I'm not going to define all of these but

193
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:57,350
there's a few of them that are kind of

194
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:59,510
interesting when you're looking at it

195
00:06:57,350 --> 00:07:02,540
from a security standpoint of course CMP

196
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:04,099
is card-not-present PA n is the primary

197
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:07,580
account number so that's 16 digit on the

198
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:08,990
front is called a pan and the icc is the

199
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:11,870
technical name for the chip it's an

200
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:13,630
integrated circuit chip we've got CPP

201
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:16,190
which is the way we usually detect that

202
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:18,710
somebody's been compromised so CPP means

203
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:20,210
common point of purchase so when you see

204
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:22,700
suddenly a whole bunch of fraud at a

205
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:24,380
given bank Santander sees all kinds of

206
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:26,150
people getting complaining about

207
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:27,620
fraudulent charges they go look for a

208
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:29,659
common point to purchase that all their

209
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:31,010
customers shopped at the same place and

210
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:33,260
then they can figure out that it was the

211
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:34,490
same Sperrys on this road that must had

212
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:36,050
a compromised terminal and was

213
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:37,220
collecting pins or you know whatever was

214
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:39,530
happening that allowed the fraud to

215
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:41,120
happen I think the last really big fraud

216
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:43,159
here in the UK related to this was the

217
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:46,010
Shell gas station a shell pump gas

218
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:47,780
station pumps in 2008-2009 that were

219
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:48,710
rigged up to steal stuff and we'll talk

220
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:50,210
a little bit about that too because

221
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:52,010
there's been some there's been some

222
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:54,560
evolution of the chip it's not the same

223
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:56,270
chip that what's the same chip it's just

224
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,550
implemented differently today than it

225
00:07:56,270 --> 00:08:02,599
was when it was first introduced here in

226
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:05,180
the UK so a modern card if we look at

227
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:06,860
them I mean it's just a smart card right

228
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:08,630
if you if you use a smart card to

229
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:11,200
authenticate to a laptop I was able to

230
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:13,730
buy 10 of these on Amazon for $3.99

231
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:15,500
that's all a modern card is it's the

232
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:16,550
exact same chip you know if you look at

233
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:18,410
it of course the same chip that's the

234
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:20,570
same chip as well it's a sex same design

235
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:22,310
the same concept these little chips

236
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:23,570
actually run an operating system most of

237
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:25,520
the operating systems that run on them

238
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:28,790
are written in Java which is why they're

239
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:30,349
so secure and most of them are produced

240
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:32,300
by Gemalto I mean Gemalto is the largest

241
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:34,550
producer of chip credit cards in the

242
00:08:32,299 --> 00:08:37,939
world most the credit card suppliers are

243
00:08:34,549 --> 00:08:40,549
mostly banks excuse me contract with

244
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:42,860
Gemalto to provide their chip that are

245
00:08:40,549 --> 00:08:44,209
their cards and they're quite easy to

246
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:45,560
read if you have a tap card if you have

247
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:47,480
a pay wave or whatever you can load up

248
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:48,650
an app on your Android am the card

249
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,150
reader there's a bunch of them out there

250
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:50,890
but

251
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:52,390
you'll want to be careful which one you

252
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:53,980
use because it does get all the

253
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:55,449
information for your credit card and if

254
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:57,730
you don't know who supplied you the app

255
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:59,290
you may be in for a surprise so like

256
00:08:57,730 --> 00:09:00,640
myself you may just be careful and use

257
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:03,910
one that's been expired if you want to

258
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:05,589
play around with it and that's actually

259
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:08,680
my credit card information right there

260
00:09:05,589 --> 00:09:10,960
and what you see there is you see it

261
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:13,510
says card a ID so that's an application

262
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:15,220
ID so the little operating system has a

263
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:17,589
file folder structure on it and there's

264
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:19,510
application IDs and those application

265
00:09:17,589 --> 00:09:22,630
IDs define what types of things that

266
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:25,150
card does so technically a card could be

267
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:26,920
a visa and an Amex at the same time it

268
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:28,930
could present multiple application IDs

269
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:29,890
to the payment terminal and it does that

270
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:30,880
if you have one of these I don't if you

271
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:31,960
have them here in the UK and oh they

272
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:34,300
have them in the States we don't have

273
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:35,830
them in Canada yet the ones that are

274
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:37,719
credit cards and debit cards and one

275
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:39,640
card from your bank it actually does

276
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:41,230
that it presents two application IDs to

277
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:42,490
the payment terminal and that's why the

278
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:43,810
payment terminal then prompts you and

279
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:45,670
says oh do you want this to be a credit

280
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:47,229
or a debit transaction because it's

281
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:49,329
seeing that I've got multiple choices

282
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:50,710
that I support for this transaction

283
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:54,640
because this card is presented me with

284
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:55,870
multiple identities if you will so if

285
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:58,089
we're looking at this right you got your

286
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:59,680
payment terminal the first thing the

287
00:09:58,089 --> 00:10:01,089
payment terminal does is query those

288
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,410
application efforts now I've shortened

289
00:10:01,089 --> 00:10:04,570
this down a little bit literally this is

290
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:06,760
like a four hour thing to explain if I

291
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:08,860
had to go through the detail detail but

292
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:09,970
I've con give you the high level it

293
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:11,680
queries for those application

294
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:13,150
identifiers and then it selects the

295
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,620
supported one and if there's more than

296
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:16,750
one that's supported by that payment

297
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:19,180
terminal it provides you with a with a

298
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:21,190
choice this is also why if you have an

299
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:23,739
American Express card which is not very

300
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:25,000
usable here or in Europe if you put it

301
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:27,370
in the terminals sometimes say

302
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,500
application not supported instead of

303
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:30,970
saying I don't accept Amex because it's

304
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:32,230
basically looking at those application

305
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:35,410
IDs and going I don't know what this one

306
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:37,330
is so I can't do that so yeah it may ask

307
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:40,089
you to choose it reads the application

308
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:41,470
file locator to determine what kind of

309
00:10:40,089 --> 00:10:44,230
card details are on there and so those

310
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:46,690
files on the file system of that chip

311
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:49,420
will present them the primary account

312
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:51,910
number the expiration day that maybe the

313
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:54,160
credit limit all kinds of other details

314
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:55,300
including sometimes out some transaction

315
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:57,730
counters that can be used to trigger

316
00:10:55,300 --> 00:11:00,550
certain situations that kind of stuff it

317
00:10:57,730 --> 00:11:01,660
then moves into data authentication mode

318
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:02,829
right so this is not where it

319
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:05,170
authenticates you with

320
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:06,730
pen this is where it authenticates that

321
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:08,770
the data itself hasn't been tampered

322
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:10,930
with so the data on the cards are

323
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:12,130
protected using different standards

324
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:14,469
sometimes they're digitally signed

325
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:16,360
sometimes they're encrypted depends on

326
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:17,560
the the generation of card and what it

327
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:19,510
supports and I'll go in a little bit of

328
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:21,069
the detail there that only happens if

329
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:23,350
it's an offline transaction if it's an

330
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:25,810
online transaction it assumes that the

331
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:27,970
bank in that online transaction is going

332
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:29,739
to confirm the details at the bank end

333
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:31,180
and know that the card is valid so it

334
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:32,470
doesn't bother to validate that the

335
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:33,969
information on the chip hasn't been

336
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:35,920
tampered with because the bank should

337
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:38,290
know that if you send bogus data to them

338
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:40,900
and then ultimately if all that passes

339
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:43,480
it goes to cardholder verification which

340
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:46,270
again is a sort of a multiple multiple

341
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:48,820
choice test you can see some of the

342
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:50,680
details you can get from cards what

343
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:52,210
things they support when you put them

344
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:53,770
into these applications because these

345
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:55,660
these identifiers are rather difficult

346
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:57,400
to read for humans so this app actually

347
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:59,020
interprets them at top one there is

348
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:00,550
actually a Visa card on the previous one

349
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:02,380
you can see it supports dynamic data

350
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:06,280
authentication and issuer authentication

351
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:07,930
meaning that the the price of the public

352
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:09,400
key for the financial institution that

353
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:11,199
issued the card is on the card that

354
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:12,760
means you can validate you're actually

355
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:15,010
talking to the financial institution and

356
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:16,360
not not a criminal and this other one

357
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:17,830
you know supports some other features we

358
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:19,510
see it has terminal risk management

359
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:21,520
which is a way to try to determine

360
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:23,890
whether the terminal itself may be

361
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:26,260
compromised that's performing the

362
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:28,480
transaction so if you're offline which

363
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:30,610
doesn't happen very often anymore this

364
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:32,380
is one of the reasons the gas-station

365
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:35,470
attack worked at Shell here they they

366
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:36,970
were doing offline authentication more

367
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:39,100
and more at least in Canada than us

368
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:41,710
where we mostly the Canada where we have

369
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:43,090
chips and use them pretty much

370
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:44,530
everything's online I don't know of

371
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:46,120
anything that's really offline for a

372
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:47,560
while the airlines we're doing offline

373
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:50,170
data authentication when you were buying

374
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:51,310
a Pepsi or whatever on a flight most of

375
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:53,020
that's even online now that we have

376
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:54,640
internet onboard the Jets and and

377
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:56,890
everybody prefers online as it reduces

378
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:58,630
fraud but if you are offline these are

379
00:12:56,890 --> 00:13:00,069
kind of the three stages right in the

380
00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:01,960
old days everything was just static data

381
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:04,150
authentication so the card percent of

382
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:05,650
the data to the terminal and it was

383
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:07,060
digitally signed and the terminal just

384
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:08,410
looked at the data in the signature and

385
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:12,369
made sure that the signature hadn't been

386
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:13,930
altered and the certificate authorities

387
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:16,510
were a pre-approved list issued by the

388
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:18,099
card associations they later moved on to

389
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:19,990
anok data authentication which pretty

390
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:22,630
much every card in circulation today has

391
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:25,450
nobody uses SDA any more modern cards

392
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:27,160
either have DDA or CDA and in the

393
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:30,130
dynamic mode there's some weird stuff

394
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:31,990
like you can tell that bankers made this

395
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:33,939
up as they went and then forced

396
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:36,670
technical people to implement it it's

397
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:41,290
some really interesting things so rather

398
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:42,579
than calling it a seed or a nonce or

399
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:45,370
anything like that we have an

400
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:46,930
unpredictable number which i think is

401
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:49,060
their way of saying random it's nothing

402
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:51,640
this should not be serial now of course

403
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:53,290
if you look into credit card compromised

404
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:54,910
of chips one of the things you'll find

405
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:57,550
is that in fact most of the terminals

406
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:59,079
don't use an unpredictable number which

407
00:13:57,550 --> 00:14:01,329
is means that you can actually

408
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:02,740
compromise them but they're supposed to

409
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:04,030
use an unpredictable number it sends

410
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:06,130
that unpredictable number to the card

411
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:09,069
the card hashes the data plus the

412
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:11,290
unpredictable number on the chip itself

413
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:13,300
using sha-1 and then signs that using a

414
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:17,829
and this is in the spec again who's ever

415
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:20,050
specified a key length in bytes 284 byte

416
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:22,060
RSA key which if you do the math is

417
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:27,130
nineteen hundred and eighty four bits

418
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:28,750
it's not 2048 it's not 1024 no 1984 I'm

419
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:32,320
not sure if this is a Orwell call out

420
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:35,770
there I suspect what it actually is is

421
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:37,630
that 64 bytes are needed for something

422
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:39,490
else and there's such limited memory in

423
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:40,720
these chips that they had to cut 64

424
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:42,460
bytes out of the key to make room for

425
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,930
something else they needed but anyway

426
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:45,610
that's what they do and that makes it

427
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:47,020
replay resistant right SDA you could

428
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:49,030
just sit there replay transactions

429
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:50,860
because it's just checking that the data

430
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:52,600
was signed and hasn't been altered

431
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:54,160
whereas with dynamic data because of the

432
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,540
unpredictable number you can't replay a

433
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:57,459
transaction because that number should

434
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:59,469
be unpredictable when it is predictable

435
00:14:57,460 --> 00:15:01,930
you can replay a transaction and it's

436
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:03,790
happened lastly and this is what most

437
00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:05,170
things should use these days and they

438
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:06,339
changed the terminology again now we

439
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:07,650
don't have an unpredictable number we

440
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:10,270
have a 64-bit nonce

441
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:12,040
it sends that to the so the card sends

442
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:13,870
that to the terminal the terminal thing

443
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:16,420
generates its own unpredictable number

444
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:19,390
but not a nonce because we copied and

445
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:20,890
pasted from the other spec combines that

446
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:22,660
with the pad at some padding original

447
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:26,050
Nantes headers and Cripps it using a RSA

448
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:27,310
public key and then the card decrypts

449
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:28,779
the

450
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:29,979
decrypts that to check that the original

451
00:15:28,779 --> 00:15:31,629
nonce is right to verify that the

452
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:35,199
terminal has done the transaction so

453
00:15:31,629 --> 00:15:36,699
kind of a little more complicated then

454
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:38,949
we move on to verifying you the

455
00:15:36,699 --> 00:15:41,769
cardholder and these are the four most

456
00:15:38,949 --> 00:15:44,469
common methods so this is called CVM or

457
00:15:41,769 --> 00:15:46,059
cardholder verification methods we have

458
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:48,699
online pin which is kind of what we

459
00:15:46,059 --> 00:15:50,410
prefer maybe once we go through how

460
00:15:48,699 --> 00:15:52,660
online pin works it's not quite as good

461
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:53,709
as it sounds but nonetheless of course

462
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:57,939
you collect that pin entry device

463
00:15:53,709 --> 00:16:00,638
collects the pin in it often encrypts it

464
00:15:57,939 --> 00:16:02,860
sends it to the next hop four pin

465
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:03,850
verification offline pin does it in the

466
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:05,949
chip and this is another vulnerability

467
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:07,600
researchers hear almost all the research

468
00:16:05,949 --> 00:16:10,300
on this for vulnerabilities has been

469
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:11,680
done at University of Cambridge and some

470
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:12,609
really great stuff go out there look at

471
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:15,339
they've got some YouTube videos they

472
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:17,680
overplay it a little bit but it's still

473
00:16:15,339 --> 00:16:18,759
foundationally great research on on what

474
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:21,370
the vulnerabilities are in the chip

475
00:16:18,759 --> 00:16:23,410
system but offline pin of course sends

476
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:25,300
the pin to the card the chip on the card

477
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:28,240
and says is the pin right and of course

478
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:30,490
the problem there is you can put a shim

479
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,870
over the top of the chip and just

480
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:34,389
respond yes no matter what pin was

481
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:36,490
entered and the terminal goes okay and

482
00:16:34,389 --> 00:16:38,019
does the transaction and and the

483
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:39,370
Cambridge students actually demonstrated

484
00:16:38,019 --> 00:16:41,860
that in the canteen at Cambridge where

485
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:45,069
they they built one of these shims for a

486
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:46,420
legitimate credit card for a BBC filming

487
00:16:45,069 --> 00:16:48,250
to show that they could just put zero

488
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:49,599
zero zero zero in for the pin and it

489
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:51,610
would try and do the transaction even

490
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,899
though that pin wasn't correct it's a

491
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:55,029
little cumbersome it's a little awkward

492
00:16:52,899 --> 00:16:56,500
it's not believed I don't believe that

493
00:16:55,029 --> 00:16:58,240
there's ever been proof that it's been

494
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:59,740
done in the wild there's been suspicions

495
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:01,300
that some criminals may have done it

496
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:03,490
it's not terribly expensive to do it's

497
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:04,599
just it's complicated innit

498
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:06,189
you know whenever you're doing card

499
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:07,500
present fraud there's a much higher risk

500
00:17:06,189 --> 00:17:09,520
of ending up with handcuffs

501
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:11,289
so criminals really prefer

502
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:13,059
card-not-present fraud because you don't

503
00:17:11,289 --> 00:17:16,209
generally end up in prison

504
00:17:13,059 --> 00:17:18,220
and then there's offline pin encrypted

505
00:17:16,209 --> 00:17:19,839
so that obviously implies that the

506
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:21,610
normal offline pin method isn't even

507
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:23,349
encrypted literally the the terminal

508
00:17:21,609 --> 00:17:25,990
sends the clear text pin to the chip and

509
00:17:23,349 --> 00:17:27,458
goes is this right whereas in the other

510
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:29,500
mode it will actually encrypt it using

511
00:17:27,459 --> 00:17:31,030
RSA public key that's on the card and

512
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:33,850
then the card of course keeps its

513
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:36,760
private key and in in the secure element

514
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:38,439
in the chip to verify that things signed

515
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:40,190
with its public key were in fact and

516
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:42,050
ciphered for it

517
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:43,700
and lastly of course signature

518
00:17:42,050 --> 00:17:45,860
verification which they're still really

519
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:47,560
fond of in the United States everything

520
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:51,169
ultimately falls back to signature and

521
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:52,580
both Visa and MasterCard now no longer

522
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:54,200
require a signature for signature

523
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:55,639
verification so I call it no

524
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:58,250
verification because you don't actually

525
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:59,810
need to sign even when it says sign they

526
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:01,220
realized what a farce that is and that

527
00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:02,860
nobody's ever verified a signature in

528
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:05,660
that people aren't handwriting experts

529
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:07,040
so they just kind of went yeah you don't

530
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:10,280
have to bother with that we just we

531
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:12,350
accept it so online code verification it

532
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:15,710
sounds good until you start looking at

533
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:17,360
how actually works you put your card

534
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:20,630
into the terminal the terminal collects

535
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:23,179
the pin and it basically sends it to the

536
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:25,010
acquirer or often there's third parties

537
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:27,170
before the acquirer that that terminal

538
00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:28,640
is contracted to work with so when you

539
00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:29,900
see the name on the terminal of the bank

540
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:32,390
or the company or the financial

541
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:34,370
institution usually that's the first hop

542
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:36,110
right there they're considered the

543
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:38,149
acquirer the problem here is you see

544
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:40,550
that it's encrypting and decrypting at

545
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:42,170
every single hop along the way it's not

546
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:43,550
encrypting it to the bank it's not using

547
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:48,290
the bank's public key which is on the

548
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:50,360
card it could but it doesn't and it will

549
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:52,909
basically use a key that's hard-coded in

550
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:54,350
the terminal a static key to encrypt it

551
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:56,750
to send it to the acquirer then the

552
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:58,939
inquirer decrypt it uses another static

553
00:18:56,750 --> 00:19:00,470
key to send it to the next hop to the

554
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:01,580
next hop to the next hop to the next

555
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:03,860
stop until gets all the way to the

556
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:06,710
issuing bank that's what the CI B is

557
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:08,570
card issuing Bank they verify if the pin

558
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:09,830
is correct so anywhere that there's

559
00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:12,950
compromise anywhere in this entire

560
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:14,810
ecosystem your pins toast because they

561
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:19,060
all have access to it all along the way

562
00:19:14,810 --> 00:19:21,260
at each hop not incredibly well designed

563
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:22,340
you want more on that there's a you are

564
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:23,270
I'll make all this available you might

565
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:24,919
want send it please talk to me

566
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:26,090
afterwards and if besides isn't

567
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:27,980
providing it I'm happy to give you a

568
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:29,659
link or point you to we're happy to

569
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:31,730
share everything I know including the

570
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:32,870
source materials for a lot of this I had

571
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:35,240
to do a lot of digging they don't

572
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:36,620
publish much I found like open FTP sites

573
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:39,170
with white papers on them and stuff it

574
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:40,939
was pretty interesting then it goes into

575
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:42,560
the risk management mode right so you

576
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:44,300
got processing restrictions maybe this

577
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:47,629
card is only able to be used online mode

578
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:49,730
I can't do offline mode or or you know

579
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:51,290
there's there's lots of different kinds

580
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:52,300
of analysis that can go on here like a

581
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:54,520
fuse tap cards

582
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:56,020
often set where you can only tap five

583
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:58,000
times before you have to enter your PIN

584
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:59,379
again so if you tap twice and then you

585
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,450
go to a chip transaction somewhere it'll

586
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:03,340
just keep working but there's a risk

587
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:05,350
management thing going after five taps

588
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:06,429
I'm gonna make you enter a PIN somewhere

589
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:08,230
because somebody might have stole your

590
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:10,090
card or somebody might have tapped your

591
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:12,310
card five times on the tube with a

592
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:13,389
reader and that limits the fraud right

593
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:15,070
because you can only do a hundred pounds

594
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:16,660
per tap and that means you could really

595
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:18,669
only have 500 pounds of fraud if you can

596
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:20,470
only do five taps before you require a

597
00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:22,510
pin verification so it's a risk there's

598
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:23,860
a lot of these risk management limiters

599
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:27,210
that are built into the decision-making

600
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:28,959
process during a card transaction and

601
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:31,480
ultimately in the end they make an

602
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:34,600
online offline decision sometimes that

603
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:36,610
requires you know the me the the there

604
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:39,790
may be a requirement for online and if

605
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:42,550
needed they do it online so this is kind

606
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:45,610
of how it works if you read in the data

607
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:48,340
from the the chip the encryption used is

608
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:51,639
two times three does so don't confuse

609
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:55,300
that with six DES and it's three its DES

610
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:58,570
three times twice which has its own

611
00:20:55,300 --> 00:21:00,700
extra flaws and then it takes kind of

612
00:20:58,570 --> 00:21:02,530
the cardholder data most of this stuff

613
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:05,140
so you know transaction counter profile

614
00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:06,460
IDs all this stuff and combines it with

615
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:08,260
some of the data from the terminal how

616
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:10,150
much money is this transaction going to

617
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:12,460
be what is the unpredictable number

618
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:14,230
which currency code are we doing the

619
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:15,760
transaction in all that kind of stuff

620
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:18,670
and it combines it all into an an

621
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:21,270
application request cipher so it's sort

622
00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:23,290
of like a little encrypted token that

623
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:27,670
represents this transaction with all

624
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:30,970
that data that was put into it and then

625
00:21:27,670 --> 00:21:32,980
it takes that the card takes that sends

626
00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:35,380
it to the terminal the terminal passes

627
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:36,610
it to the to the acquirer and you know

628
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:37,810
through that whole chain that I showed

629
00:21:36,610 --> 00:21:41,260
earlier until it gets all the way up

630
00:21:37,810 --> 00:21:42,490
there ultimately the issuing bank gets

631
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:43,870
it has to decide whether they approve

632
00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:45,880
the transaction usually they're going to

633
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:47,439
be storing all these keys in a in a

634
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:48,400
hardware security module somewhere so

635
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,990
when you get it you know when they're

636
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:52,000
minting cards they're issuing private

637
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:53,620
keys you know private public key pairs

638
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,350
to each card and then they they keep

639
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:58,689
copies of the keys in their HSM at the

640
00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:59,800
bank so they they verify that the

641
00:21:58,690 --> 00:22:01,300
restrictions that make sure you're not

642
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:03,220
over your credit limit they do all that

643
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:04,780
kind of stuff they grab the keys to do

644
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:05,799
the decryption itself to validate that

645
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:07,480
yes the

646
00:22:05,799 --> 00:22:10,600
signed this transaction it was

647
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:12,429
definitely issued by this card they

648
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:15,759
decide their response and then they do a

649
00:22:12,429 --> 00:22:17,740
response cipher um so they generate a

650
00:22:15,759 --> 00:22:20,379
response cipher encrypt that using the

651
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:22,480
public key of the card and then it gets

652
00:22:20,379 --> 00:22:24,340
passed back through the chain so in the

653
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:25,450
middle these guys have no idea what's in

654
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:26,529
these ciphers they don't know what's in

655
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:28,120
their requests they don't know what's in

656
00:22:26,529 --> 00:22:29,470
the response because it's encrypted from

657
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:36,399
the bank to the card and from the car to

658
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:38,019
the bank and if it's approved or denied

659
00:22:36,399 --> 00:22:40,209
you get two different responses here so

660
00:22:38,019 --> 00:22:41,769
if it's if the if the card gets it back

661
00:22:40,210 --> 00:22:44,649
and reads it and goes okay the bank

662
00:22:41,769 --> 00:22:47,409
approved this transaction it's valid it

663
00:22:44,649 --> 00:22:48,850
sends a certificate to the terminal and

664
00:22:47,409 --> 00:22:50,110
that certificate basically is what

665
00:22:48,850 --> 00:22:51,610
allows the terminal to collect the money

666
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:54,758
from the bank they have to have that to

667
00:22:51,610 --> 00:22:56,289
prove this is the you know proof that

668
00:22:54,759 --> 00:22:58,120
that encrypted transaction happened and

669
00:22:56,289 --> 00:23:00,220
you owe me twenty nine pounds seventeen

670
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:02,590
or whatever the transaction was if it's

671
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:04,840
denied when it decrypts it it sends a

672
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:06,549
basically equivalent to the certificate

673
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:11,019
that's a denial back to the terminal

674
00:23:06,549 --> 00:23:13,870
saying the transaction was declined now

675
00:23:11,019 --> 00:23:15,100
tap to pay is very similar it's mostly

676
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:20,139
based on the EMV standard with some

677
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:22,178
caveats and you know these are the

678
00:23:20,139 --> 00:23:23,830
primary in Canada we have what's called

679
00:23:22,179 --> 00:23:26,139
interact flash which is our debit system

680
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:28,600
but mostly internationally we see pay

681
00:23:26,139 --> 00:23:31,750
pass pay wave in and Amex Amex actually

682
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:32,799
had a brand for a while of their tap and

683
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:35,320
then they got rid of the branding I'm

684
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:36,820
not quite sure why but really not a lot

685
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:40,830
of other tap systems out there they're

686
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:40,830
all pretty much one of these three and

687
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:45,370
there's two modes again we have to

688
00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:47,080
accommodate Americans because we like

689
00:23:45,370 --> 00:23:48,370
their tourist money so we all want to

690
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:51,129
accept their credit cards but they're

691
00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:53,799
also still in the Stone Age and refuse

692
00:23:51,129 --> 00:23:55,750
to use modern technology so most of us

693
00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:58,690
when we tap end up doing what would be

694
00:23:55,750 --> 00:24:00,610
the EMV version of tap but the terminals

695
00:23:58,690 --> 00:24:03,370
often still support something called MSD

696
00:24:00,610 --> 00:24:06,100
or magnetic stripe data mode because the

697
00:24:03,370 --> 00:24:07,658
american cards don't have EMV chips so

698
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:10,209
there's no way to do EMV because there's

699
00:24:07,659 --> 00:24:11,620
no processor running java so they have

700
00:24:10,210 --> 00:24:14,710
to do something simpler which is just

701
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:16,899
hard code magnetic stripe data off the

702
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:19,460
stripe into the tap chip which is

703
00:24:16,899 --> 00:24:21,739
exactly what it sounds like

704
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:23,270
it's really being phased out quickly now

705
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:24,740
though now that the u.s. officially

706
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:27,290
transitioned even though their cards

707
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:29,420
need the cards are all chip in America

708
00:24:27,290 --> 00:24:30,590
now the terminals aren't so they're kind

709
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:32,090
of halfway there but that means their

710
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:33,770
cards when they come here can do EMV

711
00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:36,949
mode now so this is slowly being phased

712
00:24:33,770 --> 00:24:38,690
out I wasn't able to find any data on if

713
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:40,940
it's already been phased out here in the

714
00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:42,830
UK I believe it has I think you guys

715
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:45,200
went earlier we're so dependent on

716
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:47,480
Americans spending money in Canada that

717
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:50,470
we extended out our willingness to

718
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:53,450
accept this insane mode of operation

719
00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:54,980
until this October and we're finally you

720
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:57,200
know cutting the cord because most cards

721
00:24:54,980 --> 00:25:02,240
are there one of the the differences of

722
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:04,880
course between tap and chip and pin is

723
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:06,920
of course there's no non-repudiation or

724
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:09,800
provides non-repudiation but there's no

725
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:10,820
issue or authentication because they

726
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:12,139
don't want you to have to sit there and

727
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:13,820
hold the chip on the terminal while it

728
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:16,070
talks to the bank and the bank responds

729
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:17,480
in their request token comes back and

730
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:19,550
all this stuff because you tap and walk

731
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:22,100
away there's no ability to validate that

732
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:23,870
the response was signed by the bank so

733
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:26,449
you do lose issue or authentication it's

734
00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:29,239
not known to be abused but it is a

735
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:34,160
weakness in tap that's not present in a

736
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:35,690
valid chip transaction I'm a big fan of

737
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:37,250
tap to pay because of all the risk

738
00:25:35,690 --> 00:25:38,809
limiters in it and the fact that as a

739
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:41,780
consumer you have zero liability no

740
00:25:38,809 --> 00:25:44,210
matter what goes wrong so you know it's

741
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:46,340
a hundred pounds per tap and and I don't

742
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:48,800
have the data in here that the CVV

743
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:50,990
changes every time you tap the card so

744
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:52,610
if I tap you on the subway I do get your

745
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:54,110
magnetic stripe data ultimately I get

746
00:25:52,610 --> 00:25:57,199
the pan number I get the expiration date

747
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:58,729
I get a dynamic CVV though so even if I

748
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:01,820
want to go and buy something at Tesco

749
00:25:58,730 --> 00:26:05,000
with the tap fraudulently I'm limited to

750
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:07,730
that one tap because then the CVV

751
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:10,250
changes and and I have to go tap your

752
00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:12,610
card again to get the next CVV so it's

753
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:15,050
kind of limited based on the bank's

754
00:26:12,610 --> 00:26:16,490
transaction counter limit how many taps

755
00:26:15,050 --> 00:26:18,470
will they allow before they require a

756
00:26:16,490 --> 00:26:20,480
pin is kind of the limiting factor

757
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:22,450
because I could go on the tube with my

758
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:25,550
Android and tap your button five times

759
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:27,830
get your next 5c Vivi's with the card

760
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:29,510
data four tap transactions but now one

761
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:32,159
I'm gonna race condition with you if you

762
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:35,430
go use your card you'll skip ahead

763
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:37,470
to a more recent CVV in the banco go all

764
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:39,840
those other ones are invalid so I have

765
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:42,000
to do the fraud before you use your card

766
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:43,919
again if you do a chip transaction

767
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,950
anywhere I also will get locked out

768
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:48,210
they'll know that and there's a high

769
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:49,290
risk of being caught and I'm only going

770
00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:50,460
to get a hundred pounds and it's just

771
00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:52,920
not worth going to prison for a hundred

772
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:53,850
pounds so I think that's why we don't

773
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:56,010
really see much

774
00:26:53,850 --> 00:26:59,909
tap fraud and the convenience of it

775
00:26:56,010 --> 00:27:01,770
can't be beat now I prefer to Pat tap

776
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:03,690
using my google pay I'm not an Apple guy

777
00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:04,980
but I either way they're both the same

778
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:06,420
thing and they you know everybody

779
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:08,010
thought Apple just did amazing things

780
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:09,570
when they launched Apple pay what Apple

781
00:27:08,010 --> 00:27:11,580
did was implement part of EMV that

782
00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:13,530
everybody else was too lazy to do the

783
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:15,270
EMV spec has had Apple pay in it since

784
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:16,440
like five years before Apple implemented

785
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:19,379
it it's been part of the standard

786
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:21,180
forever but nobody ever implemented it

787
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:22,620
and Apple was the first to implement it

788
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:25,200
branded as Apple pay of course Google

789
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:28,530
pays the exact same technology branded

790
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:30,480
as Google pay and it's a little bit a

791
00:27:28,530 --> 00:27:32,220
little bit different the primary thing

792
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:35,280
is that middle bullet right I mean the

793
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:36,750
the we haven't really seen use yet of

794
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:38,670
the first but you may see it so back to

795
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:41,580
the hundred pounds the theory here is

796
00:27:38,670 --> 00:27:44,430
your iPhone can say I did facial

797
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:47,250
recognition to unlock the phone and pass

798
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:49,620
that along with the transaction or you

799
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:51,000
fingerprinted the touch ID or you know

800
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:52,409
you did the fingerprint on your Android

801
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,030
or whichever you can say there was a

802
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:55,680
biometric authentication you can say

803
00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:57,510
there was a pin authentication and the

804
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:58,950
banks theoretically want to be able to

805
00:27:57,510 --> 00:28:01,590
increase that spending limit they want

806
00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:05,040
to say it's okay to buy a flat-screen TV

807
00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:07,379
at the electronics store via tap without

808
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:08,520
a pin because you used your fingerprint

809
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:10,950
to unlock your iPhone or your Android

810
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:12,629
they're not doing it yet to my knowledge

811
00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:14,040
I'm not seeing it's certainly not on my

812
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:15,870
phone I'm still at a hundred bucks and

813
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:18,629
it tells me I I have to enter a PIN or

814
00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:20,280
use my card but that's one of the things

815
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:22,170
that supports that could be in the

816
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:24,330
future more convenient again for us when

817
00:28:22,170 --> 00:28:25,980
we're paying with our phone devices it

818
00:28:24,330 --> 00:28:27,720
also uses tokenization which is the most

819
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:29,310
key thing for preventing fraud and I'll

820
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:32,130
explain how that works in just a second

821
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:34,560
and it also communicates to the user

822
00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:36,330
whether it was accepted or declined kind

823
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:37,950
of stopping some of this replay kind of

824
00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:39,840
stuff that can happen where you might

825
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:41,850
fraudulently convince a terminal that

826
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,120
something was accepted but because

827
00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:43,918
there's

828
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:45,270
out of yank communication right the bank

829
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:47,100
can talk to your phone over the internet

830
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:49,110
and your phone's talking to the terminal

831
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:51,230
via tab there's sort of two separate

832
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:53,760
communication channels that prevents

833
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:56,730
more lying and fraud kind of things and

834
00:28:53,760 --> 00:29:01,230
allows more verification so if we look

835
00:28:56,730 --> 00:29:04,919
at it in essence when you register your

836
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:06,720
card with Apple pay what you're really

837
00:29:04,919 --> 00:29:08,190
doing is registering a token that

838
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:09,539
represents the card information that

839
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:11,690
doesn't actually contain the card

840
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:14,220
information and those tokens are

841
00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:15,899
generally now being I think initially

842
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:17,700
Apple was doing some special things with

843
00:29:15,899 --> 00:29:19,379
certain banks and things these days any

844
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:21,419
bank that wants to support Apple and

845
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:22,980
Google pay basically is contracting out

846
00:29:21,419 --> 00:29:24,990
to MasterCard and Visa MasterCard and

847
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:26,700
Visa provide this tokenization as a

848
00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:28,350
service and the great thing is they can

849
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:30,809
issue multiple tokens for the same card

850
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:31,918
so you're you're not in this situation

851
00:29:30,809 --> 00:29:33,090
where your credit card gets cancelled

852
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:34,230
all of a sudden all your automatic

853
00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:36,120
billing stops right you could have

854
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:37,409
multiple tokens represent the card and

855
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:39,149
if the tokens compromised for some

856
00:29:37,409 --> 00:29:40,620
reason you can just kill that token and

857
00:29:39,149 --> 00:29:43,590
maybe other tokens can continue to live

858
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:45,209
with that card information and in

859
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:46,860
essence so this is sort of the

860
00:29:45,210 --> 00:29:48,179
registration process right you put your

861
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:49,889
card data on your phone your phone

862
00:29:48,179 --> 00:29:51,750
registers with Apple or Google pay they

863
00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:54,270
go get a token send the token back to

864
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:55,950
the phone now I say multiple tokens if

865
00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:57,480
you have two iPhones you could register

866
00:29:55,950 --> 00:29:58,679
that card on a second iPhone you'll get

867
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:00,750
another token that's distinctly

868
00:29:58,679 --> 00:30:02,909
different but it still represents the

869
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:04,470
same hard older information in this

870
00:30:02,909 --> 00:30:06,299
database that basically is just a

871
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:10,529
mapping of those tokens to pan numbers

872
00:30:06,299 --> 00:30:13,529
from the issuing banks and then when you

873
00:30:10,529 --> 00:30:15,510
go to use it the terminal never gets any

874
00:30:13,529 --> 00:30:18,059
of your card data and that's the best

875
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:20,100
part of it right the the the car the

876
00:30:18,059 --> 00:30:22,320
phone presents the token to the terminal

877
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:23,939
and the terminal has to use the token as

878
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:26,010
the identifier for the transaction in

879
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:27,390
the process it you know that they the

880
00:30:26,010 --> 00:30:29,760
the terminal sends it to the token

881
00:30:27,390 --> 00:30:31,200
service provider usually visa they go

882
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,940
look up the token figure out what card

883
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:34,320
number it is send the transaction data

884
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:36,090
with the card number to the issuing bank

885
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:38,189
the bank goes approved to climb it goes

886
00:30:36,090 --> 00:30:41,070
back and then visa signs the token sends

887
00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:43,919
it back and goes it's all good so the

888
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:45,350
benefit of this also is issuing Bank

889
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:46,500
doesn't know where you're shopping

890
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:50,189
privacy

891
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:52,530
the only visa the token issuer knows the

892
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:54,809
issuing bank and where the transaction

893
00:30:52,530 --> 00:30:55,830
came from and so as long as you trust

894
00:30:54,809 --> 00:30:57,330
them to

895
00:30:55,830 --> 00:30:58,800
the tokens secure and not sell your

896
00:30:57,330 --> 00:31:00,449
information which so far it looks like

897
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:02,970
there's going to be legislation to

898
00:31:00,450 --> 00:31:04,460
prevent that and they don't appear to be

899
00:31:02,970 --> 00:31:06,180
selling it at the moment to my knowledge

900
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:07,770
you're also getting a lot more

901
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:09,270
anonymization you would be surprised how

902
00:31:07,770 --> 00:31:12,210
much money your bank makes reselling

903
00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:13,740
where you shop to companies out there

904
00:31:12,210 --> 00:31:17,160
when I was looking into venmo in the

905
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:20,310
state's venmo it's estimated that venmo

906
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:23,850
makes $400 per customer per year just

907
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:25,409
selling their transaction information so

908
00:31:23,850 --> 00:31:27,080
that's very valuable information it's

909
00:31:25,410 --> 00:31:32,400
very valuable to your privacy and

910
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:33,990
tokenization is your friend so a couple

911
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:35,880
more things and then I'll take some

912
00:31:33,990 --> 00:31:38,690
questions and we'll wrap up some of the

913
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:41,040
new wave of stuff I mentioned venmo some

914
00:31:38,690 --> 00:31:42,720
there's a water you know PayPal

915
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:44,639
ultimately bought them now venmo sort of

916
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:46,500
a it was meant to be a social network

917
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:50,070
for payments what could possibly go

918
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:51,660
wrong and it has gone wrong and in

919
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:53,850
brilliant ways but some interesting

920
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:57,570
things about it so that social network

921
00:31:53,850 --> 00:31:59,159
idea is literally you have you you share

922
00:31:57,570 --> 00:32:00,780
your contact list of course with them oh

923
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:02,130
why wouldn't you and then you know all

924
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:03,960
your friends that are using venmo and

925
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:06,210
it's like hey Harry just bought coffee

926
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:09,210
at the cost a coffee shop on Warwick

927
00:32:06,210 --> 00:32:10,620
Road and wouldn't you want to buy a

928
00:32:09,210 --> 00:32:13,110
coffee there because Harry's a

929
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:15,360
trendsetter this kind of thing I guess

930
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:17,699
is the concept and apparently it works

931
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:19,199
they make a lot of money off of the kind

932
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:20,520
of social network aspect of it and

933
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,990
sharing your payment information of

934
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:23,910
course that's on by default as it would

935
00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:25,350
be you don't have to opt-in to do this

936
00:32:23,910 --> 00:32:27,030
if you subscribe to them though you

937
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:29,550
broadcast to everyone you know by

938
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:31,740
default everywhere you shop because

939
00:32:29,550 --> 00:32:35,100
sharing is important

940
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:36,570
and oddly people get frauded a lot on it

941
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:40,260
because it's a ledger based system

942
00:32:36,570 --> 00:32:43,409
meaning until you cash out the money

943
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:45,090
sort of virtual meaning let's say I owe

944
00:32:43,410 --> 00:32:46,440
you a hundred bucks for the beers we had

945
00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:49,199
last night at the speaker dinner

946
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:50,370
I then mow you a hundred bucks I have a

947
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:52,680
hundred bucks in my account or it won't

948
00:32:50,370 --> 00:32:55,290
let me but then I spend 100 bucks

949
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:58,410
somewhere else or I withdraw the hundred

950
00:32:55,290 --> 00:33:00,000
dollars before you withdraw the hundred

951
00:32:58,410 --> 00:33:02,220
dollars I sent you that money's gone now

952
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:04,020
you won't get it because the it's not a

953
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:05,430
real-time thing where the money actually

954
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:06,210
leaves or enters your account until it's

955
00:33:05,430 --> 00:33:08,070
it

956
00:33:06,210 --> 00:33:10,230
coupon and until you cash in the coupon

957
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:11,370
you don't have the money and people

958
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:12,810
don't realize that they let it

959
00:33:11,370 --> 00:33:14,550
accumulate in there memo account and

960
00:33:12,810 --> 00:33:15,690
then fraud happens and mostly this is

961
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:17,310
happening from I can tell through

962
00:33:15,690 --> 00:33:19,170
Craigslist and these types of things

963
00:33:17,310 --> 00:33:20,639
somebody goes yeah I'll buy your macbook

964
00:33:19,170 --> 00:33:23,670
hey can I then you Mon oh you're the

965
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:25,650
$1,200 oh sure in the and of course the

966
00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:27,540
person takes the $1,200 out long before

967
00:33:25,650 --> 00:33:28,620
you get home and think to cash out the

968
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:30,930
twelve hundred dollars out of your venmo

969
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:32,879
account and the money's gone they do

970
00:33:30,930 --> 00:33:34,380
limit it to three thousand dollars there

971
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:36,300
you know other paypal owns it they've

972
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:38,700
been tightening it up a little bit the

973
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:40,470
ships there's now governance involved

974
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:42,870
and it's not just six jocks in Silicon

975
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:44,160
Valley running it so now that lawyers

976
00:33:42,870 --> 00:33:45,840
got involved it is getting a little

977
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:47,670
better but there's a lot of holes in

978
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:49,560
this system and I just found that that

979
00:33:47,670 --> 00:33:50,790
$400 a year thing about selling the

980
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:53,100
social network information just

981
00:33:50,790 --> 00:33:54,870
fascinating right I'm guessing your bank

982
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:57,360
isn't as smart as venmo I'm making money

983
00:33:54,870 --> 00:33:59,129
on your transactions because they were

984
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:00,510
smart about marketing this to the

985
00:33:59,130 --> 00:34:01,830
merchants going you should accept them

986
00:34:00,510 --> 00:34:03,480
oh because people will know when they're

987
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:05,280
other people are shopping here and it'll

988
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:06,330
be a trend-setting cool kind of thing

989
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:08,639
for more people to shop at your

990
00:34:06,330 --> 00:34:10,199
establishments and using that to market

991
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:11,429
to them and do ads inside the app and

992
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:12,960
things like that for nearby

993
00:34:11,429 --> 00:34:14,730
establishments that your friends just

994
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:18,210
frequented trying to get you to go there

995
00:34:14,730 --> 00:34:19,740
so there's some profit in that we'll see

996
00:34:18,210 --> 00:34:21,600
how it all plays out I mean the biggest

997
00:34:19,739 --> 00:34:23,159
user of it in America is uber uber

998
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:26,449
accepts venmo a lot of people like to

999
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:31,440
use use it for their burr

1000
00:34:26,449 --> 00:34:32,819
Hoover is another topic five safety tips

1001
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:34,290
I found this just kind of interesting

1002
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:36,360
thing just basically telling people like

1003
00:34:34,290 --> 00:34:39,239
the most important thing is only use

1004
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:40,800
venmo with people you trust because it's

1005
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:42,299
so easy to scam you and take the money

1006
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,680
out before you get it that you really

1007
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:46,070
shouldn't use it except with your

1008
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:46,069
friends

1009
00:34:46,170 --> 00:34:50,550
people are weird with this stuff I found

1010
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:52,170
apparently like it's really hip thing to

1011
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:54,510
do is pay your rent with venmo now in

1012
00:34:52,170 --> 00:34:55,470
America they clearly don't live in

1013
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:57,090
Vancouver because you wouldn't buy the

1014
00:34:55,469 --> 00:35:00,660
pay your rent if there's a $3,000 limit

1015
00:34:57,090 --> 00:35:04,440
but it's just I don't quite understand

1016
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:05,970
it but I guess part of it is I don't

1017
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:07,980
know the situation here in Canada at

1018
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:10,439
least our banking system allows us to do

1019
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:12,150
we call it transfers I can eat transfer

1020
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:13,560
money to anybody else in Canada so I'm

1021
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:17,040
not quite sure why I would want to trust

1022
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:19,900
these guys but people are

1023
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:22,330
if you travel to China you won't go very

1024
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:25,330
far without seeing le petit le chat pay

1025
00:35:22,330 --> 00:35:26,620
and le pay and WeChat pay or Vancouver

1026
00:35:25,330 --> 00:35:28,450
for that matter we have such a large

1027
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:31,240
Chinese population almost everybody in

1028
00:35:28,450 --> 00:35:33,040
Vancouver accepts Ali pay or WeChat pay

1029
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:35,129
now just because of the huge quantity of

1030
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:37,480
Chinese tourists we have and

1031
00:35:35,130 --> 00:35:39,310
interestingly last I what time I was in

1032
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:41,320
China homeless people have QR codes

1033
00:35:39,310 --> 00:35:42,310
nobody has cash anymore so like

1034
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:44,020
literally if you want to give two

1035
00:35:42,310 --> 00:35:48,690
dollars to the homeless guy you scan his

1036
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:51,070
QR code and Ali pay it kind of weird

1037
00:35:48,690 --> 00:35:52,930
it's used for almost everything but this

1038
00:35:51,070 --> 00:35:54,730
is also part of this social credit

1039
00:35:52,930 --> 00:35:56,230
system right they want to buy using

1040
00:35:54,730 --> 00:35:57,700
these things they literally can find out

1041
00:35:56,230 --> 00:35:59,950
everything about you and you can you can

1042
00:35:57,700 --> 00:36:01,480
use your WeChat pay as an identifier at

1043
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:03,220
the doctor's office ER at the hospital

1044
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:05,860
to receive treatment you can pay your

1045
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:09,310
traffic fines your travel tickets all

1046
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:11,590
kinds of student loans I mean it's used

1047
00:36:09,310 --> 00:36:13,120
for just about everything they're

1048
00:36:11,590 --> 00:36:15,220
starting to reach out a little further

1049
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:16,000
now so you can't use this most people in

1050
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:18,939
this room unless you're a Chinese

1051
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:22,540
citizen or a resident or citizen of the

1052
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:24,040
PRC you cannot sign up at the moment so

1053
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:25,600
it made it rather hard to deep research

1054
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:26,860
because I couldn't really use it I had

1055
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:28,240
to kind of anecdotally look into what

1056
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:31,390
others have done in and particularly

1057
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:32,470
researchers in China they are starting

1058
00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:34,480
to expand a little bit though I was in

1059
00:36:32,470 --> 00:36:37,990
Hong Kong last week and it's starting to

1060
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:39,580
take off a bit there a lot of these

1061
00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:41,620
things are always seem to be filling a

1062
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:43,150
market gap the reason they exist is you

1063
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:46,000
know like around here everywhere I go I

1064
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:48,310
can use tap to pay and so I don't need

1065
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,630
venmo I don't need a leap a write

1066
00:36:48,310 --> 00:36:51,430
everywhere I go I can just tap here in

1067
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:52,870
the UK so there's no need for these guys

1068
00:36:51,430 --> 00:36:54,790
to rush in and fill a market thing

1069
00:36:52,870 --> 00:36:56,200
whereas in the u.s. sending people money

1070
00:36:54,790 --> 00:36:56,740
is really hard because the banks don't

1071
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:58,689
talk

1072
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:59,830
so this venmo thing took off because

1073
00:36:58,690 --> 00:37:01,720
people don't have an easy way to

1074
00:36:59,830 --> 00:37:03,460
transfer money in it and very similarly

1075
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:05,200
in Hong Kong it's just it's not seeming

1076
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:06,610
to get much traction in Hong Kong most

1077
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:08,319
people use it's called Octopus card it's

1078
00:37:06,610 --> 00:37:10,120
basically your oyster card they used for

1079
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:11,740
transit and you can just put $100 on

1080
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:13,420
your Octopus card and use it at

1081
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:14,919
Starbucks or McDonald's or wherever

1082
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:16,480
you're going it is you know use that as

1083
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:18,700
tap to pay in addition to credit cards

1084
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:20,620
so people aren't really adopting a like

1085
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:21,700
chat and WeChat pay in Hong Kong and

1086
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:24,609
Singapore even though it's launched

1087
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:27,040
there because there's no market gap I

1088
00:37:24,610 --> 00:37:29,260
think and boy the privacy implications

1089
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:30,099
of this stuff are just astounding right

1090
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:33,759
and I think

1091
00:37:30,099 --> 00:37:35,289
looking forward from my perspective any

1092
00:37:33,759 --> 00:37:35,769
payment system the future has to be

1093
00:37:35,289 --> 00:37:37,059
tokenized

1094
00:37:35,769 --> 00:37:38,709
I don't really care who runs it I mean I

1095
00:37:37,059 --> 00:37:42,700
think MasterCard and Visa are a cartel

1096
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:43,960
but the fact is the tokenization that

1097
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:46,058
they allow Apple and Google Deducer

1098
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:47,950
Apple and Google pay provides me a level

1099
00:37:46,059 --> 00:37:51,160
of privacy unrivaled to anything else

1100
00:37:47,950 --> 00:37:52,868
next to cash so I'll take that trade-off

1101
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:55,359
my risk management says that's a good

1102
00:37:52,869 --> 00:37:57,789
deal unless so with tap to pay and even

1103
00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:59,558
less so yet with with in person merchant

1104
00:37:57,789 --> 00:38:01,900
transactions because my bank does see

1105
00:37:59,559 --> 00:38:03,519
everything I'm buying and has a lot of

1106
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:04,779
privacy implications to me and you know

1107
00:38:03,519 --> 00:38:08,078
they're gonna monetize it unless we

1108
00:38:04,779 --> 00:38:09,519
outlaw it it's just inevitable so you

1109
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:10,930
know that's we have to consider these

1110
00:38:09,519 --> 00:38:12,069
risk management decisions no different

1111
00:38:10,930 --> 00:38:13,328
than the terminal considers risk

1112
00:38:12,069 --> 00:38:16,029
management when six happening a card

1113
00:38:13,329 --> 00:38:18,549
transaction and that's kind of how I

1114
00:38:16,029 --> 00:38:20,410
feel about this at the moment you know I

1115
00:38:18,549 --> 00:38:21,910
really love my privacy and I'm just not

1116
00:38:20,410 --> 00:38:25,089
willing to give it up unless I have to

1117
00:38:21,910 --> 00:38:27,430
and don't cash is king I mean in the end

1118
00:38:25,089 --> 00:38:30,819
cash is king if you really want your

1119
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:33,489
privacy don't use any of this crap use

1120
00:38:30,819 --> 00:38:34,719
cash and guard it carefully and if

1121
00:38:33,489 --> 00:38:36,819
you're uncomfortable carrying one with

1122
00:38:34,719 --> 00:38:39,670
large sums of cash I'm a big big fan of

1123
00:38:36,819 --> 00:38:41,589
the Apple pay Google pay their

1124
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:43,930
equivalents I didn't talk about samsung

1125
00:38:41,589 --> 00:38:45,160
pay they're important partner sofas and

1126
00:38:43,930 --> 00:38:47,700
I shouldn't say things about them that

1127
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:50,979
aren't nice and we'll leave it at that

1128
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:52,479
and I've got maybe a minute or two for

1129
00:38:50,979 --> 00:38:55,419
questions and then we can get this back

1130
00:38:52,479 --> 00:38:56,710
on track for timing if not I would love

1131
00:38:55,420 --> 00:39:00,069
to have a beer with you guys later or

1132
00:38:56,710 --> 00:39:18,969
something and have a chat I stepped into

1133
00:39:00,069 --> 00:39:22,859
the light yes ma'am so sort of like the

1134
00:39:18,969 --> 00:39:22,859
Amazon shops that they open in Seattle

1135
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:31,549
I have no idea how they're doing that I

1136
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:33,080
wish I knew that's actually maybe I'll

1137
00:39:31,550 --> 00:39:35,690
come back in five years with my update

1138
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:37,580
again he'll know about that but I mean

1139
00:39:35,690 --> 00:39:38,839
yes there's there are quite a few

1140
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:40,970
shortcuts because time is super

1141
00:39:38,839 --> 00:39:42,250
important in fact there's a new tap to

1142
00:39:40,970 --> 00:39:44,330
pay standard that is not very

1143
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:46,369
implemented yet that visa just proposed

1144
00:39:44,330 --> 00:39:49,098
that is supposed to shave another two

1145
00:39:46,369 --> 00:39:50,060
seconds off of transactions even for

1146
00:39:49,099 --> 00:39:51,230
chips so you don't have to leave the

1147
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:52,820
chip in the machine is long again

1148
00:39:51,230 --> 00:39:54,650
skipping issue authentication some other

1149
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:57,890
things and going the fraud rates are so

1150
00:39:54,650 --> 00:39:59,270
low we'll accept the risk level just to

1151
00:39:57,890 --> 00:40:00,618
get customers out the door without

1152
00:39:59,270 --> 00:40:02,810
having their chip in the terminal for

1153
00:40:00,619 --> 00:40:06,970
five seconds we'll cut it to two seconds

1154
00:40:02,810 --> 00:40:06,970
just satisfaction kind of stuff yes sir

1155
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:17,509
this token is stored in the secure

1156
00:40:14,570 --> 00:40:19,790
element and it's signed with the

1157
00:40:17,510 --> 00:40:22,849
transaction data when it's sent off so

1158
00:40:19,790 --> 00:40:24,650
even if the terminal wanted to like it

1159
00:40:22,849 --> 00:40:26,839
doesn't have the keys to sign and the

1160
00:40:24,650 --> 00:40:28,849
keys are stored so if the HSM were

1161
00:40:26,839 --> 00:40:30,140
compromised at the bank that would be an

1162
00:40:28,849 --> 00:40:31,400
issue because then all the private keys

1163
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:33,799
would be known and other people could

1164
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:35,540
sign the token but only the card has the

1165
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:37,550
private key and the HSM has the private

1166
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:40,550
key and the cards private key is stored

1167
00:40:37,550 --> 00:40:41,869
in a secure element which is supposed to

1168
00:40:40,550 --> 00:40:44,720
be impenetrable and I'm sure there's

1169
00:40:41,869 --> 00:40:47,930
research showing it's not but but it's

1170
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:50,270
incredibly difficult I'll take one more

1171
00:40:47,930 --> 00:40:57,589
and I want to move for the next speaker

1172
00:40:50,270 --> 00:41:05,630
to set up Hey sorry have I looked at an

1173
00:40:57,589 --> 00:41:07,009
amazing M paisa oh yeah I know I haven't

1174
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:11,510
leapfrogged all these it's service

1175
00:41:07,010 --> 00:41:13,010
allowed the whole is completely my

1176
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:15,600
reaction should suggest that no I

1177
00:41:13,010 --> 00:41:18,119
haven't looked into it

1178
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:19,560
and CSU you love you put money in your

1179
00:41:18,119 --> 00:41:21,150
bank and then you texts all our money

1180
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:22,830
basically sounds terrible

1181
00:41:21,150 --> 00:41:24,060
well that's that's why I want your

1182
00:41:22,830 --> 00:41:26,279
thoughts I mean if we're to swim swim

1183
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:28,200
swapping right I mean like well reading

1184
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:37,050
and sending someone else's text messages

1185
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:39,240
is not yeah and I know that I've been

1186
00:41:37,050 --> 00:41:40,350
following the the how much you know

1187
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:41,700
because they've had frog for so much

1188
00:41:40,350 --> 00:41:43,618
longer and sim swapping because of the

1189
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:44,609
financial transactions being done over

1190
00:41:43,619 --> 00:41:46,500
text message they're much more

1191
00:41:44,609 --> 00:41:51,080
aggressive about it it's like someone

1192
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:51,080
that can only have like to a very

1193
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:57,570
changed yeah I would like to look into

1194
00:41:55,859 --> 00:41:59,940
that I have not what example is in the

1195
00:41:57,570 --> 00:42:02,490
police force and the average wages gone

1196
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:04,350
up by thirty percent because we used to

1197
00:42:02,490 --> 00:42:06,750
be the local area chief would pass on

1198
00:42:04,350 --> 00:42:08,580
their wages but now that they can get

1199
00:42:06,750 --> 00:42:11,310
paid directly through in Pisa

1200
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:13,290
there's no longer the skimming so yeah

1201
00:42:11,310 --> 00:42:14,759
and in the social impacts of this stuff

1202
00:42:13,290 --> 00:42:16,410
are really interesting you know back to

1203
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:17,730
China as well with the bet you know Ali

1204
00:42:16,410 --> 00:42:20,279
pay and WeChat pay and social credit

1205
00:42:17,730 --> 00:42:21,900
system stuff like before Social Credit

1206
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:23,310
System people didn't see any harm in

1207
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:24,480
doing this and it just accelerated

1208
00:42:23,310 --> 00:42:26,549
everything so much compared to cash

1209
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:27,630
transactions everybody was in and then

1210
00:42:26,550 --> 00:42:28,590
now that everybody's in the whole

1211
00:42:27,630 --> 00:42:30,540
thing's been turned on its head and

1212
00:42:28,590 --> 00:42:33,150
become this privacy monster and there's

1213
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:34,619
no leaving so that's another sometimes

1214
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:36,660
these things can be a trap if they're

1215
00:42:34,619 --> 00:42:37,619
not designed well as well but I'll leave

1216
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:38,850
that for the future I'd love to chat

1217
00:42:37,619 --> 00:42:40,859
with you later thank you very much I

1218
00:42:38,850 --> 00:42:43,190
