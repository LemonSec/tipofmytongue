1
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:07,350
over it so one thing I've learned here

2
00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:09,780
you might tell by my accident I'm King

3
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:12,090
my accent I'm Canadian so sorry if I

4
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:13,590
apologize unnecessarily the one thing

5
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:15,389
I've learned here is the the British

6
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:17,400
military say no cuff too tough which is

7
00:00:15,389 --> 00:00:20,310
Cohen just wing it but that's okay I've

8
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:21,479
got notes so for context yes I am

9
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:23,220
Canadian I'm just over here in an

10
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:24,630
exchange position and I figured I'd take

11
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:27,180
a chance to come to London for free day

12
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:30,269
it's been great so far I'm also in the

13
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:31,859
military so that means two things our

14
00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:33,300
primary role is to close with and

15
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:35,730
destroy the enemy but next to that we're

16
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:38,640
really really good at acronyms I've

17
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:40,140
tried to minimize the acronyms if they

18
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,500
don't make sense just throw something at

19
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:45,780
me also I might I so I'm I speak French

20
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:47,550
I speak English I also dropped into our

21
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:49,170
meal English and it's very vulgar so if

22
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:52,110
I slip into that also please just throw

23
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:54,449
something at me I'll try not to do it

24
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:56,340
so I resisted the definition slide but

25
00:00:54,449 --> 00:00:58,440
I'm gonna talk about in many ways so

26
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:00,719
first thing first mission assurance that

27
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:02,129
is in military parlance anyways that's

28
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,080
your ability to tell your boss the

29
00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:05,518
commander that for your part of the

30
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,048
mission it's going to go ahead you've

31
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,280
got a contingency plan you've thought of

32
00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:09,450
every possible reasonable thing that

33
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:11,700
could come up with and you got a plan

34
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:13,290
for it in my world in the communications

35
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:16,590
world's cut a pace plan you got primary

36
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:18,659
primary coms alternate coms contingency

37
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:19,890
and even emergency comes so if you can

38
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:21,299
do mission if you can do all that you've

39
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:23,820
got mission assurance you get to go you

40
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:26,189
can go ahead with your mission and then

41
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:28,258
the other giant hundred dollar words in

42
00:01:26,189 --> 00:01:30,689
there is a closed proprietary systems so

43
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:32,100
for context to this presentation closed

44
00:01:30,689 --> 00:01:34,258
system is something that doesn't touch

45
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:37,289
the internet or doesn't touch public

46
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:39,869
networks and proprietary I guess in

47
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:41,460
Britain we'd call it the spoke so it's

48
00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:45,360
something that you can't go down to a PC

49
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:48,630
world and buy and then the last

50
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:50,189
definitional here perhaps is risk them

51
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:52,170
so just be clear when I'm going to talk

52
00:01:50,189 --> 00:01:54,479
about risk I'm talking about not just a

53
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:56,159
threat but also a vulnerability so in

54
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:57,920
army terms if you're gonna run across a

55
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,820
field at a tank that's very very risky

56
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,420
but if you're just running across a

57
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,648
field

58
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:03,360
that's not risky because there's no

59
00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:05,040
threat and if there's just a tank with

60
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,210
no one running at it that's also not

61
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:11,340
risky because there's no one to shoot at

62
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:13,859
so let's bust on so almost two decades

63
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:17,790
ago I joined the army and we had

64
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:20,520
a NPRC 5:24 army-navy personal radio

65
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:22,769
communications 524 very formal it's got

66
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:24,450
large buttons sorry it's about large

67
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:26,130
switches it's got no buttons it's just

68
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:28,410
straight-up hardware it's a very rugged

69
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:30,420
piece of kit if it didn't break you drop

70
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:32,100
tested it to seat the cards back on the

71
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:33,809
ground and so what that meant is if

72
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:36,299
comms weren't working either the

73
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:37,620
hardware was broken or this amazing

74
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:39,840
thing we call a sudden ionospheric

75
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:41,220
disturbance it just means sometimes the

76
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,170
atmosphere is wrong and the radios don't

77
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:44,370
work well as their radio operator that

78
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:48,059
will save you from getting a lot of

79
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:50,760
shouting at but vietnam-era technology

80
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:54,000
were in Canada 1999 technology because

81
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:56,429
military procurement and then we went on

82
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,110
to the RT 51 21 and the Army Navy

83
00:02:56,430 --> 00:03:01,290
personal radio communications 117

84
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:03,140
Foxtrot so those are acronyms but

85
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:06,120
they're these two radios here they do a

86
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:08,339
wider range of communications they've

87
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:09,360
got some software in them you can talk

88
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:11,640
because now there's buttons and not

89
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,800
switches right um but it's still mostly

90
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:16,019
hardware so if something breaks it's

91
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:17,430
probably the hardware it might be a

92
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:19,860
battery so it might be some software

93
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:22,200
stuff and you still that sudden

94
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:26,700
ionosphere disturbance to save you if

95
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:28,350
you broke something but then when you

96
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:30,720
stick it all together you can have a

97
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:33,329
couple infantry fighting vehicles throw

98
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,920
some canvas and between them remote the

99
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:36,480
radios and when I say remote it's not

100
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:38,548
like a remote like this it's literally

101
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,230
just a long wire with a button that you

102
00:03:38,549 --> 00:03:44,250
push to talk on it very straight forward

103
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:45,810
but 1999 technology 2001 technology

104
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:48,360
we're calling that a deployed network

105
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:50,730
however because computers are thing and

106
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:51,959
everybody likes email it does have most

107
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:53,369
of the pieces that you would see in a

108
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:55,680
typical office Network right it's got a

109
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:57,780
printer it's got computers it's got

110
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,860
radios they don't usually connect

111
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:01,010
together and they never work well

112
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:03,090
because of sudden ionosphere disturbance

113
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:10,890
don't ever use that a female goes down

114
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:15,150
it's not believable also as the radio

115
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:17,298
technology and all that's two buttons go

116
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:17,298
back

117
00:04:19,978 --> 00:04:24,610
honestly I am in communications

118
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:27,790
inaudible computers most of the time

119
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:28,780
right so instead of just two vehicles

120
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:30,580
back together with a piece of canvas

121
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:31,809
let's add more.that because we like

122
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:33,159
computers and we like having our email

123
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:36,220
right even though it's sweaty and dirty

124
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:37,449
we want email for some reason so you put

125
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:38,800
a whole bunch of vehicles together and

126
00:04:37,449 --> 00:04:40,150
you put a lot of tents in between there

127
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,949
and then you can have a whole bunch of

128
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:44,260
computers and you can have all kinds of

129
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:45,699
office stuff but it's not Network very

130
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:47,770
well and what's the point of having

131
00:04:45,699 --> 00:04:49,630
computers if you can't network them so

132
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:51,639
in this typical setup here this is um I

133
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:52,810
don't remember that exercise but it's

134
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:54,190
not an actual deployment we're just

135
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:55,419
practicing there and it's called a

136
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:57,550
command post so it's got everything

137
00:04:55,419 --> 00:04:59,919
brigade commander

138
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:02,020
so infant ear maybe armored guy in

139
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:03,460
charge or girl in charge of five to six

140
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:05,198
thousand troops and they've got this

141
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:07,599
command post and everything's married

142
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:09,010
together but if something goes wrong

143
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,690
because we're still talking about

144
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:13,000
mission assurance then it's probably

145
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:14,949
software or maybe it's hardware

146
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,479
or maybe it's power distribution or

147
00:05:14,949 --> 00:05:17,650
maybe he didn't patch it or maybe it's

148
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:20,139
my friend's sudden ionosphere

149
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:21,849
disturbance but there's a lot of complex

150
00:05:20,139 --> 00:05:25,300
pieces in there and against complex very

151
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:29,020
very quickly so more about my personal

152
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:31,389
story when the button works then I went

153
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:32,799
to Afghanistan and I'm not telling

154
00:05:31,389 --> 00:05:34,630
Veterans Affairs my body hurts all the

155
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,340
time but most of my body hurts all the

156
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:37,870
time and I found out there's this

157
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:39,340
amazing planner in the Canadian Armed

158
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:41,770
Forces they'll send you to University

159
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:43,239
for free T's and C's may apply and then

160
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:44,889
you have job security for seven years

161
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:46,000
that's the TNCs you you don't get to

162
00:05:44,889 --> 00:05:48,520
choose where you work in the Army for

163
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,370
seven years but it's great so I'm I

164
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:52,990
switched over from being what we would

165
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:55,500
call hard field army and then I went to

166
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:58,360
school and they learned about networks

167
00:05:55,500 --> 00:06:00,880
yeah so this is an abstract admit work

168
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:02,199
we've got a cloud there as a rule of

169
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,449
thumb if you're talking about InfoSec

170
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:05,889
always be worried when there's a cloud

171
00:06:03,449 --> 00:06:07,539
but in this case it's a public cloud so

172
00:06:05,889 --> 00:06:09,550
we can email between bases not just

173
00:06:07,539 --> 00:06:13,690
between tanks you've got a router you

174
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:16,000
got firewalls DMZ servers laptops all

175
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:18,070
that kind of classic stuff right and

176
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,180
there's an industry process for doing

177
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:20,830
mission assurance on that right like

178
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:22,599
Jamie just talked about bug bounty we

179
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:24,849
know how to find vulnerabilities in that

180
00:06:22,599 --> 00:06:26,460
and we know how to fix that mostly or at

181
00:06:24,849 --> 00:06:29,800
least there's an industry around that

182
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:31,330
but then while I was at school they

183
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,289
modernized their radios again so if

184
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:34,419
you're keeping track that's

185
00:06:32,289 --> 00:06:35,498
twice in 20 years that's pretty good and

186
00:06:34,419 --> 00:06:37,628
now we have these things called

187
00:06:35,499 --> 00:06:39,789
communication selector box that's the

188
00:06:37,629 --> 00:06:42,219
one on the left that's the one on the

189
00:06:39,789 --> 00:06:44,080
left and that just chooses which radio

190
00:06:42,219 --> 00:06:46,330
you're talking on and then you can also

191
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:48,039
configure the radio through that so you

192
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:49,748
can change channels on a radio in

193
00:06:48,039 --> 00:06:51,818
somebody else's vehicle by turning this

194
00:06:49,749 --> 00:06:54,399
dial and then we have a thing called Al

195
00:06:51,819 --> 00:06:56,379
and Ethernet switch which is just a

196
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:57,999
switch with some really overpriced

197
00:06:56,379 --> 00:07:00,999
military hardware stuck on to it to make

198
00:06:57,999 --> 00:07:02,649
a ruggedized so that's great now we've

199
00:07:00,999 --> 00:07:04,809
better utopia of data sharing right so

200
00:07:02,649 --> 00:07:06,729
got laptops about printers and servers

201
00:07:04,809 --> 00:07:08,889
it's all connected together trucks are

202
00:07:06,729 --> 00:07:12,729
talking that's amazing right I we want

203
00:07:08,889 --> 00:07:14,459
that I think maybe but actually your

204
00:07:12,729 --> 00:07:16,719
network kind of looks like this

205
00:07:14,459 --> 00:07:18,969
all right me so when you're left you've

206
00:07:16,719 --> 00:07:20,409
got your your typical office Network so

207
00:07:18,969 --> 00:07:21,879
when I'm working in the office we're

208
00:07:20,409 --> 00:07:24,219
getting computers ready to deploy out of

209
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:26,020
the field we're on an office Network and

210
00:07:24,219 --> 00:07:27,339
then there's this air gap and then we're

211
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:28,990
on a deployed know Rick and the deployed

212
00:07:27,339 --> 00:07:30,099
networks safe right because no hackers

213
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:33,069
can get onto that because it never

214
00:07:30,099 --> 00:07:35,378
touches the internet right doesn't

215
00:07:33,069 --> 00:07:36,759
matter that USBs and CDs and DVDs or

216
00:07:35,379 --> 00:07:39,789
tape drives or whatever going back and

217
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:41,740
forth I should see shaking of heads

218
00:07:39,789 --> 00:07:43,808
because for one example they were

219
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:45,189
Stuxnet right so we've proven that

220
00:07:43,809 --> 00:07:46,719
nation-state actors and if you're the

221
00:07:45,189 --> 00:07:48,459
military worried about nation-state

222
00:07:46,719 --> 00:07:50,529
actors we've proven that nation-state

223
00:07:48,459 --> 00:07:53,139
actors can jump air gaps so now we have

224
00:07:50,529 --> 00:07:54,490
to figure out how to do that so I really

225
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:56,409
liked Jamie's talk I thought it was

226
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:57,490
amazing I very much doubt the military

227
00:07:56,409 --> 00:07:59,409
is going to get them to bug bounty on

228
00:07:57,490 --> 00:08:00,879
their internal proprietary network with

229
00:07:59,409 --> 00:08:04,688
proprietary software and proprietary

230
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:06,129
hardware also we're close with and

231
00:08:04,689 --> 00:08:09,219
destroy thing we're very good at

232
00:08:06,129 --> 00:08:10,629
smashing things not all of us are very

233
00:08:09,219 --> 00:08:12,009
good at figuring out how to break

234
00:08:10,629 --> 00:08:14,589
computers on purpose and then fix it

235
00:08:12,009 --> 00:08:18,659
again so that's the problem that I left

236
00:08:14,589 --> 00:08:18,659
University with how do you fix that

237
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:24,009
another network diagram because network

238
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:26,080
diagrams are great so this is what two

239
00:08:24,009 --> 00:08:28,839
vehicles look together so it doesn't

240
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:30,550
matter if it's a command post if it's

241
00:08:28,839 --> 00:08:32,169
two inter entry fighting vehicles or

242
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:33,399
tanks or fuel trucks from a network

243
00:08:32,169 --> 00:08:35,159
point it's all the same that's pretty

244
00:08:33,399 --> 00:08:37,779
much what they look like so you've got

245
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:39,309
this dashed line across the middle so

246
00:08:37,779 --> 00:08:39,669
top is one vehicle bottom is another

247
00:08:39,309 --> 00:08:41,919
vehicle

248
00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:43,838
you've got the communication selector

249
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:45,449
boxes you've got land Ethernet switches

250
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:46,530
headsets radios

251
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:48,960
everything he would expect to see in a

252
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:51,990
trial that's what our network looks like

253
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:53,940
now so how do we how do we how do we fix

254
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:56,340
that how do we address this problem so

255
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:57,420
uh after I left University I went to

256
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:59,370
that Canadian Forces School of

257
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:00,930
Communications electronics and I was

258
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:03,030
teaching some network defense and

259
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:05,040
servers and routers I wasn't doing most

260
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:07,050
of the teaching I just weighed in and

261
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,730
jumped in there um so that's basically

262
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:10,589
just sans courses but with more shouting

263
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:13,770
and more running and heavy things to

264
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:14,820
carry too it's great so in my spare time

265
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:17,220
at the same time I was doing grad

266
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:18,150
studies on this problem how can we fix

267
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:19,920
it and because I was at the

268
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:21,810
communication school we had a training

269
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:23,550
lab to teach people how to operate this

270
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:25,709
stuff which means we've got all the

271
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:27,120
equipment it all works great because

272
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:28,410
it's a training establishment it has to

273
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:31,020
work you can't train people and broken

274
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:33,660
kit and it's not connected to any real

275
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:34,699
network so if it breaks accidentally

276
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:38,100
it's not a big problem

277
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:40,200
so I I bought the Commandant a few beers

278
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:42,510
and said I've got a couple ideas

279
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:43,800
can i play on this networking and see

280
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:45,569
what happens

281
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:47,189
like as a start if you're 10 what does

282
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:49,560
rudimentary pentesting look like on

283
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:52,500
proprietary hardware private proprietary

284
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:54,989
software so I read a lot of

285
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:56,670
documentation fortunately I don't like

286
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:57,630
my wife and kids very much I was gone

287
00:09:56,670 --> 00:10:00,089
all evenings and weekends

288
00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:02,700
reading exciting military technical

289
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:03,990
documents and I Connor came up with this

290
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:05,190
process which is what we're talking

291
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:07,230
about mission assurance for closed

292
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:08,970
proprietary systems if you don't have

293
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:10,830
bug bounties to rely on if you can't

294
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:13,710
really look at all this CVEs you've got

295
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:16,050
to do a holistic examination that's

296
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:18,630
really tiny from back there I'm sorry so

297
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:21,209
step one you do a system analysis you

298
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:22,920
read all the documentation then you do a

299
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:24,270
vulnerability analysis where the weak

300
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:26,459
points where are the communications

301
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:29,790
bottlenecks on this and then how can I

302
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:31,020
break them so that's the exploit so you

303
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:33,060
look at the system you find the weak

304
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:34,290
points you see if you can break it and

305
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:37,079
then you write a report and that's

306
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:38,550
really really critical so a lot of the

307
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:40,530
times commanders will be told you've got

308
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:43,109
237 critical vulnerabilities in your

309
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:45,300
network sir you say well I had 230 last

310
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:47,700
year and my email still works so it's

311
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:49,170
not a problem right you need to write

312
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:50,730
your exploits and your vulnerabilities

313
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:53,339
in a way that shows them meaningfully

314
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:54,930
mmm so I'd recommend whether its

315
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:57,450
industry or in the military pick your

316
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:59,310
top one or two say that's the critical

317
00:10:57,450 --> 00:11:02,279
one don't give 230 critical

318
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:04,050
vulnerabilities so I took the

319
00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:05,910
documentation I took some ideas and took

320
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:08,339
a laptop with Kali on it and I plugged

321
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:10,469
it into a communication selector box and

322
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:12,779
I told it was a headset and it believed

323
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:15,480
me and then I opened up a full packet

324
00:11:12,779 --> 00:11:17,820
capture and then I threw an ether cap

325
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:21,360
and a couple others like low equity

326
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:23,160
scripting tools I am NOT a hacker like I

327
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,529
can say O'Day and I can maybe talk the

328
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:27,959
talk but I'm not a high-end hacker but I

329
00:11:25,529 --> 00:11:29,850
did manage to break a bunch of stuff I

330
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:30,810
paid some of it out of it so you can't

331
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:32,580
see I thought it'd be a little bit

332
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:36,439
irresponsible to throw that up there um

333
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:38,640
but I found a large number of sometimes

334
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:40,650
complicated vulnerabilities sometimes

335
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:43,970
really simple vulnerabilities if you're

336
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:46,410
on a an IP network and that network is

337
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:48,540
command and control for a Combat Team

338
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:50,370
you can choose when the commander gets

339
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:51,630
to talk on the radio or not that's a

340
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:53,040
great thing if you're the person the

341
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:55,320
commander is shooting at it's really bad

342
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:58,079
if you're on that commander side so that

343
00:11:55,320 --> 00:12:00,930
kind of stuff is what I found I did

344
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:03,180
proof of concepts I had physical access

345
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:04,589
to the system the next step in further

346
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:05,849
research would be to do it through a

347
00:12:04,589 --> 00:12:08,520
radio or some other kind of network

348
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:10,050
access we haven't done that I tricked

349
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:12,170
him into sending me here instead and

350
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:15,750
it's great I do like it being here

351
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:17,310
so I've renamed my my presentation it's

352
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:19,080
not evaluating it's maybe there is no

353
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:21,390
such thing as mission assurance we've

354
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:22,589
we've got a problem but we don't really

355
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:25,140
know what the problem is remember the

356
00:12:22,589 --> 00:12:28,170
two parts to risk right we kind of know

357
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:29,699
what the threat is maybe sort of but do

358
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:30,930
we know what our vulnerabilities are no

359
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:32,940
because no one's really looking at it

360
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:35,550
and I think that applies not just within

361
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:37,440
the military but within any enterprise

362
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:39,420
that has proprietary systems that

363
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:42,720
they're not letting external

364
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:44,790
organizations have a look at that's all

365
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:47,580
I have to say about that thanks Josh

366
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:51,449
anyone have questions okay anyone have

367
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:52,950
concerns okay I've got one so when you

368
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:54,839
said you know how do you figure out what

369
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:56,100
the problem was meeting just google it

370
00:12:54,839 --> 00:12:59,580
and see if it wasn't out on the web

371
00:12:56,100 --> 00:13:01,680
already that was a joke sorry I have a

372
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:07,980
bad sense of humor okay you like to give

373
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:11,370
them questions all kingside no questions

374
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:15,290
comments thoughts ideas suggestions

375
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:17,519
ideas and suggestions always a good one

376
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:19,379
industry which we work in and we're both

377
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:20,850
pen testers we come from a kind of

378
00:13:19,379 --> 00:13:22,529
national infrastructure type background

379
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:24,269
with a lot of proprietary systems so

380
00:13:22,529 --> 00:13:25,740
your various non-military what you're

381
00:13:24,269 --> 00:13:28,079
talking about resonates there's quite a

382
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:29,250
bit actually so yes that's really

383
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:34,019
interesting enjoyed it

384
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:35,759
well thanks um when it's relevant the

385
00:13:34,019 --> 00:13:40,589
guy from the college that doesn't exist

386
00:13:35,759 --> 00:13:44,399
in hello yeah I really enjoyed that talk

387
00:13:40,589 --> 00:13:48,990
that was extremely fascinating I'm just

388
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:50,970
quite amazed that you're like the only

389
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:54,180
person who's kind of looking into this

390
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:55,709
like is there no one else working with

391
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:58,170
you or with that equipment that's like

392
00:13:55,709 --> 00:14:00,540
maybe we should just check if this stuff

393
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:02,310
is secure or so full disclosure I

394
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:04,699
started this work about three years ago

395
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:07,319
I wrote a master's thesis on it about a

396
00:14:04,699 --> 00:14:08,729
little over a year ago so the ball is

397
00:14:07,319 --> 00:14:10,680
rolling people are starting to look at

398
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:11,790
it right and when I talked to the

399
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:13,349
designers because that was part of the

400
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:14,790
documentation I went to the people who

401
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:17,129
built it and designed it and I said

402
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:18,599
what's your approach and one of the

403
00:14:17,129 --> 00:14:21,029
things they said was we're going to take

404
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:22,559
public software and put it on this

405
00:14:21,029 --> 00:14:23,790
proprietary system because that way we

406
00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:26,250
know it's been bug bounty didn't bug

407
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:28,860
tested that's great right how often are

408
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:31,050
you updating it mmm so people are

409
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:34,139
looking at it just not enough in my

410
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:35,939
humble opinion amazing Thanks and here I

411
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:38,430
thought that the comment back would have

412
00:14:35,939 --> 00:14:41,099
been I wasn't cleared high enough to get

413
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:43,920
that information other questions

414
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:47,120
comments thoughts okay

415
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:47,120
with that thank you very much
