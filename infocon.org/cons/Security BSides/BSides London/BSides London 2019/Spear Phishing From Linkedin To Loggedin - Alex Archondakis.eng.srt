1
00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:06,210
hi everyone thank you very much for

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:09,990
coming I appreciate attendance

3
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:11,129
especially Freya last talk of the day so

4
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:12,750
I'm going to be speaking to you about

5
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:14,240
spear fishing and we'll be looking

6
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:16,410
through a bit of a story and

7
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:18,990
understanding how fishing attacks work

8
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:21,509
and why they're so easy and why people

9
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:24,959
would actually choose these over a more

10
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:26,820
technical attack for an example so my

11
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,570
name is Alex arc and arcs I work for

12
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:31,890
pentest people as a senior consultant I

13
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:34,230
specialize in web application and API

14
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:36,450
technologies but I have a genuine

15
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:39,029
interest in the psychology of hacking

16
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:40,440
any sort of social engineering basically

17
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:41,820
the fun bits I'm sure all the pen

18
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:45,209
testers in the audience here love as

19
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:47,940
well so first of all I'm just going to

20
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:49,860
be going through a few common

21
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:51,510
vulnerabilities just to make sure that

22
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:54,539
we're all on the same page for the non

23
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:55,949
pen testers in the room so we're going

24
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:57,510
to be having a look at software versions

25
00:00:55,949 --> 00:01:01,530
brute force multi-factor authentication

26
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:03,329
and weak passwords so software versions

27
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:07,380
are left on by default by many different

28
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:10,560
software's and these versions are often

29
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:13,350
seen as a low-hanging fruit for an

30
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,270
attacker it's very simple once we find

31
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:18,149
software versions we can go and look for

32
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:20,250
pre-written publicly available exploits

33
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:22,259
click and play them a lot of the time

34
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:25,650
and there's very little effort required

35
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:27,990
whatsoever and you can potentially get

36
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:30,840
root system or any kind of exploitation

37
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:33,750
that you're looking for from it so

38
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:35,670
here's an example of a server response

39
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:38,820
header that has been caught from a web

40
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:40,770
application using a talk about sweet on

41
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:43,589
here we can see that there is Microsoft

42
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:45,689
is 5.0 as I'm sure the pen testers will

43
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:48,240
point out the incredibly ancient version

44
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:49,889
with thousands of version but well a lot

45
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,390
of vulnerabilities associated to it so I

46
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:54,030
thought it would be a good good version

47
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:55,860
for this so software versions are not

48
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:58,229
only sent in server response headers and

49
00:01:55,860 --> 00:02:00,509
web applications you can also find these

50
00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:02,429
by running a port scan against the

51
00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:06,780
network layer by using tools such as

52
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:08,280
nmap here's an example of an EM map scan

53
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:11,550
that's been returned that is showing the

54
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:13,500
is web server 5.0 version and we can

55
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:16,730
also see here just for jokes that

56
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:19,380
four or five TCP is open which is the

57
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:23,340
which is a service that was exploited

58
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:25,290
during the NHS wanna cry attacks so as

59
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:27,900
an attacker once we actually have a

60
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:30,480
software version what is the next step

61
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:31,709
how do we find the next way how do we

62
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:35,280
find the exploit

63
00:02:31,709 --> 00:02:37,770
so CVE details contains thousands and

64
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,480
thousands of published exploits you can

65
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:41,730
search the software version on here and

66
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:44,190
find anything to use against in this

67
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:45,959
case the web application so as we can

68
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:47,760
see these are just a few of the ones

69
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:50,330
that have been found including buffer

70
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:53,459
overflows and denial of service attacks

71
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:55,350
once we've looked on TV details and we

72
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:57,450
found that there are exploits related to

73
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:59,730
it we actually need the code to then

74
00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:03,899
compile and run and attack the target

75
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:06,390
we're looking for exploit DB is a

76
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:09,989
website that you don't have to sign up

77
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:13,829
for it's publicly available very easy to

78
00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:16,560
use and it hosts code for exploits it

79
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:19,230
also hosts the a lot of the time the

80
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,940
vulnerable software alongside the

81
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:22,859
exploit so if anyone does really want to

82
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:25,410
try and have a little play around with

83
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:27,239
some hacking go and exploit DB download

84
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:28,829
the vulnerable software versions

85
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:31,350
download the exploit fire them off

86
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:34,440
yourself and just see how actually very

87
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:39,060
easy it is so this is a little bit of a

88
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:42,030
snippet from the Microsoft is x-point

89
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:44,400
and here we can see a snippet of the

90
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:48,000
eternal blue code the gun was used in

91
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:50,640
the NHS ransomware attacks so software

92
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,290
versions are incredibly easy to hide so

93
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,420
for example in your Apache config you

94
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:59,940
can just turn service signatures off and

95
00:03:54,420 --> 00:04:02,399
your server tokens product so brute

96
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:03,890
force and multi-factor authentication a

97
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,510
brute force attack in a web application

98
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:09,420
scenario will typically start off by

99
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:11,700
trying to enumerate a list of valid user

100
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:13,890
names this can be done through different

101
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:16,140
functionality within the web application

102
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:18,988
usually being the Forgotten password

103
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:21,000
function or the registration function so

104
00:04:18,988 --> 00:04:24,150
when we go onto an application we will

105
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,340
try and register an account and then

106
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:26,849
afterwards we'll try and re-register it

107
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:28,679
with the same

108
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:31,170
an address to see what the error message

109
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:34,170
is if the error message returns to us as

110
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:35,910
this account already exists then we have

111
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:38,820
a different response and we can use

112
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:41,220
automated tools online to build lists of

113
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:43,500
thousands of user names or email

114
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:45,420
combinations there are many word lists

115
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:48,990
around this really isn't much work or

116
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:51,480
much effort for any pen testers once

117
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:53,640
we've got a list of valid user names we

118
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:55,890
will then actually run brute force

119
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:57,719
attacks against the login portal against

120
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:59,570
the password sections try and get it

121
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:01,980
again there are readily available

122
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:05,550
automated tools online that are very

123
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:07,800
easy to do this so multi-factor

124
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:09,840
authentication is a second layer of

125
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:12,420
authentication after we've used our

126
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:14,429
standard username and password this is

127
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:15,960
often a screeners asking for some kind

128
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:19,070
of code that usually comes through

129
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:21,359
Google Authenticator or SMS messages

130
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:23,250
multi-factor authentication code should

131
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,920
be treated exactly like passwords are

132
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:27,360
not shared with anyone recently I was

133
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:33,120
doing an engagement for a pharmaceutical

134
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:35,220
company and we spoof well we did we got

135
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,960
their domain added - support on the end

136
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:39,420
just a nice classic and registered it

137
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:44,280
and then we sent an email to their

138
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:46,110
company saying that we have an important

139
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:47,909
security update to be pushed that will

140
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:49,950
require everyone's have Outlook Web

141
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:51,510
Access which is obviously rubbish the

142
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:54,510
majority of us but a lot of people will

143
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:56,550
fall for it so we had a keylogger on the

144
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:59,940
portal that we redirected them to from

145
00:05:56,550 --> 00:06:02,010
the email and we got to director-level

146
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:03,750
accounts and pharmaceutical company

147
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:06,420
however they had multi-factor

148
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:08,850
authentication enabled so I thought I'd

149
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:11,160
take a long shot and phone one of them

150
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:12,870
and I was like hi I'm calling from IT

151
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:14,310
support we've you know emailed you

152
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:15,720
earlier we've asked you to log into this

153
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:18,660
you come back to us and told us you're

154
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:20,550
having problems would you be able to

155
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:22,110
read the code that I'm about to text

156
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:26,910
through to your phone to me please and

157
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:29,760
they read it straight away so I decided

158
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:31,350
why not try and see if I can get another

159
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:33,800
method for them to give it to me like

160
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:36,570
this so I sent a push notification

161
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:38,580
called them and said we're sending a

162
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:39,990
push notification to your phone just to

163
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:42,150
confirm it to you before we

164
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:44,010
asking you a few more questions they

165
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:46,590
press the push notification without any

166
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:47,969
argument whatsoever so we have to start

167
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:52,409
treating multi-factor authentication

168
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:54,720
tokens as passwords so as we can see

169
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:56,850
brute-force attacks is simple to set up

170
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,830
and execute it's only a matter of time

171
00:06:56,850 --> 00:07:01,260
and computing power until we actually

172
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:03,690
get through unless there's some form of

173
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:06,900
protection the protection is quite easy

174
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:09,750
you can add a CAPTCHA you can use

175
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:11,039
account lockout policies and ideally you

176
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:13,830
should always have multi-factor

177
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:16,620
authentication enabled on logins whilst

178
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:18,450
this isn't always possible I think the

179
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:19,980
more is an industry if we can really

180
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:22,140
start pressing the importance of

181
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:23,790
multi-factor authentication then whether

182
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:26,340
applications in general will become a

183
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:28,500
lot more secure mitigates against

184
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:30,570
password reuse in in in in essence

185
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:31,800
because even if you log in through the

186
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:35,400
first layer you're not going to get into

187
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:37,290
the second so there are a lot of options

188
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:43,320
now mainly being automation Google

189
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:46,470
authentication Skater so weak passwords

190
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:48,900
passwords have been talking topic of the

191
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:50,490
security industry I guess since the

192
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:54,330
first day and there are many myths

193
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:55,890
surrounding it so take this as a bit of

194
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:57,960
a pinch of salt because it's come from

195
00:07:55,890 --> 00:08:00,690
how secure is my password online so I

196
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:02,430
don't know the full accuracy but it

197
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:04,140
gives a bit of a rough idea on the

198
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:06,600
computational power that is actually

199
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:09,960
required to crack passwords so here's

200
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:13,200
your typical pass typical weak password

201
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:16,500
of the word password which will be

202
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:18,750
cracked instantly by by dictionary

203
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:22,740
attacks and very quickly by any kind of

204
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:25,500
true brute-force attacks so does using

205
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:30,240
complexity on weak passwords make them

206
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:32,130
stronger yes but not by that much you

207
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,900
can add more complexity you can change

208
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:37,650
things up but it really doesn't make it

209
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:40,140
stronger much stronger so passphrases

210
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:41,340
I'm sure everyone in here or most of the

211
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:43,890
people here have now heard about

212
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:46,200
passphrases at one point or another pass

213
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:50,160
phrases are multiple words with spaces

214
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:52,760
in between them and this is a lot easier

215
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:56,000
for the human brain to actually remember

216
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:58,130
in a psychological point of view because

217
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,750
remembering three words with spaces or

218
00:08:58,130 --> 00:09:02,110
dashes is a lot easier than remembering

219
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:04,250
one word with seven hush tags for

220
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:06,950
semicolons and a couple of commas

221
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:08,750
involved it up a minimum length of ten

222
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:11,000
characters should be in place for low

223
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:13,460
privilege users and a minimum length of

224
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:18,410
16 characters should be in place for

225
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:22,310
high privilege users so here's an

226
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:24,770
example of a passphrase being used which

227
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:28,250
has now gone from instantly to one

228
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:31,220
minute to 454 billion years so the

229
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:33,110
computational mathematics behind it

230
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:35,570
shows that it will take a lot longer and

231
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:39,650
even better yet add some complexity in

232
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:41,960
there as well so now we can move on to

233
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:44,870
the main part social media spearfishing

234
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:46,310
and how to protect yourself we're going

235
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:48,200
to start off by having a little look at

236
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:50,359
the threat landscape understanding what

237
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:52,340
spearfishing is a bit of a motivation

238
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:54,410
behind it some scary facts and

239
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:56,660
statistics a case study and then how to

240
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:58,850
protect against spearfishing we are

241
00:09:56,660 --> 00:10:01,100
going to be giving away some lockpick

242
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:02,990
sets at the end of this talk to people

243
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:05,240
that can answer questions about the top

244
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:07,250
sight do you pay attention and don't

245
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:10,850
fall asleep if you want free lockpick

246
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:13,850
status so let's have a look at the

247
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:16,790
threat landscape between October 2013

248
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:20,180
and May 2018 businesses inside and

249
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:23,410
outside of the US lost over 12.5 billion

250
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:26,420
dollars to email business compromised

251
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:28,790
2015 was really a massive year for

252
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:30,530
ransomware with over seven hundred and

253
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:33,880
fifty two percent increase and

254
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:37,010
ransomware families jumping from 29 to

255
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:40,820
247 ransomware is still increasing but

256
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:43,610
rapidly what is the business email

257
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:46,790
compromised so business email compromise

258
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:51,440
is a form of fraud and it plays off

259
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:54,050
natural human psychological urges so I

260
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:56,450
would send Leggett so you to spook

261
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:59,479
spoofer c-suite employs a chief

262
00:10:56,450 --> 00:11:01,700
executive officer or chief operating

263
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:05,300
officer or or whatever officers are are

264
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:08,330
these days and you'd email through to a

265
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:10,880
financial director asking them to

266
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:14,150
deposit X amount of money quickly before

267
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:15,770
we lose a license for example so the

268
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:18,650
average loss is a hundred and forty

269
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:20,840
thousand dollars the owner AG lost forty

270
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:24,160
four point six million dollars from one

271
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:28,130
point of business email compromised in

272
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:30,469
2006 in 2018 business email compromised

273
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:32,960
rose by about forty six percent or

274
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:36,770
reported email business compromised rose

275
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:37,400
by about forty six percent what is

276
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:39,590
ransomware

277
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:41,360
so I ransomware payloads are usually

278
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:44,060
delivered by email a user will click a

279
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:46,460
link or download an attachment or some

280
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:48,469
form of trickery involved and the

281
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:51,250
ransomware will then encrypt all of the

282
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:54,770
files on the computer and demand money

283
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:56,510
usually in the payment form of Bitcoin

284
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:58,610
or etherium or some form of

285
00:11:56,510 --> 00:12:01,730
cryptocurrency to actually unlock the

286
00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:03,410
files I saw quite a lot of cases where

287
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:05,450
people actually did pay to get their

288
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:10,100
files unlocked and never got given a key

289
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:14,480
to unlock their files so what is

290
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:16,580
spearfishing spearfishing unlike regular

291
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:20,030
fishing target's individuals and

292
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:22,180
specific people it has the attacker will

293
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:24,740
actually spend some time researching

294
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:26,479
understanding the person that they're

295
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:28,130
going to attack and building a profile

296
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:31,100
you'll understand the family's needs

297
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:32,870
their hobbies pretty much everything

298
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:36,260
that they do anything that you can do to

299
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:38,540
build an overall profile there are three

300
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:40,550
main payloads and here technical

301
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:43,250
payloads which is usually ransomware or

302
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:44,900
some form of malware psychological

303
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:47,600
payloads which is business email

304
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:49,430
compromised or any other kind of do this

305
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:52,490
now because someone's emailing you from

306
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:55,400
a higher higher level accounts either or

307
00:12:52,490 --> 00:13:00,200
both which is just a spoof password

308
00:12:55,400 --> 00:13:03,670
reset or some form of key logger so what

309
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:06,350
is the motivation behind spear fishing

310
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:08,060
spear phishing is incredibly easy to set

311
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:10,339
up and execute it doesn't take up much

312
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:12,859
time and the rewards can be absolutely

313
00:13:10,339 --> 00:13:13,670
massive we'll talk about case study a

314
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:14,930
little bit later

315
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:16,880
you'll be able to see some of the real

316
00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:20,750
effects of spearfishing and how much

317
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:23,120
money it can actually make so why

318
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:25,910
spearfishing really so we've all

319
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:27,590
received normal maths phishing emails

320
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:28,250
that are clearly sent out to thousands

321
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:30,530
of people

322
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:32,870
that are written in poorly they're in

323
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:35,060
poorly written English probably trying

324
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:38,420
to sell you some kind of penis extension

325
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:40,130
medication or or something that is you

326
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:41,209
know something terrible along those

327
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:47,770
lines maybe similar

328
00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:50,270
Russian mail brides as well so the

329
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:53,240
difference between these emails are they

330
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:54,980
are not obvious they are well-made they

331
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:58,610
look authentic in their correct and

332
00:13:54,980 --> 00:14:00,350
crafted the URL sorry the email address

333
00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:02,360
that it's coming from will not look fake

334
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:04,340
it will no longer be their valued

335
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:05,690
customer and there are a couple of other

336
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:09,830
mistakes in there that I'm sure people

337
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:12,530
would notice like regard bottom so how

338
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:14,510
can we actually start building better

339
00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:17,140
emails that people are more likely to

340
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:20,540
fall for and more likely to understand

341
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:25,189
so an example that I like to use is AC

342
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:26,900
suite employee goes on holiday and post

343
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:28,760
a picture of them on the beach and they

344
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:31,370
have their hotel name in the background

345
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:32,260
so we've got on Twitter and we found

346
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:34,970
this

347
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:36,439
we found the hotel name and we know that

348
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:39,080
they were there during certain dates

349
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:41,000
I'll then send an email to the hotel

350
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:43,430
asking them a very generic question like

351
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,050
do you have gym facilities or what time

352
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:47,930
is your bar closed or the usual

353
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:49,609
important questions and when they reply

354
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:51,770
to you will then analyze the language

355
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:54,760
and the way the being mail response is

356
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:56,900
written to us grab the email footer and

357
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:59,000
any information that we can actually

358
00:14:56,900 --> 00:15:02,060
grab from the email returned to us and

359
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:04,940
then send an email to the c-suite

360
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:06,619
employee that has tweeted picture of

361
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:08,360
another hotel

362
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:10,640
we'll be exploiting a trust relationship

363
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:12,560
here because they've been there before

364
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:14,270
they know the hotel they don't

365
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:17,300
understand why people know they were in

366
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:19,750
the hotel so our email will say we found

367
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:22,459
some high value goods in your room

368
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:24,320
please either click on this link or

369
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:26,560
download this to have a look at them and

370
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:29,410
if they are yours then we'll return

371
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:31,060
to you very quickly people naturally

372
00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:32,650
will click on that they're scared that

373
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:34,209
they've lost something maybe even

374
00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:35,890
they're a bad person they're thinking

375
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:37,060
can I steal something here can I say

376
00:15:35,890 --> 00:15:38,860
that something was mine

377
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:41,829
in which case and it's a good thing that

378
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:43,990
we are fishing them so let's have a look

379
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:50,740
at some fairly scary facts and

380
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:53,400
statistics two-thirds of all malware

381
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:55,800
arrives by email attachments

382
00:15:53,400 --> 00:16:00,699
sophisticated phishing emails facilitate

383
00:15:55,800 --> 00:16:03,459
90% of successful attacks 97% of people

384
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:06,010
cannot differentiate an authentic email

385
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:07,810
from a well-crafted fake one this is a

386
00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:10,300
statistic that I'm focusing on the most

387
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:12,279
for this presentation whilst the other

388
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:14,620
one show the effect of it and a powerful

389
00:16:12,279 --> 00:16:16,689
of Ness of it this is showing that

390
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:19,510
actually if you write things in good

391
00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:23,400
English and it looks genuine then people

392
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:26,319
probably are going to click on it so 50%

393
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:28,089
56% of email recipients and 40% of

394
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:31,089
Facebook users clicked on a link from an

395
00:16:28,089 --> 00:16:32,589
unknown sender because of curiosity they

396
00:16:31,089 --> 00:16:34,540
didn't know what was on there but they

397
00:16:32,589 --> 00:16:40,420
wanted to know so they still clicked on

398
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:42,790
it even knowing the risks so let's have

399
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:45,490
a little bit of look at a case study a

400
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:46,900
very famous hacking group called carbon

401
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:49,390
AK who have been around for a little

402
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:52,930
while and they have stolen billions and

403
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:54,760
billions of dollars now in total and I

404
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:56,050
believe one person has been arrested but

405
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:58,569
I don't think anyone's ever actually

406
00:16:56,050 --> 00:17:00,550
been charged so if we compare this to

407
00:16:58,570 --> 00:17:02,710
jewelry heists of 30 million where

408
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:05,438
everyone well the majority of the tying

409
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:07,750
their courts in comparison to our hacker

410
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:10,089
stealing billions and never being caught

411
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:13,599
we can really see why spearfishing is so

412
00:17:10,089 --> 00:17:15,550
good so the carbonate group attack

413
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:18,490
banking institutions and they started

414
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:20,740
with spear phishing emails once they

415
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:23,290
were on the network that run some form

416
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:25,000
of manual reconnaissance recording

417
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:27,879
everything that was tied by staffs and

418
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:30,060
video footage CCTV footage webcams that

419
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:32,200
kind of thing to ensure that they can

420
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:35,500
actually understand how everything's

421
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:37,810
working and how everything inside is

422
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:38,770
actually operating so they can try and

423
00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:42,310
impersonate

424
00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:44,320
Euan member of staff large sums of money

425
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:46,480
were transferred through ATM to Swift

426
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:49,330
Network and creating high value bank

427
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:51,790
accounts but here's a slide that I've

428
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:54,250
liberated from Kaspersky they were

429
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:57,070
actually the company that investigated

430
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:58,960
this attack if you add me on Twitter at

431
00:17:57,070 --> 00:18:02,010
the end or go to my Twitter at the end I

432
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:03,940
posted an interview with the guy that

433
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:07,450
investigated the carbon arc attacks

434
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:10,780
really really interesting stuff really

435
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:12,490
interesting so we start off at the

436
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:14,770
beginning where carbon arc is sent is a

437
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:17,050
backdoor email attachment to a bank

438
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:18,820
employee previously they've discovered

439
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:21,580
that this Bank is running an old version

440
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:23,980
of Microsoft Word internally by using

441
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:27,040
standard forms of Osen tools such as a

442
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:29,550
Bluto or a few others that will scrape

443
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:31,810
the metadata from files online and

444
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:34,300
they've been uploaded by people from

445
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:36,399
that company so the backdoor attachment

446
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:38,620
would exploit a vulnerability in the

447
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:41,890
Microsoft Word version that would give

448
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:43,479
system access so the employees

449
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:45,850
downloaded this and they've got system

450
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:47,770
access on one computer they've sent it

451
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:50,530
to quite a few other people and they've

452
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:53,290
got a load of computers but at this

453
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:55,750
point there is no administrative

454
00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:57,820
credentials to get on to the domain

455
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:59,800
controller so they used one of the

456
00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:03,100
compromised computers to send an email

457
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:05,220
to the IT administrators complaining

458
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:08,230
that one of the computers that had been

459
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:10,150
infected was very slow and they wanted

460
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:12,070
them to come and have a look at it the

461
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:13,780
IT administrators came and had a look

462
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:17,080
and there was a key logger on the login

463
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:19,149
portal so they now have administrative

464
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:22,689
access and they've got complete control

465
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:24,850
of the data that they've got control of

466
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:26,620
the domain controller they own the

467
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:29,800
infrastructure that can pretty much do

468
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:31,989
whatever they want from this time so now

469
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:34,120
that you're inside a bank how'd you get

470
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:36,220
the money out without being caught or

471
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:37,719
without being caught quickly and giving

472
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:40,540
you enough time to actually be able to

473
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:41,740
get out a decent sum of money so there

474
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:44,470
are four different methods that were

475
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:47,170
used by paavana online banking so

476
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:49,390
sending money outside of the outside of

477
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:52,570
the countries to maybe Caymans or any

478
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:55,210
kind of tax haven places

479
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:57,908
payment systems inflating bank balances

480
00:19:55,210 --> 00:20:03,039
but my personal favorite controlling

481
00:19:57,909 --> 00:20:06,519
ATMs so they lay a bit of malware damn

482
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:10,809
that would go into the ATMs and that

483
00:20:06,519 --> 00:20:12,759
hired a load of thugs to go to banks

484
00:20:10,809 --> 00:20:14,590
with special cards that would trigger

485
00:20:12,759 --> 00:20:16,779
the malware and spit all of the money

486
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:20,340
out of the ATMs

487
00:20:16,779 --> 00:20:22,630
after reading about this I ended up

488
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:24,870
researching ATM hacking a little bit

489
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:29,529
more and apparently it's quite easy you

490
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:31,508
can a lot of ATMs you can buy a generic

491
00:20:29,529 --> 00:20:33,279
default key online that allows you to

492
00:20:31,509 --> 00:20:34,899
unlock them and once you unlock them

493
00:20:33,279 --> 00:20:36,340
you've got a USB port not that I'm

494
00:20:34,899 --> 00:20:38,768
encouraging anyone to go around hacking

495
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:41,350
ATMs but I'm just saying it's probably

496
00:20:38,769 --> 00:20:42,850
easier than we think so they would go

497
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:45,309
and collect this money and then drop the

498
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:49,240
money off to whoever was controlling

499
00:20:45,309 --> 00:20:52,450
them and yeah they took over a billion

500
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:55,210
dollars on this Bank I believe this one

501
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:58,179
was it was it was a billion dollars

502
00:20:55,210 --> 00:21:03,519
worth of rubies or ripples that they

503
00:20:58,179 --> 00:21:07,600
ended up stealing so how do we protect

504
00:21:03,519 --> 00:21:11,169
against spear phishing don't share

505
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:13,480
personal information online try and keep

506
00:21:11,169 --> 00:21:15,070
as much it's easier said than done we

507
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,820
all want to put things on facebook every

508
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:17,529
now and then

509
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:19,299
I'm sure off that we're on holiday for

510
00:21:17,529 --> 00:21:21,580
example but you try and be considerate

511
00:21:19,299 --> 00:21:24,759
and try and really think if someone saw

512
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:26,860
this on my social media could they use

513
00:21:24,759 --> 00:21:29,049
this to exploit some form of trust

514
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:31,750
relationship that I have with maybe a

515
00:21:29,049 --> 00:21:34,149
third party or maybe a something that

516
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:37,750
I'm interested in report any suspicious

517
00:21:34,149 --> 00:21:40,600
emails contact the sender before you

518
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:45,399
download anything and contact the sender

519
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:46,779
before you click on any links so now's

520
00:21:45,399 --> 00:21:49,508
the fun bit see who is actually

521
00:21:46,779 --> 00:21:53,080
listening and we will be giving out some

522
00:21:49,509 --> 00:21:56,259
lock picks for this so can anyone tell

523
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:58,270
me how often is malware sent as an

524
00:21:56,259 --> 00:22:01,359
attachment yes

525
00:21:58,270 --> 00:22:01,359
[Music]

526
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:10,980
so yeah according to Verizon two-thirds

527
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,140
of all malware arrives by email

528
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:15,180
attachments

529
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:17,060
what percentage of sophisticated cyber

530
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:28,320
attacks start with the phishing email

531
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:34,290
knighted correct how many people from

532
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:38,760
the carbonic group have been charged one

533
00:22:34,290 --> 00:22:49,950
have been charged one was at risk but no

534
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:51,720
one's been charged yet what should the

535
00:22:49,950 --> 00:23:05,040
minimum password length be for a low

536
00:22:51,720 --> 00:23:15,360
privileged user account of course anyone

537
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:16,889
want to answer way like sorry ten

538
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:20,219
characters obviously this recommendation

539
00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:22,860
may vary depending on companies company

540
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:24,660
but ten characters usually your standard

541
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:27,360
for very low privilege user accounts

542
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:28,710
that don't have easy access to really

543
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:36,270
doing any damage to either an

544
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:44,570
application or infrastructure why should

545
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:44,570
the maximum password length be here yeah

546
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:58,560
so has anyone got any questions for me

547
00:23:51,780 --> 00:24:02,720
about the presentation pardon they'll be

548
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:02,720
given out some of the questions yep

549
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:14,459
[Music]

550
00:24:26,659 --> 00:24:34,289
ya know if you can research a person you

551
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:35,908
can understand then yes but we recommend

552
00:24:34,289 --> 00:24:38,629
to use password lockers which will be

553
00:24:35,909 --> 00:24:42,830
randomly generating pass phrases for you

554
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:42,830
that's a really good point absolutely

555
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:48,149
they use pass phrases because it's all

556
00:24:46,289 --> 00:24:50,100
its dictionary based but a lot of the

557
00:24:48,149 --> 00:24:51,629
time the password lockers will choose

558
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:53,939
your passphrase but they'll throw some

559
00:24:51,630 --> 00:24:56,279
random complexity into there and some

560
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:58,139
random bits too to break up words so

561
00:24:56,279 --> 00:25:06,590
that they're not necessarily untrue

562
00:24:58,139 --> 00:25:06,590
words at that point it's very question

563
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:25,320
yes this housands of people so we'll

564
00:25:23,610 --> 00:25:27,090
we'll start off by going through their

565
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:29,010
LinkedIn and we'll run some tools it'll

566
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:30,928
bring sort of all the employees back on

567
00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:32,850
LinkedIn and we'll start with the

568
00:25:30,929 --> 00:25:35,279
obvious we get rid of the IT department

569
00:25:32,850 --> 00:25:38,029
get rid of anyone technical and then

570
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:40,320
we'll try and break it down usually to

571
00:25:38,029 --> 00:25:42,000
focus on employees that have been there

572
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:44,010
for less than three months or less than

573
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,380
two months as they likely wouldn't have

574
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:48,929
had any security awareness or fishing

575
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:50,610
training at that point but it's a matter

576
00:25:48,929 --> 00:25:53,130
of just filtering and filtering and

577
00:25:50,610 --> 00:25:56,990
filtering until you get down to the five

578
00:25:53,130 --> 00:25:56,990
maybe ten people you'd actually choose

579
00:25:58,130 --> 00:26:03,659
or then then you'll research them

580
00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:05,700
individually as a person so if I chosen

581
00:26:03,659 --> 00:26:07,409
to focus on you for a spear phishing

582
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:10,230
attack I'd go to your Facebook your

583
00:26:07,409 --> 00:26:11,669
Twitter your LinkedIn read your local

584
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:14,190
newspaper see if you've ever fit in

585
00:26:11,669 --> 00:26:15,510
there for example if you if you have

586
00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:17,519
interested in football that I know

587
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:21,149
that's potential exploit point I can go

588
00:26:17,519 --> 00:26:22,799
into and yeah just researching the

589
00:26:21,149 --> 00:26:25,428
person is a specific individual to

590
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:25,429
understand them

591
00:26:45,059 --> 00:26:52,720
non financially motivated um yeah so

592
00:26:49,929 --> 00:26:54,220
yeah in in terms of complete in terms of

593
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:55,570
actual research that I've read I'm not

594
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:59,379
aware of any but I could see how it

595
00:26:55,570 --> 00:27:01,570
could be used so usually when there's no

596
00:26:59,379 --> 00:27:03,219
monetary value involved in a tap there

597
00:27:01,570 --> 00:27:05,799
has to be something else involved in it

598
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:07,720
it could be an attacker that has a

599
00:27:05,799 --> 00:27:09,879
massive ego that's just doing it for fun

600
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:12,070
but it would most likely in that case be

601
00:27:09,879 --> 00:27:14,259
either a competitor or someone that

602
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:17,080
would have that would benefit in some

603
00:27:14,259 --> 00:27:18,669
way of actually either knocking down

604
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:24,220
your infrastructure or getting into your

605
00:27:18,669 --> 00:27:34,720
your email accounts no I'm not aware of

606
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:49,029
any research specifically yeah yeah yeah

607
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:51,879
almost aw yeah absolutely

608
00:27:49,029 --> 00:27:52,990
yeah absolutely I think the only way

609
00:27:51,879 --> 00:27:55,779
that we're ever going to be able to

610
00:27:52,990 --> 00:28:27,399
really tackle spear phishing is security

611
00:27:55,779 --> 00:28:29,950
awareness training definitely you could

612
00:28:27,399 --> 00:28:30,998
potentially but the codes reset every 60

613
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:33,869
seconds if you're using Google

614
00:28:30,999 --> 00:28:33,869
Authenticator

615
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:49,949
yeah I'm not entirely sure I wouldn't

616
00:28:47,850 --> 00:29:03,320
know how to go about approaching that

617
00:28:49,950 --> 00:29:03,320
once we Afghanistan yeah evil jinx yep

618
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:33,030
yep yes interesting follows this is the

619
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:35,250
last one giving up yeah a comfortable

620
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:36,960
amount of data to gather is until you

621
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:39,000
are personally comfortable you know that

622
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:41,220
person well enough that if you would

623
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:43,140
have a conversation with them persons

624
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:44,730
person for example you'd know ways to be

625
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:46,710
able to lead the conversations be able

626
00:29:44,730 --> 00:29:48,210
to trick them and steer them it's a

627
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:50,280
little bit how long is a piece of string

628
00:29:48,210 --> 00:29:52,470
in that sense because you might come

629
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:55,050
across a really really vulnerable target

630
00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:57,930
a really easy target but you might end

631
00:29:55,050 --> 00:29:59,669
up someone that's posted really obvious

632
00:29:57,930 --> 00:30:01,530
information about themselves online that

633
00:29:59,670 --> 00:30:02,760
you can use to exploit sometimes it's a

634
00:30:01,530 --> 00:30:04,820
little bit more difficult it's usually

635
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:25,640
down to whether the company is doing

636
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:25,639
security awareness training or not yeah

637
00:30:27,770 --> 00:30:37,110
so if if people are not reusing

638
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:40,530
passwords and I can definitely

639
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:42,990
understand the less rotation what if

640
00:30:40,530 --> 00:30:45,090
you're using a 25 character password

641
00:30:42,990 --> 00:30:47,640
you're only using in one place you're

642
00:30:45,090 --> 00:30:50,760
100% sure it's being stored in

643
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:53,460
an encrypted format then yes potentially

644
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:57,540
but the reality is that most people

645
00:30:53,460 --> 00:31:00,770
reuse passwords websites don't always

646
00:30:57,540 --> 00:31:03,810
store your data and clear encrypted and

647
00:31:00,770 --> 00:31:05,340
I'm sure most of people this room have

648
00:31:03,810 --> 00:31:07,110
used have I been poned on one of their

649
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:10,080
old email accounts and found at least

650
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:12,479
one or two weeks that they've been in so

651
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:14,970
in a perfect scenario yes but I just

652
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:17,460
think unfortunately the human element

653
00:31:14,970 --> 00:31:36,930
makes it a little bit more difficult

654
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:41,070
than just doing that to buy password

655
00:31:36,930 --> 00:31:46,110
history do you mean so you don't have to

656
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:50,700
attend class I mean I guess it means

657
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:53,429
that it really depends on the company

658
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:56,370
specifically I think how their employees

659
00:31:53,430 --> 00:31:59,280
are how well the any security awareness

660
00:31:56,370 --> 00:32:02,250
training is affected them and how the

661
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:04,350
kind of setup is I think it should be

662
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:07,020
looked at on more of an individual case

663
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:09,240
to case basis as opposed to just

664
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:12,200
deciding straight away but I think

665
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:15,660
rotating passwords does have its merit

666
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:17,130
but that is usually because of password

667
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:18,690
reuse attacks that have been coming out

668
00:32:17,130 --> 00:32:22,620
of clear text leaks and that kind of

669
00:32:18,690 --> 00:32:24,150
thing so if people aren't using their

670
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:26,520
password in multiple places and they're

671
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:41,250
not reusing then yeah you can get rid of

672
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:42,990
the yeah yeah I mean they also used to

673
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:44,520
say that um complexity was more

674
00:32:42,990 --> 00:32:46,650
important than length in terms of

675
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:48,629
computational power so I think

676
00:32:46,650 --> 00:32:49,650
everything needs taken with a little bit

677
00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:53,930
of a pinch of soul

678
00:32:49,650 --> 00:32:56,160
I personally my personal view is the

679
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:57,510
password should be rolled over and they

680
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:58,870
should be changed and they should be a

681
00:32:57,510 --> 00:33:00,700
policy that

682
00:32:58,870 --> 00:33:03,280
is forcing people to reset their

683
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:05,380
password every maybe six months to a

684
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:07,059
year I know three months was thrown

685
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:08,830
around for a while at one point but I

686
00:33:07,059 --> 00:33:11,230
think it's being increased quite a lot

687
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:13,689
now by most companies but I don't see

688
00:33:11,230 --> 00:33:15,340
why reinforcing users change a password

689
00:33:13,690 --> 00:33:28,120
can actually be a negative thing if

690
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:30,659
they're using a password blocker yeah in

691
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:30,659
what sense

692
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:37,179
not really I mean on a typical

693
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:40,270
penetration testing engagement where

694
00:33:37,179 --> 00:33:42,220
we're doing phishing campaigns will ask

695
00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:44,410
to be white listed on a web application

696
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:47,320
test when we're testing will ask to be

697
00:33:44,410 --> 00:33:49,870
white listed this isn't this is in a

698
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:52,000
standard penetration test as opposed to

699
00:33:49,870 --> 00:33:54,699
red teaming this is because we're

700
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:56,980
looking to test the vulnerabilities the

701
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:58,600
code itself or the humans themselves if

702
00:33:56,980 --> 00:34:01,600
they're gonna click on it as opposed to

703
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:03,240
testing someone's defenses or anything

704
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:10,000
that they've got in place over there

705
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:11,620
yeah spam filters are great they should

706
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:19,989
always be used but there's no guarantee

707
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:21,549
that well I've seen from our experience

708
00:34:19,989 --> 00:34:23,560
will usually ask to be whitelist

709
00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:27,040
engagement through through any spam

710
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:30,190
filters but I've I've seen recently the

711
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:33,489
people have been putting JPEGs or PNG s

712
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:34,899
pasted into emails and as opposed to

713
00:34:33,489 --> 00:34:37,270
having it just in normal text it's

714
00:34:34,899 --> 00:34:38,440
actually an image that's insider and I

715
00:34:37,270 --> 00:34:40,509
think that's one of the ways of people

716
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:48,280
are trying to bypass different spam

717
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:50,950
filters at the moment personally not to

718
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:56,409
my knowledge but if they've done it well

719
00:34:50,949 --> 00:35:03,700
enough and I won't know anyone else I am

720
00:34:56,409 --> 00:35:05,050
NOT I mean I'm definitely getting social

721
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:08,310
engineered a bit by the partner at the

722
00:35:05,050 --> 00:35:17,550
moment so it's probably me

723
00:35:08,310 --> 00:35:20,610
yes no no typically if a company's never

724
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:22,440
had a fishing engagement or any security

725
00:35:20,610 --> 00:35:25,410
awareness training you'll get plus 50%

726
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:27,450
click rate and that'll get lower and

727
00:35:25,410 --> 00:35:29,520
lower with the amount that it goes down

728
00:35:27,450 --> 00:35:31,200
but I mean it does depend on the company

729
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:32,780
so that's not an exact statistic but

730
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:51,750
from my previous experience it's usually

731
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:56,400
roughly 50 yeah yeah I don't yeah do

732
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:57,570
that okay yeah oh they'll be really

733
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:26,640
interesting I'll definitely have a look

734
00:35:57,570 --> 00:36:28,980
at that awesome cool anyone else secure

735
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:32,600
it security awareness training is the

736
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:37,320
only way to really tackle it funny and

737
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:39,089
we should try and ensure that the

738
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:40,950
languages used in emails are coming

739
00:36:39,090 --> 00:36:42,450
through to us so often when you're at

740
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:43,710
work for example if you're emailing a

741
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:46,200
friend you'll use slightly different

742
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:47,760
language it's analyzing and looking for

743
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:50,689
these kinds of things but the only real

744
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:54,120
thing to prevent spear phishing is to

745
00:36:50,690 --> 00:36:55,890
have a real staff awareness security

746
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:58,609
awareness training program and regular

747
00:36:55,890 --> 00:36:58,609
fishing campaigns

748
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:03,540
it's definitely paying off so when when

749
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:06,120
we've typically been doing a fishing

750
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:08,070
engagement for a company will will be

751
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:10,759
three or four maybe five and we see

752
00:37:08,070 --> 00:37:17,580
significant changes between each one

753
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:21,090
yeah that we're doing the fishing

754
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:22,020
engagements against so the one the one I

755
00:37:21,090 --> 00:37:25,380
use an example

756
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:28,050
a big pharmaceutical company so massive

757
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:30,030
it can really vary from from small media

758
00:37:28,050 --> 00:37:35,790
from small businesses small mediums to

759
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:51,960
large financial institutions last

760
00:37:35,790 --> 00:37:53,370
question if there is one yes please so

761
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:55,560
one of the things that we recommend is

762
00:37:53,370 --> 00:37:58,080
if you have a phishing assessment done

763
00:37:55,560 --> 00:38:00,120
you watch is sure those users you don't

764
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:02,460
shame and there's no need to share not

765
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:05,250
use except if seven under training then

766
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:08,070
there's no point in fighting with fire

767
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:09,720
basically so the best thing to do one is

768
00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:14,100
to show them what their actions lighter

769
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:16,740
so if we fished a you CEO say and there

770
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:18,180
are no efficient training I thought is

771
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:20,759
that you know the bare minimum

772
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:23,220
show him because of your options you

773
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:25,950
know this malicious target managed to

774
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:29,220
steal on your passport number your

775
00:38:25,950 --> 00:38:31,080
credit card information the company the

776
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:33,359
crown jewels basically if the company

777
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:35,700
and they make some think a bit more and

778
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:38,760
then they start to apply a lot mentality

779
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:40,319
so their own personal emails because you

780
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:46,080
know that's why it's going to kick in

781
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:49,280
the most really yep thank you very much

782
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:49,279
thank you very much guys
