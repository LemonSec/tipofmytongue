5
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:23,039
who I am like Roy said CBT and a

6
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:27,028
practitioner I'm a parenting consultant

7
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:30,210
and I do lots of work with recovery

8
00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:32,640
college in reading so I run workshops

9
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:34,739
for anxiety and depression panic attacks

10
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,950
and stress so people that are already

11
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:41,519
very stressed out and anxious so I know

12
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:45,809
when they come we'll take the rain now I

13
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:47,430
don't know how you guys are dealing with

14
00:00:45,809 --> 00:00:51,599
stress and anxiety and things like that

15
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:54,809
so my agenda for today is discussing a

16
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,460
bit what what mental health is what we

17
00:00:54,809 --> 00:00:59,968
can do to improve mental health who is

18
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:02,430
anxiety what is the stress hello long

19
00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:05,369
flight what is depression and what we

20
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:06,689
can do to cope with you know one way

21
00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:08,280
when we are not of weights and we don't

22
00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:10,619
know what to do and we are very stressed

23
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:12,930
out and we feel that life is not going

24
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:17,220
the way we want to we want to you know

25
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:20,850
we want it to go and we envision so that

26
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:24,600
is the agenda and the alcohol for today

27
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:26,699
is that if you guys can take one thing

28
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:28,350
away from today that you can implement

29
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:33,000
that you think is going to make your

30
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:35,369
life easier different better that would

31
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,280
be for me the best thing ever

32
00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:41,520
so I don't expect anyone to take

33
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:43,079
millions of nodes and do I'm going to do

34
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:45,329
this and I think that if you want to do

35
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:47,130
that you know go ahead and do it but

36
00:01:45,329 --> 00:01:48,839
sometimes there is lots of information

37
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:50,429
that is being delivered and it's big

38
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:52,770
huge elephant if you can just take one

39
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:54,780
thing and say this is what I'm gonna

40
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:57,179
implement this is what I'm gonna do this

41
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:59,159
resonates with me and I think it's going

42
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:02,880
to make a difference to my life so that

43
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:06,299
is the outcome really office of this

44
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,580
session on mental health what is mental

45
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:10,649

46
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:13,560
can anyone say I've got a few things in

47
00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:18,880

a really huge depression um I didn't I

65

67
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:11,530
I was stuck I was in a hole and all I

68
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:13,480
got was people walking past let's say

69
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:16,000
and say oh you're not feeling that well

70
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:18,070
Tina life is okay you know you could

71
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,570

we are still in the hole and you're

74
00:03:21,459 --> 00:03:25,060
still looking down and you're not able

75
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:28,209
to look confident you don't know what to

76
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:29,769
do so mental health good about mental

77
00:03:28,209 --> 00:03:32,890
health refers to our cognitions our

78
00:03:29,769 --> 00:03:35,519
behaviors and our emotions let's say a

79
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:38,829
good mental health is how we manage to

80
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:41,230
express and then with our emotions in

81
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:42,670
the blood or negative or positive and by

82
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:44,890
the way there is no negative or positive

83
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:48,220
emotions is there just emotions all

84
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:51,690
emotions are giving us something not

85
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:54,430
telling us we you know if if you go into

86
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:56,950
panic because you step onto the road and

87
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:58,750
a bus is coming well that's you know

88
00:03:56,950 --> 00:04:00,429
your emotion is telling you to move get

89
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:03,580
out of the way you need to know you need

90
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:06,130
to do something right how we build up

91
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:08,829
relationships with people all depends on

92
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:12,100
our mental health right if we have

93
00:04:08,829 --> 00:04:14,769
positive thinking and good thinking we

94
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:17,200
think importance and we can we can

95
00:04:14,769 --> 00:04:20,070
relate to others if we go out in the

96
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:22,440
street suddenly someone looks at

97
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:25,530
from across the road always not going Oh

98
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:27,030
looking at me Oh want to kill me

99
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:28,770
oh no looking at me what do you say what

100
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:32,219
is it I'm looking ugly today it's in my

101
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:34,380
hair I don't know what is it right but

102
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:37,620
it's not healthy where you're thinking

103
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:40,170
that can lead into paranoia right you

104
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:42,180
don't go out of the house and goes into

105
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:42,480
looking yourself up so no one looks at

106
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:45,300
you

107
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:48,300
so you see understand in emotional

108
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:50,760
intelligence knowing our limitations

109
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:54,270
knowing what to do to cope when we get

110
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:55,710
into moments of the strange man so the

111
00:04:54,270 --> 00:05:00,479
world is upside down and we don't know

112
00:04:55,710 --> 00:05:02,489
what to do that is promoting good mental

113
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:04,100
health because you're not going through

114
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:07,920
a crisis and you're not gonna get stuck

115
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:09,840
so that is my understanding of mental

116
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:12,500
health and this is from my own personal

117
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:17,820
experiences to war you know what I think

118
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:23,300
good mental health is now mental health

119
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:26,849
problems this is a survey done 2018

120
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:29,490
stress depression and anxiety is is the

121
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:32,190
main three mental health problems that

122
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:35,490
we get to talk about and people are a

123
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:37,860
bit more open to talk I'm very very

124
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:39,930
stress at work I'm a bit anxious about

125
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:44,460
doing this on the other don't like

126
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:47,310
social situations move away I don't I

127
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:50,489
don't feel right socializing with people

128
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:53,820
I'm feeling very low I don't know what

129
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:56,270
to do with my life so you kind of you

130
00:05:53,820 --> 00:06:00,450
kind of start going is pulling down the

131
00:05:56,270 --> 00:06:03,210
statistics for 2018 is like 15 point 4

132
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:06,530
million working days are lost for the

133
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:12,060
year due to stress depression anxiety

134
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:15,239
now that is because we are not having

135
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:17,580
the tools to cope we don't know so it

136
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:19,710
gets to a point in which like I did I go

137
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:21,690
to my manager and I said I'm not feeling

138
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:23,820
very well and I'm feeling really down

139
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:26,460
I'm feeling very blue and crying all the

140
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:28,590
time I just don't know what to do and

141
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:30,479
then my manager would say like

142
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:32,369
says at the time you need to go and see

143
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:34,020
your GP and I go to GP and I said look

144
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:35,490
I'm feeling really blue and crying and

145
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:38,640
said yeah I know you're crying here you

146
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:39,810

147
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:44,370
you're depressed here you are

148

150
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:51,600
that you need that break but that

151
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:56,099
doesn't really sort out the program

152
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:58,170
that's it what is it living for me so

153

00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:23,460
no had they drank anything no did they

166
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:26,340
sort out my problem no let me empty the

167
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:29,250
prison's work yes they did I was a

168
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:31,080
zombie they worked in a way right I just

169
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:33,240
pasted up along the corridor with my

170
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:35,580
cigarette wouldn't removing at one point

171
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:40,380
I just all those many cigarettes you

172
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:41,580
know worse than another right so I did

173
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:43,650
the presence helped but we need to help

174
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:45,630
ourselves as well and wait to understand

175
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:47,429
what's going on with us if we don't want

176
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:50,330
this time was going on how we're gonna

177
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:52,110
solve a problem when we don't understand

178
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:54,870
because of a problem you don't

179
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:59,160
understand you need to be able to make

180
00:07:54,870 --> 00:08:02,310
sense of what is going on right so what

181
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:05,880
is it stress stress is the body responds

182
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:08,130
to the feeling on wound and many people

183
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:09,540
talk about stress later but I've got so

184
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:11,909
much work to do of course much of my

185
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:13,500
plate I've got so much you know so many

186
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:17,190
things going on there is stress about

187
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:20,780
finances health work relationships

188
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:24,110
strength to be a situation in which you

189
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:28,200
believe you're supposed to do something

190
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:29,730
but you don't know how to manage that

191
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:32,970
something you're supposed to do when you

192
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:34,800
become all stressed out right I'll give

193
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:37,830
you an example I'm driving my children

194
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:38,829
to school and I get into school gave my

195
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:41,140
child says drop me

196
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:51,820
in here and I just go but it's a card

197
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:54,120
behind I can't drop your fin here I'm

198
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:54,120
going oh

199
00:08:54,270 --> 00:09:00,010
Melissa let's just rest

200
00:08:57,390 --> 00:09:01,270
that's a stretch for everyone for

201
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:02,770
example we don't take it in different

202
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:05,050
ways why because we've got certain

203
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:07,120
behaviors that tells us you've got to do

204
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:09,339
the right thing the right thing is not

205
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,750
just in the middle of nowhere right I

206
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:12,790
need to like do it right and it's

207
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:15,820
perfect so they say as a sense of

208
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:17,500
perfectionism also attached to the

209
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:21,040
certain beliefs that we have that

210
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:24,270
whiteness stressors so relationships

211
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:27,939
cause of stress health word fluency

212
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:31,810
anything else that you guys think causes

213
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:37,980
a stress or stress you on anyone because

214
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:40,510
this is going mean children absolutely

215
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:43,270
what's going on in the world right that

216
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:44,740
is beyond our control and children I

217
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:47,770
mean they do know how to press it what

218
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:49,690
else are they we need also to be special

219
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:51,189
anyone notice sleep at night and you

220
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:55,540
come and see them on their quiet they go

221
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:57,460
oh yes oh not me not a few hours ago

222
00:09:55,540 --> 00:10:03,760
when you were screaming at me and so no

223
00:09:57,460 --> 00:10:08,320
yeah you are so stress um how does it

224
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:10,840
manifest how do we feel it because in in

225
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:14,410
my in my world when I talk to people

226
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:18,240
about stress translate and depression we

227
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:21,370
miss out how it manifests in the body

228
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:24,160
right when I was doing my civic training

229
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:26,740
and the rest of it it was all about you

230
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:29,530
know your thought leads to your feelings

231
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:31,960
and leads to your behaviors and if you

232
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:33,520
change your thoughts then you're able to

233
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:34,030
change the way you feel and the way you

234
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:39,060
behave

235
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:41,709
that's all well and good but I act out

236
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:45,880
before I even have a moment to think

237
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:49,750
about what has happened right so you're

238
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:52,540
suddenly going to panic mode run out of

239
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:55,030
a role you need to get away

240
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:56,939
you're stressed out or you're anxious

241
00:10:55,030 --> 00:11:01,030
you don't know what what is going on

242
00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:04,120
however if we start looking at both

243
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:07,270
physical symptoms we have we will be

244
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:10,570
able to then look into what thoughts and

245
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:12,939
reframe those thoughts so when I talk to

246
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:15,280
people about stress I ask them where do

247
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:17,860
you fit in your stress and something

248
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:18,839
people say oh I don't know that's what I

249
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:21,370
tell you

250
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:24,550
stress is felt all throughout the body

251
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:27,850
so you can feel your heart rate going

252
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:30,520
suddenly is is a really fast heartbeat

253
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:32,290
you start breathing from up here

254
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:34,210
some people feel butterflies in the

255
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:38,949
stomach some people fit some people feel

256
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:43,110
the face the plantain and the Jew

257
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:46,150
tightens up so if we're able to know

258
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:47,830
where the stress manifests some people

259
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:49,840
it's on your shoulders maybe get your

260
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:54,610
shoulders up to you or to your ears you

261
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:58,300
can relax a bit right so if we start

262
00:11:54,610 --> 00:12:00,820
understanding first room where we feel

263
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:03,609
the stress we're able to recognize what

264
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:07,030
getting stressed out and then we're able

265
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:09,100
to put some wishes in place it makes

266
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:12,339
sense to me and I hope it makes sense to

267
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:14,920
everyone so you need to figure out where

268
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:18,940
you feel it and the thing is in this

269
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:20,110
modern world we are so fast going into

270
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:21,910
everything and anything that we are

271
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:24,700
going the with we lost our connection

272
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:27,699
with our bodies which is totally have

273
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:29,860
lost it we've lost our instant in gut

274
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:32,500
feeling with lost connection as to what

275
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:35,830
my body is telling me my body's telling

276
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:38,110
me something right behavioral

277
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:40,480
manifestations you all probably know if

278
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:42,910
you think stress no point in your life

279
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,890
you can't sleep you wake up in the

280
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:48,010
middle of the night you're irritable you

281
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:51,610

282
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:57,450
my you know my goal of the window you

283
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:57,450
are aggressive with everyone is not be

284
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:01,609
I'm going out there sometimes I'm going

285
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:05,149

going you know go away leave me alone

292
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:27,290
everyone is stressing me so if we can

293
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:30,019
think of a stress like a container right

294
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:31,849
I'm gonna stress is coming in cause

295
00:13:30,019 --> 00:13:34,550
stress is coming in and we haven't got

296
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:35,689
evolved to get this trace hard we just

297
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:38,628
don't know how to get this trace out

298
00:13:35,689 --> 00:13:42,110
then it goes into long-term chronic

299
00:13:38,629 --> 00:13:47,240
stress it really depletes the immune

300
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:51,160
system we get all sort of all sort of

301
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:55,279
hard problems with all sort of IBS and

302
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:58,339
sanity and depression and Crohn's

303
00:13:55,279 --> 00:14:01,100
disease sport officers and eventually

304
00:13:58,339 --> 00:14:04,370
over time chronic stress will lead to a

305
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:08,860
very very over word fragile immune

306
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:12,860
system that will not be able to cope

307
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:15,139
with any parts of viruses too different

308
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:16,550
you know your body so if you're

309
00:14:15,139 --> 00:14:18,769
distressed enough for a long period of

310
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:20,719
time you might find that you get colds

311
00:14:18,769 --> 00:14:23,600
oh you get more clothes dude in the

312
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:25,579
window you want to find that your

313
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:27,500
stomach is upside down most of the times

314
00:14:25,579 --> 00:14:30,709
and then you might get some skin

315
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:34,160
reactions pink brushes and that is

316
00:14:30,709 --> 00:14:36,018
called you to what stress does to us

317
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:38,329
so there is eternally rushing through

318
00:14:36,019 --> 00:14:41,089
the body that is there is cortisol

319
00:14:38,329 --> 00:14:43,839
rushing through the body they are they

320
00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:47,059
are if you want to call it too sick

321
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:49,220
chemicals they are there to make us act

322
00:14:47,059 --> 00:14:51,319
they are there to keep it away from

323
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:55,370
dinosaur a dinosaur is just about to

324
00:14:51,319 --> 00:14:59,660
eaten right is a very old alert system

325
00:14:55,370 --> 00:15:02,089
with God it has been postponed three

326
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:04,579
years and centuries and millions of

327
00:15:02,089 --> 00:15:07,910
years to our change because we need to

328
00:15:04,579 --> 00:15:11,670
be alerted if something happens but we

329
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:15,390
don't need to be in a constant state

330
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:17,699
of simmering stress all the time and

331
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:22,050
that is what depletes the immune system

332
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:23,580
there is there is no no way for the for

333
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:25,589
the body to be able to cope with the

334
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:26,910
amount of cortisone that comes through

335
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:28,950
the amount of adrenaline that comes

336
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:31,680
through you need to release it somehow

337
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:33,240
and in our modern society in the olden

338
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:35,400
days you can go and run away from the

339
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:37,110
dinosaur well that's fine but nowadays

340
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:39,000
there is no dinosaur

341
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:40,500
I knew sit at your desk and you're

342
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,140
having a panic attack and you just sit

343
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:44,670
in there or you're stressed out and the

344
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:45,870
adrenaline is still running through your

345
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:47,099
body but you're not getting rid of it

346
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:49,290
we're not getting rid of it we just sit

347
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:50,720
there and we just plug it on well

348
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:54,030
because I need to get that report done

349
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,750
we can't think straight what happens you

350
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:58,230
can't think straight

351
00:15:54,750 --> 00:16:00,780
um so what can we do to help ourselves

352
00:15:58,230 --> 00:16:04,380
um they are what is called the four

353
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:06,930
pillars of well-being that was presented

354
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:08,970
back in October last year by the

355
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:11,250
University of Reading in a conference

356
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:14,070

357
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:16,260

358
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:17,970
straightforward and easy and all of you

359
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:20,490
know and they just gave it a fancy name

360
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:23,490
because they need to give something um

361
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:27,290
give it a name um but it's properly

362
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:30,990
sleep good nutrition and hydration and I

363

400
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:49,720
was horrible nice in the world they're

401
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:52,209
going for drinks right so if we start

402
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:56,530
thinking about let's have a look at what

403
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:59,049
we can change in our diet for example if

404
00:17:56,530 --> 00:18:00,399
I am eating I don't know what dollars

405
00:17:59,049 --> 00:18:05,020
every day what surely it's not gonna be

406
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:07,210
good for me is it if I am drinking five

407
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:09,730
pints of beer every day there's not

408
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:11,260
going to be good if I am not sleeping

409
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:12,760
well you shouldn't have been saying we

410
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:15,820
don't sleep properly there is no

411
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:18,549
restorative sleep we go through the REM

412
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:20,049
sleep when you dream and when you have

413
00:18:18,549 --> 00:18:21,730
the vivid train something you remember

414
00:18:20,049 --> 00:18:25,330
sometimes so you might not remember but

415
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:27,760
the deep deep restorative sleep is what

416
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:31,210
helps the brain get rid of the toxins

417
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:33,879
that it has produced during the day so

418
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:36,340
when we here we talk when we work with

419
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:38,770
the things the brain is working the

420
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:41,350
sense of producing garbage and at night

421
00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:43,570
is when everything is cleansed out now

422
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:46,510
if you don't speak properly and you go

423
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:48,370
over the day another day and another day

424
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:49,990
eventually those books in Singapore they

425
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:53,620
are going on thank you

426
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:55,929
you're not rested so so if we start

427
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:58,658
looking about what we contains and then

428
00:18:55,929 --> 00:19:02,200
when we talk about relationships how do

429
00:18:58,659 --> 00:19:03,610
we manage relationships so I don't know

430
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:05,730
what you guys but sometimes of you're

431
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:09,280
very stressed about relationships about

432
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:12,850
friends and friendships and expectations

433
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:14,470
people put the words right I had a

434
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:17,080
friend that all she wanted to do was to

435
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:18,429
go clubbing every single weekend and it

436
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:20,710
would be Friday Saturday and Sunday

437
00:19:18,429 --> 00:19:22,390
clubbing so we would do the fried and

438
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:23,830
they started a club in and off we go and

439
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:26,549
then on Sunday I used to live in London

440
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:29,230
we used to go to the church in uh in

441
00:19:26,549 --> 00:19:30,610
case cross that was open from whatever

442
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:32,380
time in the morning to whatever time I

443
00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:32,760
mean you go there they give you a park I

444
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:34,920
mean

445
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:36,720
drinks will just come off from when I

446
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:38,280
Club it love doesn't matter get your

447
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,690
back your your disparate parts Oh

448
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:41,310
plastic back with your drinks and you

449
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:42,210
don't get somewhere and then they said

450
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:45,480
they say that huh

451
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:46,950
I mean eventually I go home and it got

452
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:49,560
to a point when I started not feeling

453
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:50,670
very well mentally I said I don't want

454
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:53,490
to go out anymore

455
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:56,850
I feel very of one of people with noise

456
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:59,880
I don't want to go out anymore oh we

457
00:19:56,850 --> 00:20:00,360
used to like it yes but no I don't like

458
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:02,760
it anymore

459
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:04,409
and then it was argument and it was pain

460
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:05,730
from course and was text messages and

461
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:07,530
that became very stressful for me

462
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:09,650
because I didn't want to lose my

463
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:11,910
friendship but at the same time I

464
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:13,320
couldn't comply with what she wanted me

465
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:18,840
to do so

466
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:23,429
saying no certain certain boundaries but

467
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:24,929
you think that it is it's a compromise

468
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:27,240
let's say for both sighs it's on both

469
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:28,950

00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:25,530
oh so having to say sometimes without

492
00:21:23,370 --> 00:21:28,679
hurting feelings and say listen I've

493
00:21:25,530 --> 00:21:32,160
been here 22 years for God's sake get a

494
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:34,560
break okay well you know you know it's a

495
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:37,080
long time you should have been used to

496
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:39,080
it but you know it's not good they were

497
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:41,490
one the best food for us but sometimes

498
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:43,439
we don't get into situations in which

499
00:21:41,490 --> 00:21:45,389
you know they want us to do this and on

500
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:47,879
the other we just not happy with it

501
00:21:45,389 --> 00:21:52,379
so we need to to money set expectations

502
00:21:47,879 --> 00:21:53,009
and say no now what can we do to come to

503
00:21:52,379 --> 00:21:58,619
mind

504
00:21:53,009 --> 00:21:59,809
right why is stress okay when there is a

505
00:21:58,619 --> 00:22:01,799
situation

506
00:21:59,809 --> 00:22:05,059
are you certain yourself can I do

507
00:22:01,799 --> 00:22:08,668
something about it right it's easy yes

508
00:22:05,059 --> 00:22:12,529
why stress you can do something about it

509
00:22:08,669 --> 00:22:15,989
then go ahead and do it just do it

510
00:22:12,529 --> 00:22:19,729
no why stress you can't do anything

511
00:22:15,989 --> 00:22:24,089
about it and I know it sounds very blunt

512
00:22:19,729 --> 00:22:27,329
but the thing is when we start reliving

513
00:22:24,089 --> 00:22:31,289
our past and sometimes I say to people

514
00:22:27,329 --> 00:22:34,109
how present is your past right

515
00:22:31,289 --> 00:22:36,779
how prescient is your past and we start

516
00:22:34,109 --> 00:22:38,189
planning ahead and trying to control

517
00:22:36,779 --> 00:22:42,329
things that we can't control

518
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:44,639
we stress but if we've got a situation

519
00:22:42,329 --> 00:22:45,719
Elysees right okay this is the situation

520
00:22:44,639 --> 00:22:49,109
of common hands

521
00:22:45,719 --> 00:22:51,149
what can I do about it I can do this and

522
00:22:49,109 --> 00:22:52,889
this and these will it work I don't know

523
00:22:51,149 --> 00:22:55,139
until I give it a go will it not work

524
00:22:52,889 --> 00:22:57,089
well if it doesn't work I'll try

525
00:22:55,139 --> 00:22:57,570
something else and I'll try something

526
00:22:57,089 --> 00:22:59,369
else

527
00:22:57,570 --> 00:23:02,668
and I'll try something else and if there

528
00:22:59,369 --> 00:23:04,320
is nothing to be done there is nothing I

529
00:23:02,669 --> 00:23:07,070
can do cause regardless of what I'm

530
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:09,479
trying to do there is nothing to be done

531
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:10,979
so it's not one of these situations that

532
00:23:09,479 --> 00:23:12,479
will say or what are you telling me to

533
00:23:10,979 --> 00:23:14,339
give up why are you telling me not to

534
00:23:12,479 --> 00:23:16,679
carry on are you telling me not to you

535
00:23:14,339 --> 00:23:20,309
know to push forward no I'm telling you

536
00:23:16,679 --> 00:23:22,079
to realistically look at it as it is or

537
00:23:20,309 --> 00:23:26,009
what it is is that if you can do

538
00:23:22,079 --> 00:23:27,709
something do it and if not be mindful so

539
00:23:26,009 --> 00:23:32,039
mindfulness based stress reduction

540
00:23:27,709 --> 00:23:34,019
techniques is what lately has been

541
00:23:32,039 --> 00:23:37,379
implemented in different companies and

542
00:23:34,019 --> 00:23:41,159
they provide a space for workers to be

543
00:23:37,379 --> 00:23:44,099
able to to relax to be able to chill out

544
00:23:41,159 --> 00:23:46,200
or to be able to run to in case they

545
00:23:44,099 --> 00:23:47,519
have panic attacks anxiety whatever I

546
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,989
used to go and lock myself in the

547
00:23:47,519 --> 00:23:53,519
cubicle in the toilet is there was no

548
00:23:48,989 --> 00:23:55,409
place to go so under different different

549
00:23:53,519 --> 00:23:56,110
ways that we can do and I know that

550
00:23:55,409 --> 00:23:58,660
you've heard

551
00:23:56,110 --> 00:23:59,770
probably oftentimes mindfulness and I

552
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:01,690
tell you what when I first heard

553
00:23:59,770 --> 00:24:04,960
mindfulness I was like over a month of

554
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:06,190
my own says what among the world raving

555
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:09,160
I see if I'm not breathing but if I'm

556
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:11,500
not reading in bed but it's not that

557
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:13,090
type of breathing you see we've got the

558
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:15,850
nervous system has the parasympathetic

559
00:24:13,090 --> 00:24:18,428
nervous system big word but it's

560
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:20,439
basically rest on digest this when you

561
00:24:18,429 --> 00:24:23,710
are till now did when you online know

562
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:27,280
the age is when you're watching TV and

563
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:29,590
there is no worries for you that is not

564
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:32,290
it being calm on the sympathetic nervous

565
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:35,350
system is the amygdala is the

566
00:24:32,290 --> 00:24:37,418
fight-or-flight response is you need to

567
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:41,320
get out of here is not stress is the

568
00:24:37,419 --> 00:24:43,950
simmering on solitary right and it has

569
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:47,129
been proven that breathing from here

570
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:52,000
from from it diaphragmatic breathing

571
00:24:47,130 --> 00:24:54,250
comes down the the sympathetic nervous

572
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,590
system the fight-or-flight response it

573
00:24:54,250 --> 00:25:00,240
has been proven there is no way you

574
00:24:56,590 --> 00:25:02,470
start breathing from here I'm your

575
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:04,870
amygdala is still gonna be a different

576
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:06,850
working that's how you come to certainly

577
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:10,449
monkeys or in the back of the head that

578
00:25:06,850 --> 00:25:15,189
is constantly going on right you you it

579
00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:16,540
is it is calming it down so I say if it

580
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:18,130
something to work with parents and

581
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:20,020
someone said children stress me out I

582
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:23,559
work with parents most of the times

583
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:25,809
actually sometimes they call oh my god I

584
00:25:23,559 --> 00:25:28,178
can't take the silence you even hate

585
00:25:25,809 --> 00:25:33,010
here I'm right here that's alright

586
00:25:28,179 --> 00:25:34,390
stop stop and pick five five pick

587
00:25:33,010 --> 00:25:36,820
breaths just from here from you're gonna

588
00:25:34,390 --> 00:25:39,910
put your hand over Billy and just give

589
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:41,889
it a big breath in on a big breath out

590
00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:43,450
I just do it two or three times a day

591
00:25:41,890 --> 00:25:45,760
your brain gets used to it you bring the

592
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:47,590
strain on doing it when you run into an

593
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:49,030
emergency you bring we know what to do

594
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:51,070
isn't it when your shoelaces when your

595
00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:52,780
little kid you start by learning that

596
00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:54,370
you doing like this and like that and

597
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:55,720
everything is a staple nowadays you just

598
00:25:54,370 --> 00:25:56,409
going to your shoelace this is like

599
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:58,299
driving

600
00:25:56,410 --> 00:26:00,490
remember when you started driving

601
00:25:58,299 --> 00:26:02,679
mirrors are in decay

602
00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:05,110
they were indication one over oh my god

603
00:26:02,679 --> 00:26:08,679
I look like a parrot not trying to

604
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:10,059
remember what I'm doing now whoever is

605
00:26:08,679 --> 00:26:11,920
struggling here you know that you just

606
00:26:10,059 --> 00:26:15,250
do it you don't have to think about it

607
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:17,530
so if you if you train your brain to

608
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:19,780
start doing some breathing if you train

609
00:26:17,530 --> 00:26:21,129
your brain to relax if you go before you

610
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:23,170
go to play it on your samurai token I'm

611
00:26:21,130 --> 00:26:25,690
gonna relax I'm gonna relax I'm going to

612
00:26:23,170 --> 00:26:28,210
stop focusing on my toes I'm gonna relax

613
00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:30,520
my faith I'm gonna relax my curves on my

614
00:26:28,210 --> 00:26:33,340
legs and you progressively work your way

615
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:35,679
through the body eventually you'll fall

616
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:37,149
asleep I can guarantee you huh and

617
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:40,660
eventually you'll have the best sleep

618
00:26:37,150 --> 00:26:42,220
ever so you need to start relaxing your

619
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:44,470
body and relaxing your mind and then

620
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:46,230
visualization techniques sometimes when

621
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:49,300
I'm stressed out of my mind I just think

622
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:52,390
where have I been in a place but I felt

623
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:54,850
really really really relaxed and happy

624
00:26:52,390 --> 00:26:57,309
and a page and I just think myself lying

625
00:26:54,850 --> 00:26:59,800
on a beach on each one when the Sun is

626
00:26:57,309 --> 00:27:02,920
hot and I'm like oh this is nothing no

627
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:06,220
children no Christian sleepy bird on the

628
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:08,800
Sun emits no feeling at all and you can

629
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:10,780
actually recreate that so you can be in

630
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:12,879
the place anytime you want

631
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:16,149
it's all in your head and you've got the

632
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:19,150
ability to do it because you've got the

633
00:27:16,150 --> 00:27:22,030
ability to relieve a horrid moment

634
00:27:19,150 --> 00:27:24,309
you've had in the past why wouldn't you

635
00:27:22,030 --> 00:27:27,090
use the same ability the relief a good

636
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:31,090
woman that you've had in your life

637
00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:32,949
because the brain watch how with watch

638
00:27:31,090 --> 00:27:33,550
is out for the negative because it's not

639
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:35,740
alert

640
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:37,210
you know alert alert Danger Danger so

641
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:39,970
for negative things the brain is not

642
00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:41,620
velcro and for positive things is like

643
00:27:39,970 --> 00:27:43,870
Teflon we tend to forget it

644
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:46,510
oh forget forget program so those are

645
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:48,699
things that we can do to mine one time

646
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:50,770
is an issue we're talking about work and

647
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:53,290
when time is an issue we'll let's look

648
00:27:50,770 --> 00:27:56,590
at what we can do in terms of organizing

649
00:27:53,290 --> 00:28:00,520
our our our word you know sometimes I

650
00:27:56,590 --> 00:28:03,129
find myself doing the the millions of

651
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:05,980
emails why are you doing that

652
00:28:03,130 --> 00:28:07,230
is it gonna bring you something no

653
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:10,630
really

654
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:12,700
am i dealing with things that need to be

655
00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:14,320
done and they are not urgent but they

656
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:16,780
need to be done because if I don't do

657
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:18,909
them you know I'm gonna be stressed out

658
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:21,010
if I leave you finally Fabio and I'm not

659
00:28:18,910 --> 00:28:22,480
planning a bail let's say until the last

660
00:28:21,010 --> 00:28:24,040
minute and I get the reminder then I'm

661
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:25,780
gonna be stress not about pain that they

662
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:28,090
write they finally to arrange whatever

663
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:30,340
for work and I don't do the presentation

664
00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:32,320
and then last minute I need to put the

665
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:36,370
presentation together I'm very stressed

666
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:38,860
out so one time is one time is it's an

667
00:28:36,370 --> 00:28:40,840
issue that it structures it what we

668
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:44,469
don't want to do we complete those ones

669
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:46,959
aside and we can prioritize and we the

670
00:28:44,470 --> 00:28:49,540
the notion of what we think is urgent

671
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:53,740
and important sometimes everything are

672
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:57,309
not important sometimes making dinner

673
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:59,860
for the children is not not important or

674
00:28:57,309 --> 00:29:01,270
that then you can't fix something you

675
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:05,290
don't need to prepare a three-course

676
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:06,820
meal - and sometimes sending an email to

677
00:29:05,290 --> 00:29:08,920
someone that you might of crossing the

678
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:11,020
corridor at work and say okay I have

679
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:13,510
seen your email but haven't got the one

680
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:14,470
with now to do it I will reply the

681
00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:15,910
backup you had always should've

682
00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:18,220
should've should've done it using the

683
00:29:15,910 --> 00:29:21,250
shoes from the masked man I have to sew

684
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:25,150
when time does what we can do and when

685
00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:27,120
we need to prioritize rest of the paper

686
00:29:25,150 --> 00:29:28,809
is ask yourselves what outcome you want

687
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:31,479
what do I want

688
00:29:28,809 --> 00:29:35,470
what when does he need to be done and

689
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:38,170
some people have some people have white

690
00:29:35,470 --> 00:29:40,179
boards with planners with wit planners

691
00:29:38,170 --> 00:29:41,890
and they say right that needs to be done

692
00:29:40,179 --> 00:29:45,030
that needs to be done what resources do

693
00:29:41,890 --> 00:29:47,350
I need who needs to be involved in here

694
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:49,629
what what else do I need

695
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:52,449
and then you just is a really really

696
00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:55,540
quick step one your brain knows what to

697
00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:57,580
do step one two three four five as many

698
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:59,320
steps as you need and then just go

699
00:29:57,580 --> 00:30:01,149
through your list when you get it out of

700
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:03,850
your brain and you put it in paper is

701
00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:05,770
when you you suddenly come visualize

702
00:30:03,850 --> 00:30:08,649
what needs to be done it's not making

703
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:10,929
that washing machine just painting noise

704
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:13,690
in the back of your head and you can

705
00:30:10,929 --> 00:30:18,210
actually take action in a in a manner

706
00:30:13,690 --> 00:30:22,940
that is not stressing you know

707
00:30:18,210 --> 00:30:27,840
stress leads to anxiety and depression I

708
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:29,970
tell you why when our amygdala when the

709
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:32,459
fight or flight response is constantly

710
00:30:29,970 --> 00:30:34,440
on we're stressed all the time I wanna

711
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:36,090
make my eyes constantly going the limbic

712
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:38,309
system if you can think of your brain as

713
00:30:36,090 --> 00:30:40,769
a fish unlesss are usually presented

714
00:30:38,309 --> 00:30:43,889
this is your limbic system this is your

715
00:30:40,769 --> 00:30:46,590
amygdala the adrenaline gland sits back

716
00:30:43,889 --> 00:30:49,019
here and this is your prefrontal cortex

717
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:51,689
this what makes you Russian what makes

718
00:30:49,019 --> 00:30:55,769
you relate to people in a normal manner

719
00:30:51,690 --> 00:31:00,330
and it is it regulates your emotions

720
00:30:55,769 --> 00:31:04,259
now when you are in a constant similar

721
00:31:00,330 --> 00:31:07,678
in state of stress that is like a lid

722
00:31:04,259 --> 00:31:10,139
frames up it's not proper flipped up but

723
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:12,450
that flips up a new artist working in

724
00:31:10,139 --> 00:31:14,008
reptilian brain now when the amygdalae

725
00:31:12,450 --> 00:31:15,720
sandwich hunt all the time was going

726
00:31:14,009 --> 00:31:18,059
almost coming almost almost almost it's

727
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:19,740
like a mere cut or like a prairie dog

728
00:31:18,059 --> 00:31:20,789
and it's just going that what's going on

729
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:24,869
what's going on what's going on is like

730
00:31:20,789 --> 00:31:27,990
Shh there's nothing going on but that is

731
00:31:24,869 --> 00:31:31,769
so unsanitary waste are catastrophizing

732
00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:39,499
honest how you pee is it's not feeling

733
00:31:31,769 --> 00:31:39,499
of sensation of danger unfair an extreme

734
00:31:39,799 --> 00:31:45,240
extreme fear I would say but it's not

735
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:47,759
actual danger but your brain is telling

736
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:49,730
you can't throws country what's going on

737
00:31:47,759 --> 00:31:53,519
what's going on what's going on sure

738
00:31:49,730 --> 00:31:58,139
it's got different flavors and people

739
00:31:53,519 --> 00:32:01,830
would have different ways to express an

740
00:31:58,139 --> 00:32:03,869
anxiety let's say social anxiety I was

741
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:06,049
knocked in the house who liked the whole

742
00:32:03,869 --> 00:32:08,999
hollow and I could not even go out and

743
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:10,350
buy milk because I had to go out of the

744
00:32:08,999 --> 00:32:12,389
house and talk to the person in the

745
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:14,969
petrol station that was going to say to

746
00:32:12,389 --> 00:32:18,449

764
00:32:47,370 --> 00:32:50,280
I'm just going like all you know school

765
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:54,090
days and I've got luck and I've got this

766
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:55,678
and luck phobias panic attack or cities

767
00:32:54,090 --> 00:33:00,240
and their lessons I think just in

768
00:32:55,679 --> 00:33:03,210
general um how does it represent Hey

769
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:05,820
look look at my poor little one ah nah

770
00:33:03,210 --> 00:33:09,990
it's all that goes on when we're anxious

771
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:11,970
all of it goes on absolutely every

772
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:16,799
single thing because you could be

773
00:33:11,970 --> 00:33:19,320
response in a way that triggers all the

774
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:22,520
adrenaline and cortisol going through so

775
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:25,230
you'll have sweat in your sweetie and

776
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:27,150
your legs become jelly you might need to

777
00:33:25,230 --> 00:33:29,669
go to a toilet and suddenly it's like a

778
00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:31,470
toilet you get it with children you

779
00:33:29,669 --> 00:33:33,090
won't feel so sick your stomach is going

780
00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:36,150
you don't know your breathing is like

781
00:33:33,090 --> 00:33:37,500
hey I'm having a heart attack I'm dying

782
00:33:36,150 --> 00:33:38,640
that's what I thought when I first no I

783
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:40,860
think it's in sorry I'm having a heart

784
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:45,679
attack I'm dying someone is gonna pick

785
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:50,100
me up place and take me somewhere so

786
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:51,960
what do you fill your anxiety I put in

787
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:54,570
there a fight flight freeze and faint

788
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:56,280
because the amygdala will get the

789
00:33:54,570 --> 00:33:58,379
sentence but you probably have heard

790
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:59,399
fight and flight response right when you

791
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:04,260
need to jump out of a dangerous

792
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:06,450
situation but when you feel it it will

793
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:08,730
be in your body so I can tell you for

794
00:34:06,450 --> 00:34:12,030
example that I feel my anxiety when my

795
00:34:08,730 --> 00:34:15,060
heart starts going but I feel my fist so

796
00:34:12,030 --> 00:34:16,679
I'm a fighter I would go and fight that

797
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:18,739
dinosaur my husband would say that I am

798
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:21,510
a donkey show their life fight windmills

799
00:34:18,739 --> 00:34:23,489
non-stop and I would for every single

800
00:34:21,510 --> 00:34:27,179
scene so I feel my fist

801
00:34:23,489 --> 00:34:29,779
some people just feel it in the legs and

802
00:34:27,179 --> 00:34:32,369
the legs start going oh they need to

803
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:34,710
defend me to run somewhere and some

804
00:34:32,369 --> 00:34:35,970
people disturb breathing so soon so much

805
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:37,770
that they finished in the feel like

806
00:34:35,969 --> 00:34:40,939
gonna faint and some people just freeze

807
00:34:37,770 --> 00:34:42,829
so we're with a little girl last year

808
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:44,720
you could just literally pick it up so

809
00:34:42,829 --> 00:34:46,849
so picture from there gradually taken

810
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:48,348
off so we just be like huh for one place

811
00:34:46,849 --> 00:34:50,599
and another and just take huh

812
00:34:48,349 --> 00:34:53,510
okay she was just like a little listen

813
00:34:50,599 --> 00:34:55,579
she was so petrified to share with their

814
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:58,220
works you can serve it in this port so

815
00:34:55,579 --> 00:35:02,390
some people do that well what do you see

816
00:34:58,220 --> 00:35:04,098
it now you feel in your body and I don't

817
00:35:02,390 --> 00:35:06,828
know whether you've asked yourself such

818
00:35:04,099 --> 00:35:10,609
a question if you have ever suffered

819
00:35:06,829 --> 00:35:12,410
from anxiety or stress but figuring out

820
00:35:10,609 --> 00:35:15,288
where you feel it in your body will hold

821
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:17,750
here to be able to identify what is

822
00:35:15,289 --> 00:35:20,450
going on with you and their challenge

823
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:23,690
those thoughts that make you feel the

824
00:35:20,450 --> 00:35:27,020
way you feel so this is the the

825
00:35:23,690 --> 00:35:29,029
stability Crossman and

826
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:30,980
intimately they say that you've got a

827
00:35:29,029 --> 00:35:32,990
thought a little triggers the emotion

828
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:35,240
and then the behavior we put marriages

829
00:35:32,990 --> 00:35:36,649
we put safety behaviors in place like I

830
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:38,868
said you know I'm not going to a petrol

831
00:35:36,650 --> 00:35:40,970
station we're gonna get the bus so for a

832
00:35:38,869 --> 00:35:42,410
while my journey into work was an hour

833
00:35:40,970 --> 00:35:44,058
and a half when you could have been 45

834
00:35:42,410 --> 00:35:46,700
minutes Chris I wouldn't go on a red bus

835
00:35:44,059 --> 00:35:48,589
because red bus says I had a panic

836
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:50,240
attack on a red bus so I were called

837
00:35:48,589 --> 00:35:52,700
away on the train to Waterloo and then

838
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:54,828
come out of Waterloo and guess what what

839
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:57,919
colors are the causes in London red

840
00:35:54,829 --> 00:36:00,230
there is no other color so I come out of

841
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:08,630
Waterloo and I'm just walking and I see

842
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:10,640
a man because he's alright was because I

843
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:12,950
had a panic attack and I was petrified

844
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:14,569
of a red bus so then I decided to walk

845
00:36:12,950 --> 00:36:16,848
over the bridge into whole wall where

846
00:36:14,569 --> 00:36:18,920
the office was and back I'm just picking

847
00:36:16,849 --> 00:36:21,770
the pages so we put safety behaviors in

848
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:23,930
place you see um so if we were able to

849
00:36:21,770 --> 00:36:25,190
identify the physical sensation then we

850
00:36:23,930 --> 00:36:26,569
might be able to challenge our thoughts

851
00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:28,910
and unsee

852
00:36:26,569 --> 00:36:31,279
so when we talk about challenging our

853
00:36:28,910 --> 00:36:33,680
thoughts with this kind of mental

854
00:36:31,279 --> 00:36:35,390
distortions that we all have right

855
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:37,609
someone has looked at me across the road

856
00:36:35,390 --> 00:36:40,220
and all my gold is because they they

857
00:36:37,609 --> 00:36:41,990
they hate me because I don't I don't I

858
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:43,220
make a pass through Feist and if the

859
00:36:41,990 --> 00:36:44,959
worst is gonna happen and it's gonna

860
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:47,930
cross the road that person is gonna come

861
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:50,240
tell me that I'm so scared I was just so

862
00:36:47,930 --> 00:36:52,410
frightened I'm walking into a cinema

863
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:54,779
social situation

864
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:55,859
in a room like in here for example a few

865
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:59,640
years ago I wouldn't have been able to

866
00:36:55,860 --> 00:37:00,900
walk him and I just go oh my goodness so

867
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:03,390
many people have in your company that

868
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:05,160

871
00:37:07,650 --> 00:37:11,760

873
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:14,150
the bad thing is gonna happen it's gonna

874
00:37:13,410 --> 00:37:16,230
happen to us

875
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:19,500
that's what we say it's gonna happen to

876
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:22,440
me it's not gonna be a tiny but thing is

877
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:24,510
gonna be a huge thing it's just gonna be

878
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:27,570
just horrendous now I'm not even gonna

879
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:29,670
be able to hope I'm gonna die someone is

880
00:37:27,570 --> 00:37:29,910
I'm just gonna cry I'm gonna have to run

881
00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:33,330
away

882
00:37:29,910 --> 00:37:34,710
they filter hricko filters we filter is

883
00:37:33,330 --> 00:37:37,020
black and white is either I get it

884
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:37,530
perfect or I am I'm a loser I'm a

885
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:40,320
failure

886
00:37:37,530 --> 00:37:42,990
there is no grain between we filter the

887
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:43,770
positives how many times you have a

888
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:45,629
lovely day

889
00:37:43,770 --> 00:37:47,009
and sometimes you know there is

890
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:48,780
something that happens and someone grows

891
00:37:47,010 --> 00:37:50,640
it so how would you like oh my god it

892
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:52,560
was so rubbish you know I was in the

893
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:53,940
office and this person came over lunch

894
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:55,320
and she said that she won't be blah blah

895
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:56,610
blah done and I couldn't get it done

896
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:58,680
because I was having lunch when they she

897
00:37:56,610 --> 00:38:01,470
said you do

898
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:03,029
chatter chatter chatter chatter but you

899
00:38:01,470 --> 00:38:05,310
had to get meeting with your boss you

900
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:08,070
had a good journey on the trail how to

901
00:38:05,310 --> 00:38:09,540
get your husband you had a good time out

902
00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:12,300
with your friends you went to the cinema

903
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:15,110
on enjoy we filter all the out and we

904
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:18,990
just say no negative oh but you're not

905
00:38:15,110 --> 00:38:22,590
generalizing you know everything happens

906
00:38:18,990 --> 00:38:25,109
to me is the worst and everything but in

907
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:27,210
the world it happens to me right

908
00:38:25,110 --> 00:38:30,300
an emotional reasoning is when we find

909
00:38:27,210 --> 00:38:33,210
the way we find the way to say no but no

910
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:37,020
but so I often say that I work with

911
00:38:33,210 --> 00:38:39,120
related a while back now and her husband

912
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:42,150
would come back home late from from work

913
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:43,740
I mean her mind out her husband was you

914
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:45,600
know he was unhappy he was having an

915
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:47,609
affair he was gonna leave her leave her

916
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:49,710
and the children and what am I gonna do

917
00:38:47,610 --> 00:38:52,220
and this is horrendous and they cease

918
00:38:49,710 --> 00:38:54,990
and you go what else can it be

919
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:56,910
have you spoken what else can it be

920
00:38:54,990 --> 00:38:59,490
but we lose that mental flexibility of

921
00:38:56,910 --> 00:39:00,990
bordelles can it be right or it could be

922
00:38:59,490 --> 00:39:03,209
the poor man was the stress out of his

923
00:39:00,990 --> 00:39:04,089
brain he was going London hours in your

924
00:39:03,210 --> 00:39:06,490
face and he

925
00:39:04,090 --> 00:39:08,170
comes back home late and he's tired so

926
00:39:06,490 --> 00:39:10,839
he doesn't want to talk and he doesn't

927
00:39:08,170 --> 00:39:14,500
want to eat because he instantly he's

928
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:16,480
too tired but we just find the way and

929
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:18,790
she we just say no no no putting 101

930
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:21,130
together on 101 is like he's doing this

931
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:23,560
because of and every time she will come

932
00:39:21,130 --> 00:39:24,880
she will have a list of behaviors that

933
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:31,630
she had picked on him

934
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:35,500
that would actually confirm her hair her

935
00:39:31,630 --> 00:39:36,970
dance on her husband for example Oh what

936
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:40,060
can we do right

937
00:39:36,970 --> 00:39:42,009
um in a day you know one night we've got

938
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:44,170
we've got we're going to happen hobbies

939
00:39:42,010 --> 00:39:47,230
the center when we're feeling calm and

940
00:39:44,170 --> 00:39:49,930
relaxed of peace and if you think it's a

941
00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:51,700
bit the bicycle wheel if every single

942
00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:54,339
one of this Punk's is what happens

943
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:56,379
during the day right what you've got

944
00:39:54,340 --> 00:40:00,160
during the day going on in your day all

945
00:39:56,380 --> 00:40:03,670
the ring of the of the wheel now when we

946
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:07,509
feel anxious okay which is focus and

947
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:09,640
that on the anxiety and how much time

948
00:40:07,510 --> 00:40:12,580
there is pain or do we spend focusing on

949
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:15,310
what is making us anxious I tell you for

950
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:17,590
me 90% of the time it would be

951
00:40:15,310 --> 00:40:20,740
constantly in the back of my head does

952
00:40:17,590 --> 00:40:24,010
it make sense now the other things going

953
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:26,290
on we don't pay attention to them one

954
00:40:24,010 --> 00:40:28,470
thing I want you to do is it's a little

955
00:40:26,290 --> 00:40:31,120
bit of an exercise and we might might

956
00:40:28,470 --> 00:40:32,919
wake some people up from talking

957
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:34,839
toughness Network falling sleep is a

958
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:37,750
dark room anyway if you get your finger

959
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:37,930
on your index finger out go on don't be

960
00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:39,490
shy

961
00:40:37,930 --> 00:40:42,190
I'm not gonna bite the finger of a

962
00:40:39,490 --> 00:40:43,689
promise get the finger out just put it

963
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:46,930
straight ahead of you

964
00:40:43,690 --> 00:40:51,220
and then keep bringing it slowly slowly

965
00:40:46,930 --> 00:40:53,319
slowly slowly as close as you can as

966
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:56,140
close as you can to your notes on at one

967
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:58,120
point you're gonna feel and if you hold

968
00:40:56,140 --> 00:41:02,080
it there and you keep looking at it

969
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:04,540
intensively okay you're gonna feel that

970
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:07,660
your eyes is not hurting you're

971
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:09,759
squinting is not comfortable you lose

972
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:11,290
your peripheral vision when you think

973
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:12,180
that it's not here you can focus on that

974
00:41:11,290 --> 00:41:15,000
finger you can

975
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:18,270
still see what is going on around you

976
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:19,530
it's called peripheral vision when you

977
00:41:18,270 --> 00:41:21,599
think that is here

978
00:41:19,530 --> 00:41:23,880
you've lost your peripheral vision is

979
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:25,920
called for your vision now what we

980
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:29,369
needed in the day just focus on that

981
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:30,990
unsightly what are we doing which is and

982
00:41:29,369 --> 00:41:32,730
what is it doing when we when we are

983
00:41:30,990 --> 00:41:36,598
looking at it for a long period of time

984
00:41:32,730 --> 00:41:39,750
it hurts your eyes will hurt eventually

985
00:41:36,599 --> 00:41:42,780
is not comfortable anymore with anxiety

986
00:41:39,750 --> 00:41:46,050
this is what we do we just focus on that

987
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:48,630
particular point instead of just putting

988
00:41:46,050 --> 00:41:52,530
it aside and saying right I've got other

989
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:55,559
things going on right so when you feel

990
00:41:52,530 --> 00:41:57,839
yourself anxious I often say to people

991
00:41:55,559 --> 00:41:59,970
the way they you stop yourself right

992
00:41:57,839 --> 00:42:02,460
afoot concern when you stop yourself I

993
00:41:59,970 --> 00:42:04,890
used to wear elastic band around my

994
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:07,020
wrist and whenever I used to feel

995
00:42:04,890 --> 00:42:08,460
anxious I used to snap it because that

996
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:11,579
would get me out of it and realize that

997
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:14,010
I am being anxious and then I would ask

998
00:42:11,579 --> 00:42:16,589
myself what is going on in here what am

999
00:42:14,010 --> 00:42:21,180
I thinking what has happened that has

1000
00:42:16,589 --> 00:42:23,490
triggered the state I am in and that way

1001
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:27,480
I can then act on it and the way to act

1002
00:42:23,490 --> 00:42:29,129
on it is it's in different different

1003
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:33,299
different techniques and different ways

1004
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:35,460
to act on it when you've got the thought

1005
00:42:33,299 --> 00:42:39,690
that is not a healthy thought is called

1006
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:42,150
the three C's for CVT you catch the

1007
00:42:39,690 --> 00:42:45,119
thought which is the hardest part it's

1008
00:42:42,150 --> 00:42:47,099
like cutting going fishing it's hard you

1009
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:49,049
know you catch the thought you collect

1010
00:42:47,099 --> 00:42:52,230
the evidence you become a duplicative of

1011
00:42:49,049 --> 00:42:53,970
your swords right you need to collect

1012
00:42:52,230 --> 00:42:55,829
all the evidence before you can say well

1013
00:42:53,970 --> 00:43:00,089
this is true or not because reality is a

1014
00:42:55,829 --> 00:43:01,920
sword the sword is not a fact right I

1015
00:43:00,089 --> 00:43:05,009
think we are all ok with that

1016
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:07,980
good it's a stone now I thought crisis

1017
00:43:05,010 --> 00:43:10,650
our minds if we engage with it we can

1018
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:13,589
aspire on down now it's a thought it

1019
00:43:10,650 --> 00:43:17,569
could be true it cannot be true if we

1020
00:43:13,589 --> 00:43:20,609
let it go past our heads as if our Birds

1021
00:43:17,569 --> 00:43:23,250
just don't engage just be an observer no

1022
00:43:20,609 --> 00:43:25,370
facade yes I had a thought but you don't

1023
00:43:23,250 --> 00:43:28,850
engage with it it's a different matter

1024
00:43:25,370 --> 00:43:30,200
if you choose to engage with it you cut

1025
00:43:28,850 --> 00:43:33,950
safe and then you collect the evidence

1026
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:37,480
and you ask yourself what evidence doing

1027
00:43:33,950 --> 00:43:40,210
half of this thought through and against

1028
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:46,400
what else can it be

1029
00:43:40,210 --> 00:43:48,170
what else can I say that I can look at

1030
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:49,730
it could I look at it from a different

1031
00:43:48,170 --> 00:43:50,360
perspective could I look at it from a

1032
00:43:49,730 --> 00:43:52,280
different angle

1033
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:54,140
this of a look if I've been owned about

1034
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:55,370
several times before and nothing has

1035
00:43:54,140 --> 00:43:58,910
happened I've not heart the heart that I

1036
00:43:55,370 --> 00:43:59,450
can have not died right oh why would I

1037
00:43:58,910 --> 00:44:01,790
know

1038
00:43:59,450 --> 00:44:03,169
okay what is it different in this

1039
00:44:01,790 --> 00:44:10,850
situation that it was in the previous

1040
00:44:03,170 --> 00:44:13,160
situation okay yes yeah so you see that

1041
00:44:10,850 --> 00:44:14,990
listen when I when I put the roof on

1042
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:17,000
before so in sympathy they say any

1043
00:44:14,990 --> 00:44:18,799
challenge your thoughts become a

1044
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:20,900
detective of your thoughts however

1045
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:24,530
remember I was telling you before that

1046
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:27,110
you act so fast that you don't have the

1047
00:44:24,530 --> 00:44:28,970
time to challenge your thought that's

1048
00:44:27,110 --> 00:44:30,980
why I said pay attention first of all to

1049
00:44:28,970 --> 00:44:34,160
your physical symptoms because then you

1050
00:44:30,980 --> 00:44:36,380
know that you are having a thought that

1051
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:38,690
is not healthy because your body is

1052
00:44:36,380 --> 00:44:42,290
telling you if you do that body mind

1053
00:44:38,690 --> 00:44:44,510
body connection right and then you can

1054
00:44:42,290 --> 00:44:45,560
you can challenge the thought and when

1055
00:44:44,510 --> 00:44:47,450
you can tell you something you say well

1056
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:49,520
what other way is a more realistic way

1057
00:44:47,450 --> 00:44:51,439
of looking at it well what a friend of

1058
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:53,390
mine say what if that what a simple

1059
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:55,670
friend that has to NATO base in Ghana is

1060
00:44:53,390 --> 00:44:58,250
happening over on us you say to me I

1061
00:44:55,670 --> 00:44:59,930
what would he say to me what is a more

1062
00:44:58,250 --> 00:45:03,800
reasonable way of looking at this

1063
00:44:59,930 --> 00:45:06,410
situation so you talented another way

1064
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:09,980
that I do it and I often say when I when

1065
00:45:06,410 --> 00:45:11,990
I run this this particular technique

1066
00:45:09,980 --> 00:45:13,730
with others not telling do it so much

1067
00:45:11,990 --> 00:45:15,859
better than we do because we others have

1068
00:45:13,730 --> 00:45:16,720
lost all imagination whatsoever and I

1069
00:45:15,860 --> 00:45:19,580
said

1070
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:20,359
unsightly you're not born anxious you're

1071
00:45:19,580 --> 00:45:22,250
not coming out

1072
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:23,630
I'm you're anxious already the same way

1073
00:45:22,250 --> 00:45:24,830
you're not gonna smoke on you know you

1074
00:45:23,630 --> 00:45:27,950
don't come out with a cigarette in your

1075
00:45:24,830 --> 00:45:30,020
hands right no so we learn if it's a nun

1076
00:45:27,950 --> 00:45:32,689
behavior we can unlearning

1077
00:45:30,020 --> 00:45:35,360
with one your own brain to be to be

1078
00:45:32,690 --> 00:45:36,079
anxious week on my of the brain we can

1079
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:38,719
break those

1080
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:43,430
connections so if you start thinking of

1081
00:45:38,719 --> 00:45:44,959
your anxiety as it is my warrior helping

1082
00:45:43,430 --> 00:45:47,499
me be safe

1083
00:45:44,959 --> 00:45:50,479
however is like a faulty car along

1084
00:45:47,499 --> 00:45:51,680
sometimes they set off and it needs to

1085
00:45:50,479 --> 00:45:53,029
be rewired

1086
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:55,098
and sometimes it's telling me don't make

1087
00:45:53,029 --> 00:45:56,989
me think of the reason I'm used to

1088
00:45:55,099 --> 00:45:58,219
personalizing it and often I say you

1089
00:45:56,989 --> 00:46:00,289
know you can put it in the palm of your

1090
00:45:58,219 --> 00:46:02,329
hands and say this is my anxiety talking

1091
00:46:00,289 --> 00:46:05,029
to me right you start feeling anxious

1092
00:46:02,329 --> 00:46:07,299
actually did it in a supermarket my

1093
00:46:05,029 --> 00:46:09,979
husband doesn't know this but know him

1094
00:46:07,299 --> 00:46:11,660
in the supermarket and I I feel very

1095
00:46:09,979 --> 00:46:12,799
very very anxious and I was pushing the

1096
00:46:11,660 --> 00:46:15,109
shopping trolley and I was going to the

1097
00:46:12,799 --> 00:46:16,279
cashier and I was so panicking my legs

1098
00:46:15,109 --> 00:46:17,509
were going thank goodness a hot that

1099
00:46:16,279 --> 00:46:19,279
trolley because I was holding on to it

1100
00:46:17,509 --> 00:46:20,420
so the life of me thinking I'm gonna

1101
00:46:19,279 --> 00:46:23,089
faint in here and everyone is gonna

1102
00:46:20,420 --> 00:46:25,339
notice he's gonna be terrible and I got

1103
00:46:23,089 --> 00:46:26,690
to get to the cashier just to the table

1104
00:46:25,339 --> 00:46:27,799
to pay and they started packing but my

1105
00:46:26,690 --> 00:46:29,150
hands were steaming really that I

1106
00:46:27,799 --> 00:46:30,890
couldn't really get the things out come

1107
00:46:29,150 --> 00:46:34,190
on you know X I gotta fall and then

1108
00:46:30,890 --> 00:46:36,979
everything is gonna fall and I like foot

1109
00:46:34,190 --> 00:46:38,569
right enough and I put it in the palm of

1110
00:46:36,979 --> 00:46:41,058
my hand give it a nice tight bikinis

1111
00:46:38,569 --> 00:46:45,369
give it a shape give it the color give

1112
00:46:41,059 --> 00:46:47,420
it the name what he said I'm happy

1113
00:46:45,369 --> 00:46:51,289
whatever they hold on the water nowadays

1114
00:46:47,420 --> 00:46:53,119
I mean really really close and it's got

1115
00:46:51,289 --> 00:46:55,670
these rooms in here that's right

1116
00:46:53,119 --> 00:46:57,440
but you can talk to it you can actually

1117
00:46:55,670 --> 00:46:59,269
talk to you inside and say I know you're

1118
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:03,469
trying to protect me I know you think

1119
00:46:59,269 --> 00:47:06,049
this is something but but it isn't I'm

1120
00:47:03,469 --> 00:47:08,299
in the supermarket needless to say

1121
00:47:06,049 --> 00:47:10,309
people started looking at me thinking

1122
00:47:08,299 --> 00:47:11,690
it used to be looked up and I was just

1123
00:47:10,309 --> 00:47:13,609
going right what what he said it was

1124
00:47:11,690 --> 00:47:14,900
like to be or not to be to be or not to

1125
00:47:13,609 --> 00:47:17,390
be and I was just looking like what you

1126
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:18,619
want no no I'm fine I'm fine this is the

1127
00:47:17,390 --> 00:47:21,140
supermarket things no problem

1128
00:47:18,619 --> 00:47:23,329
yeah you don't in any way you want to do

1129
00:47:21,140 --> 00:47:24,949
but what we're trying to do in here is

1130
00:47:23,329 --> 00:47:27,650
to disassociate yourself from your

1131
00:47:24,949 --> 00:47:30,049
anxiety you are not your anxiety and say

1132
00:47:27,650 --> 00:47:32,509
it is something you do when you don't do

1133
00:47:30,049 --> 00:47:33,799
it all the time you do it sometimes so

1134
00:47:32,509 --> 00:47:36,199
if we can start thinking about anxiety

1135
00:47:33,799 --> 00:47:38,209
as something we do then we gonna stay

1136
00:47:36,199 --> 00:47:41,569
sane right I can do it I cannot do it

1137
00:47:38,209 --> 00:47:45,109
I've got a choice it's not me when I

1138
00:47:41,569 --> 00:47:47,099
first went very very very safe I went to

1139
00:47:45,109 --> 00:47:49,680
a psychiatrist and she

1140
00:47:47,099 --> 00:47:50,970
he said to me get used to it this is

1141
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:52,529
what it is this is what it gonna be for

1142
00:47:50,970 --> 00:47:54,238
the rest of your life depression anxiety

1143
00:47:52,529 --> 00:47:55,890
that's a part of Prozac

1144
00:47:54,239 --> 00:47:59,099
off you go when you run out what do you

1145
00:47:55,890 --> 00:48:02,400
GP any okay mayor Parker um that was the

1146
00:47:59,099 --> 00:48:07,019
end of it and I saw mm I was okay before

1147
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:08,009
I was fine for what is among a number of

1148
00:48:07,019 --> 00:48:09,359
years right

1149
00:48:08,009 --> 00:48:10,619
I know if there's something I'm not fine

1150
00:48:09,359 --> 00:48:14,578
and you're telling me that this is gonna

1151
00:48:10,619 --> 00:48:15,960
be it well no I'm not faced this has

1152
00:48:14,579 --> 00:48:21,269
hurt man I it has happened for a reason

1153
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:25,079
I don't know what it is this number five

1154
00:48:21,269 --> 00:48:29,249
is something that we have done is

1155
00:48:25,079 --> 00:48:30,839
something that is very very good to do

1156
00:48:29,249 --> 00:48:32,999
because when new and answers you think

1157
00:48:30,839 --> 00:48:35,130
about your anxiety all the time a few

1158
00:48:32,999 --> 00:48:37,109
hitmen if you city is some 15 minutes

1159
00:48:35,130 --> 00:48:38,849
every day 15 minutes every day whatever

1160
00:48:37,109 --> 00:48:40,259
the rural place so I used to live in my

1161
00:48:38,849 --> 00:48:43,229
bedroom I stay in the bedroom I'm just

1162
00:48:40,259 --> 00:48:45,180
going the bedroom I was a bullet champ

1163
00:48:43,229 --> 00:48:46,999
sit down in the bedroom and just go

1164
00:48:45,180 --> 00:48:49,788
right okay timeout 15 minutes oh

1165
00:48:46,999 --> 00:48:55,439
goodness

1166
00:48:49,789 --> 00:48:58,469
it was it was so hot baby no more when I

1167
00:48:55,440 --> 00:49:01,109
anxious thought comes and you worry time

1168
00:48:58,469 --> 00:49:02,729
is finished your money a box in your

1169
00:49:01,109 --> 00:49:04,410
head or backpack are used to merging I

1170
00:49:02,729 --> 00:49:07,169
had a backpack and you tuck it in

1171
00:49:04,410 --> 00:49:10,078
don't worry time and all the time you

1172
00:49:07,170 --> 00:49:12,960
break those connections because the more

1173
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:14,940
you think about your entire thing it's

1174
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:16,950
like a tomato plant you're watering it

1175
00:49:14,940 --> 00:49:17,309
you're tending to it you're picking the

1176
00:49:16,950 --> 00:49:19,799
box

1177
00:49:17,309 --> 00:49:21,539
we're even have beautiful beautiful big

1178
00:49:19,799 --> 00:49:23,549
Tomatoes do you want a big tomato no

1179
00:49:21,539 --> 00:49:26,819
thank you very much I don't want it you

1180
00:49:23,549 --> 00:49:28,819
say so if you if you give you some 15

1181
00:49:26,819 --> 00:49:31,140
minutes I need to say this is what it is

1182
00:49:28,819 --> 00:49:32,609
you start breaking up those connections

1183
00:49:31,140 --> 00:49:34,529
and guess what happened one day a friend

1184
00:49:32,609 --> 00:49:35,700
of mine said let's go to the cinema

1185
00:49:34,529 --> 00:49:37,559
I heard them into the cinema for

1186
00:49:35,700 --> 00:49:39,779
donkey's years I was so scared of pain

1187
00:49:37,559 --> 00:49:41,309
and in a closed place with people I

1188
00:49:39,779 --> 00:49:43,680
didn't know you know what I couldn't do

1189
00:49:41,309 --> 00:49:45,499
is something hop in a panic attack and I

1190
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:47,848
went and I said okay I'm gonna be a

1191
00:49:45,499 --> 00:49:49,979
phenomenal and I went to the cinema I

1192
00:49:47,849 --> 00:49:53,190
came back home and it was too late leave

1193
00:49:49,979 --> 00:49:56,700
me and I went or eaten gone decided

1194
00:49:53,190 --> 00:49:59,369
tango I couldn't get that day and over

1195
00:49:56,700 --> 00:50:00,839
time I did something else I was so

1196
00:49:59,369 --> 00:50:02,670
excited I went to the cinema

1197
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:05,310
I went for the drink I went for a coffee

1198
00:50:02,670 --> 00:50:08,250
and then I didn't need more time anymore

1199
00:50:05,310 --> 00:50:11,390
because I was able to control my

1200
00:50:08,250 --> 00:50:14,460
thoughts I'm telling him

1201
00:50:11,390 --> 00:50:15,950
grounding is when you are in a state in

1202
00:50:14,460 --> 00:50:18,540
which you're doing a presentation like

1203
00:50:15,950 --> 00:50:21,509
me you know here five o'clock in the

1204
00:50:18,540 --> 00:50:24,270
morning I I wasn't in a very good state

1205
00:50:21,510 --> 00:50:26,910
of mind and it's really really really

1206
00:50:24,270 --> 00:50:29,340
quick and you just say okay three things

1207
00:50:26,910 --> 00:50:31,230
I can say three things I can hear three

1208
00:50:29,340 --> 00:50:32,910
things I can feel and then you go down

1209
00:50:31,230 --> 00:50:35,190
two things I can say two things I can

1210
00:50:32,910 --> 00:50:37,529
feel I can I can hear two things I can

1211
00:50:35,190 --> 00:50:39,330
feel anything you go down one thing I

1212
00:50:37,530 --> 00:50:40,800
mean you take a deep breath now what

1213
00:50:39,330 --> 00:50:45,240
you're doing when you're doing that when

1214
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:46,500
you're anxious the your right brain you

1215
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:49,350
don't think this is your brain so when

1216
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:51,690
you're done choose right emotions are in

1217
00:50:49,350 --> 00:50:53,460
the right side of the brain and they're

1218
00:50:51,690 --> 00:50:55,800
just running running running like wine

1219
00:50:53,460 --> 00:50:57,960
and you're spiraling down now there is

1220
00:50:55,800 --> 00:51:01,050
no integration with the left side of the

1221
00:50:57,960 --> 00:51:02,760
brain which is the language the logic

1222
00:51:01,050 --> 00:51:04,920
the lateral side of the brain in which

1223
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:08,010
you you you can make sense of things

1224
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:10,200
when you start saying three things I can

1225
00:51:08,010 --> 00:51:11,790
hear three things I can see you're

1226
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:13,589
starting getting the language the left

1227
00:51:11,790 --> 00:51:14,730
side of the brain when you engage the

1228
00:51:13,590 --> 00:51:17,340
left side of the brain that is

1229
00:51:14,730 --> 00:51:19,080
integration in the brain some people say

1230
00:51:17,340 --> 00:51:20,820
it's a distraction but in reality

1231
00:51:19,080 --> 00:51:22,319
neuroscience what there is is an

1232
00:51:20,820 --> 00:51:26,700
integration between left and right

1233
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:29,960
hemisphere of the brain no I'm going to

1234
00:51:26,700 --> 00:51:34,109
technical with it before visualizing

1235
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:37,770
depression depression is feeling blue

1236
00:51:34,110 --> 00:51:40,590
every day feeling sad every day feeling

1237
00:51:37,770 --> 00:51:45,540
worthless you don't sleep you don't need

1238
00:51:40,590 --> 00:51:47,460
I used to just you know smoke like I

1239
00:51:45,540 --> 00:51:49,770
said up and down the corridor I I

1240
00:51:47,460 --> 00:51:51,930
couldn't eat my stomach was in a state

1241
00:51:49,770 --> 00:51:53,400
I couldn't sleep either I couldn't make

1242
00:51:51,930 --> 00:51:58,100
sense of the world I couldn't make sense

1243
00:51:53,400 --> 00:52:01,530
of myself now very characteristic of

1244
00:51:58,100 --> 00:52:03,170
depression is that you lose interesting

1245
00:52:01,530 --> 00:52:07,770
things that you used to like in the past

1246
00:52:03,170 --> 00:52:10,800
you you don't want to do things and you

1247
00:52:07,770 --> 00:52:14,390
see the world in a different way now

1248
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:17,480
that is overall

1249
00:52:14,390 --> 00:52:20,779
what we feel when we are depressed there

1250
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:23,390
is no restorative sleep there is no

1251
00:52:20,780 --> 00:52:26,750
concentration we can concentrate we can

1252
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:30,230
engage the prefrontal cortex to to be

1253
00:52:26,750 --> 00:52:34,160
able to you know function in the world

1254
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:35,810
we can't function basically what happens

1255
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:40,160
in our brain happens in your brain when

1256
00:52:35,810 --> 00:52:42,140
we are very very stressed and we have

1257
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:44,240
like you know we explained before

1258
00:52:42,140 --> 00:52:47,330
adrenaline and cortisol and Wilko court

1259
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:49,879
longer eco corticoids rushing through

1260
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:53,690
now we've got really good chemicals in

1261
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:56,060
the brain nor a not a big thing I never

1262
00:52:53,690 --> 00:52:58,510
want to hear that we're right helps you

1263
00:52:56,060 --> 00:53:01,940
be alert I'm mentally alert and active

1264
00:52:58,510 --> 00:53:04,240
okay but we're depressed because I wanna

1265
00:53:01,940 --> 00:53:06,440
meet because our amygdala has been

1266
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:08,779
overworked okay

1267
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:13,130
the levels go down and when the levels

1268
00:53:08,780 --> 00:53:15,500
of norepinephrine go down it will make

1269
00:53:13,130 --> 00:53:18,710
you feel a nolo me more team will make

1270
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:20,900
you feel blue look at corticoids always

1271
00:53:18,710 --> 00:53:22,820
look and also lower the production of

1272
00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:26,930
dopamine and dopamine is the feel the

1273
00:53:22,820 --> 00:53:28,820
feel-good chemical that we have and when

1274
00:53:26,930 --> 00:53:30,710
we enjoy something this is what I

1275
00:53:28,820 --> 00:53:33,470
encounter now with kitties that they're

1276
00:53:30,710 --> 00:53:35,570
all of gaming on that less for night why

1277
00:53:33,470 --> 00:53:38,180
because the dopamine levels go up is

1278
00:53:35,570 --> 00:53:40,610
that reward system but when we are

1279
00:53:38,180 --> 00:53:41,779
depressed that goes down so then no

1280
00:53:40,610 --> 00:53:44,900
wonder that we don't enjoy activities

1281
00:53:41,780 --> 00:53:46,970
anymore and then the stress that goes

1282
00:53:44,900 --> 00:53:48,770
with it reduces the serotonin which is

1283
00:53:46,970 --> 00:53:51,080
the if in the feel-good

1284
00:53:48,770 --> 00:53:54,350
is the failure good chemical so we

1285
00:53:51,080 --> 00:53:56,930
become really depressed and then we

1286
00:53:54,350 --> 00:54:00,140
start developing certain core beliefs of

1287
00:53:56,930 --> 00:54:02,930
helplessness of worthlessness and enough

1288
00:54:00,140 --> 00:54:05,210
ability and we turn it on waste and one

1289
00:54:02,930 --> 00:54:11,960
loser I'm a failure I can't get anything

1290
00:54:05,210 --> 00:54:15,230
right you know me I don't fit in so we

1291
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:19,910
start seeing the world ourselves on the

1292
00:54:15,230 --> 00:54:22,610
future in a negative way so it just goes

1293
00:54:19,910 --> 00:54:25,580
thrown in circles and it goes run in

1294
00:54:22,610 --> 00:54:27,800
circles so Buddhist is not really we

1295
00:54:25,580 --> 00:54:31,310
create our own environment and what he

1296
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:33,080
refers to what he means is now when

1297
00:54:31,310 --> 00:54:34,640
we're depressed we don't get to see the

1298
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:37,250
positives in life we don't get to see

1299
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:40,129
the good things in life we just focus on

1300
00:54:37,250 --> 00:54:42,260
the negativity about ourselves the world

1301
00:54:40,130 --> 00:54:43,490
on the future so people come and say oh

1302
00:54:42,260 --> 00:54:45,440
but you know you got something to look

1303
00:54:43,490 --> 00:54:46,910
forward to no I don't because I am not

1304
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:49,490
feeling I'm enjoying anything in life

1305
00:54:46,910 --> 00:54:52,100
lately and I'm not happy with anything

1306
00:54:49,490 --> 00:54:54,109
and I feel bad with myself people don't

1307
00:54:52,100 --> 00:54:59,390
love me people don't like me it's not

1308
00:54:54,110 --> 00:55:02,270
the case but we filter now why why we

1309
00:54:59,390 --> 00:55:04,460
feel depressed sometimes well this is

1310
00:55:02,270 --> 00:55:06,200
the current self and this is the ideal

1311
00:55:04,460 --> 00:55:10,280
self we all have a blueprint the order

1312
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:12,980
of the world that is ruled by our

1313
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:15,710
beliefs and our core essence of who we

1314
00:55:12,980 --> 00:55:18,140
all are as individual and unique human

1315
00:55:15,710 --> 00:55:22,970
beings and we've got values and we've

1316
00:55:18,140 --> 00:55:24,830
got beliefs I said and dreams as to the

1317
00:55:22,970 --> 00:55:26,689
world should be know this and this and

1318
00:55:24,830 --> 00:55:28,400
this is a blueprint we're all born with

1319
00:55:26,690 --> 00:55:29,930
it we all know that I'm gonna be like

1320
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:31,490
this I'm gonna be like that I want this

1321
00:55:29,930 --> 00:55:34,129
in my life I want that and I want the

1322
00:55:31,490 --> 00:55:37,910
other now when there is a gap between

1323
00:55:34,130 --> 00:55:41,260
the current self and the ideas of your

1324
00:55:37,910 --> 00:55:45,859
blueprint that very suffer you say and

1325
00:55:41,260 --> 00:55:49,460
we suffer because we are not paying

1326
00:55:45,860 --> 00:55:50,660
attention to who we are so that we are

1327
00:55:49,460 --> 00:55:52,760
oftentimes

1328
00:55:50,660 --> 00:55:55,580
conditioned by the society by our

1329
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:58,430
parents by pictures by what we should do

1330
00:55:55,580 --> 00:56:00,319
what we shouldn't do I'm a family man I

1331
00:55:58,430 --> 00:56:02,660
need to provide I need to do this I need

1332
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:04,640
to do that right in my case I was a

1333
00:56:02,660 --> 00:56:07,759
pharmaceutical sales rep I was always

1334
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:09,440
told on my parents work and a good

1335
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:11,900
salary do this do that to the other I

1336
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:16,130
used to work ten twelve hours a day

1337
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:19,100
very very very successful but it's not

1338
00:56:16,130 --> 00:56:21,050
me so it was not conditioning that you

1339
00:56:19,100 --> 00:56:22,580
must half a salary you must have a good

1340
00:56:21,050 --> 00:56:25,520
salary you must have - you must have

1341
00:56:22,580 --> 00:56:27,170
that and it's like an onion and it's

1342
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:29,300
Vegas and layers her layers that you

1343
00:56:27,170 --> 00:56:30,950
that you put upon yourselves ever since

1344
00:56:29,300 --> 00:56:33,770
we are little and we start picking up

1345
00:56:30,950 --> 00:56:35,689
beliefs that might not be our beliefs so

1346
00:56:33,770 --> 00:56:38,600
the bigger the gap between your current

1347
00:56:35,690 --> 00:56:42,050
situation and your radium self

1348
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:44,690
the more suffering we get right um

1349
00:56:42,050 --> 00:56:47,300
basic human needs so what can we do so

1350
00:56:44,690 --> 00:56:49,580
if we start thinking about we all have

1351
00:56:47,300 --> 00:56:53,030
certain human needs and our values and

1352
00:56:49,580 --> 00:56:55,670
our actions are developed over time

1353
00:56:53,030 --> 00:56:58,790
according to we value the most

1354
00:56:55,670 --> 00:57:00,890
so some people would probably certainty

1355
00:56:58,790 --> 00:57:02,779
meaning that I've got a routine I've got

1356
00:57:00,890 --> 00:57:05,480
a job I do this every day and this is

1357
00:57:02,780 --> 00:57:07,130
this is me I don't like this is me as

1358
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:10,040
well by the way a certainty is one of

1359
00:57:07,130 --> 00:57:11,870
mine I do not want to be doing bungee

1360
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:13,279
jumping I am NOT adventurous if I'm

1361
00:57:11,870 --> 00:57:14,960
going somewhere my husband will turn I

1362
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:16,130
need to plan the whole thing out what

1363
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:19,430
I'm gonna eat what I'm not gonna eat

1364
00:57:16,130 --> 00:57:21,350
what I'm gonna go the bus fare whatever

1365
00:57:19,430 --> 00:57:23,149
it is some people like variety that's

1366
00:57:21,350 --> 00:57:25,040
the adrenaline junkie that you might

1367
00:57:23,150 --> 00:57:27,110
find others people that change jobs

1368
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:28,009
every so often or they like being here

1369
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:30,260
and there and everywhere

1370
00:57:28,010 --> 00:57:32,210
some people like being significant being

1371
00:57:30,260 --> 00:57:33,950
value for who they are and some people

1372
00:57:32,210 --> 00:57:36,400
say well I want to be seen as who I am I

1373
00:57:33,950 --> 00:57:39,080
want I want my own authenticity to be

1374
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:42,560
acknowledged and to be accepted

1375
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:45,259
unconditionally some people very local

1376
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:48,710
connection some people value love a

1377
00:57:45,260 --> 00:57:50,960
growth or contribute contribution now

1378
00:57:48,710 --> 00:57:52,490
growth is learning is developing in

1379
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:55,640
whichever way and contribution is is

1380
00:57:52,490 --> 00:57:57,020
giving back so when I was a

1381
00:57:55,640 --> 00:57:58,430
pharmaceutical sales rep when I was

1382
00:57:57,020 --> 00:58:03,980
being told that you need to generate X

1383
00:57:58,430 --> 00:58:05,779
number of millions right oh yeah it goes

1384
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:08,210
against my values because my value here

1385
00:58:05,780 --> 00:58:11,780
is contribution I am a giver I want to

1386
00:58:08,210 --> 00:58:13,670
take her so but on the other hand I have

1387
00:58:11,780 --> 00:58:15,950
to get a good job because my mom and dad

1388
00:58:13,670 --> 00:58:17,600
you know you know in life with giving

1389
00:58:15,950 --> 00:58:20,629
you an education and get a good job get

1390
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:23,630
your money have a house have children is

1391
00:58:20,630 --> 00:58:27,230
all this conditioning that we have so

1392
00:58:23,630 --> 00:58:29,330
when you start looking at what is that

1393
00:58:27,230 --> 00:58:32,980
you value and you start aligning your

1394
00:58:29,330 --> 00:58:35,660
actions and your values and your beliefs

1395
00:58:32,980 --> 00:58:37,640
according to that is when when you start

1396
00:58:35,660 --> 00:58:41,000
feeling that you can actually make a

1397
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:42,379
change in your life so you can you know

1398
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,580
you can sister what do I want to

1399
00:58:42,380 --> 00:58:45,200
experience more in life what was

1400
00:58:43,580 --> 00:58:47,690
important for me in life or what do I

1401
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:49,399
enjoy experiencing in life for me will

1402
00:58:47,690 --> 00:58:51,380
be no fun connection and contribution I

1403
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:52,460
like even some other people way I want

1404
00:58:51,380 --> 00:58:58,220
to be significant

1405
00:58:52,460 --> 00:59:00,440
I want to be valued right in in civitate

1406
00:58:58,220 --> 00:59:03,200
we talk about concurrent depression with

1407
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:06,710
valued activities now because you've

1408
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:08,960
seen that a human needs chart over there

1409
00:59:06,710 --> 00:59:11,180
when I talk about value that activities

1410
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:13,160
you need to actually consider what you

1411
00:59:11,180 --> 00:59:14,690
value before you start looking at the

1412
00:59:13,160 --> 00:59:17,629
activities because as I said I used to

1413
00:59:14,690 --> 00:59:20,000
go clubbing Friday Saturday Sunday and I

1414
00:59:17,630 --> 00:59:21,020
used to do it and at one point I said I

1415
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,520
don't want to do it anymore

1416
00:59:21,020 --> 00:59:24,050
I didn't realize why I didn't want to do

1417
00:59:22,520 --> 00:59:27,319
it and I didn't know what was it that

1418
00:59:24,050 --> 00:59:29,300
was so for me so against it and then I

1419
00:59:27,319 --> 00:59:32,060
realize that because I want a little fun

1420
00:59:29,300 --> 00:59:34,250
connection going clubbing getting

1421
00:59:32,060 --> 00:59:35,810
actually provide me with the opportunity

1422
00:59:34,250 --> 00:59:37,760
to be connected with others because when

1423
00:59:35,810 --> 00:59:39,349
you're in a nightclub let's be honest I

1424
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:40,640
mean you can be connected so that the

1425
00:59:39,349 --> 00:59:42,650
solar as you're jumping then you can

1426
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:44,089
have a meaningful conversation you can't

1427
00:59:42,650 --> 00:59:45,980
have a coefficient I would say okay I

1428
00:59:44,089 --> 00:59:46,700
value that I would come for a coffee

1429
00:59:45,980 --> 00:59:51,530
with you

1430
00:59:46,700 --> 00:59:55,220
so small daily changes that go according

1431
00:59:51,530 --> 00:59:56,960
to your values and and that is what you

1432
00:59:55,220 --> 00:59:59,540
need to do putting it to align with what

1433
00:59:56,960 --> 01:00:02,030
you really truly think and when you

1434
00:59:59,540 --> 01:00:05,150
reevaluate your beliefs at the same time

1435
01:00:02,030 --> 01:00:07,160
and you say what I must do this and you

1436
01:00:05,150 --> 01:00:10,339
can actually say to yourself oh his

1437
01:00:07,160 --> 01:00:11,598
belief is this one I must work right

1438
01:00:10,339 --> 01:00:13,040
when I said well no I must go if I need

1439
01:00:11,599 --> 01:00:16,640
to be full-time employed and blah blah

1440
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:20,119
blah and I stopped to say to myself okay

1441
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:22,848
who who do I believe with this one but

1442
01:00:20,119 --> 01:00:25,520
if my parents is not lying I'm quite

1443
01:00:22,849 --> 01:00:29,089
happy working you know not having to do

1444
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:30,710
this whatever big corporation or

1445
01:00:29,089 --> 01:00:34,009
whatever it is I'm quite happy doing my

1446
01:00:30,710 --> 01:00:37,339
own thing so so when we can do

1447
01:00:34,010 --> 01:00:39,290
activities that align with with those

1448
01:00:37,339 --> 01:00:43,460
three points it when we start becoming

1449
01:00:39,290 --> 01:00:45,770
the oh yeah now to want it to straight

1450
01:00:43,460 --> 01:00:49,220
when you feel blue when you feel

1451
01:00:45,770 --> 01:00:51,770
depressed you can do it in three ways

1452
01:00:49,220 --> 01:00:53,270
you can change your focus like we were

1453
01:00:51,770 --> 01:00:55,310
talking with moving your focus move not

1454
01:00:53,270 --> 01:00:58,040
will when you focus on the room you can

1455
01:00:55,310 --> 01:01:00,230
change your language or you can change

1456
01:00:58,040 --> 01:01:02,630
your physiology I often say to people

1457
01:01:00,230 --> 01:01:03,450
that if I am to talk to myself when I

1458
01:01:02,630 --> 01:01:05,250
say change

1459
01:01:03,450 --> 01:01:07,439
when we talk to ourselves if if I am to

1460
01:01:05,250 --> 01:01:10,920
talk to me soon oftentimes my talk will

1461
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:12,720
be oh so rubbish you're such a stupid

1462
01:01:10,920 --> 01:01:14,760
person what would you do that it's a

1463
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:16,890
negative negative negative so for me

1464
01:01:14,760 --> 01:01:19,230
it's hard to be mindful and change my

1465
01:01:16,890 --> 01:01:22,710
language change my focus is also very

1466
01:01:19,230 --> 01:01:25,410
hard but physiology is something easy

1467
01:01:22,710 --> 01:01:28,620
for me to do now if I am to ask you here

1468
01:01:25,410 --> 01:01:31,640
how when someone is depressed can you

1469
01:01:28,620 --> 01:01:33,089
figure on in your mind how they look

1470
01:01:31,640 --> 01:01:35,730
what body

1471
01:01:33,090 --> 01:01:36,840
what would a poster do they have and you

1472
01:01:35,730 --> 01:01:38,220
might not have seen a depressed person

1473
01:01:36,840 --> 01:01:40,410
in your life but when you talk about

1474
01:01:38,220 --> 01:01:42,720
depression what do we what do we think

1475
01:01:40,410 --> 01:01:46,080
in our minds is this your cruelty now

1476
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:49,859
you're looking down you're slow you your

1477
01:01:46,080 --> 01:01:52,590
facial features are being and son right

1478
01:01:49,860 --> 01:01:56,660
if you are to change if you are to

1479
01:01:52,590 --> 01:02:01,160
change your physiology and straighten up

1480
01:01:56,660 --> 01:02:05,490
and look up your brain will change I

1481
01:02:01,160 --> 01:02:09,450
will leave you with a pic talk we're

1482
01:02:05,490 --> 01:02:11,009
young sociologists social psychologists

1483
01:02:09,450 --> 01:02:14,310
in Harvard University called

1484
01:02:11,010 --> 01:02:16,890
Amy Cuddy and the talk is fake head

1485
01:02:14,310 --> 01:02:19,049
until you become it and she's done loads

1486
01:02:16,890 --> 01:02:22,670
of research and studied into how your

1487
01:02:19,050 --> 01:02:24,840
physiology changes your brain and it's

1488
01:02:22,670 --> 01:02:27,060
amazingly interesting and she talks

1489
01:02:24,840 --> 01:02:28,470
about how postures that you hold it for

1490
01:02:27,060 --> 01:02:30,720
two seconds and this is the Wonder Woman

1491
01:02:28,470 --> 01:02:32,490
once pulls it and you hold the footage

1492
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:36,149
segments on the cortisol level goes down

1493
01:02:32,490 --> 01:02:39,540
and the good feeling levels goes up and

1494
01:02:36,150 --> 01:02:41,910
it's a very very very interesting feel

1495
01:02:39,540 --> 01:02:44,430
because we always said our brain changes

1496
01:02:41,910 --> 01:02:47,790
our bodies but our bodies also change

1497
01:02:44,430 --> 01:02:50,129
our brain and that is all for me I think

1498
01:02:47,790 --> 01:02:53,790
I've over run I'm so sorry any questions

1499
01:02:50,130 --> 01:03:04,320
I'll be happy to if there is any

1500
01:02:53,790 --> 01:03:09,300
questions so a lunch is gonna be out

1501
01:03:04,320 --> 01:03:13,790
there so you've got but before we go

1502
01:03:09,300 --> 01:03:13,790
these big round of applause is all about
