1
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:08,599
hi everyone thank you for coming and

2
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:11,399
good morning it's great to be here

3
00:00:08,599 --> 00:00:13,200
actually I grew up up will not grow up

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:16,199
but I did live in Everett for a bit so

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:18,240
it's good to be back in the UK so we're

6
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:20,910
gonna cover a little bit about UK laws

7
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:23,970
currently and then a little bit on US

8
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:25,609
laws any US people in here raise your

9
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:28,070
hands

10
00:00:25,609 --> 00:00:30,900
okay I'm going to touch on that very

11
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:36,840
short then how many of you guys are

12
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:41,519
actually hackers yourself sweet how're

13
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:44,700
you guys our program managers okay this

14
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:47,640
is great for me you know so just a

15
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:49,289
disclaimer I am NOT an attorney at all I

16
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,390
was thinking about going to law school I

17
00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:52,980
was looking at Cambridge Oxford and then

18
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:56,820
I was like no you know what I don't

19
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:59,370
think law schools for me so anything I

20
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:02,910
give you is not advice at all it's just

21
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:04,890
me sharing a little bit of research so

22
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:07,408
I'm a scary searcher advocate a buck rod

23
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:09,210
I co-founded women and security woah sec

24
00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:11,189
we have chapters all over the world and

25
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:13,169
we're looking to build them out also in

26
00:01:11,189 --> 00:01:16,589
the UK so any ladies in here who are

27
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:19,229
interested connected me I do mentor

28
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:20,759
women to stay in InfoSec and also to get

29
00:01:19,229 --> 00:01:23,520
them trained on burp suite so they can

30
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:26,850
start hacking themselves I do speak on

31
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:28,920
diversity inclusion and bug bounty and a

32
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:32,189
board member for nonprofits creator

33
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:34,200
women hackers the slack so ladies that

34
00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:38,548
are hackers message me I'll add you on

35
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:40,680
to the women's slack channel drop labels

36
00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:42,570
founders and nonprofit and most

37
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:44,549
importantly the one takeaway from this

38
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:48,240
entire slide is this puppy right here

39
00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:49,710
this is Sherlock Sherlock is not happy

40
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,170
in that photo most likely because she's

41
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:53,939
wearing a diaper she is a Shiba Inu if

42
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:57,659
anyone knows what a Shiba Inu is like

43
00:01:53,939 --> 00:02:01,500
it's a cat it's literally a cat dog that

44
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:02,909
acts like a fox sometimes so let's touch

45
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:06,570
it a little bit on the current landscape

46
00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:09,360
in the UK so one thing is it's

47
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:10,979
interesting there has been a significant

48
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:14,770
drop of cases

49
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:16,840
however there's also has been evidence

50
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:19,840
that shows that there was an increase by

51
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:22,290
1.7 million cyber related crimes in the

52
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,790
same period which is very interesting

53
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:26,590
but I thought the one thing that I have

54
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:29,440
noticed in the research is that the

55
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:31,209
language that the UK has when it comes

56
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:34,270
to talking about hackers it's quite

57
00:02:31,209 --> 00:02:36,880
negative it's already assuming that you

58
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:39,190
are a bad person which is probably not a

59
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:40,930
good thing to stay but also not just

60
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:44,620
that but in almost every written

61
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:48,489
document it always is using he and not

62
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:51,130
she or they either so it's already very

63
00:02:48,489 --> 00:02:53,530
it's a very one-way straight of looking

64
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:55,510
at things but the most important thing

65
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:57,670
is that when you do switch it around by

66
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:59,920
putting ethical hacking in front or

67
00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:00,700
secure researcher you get a little bit

68
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:06,250
more positive

69
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:08,200
just a tad though so 1990 the computer

70
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:13,090
misuse Act how many of you guys are

71
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:17,048
aware of this act yes you've read that's

72
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:19,450
fantastic so it was introduced in 1990

73
00:03:17,049 --> 00:03:21,970
of course but it basically it was a way

74
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:24,130
to you know anyone who's gained on the

75
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:26,709
authorized access to a computer and

76
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:30,340
uncompassionate a sizable application of

77
00:03:26,709 --> 00:03:33,579
computers files would be prosecuted that

78
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:35,380
means even hacking tools or exploits

79
00:03:33,579 --> 00:03:38,049
such as used by legitimate secure

80
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:39,880
hackers can also be considered illegal

81
00:03:38,049 --> 00:03:42,100
but I think one of the most important

82
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:44,320
things is this first line right here

83
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:46,630
unauthorized access to computer material

84
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:49,780
did you know there's actually no solid

85
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:53,079
definition of computer materials so

86
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:55,810
except that they used this old old text

87
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:59,769
in 1968 that they still reference till

88
00:03:55,810 --> 00:04:02,019
today so that's one thing to note is

89
00:03:59,769 --> 00:04:03,820
that they use something very old not

90
00:04:02,019 --> 00:04:05,140
just that but the penalties are pretty

91
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:07,959
clear-cut here which I was actually

92
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:10,238
surprised he could go anywhere from two

93
00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:12,880
years of 14 years of being imprisoned

94
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:15,220
but just to note that there's also three

95
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:17,680
different levels of doing so and it can

96
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:20,079
range penalties from five thousand

97
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,730
pounds to unlimited that's right

98
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:26,919
unlimited people that's

99
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:28,660
little scary however in 2015 the state

100
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:31,690
police and intelligence personnel

101
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:35,380
realized oh wait we're also obligated to

102
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:37,390
follow this so 2015 they decided to make

103
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:42,159
an addition change to it that allows

104
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:44,260
them to not have to go by this act but

105
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,640
most importantly is that accidents

106
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:48,219
happen how many you guys when you're

107
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:52,810
hacking or what not you go things out of

108
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:53,830
scope accidentally at times right those

109
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:57,520
that's illegal

110
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:59,560
but apparently it's also and here it

111
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:01,330
just shows that there is a tricky

112
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:04,930
situation when you watch a report of

113
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:06,130
vulnerability that's very important but

114
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:08,020
the good news is that there are some

115
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:09,370
landscape improvements so in the UK even

116
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:11,440
though it comes off very negative

117
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:13,690
towards hackers itself

118
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:16,180
you had the Data Protection Act 2018

119
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:17,890
which actually offers protection for

120
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:20,980
those secure researchers I'd do it as

121
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:23,760
their lifetime career but also gives

122
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:29,110
them kind of more of a right situation

123
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:30,580
however once again it's it's not always

124
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:33,340
perfect either

125
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:36,520
so you have been warned the other thing

126
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:38,799
is that the NCSC the great news is that

127
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:41,169
they do participate in one really

128
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:43,810
disclosure a bug bounty programs and

129
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:45,670
they're very accurate when I dived in on

130
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:47,770
What's in scope what's outer scope and

131
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:49,240
the expectations or rewards that you can

132
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:52,719
get but the most important thing I think

133
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:55,780
of all of this is the good communication

134
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:58,210
they actually will tell you that this is

135
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:59,469
will get a hold of you within 90 days or

136
00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:04,270
whatnot so that's pretty good that's

137
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:07,750
clear-cut but let's go into post

138
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:09,370
briggsie ok I know it's very scary and

139
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:10,750
everything actually I'm just kidding I'm

140
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:15,670
not touching that I'm not touching that

141
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:17,860
at all ok good luck but let me dive into

142
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:19,900
some us loss in case of you're doing any

143
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:22,150
vulnerability disclosure and you're it

144
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:25,719
you're like on a US company or whatnot

145
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:29,469
so the CFA it was basically the same

146
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:32,650
thing as you cannot access this computer

147
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:34,040
with that authorization or you will be

148
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:35,780
prosecuted now the

149
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:38,240
interesting fact is this was created in

150
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:41,150
1984 after Ronald Reagan watched

151
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:44,690
wargames that's right so it was created

152
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:47,989
fantastic president so that's something

153
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:50,120
to keep in mind the DMC a which is the

154
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:53,300
Digital Millennium Copyright Act is the

155
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:55,850
way that you do not have quote unquote

156
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:58,040
the right to repair so that's one thing

157
00:06:55,850 --> 00:07:00,080
to note is that you could be violating

158
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:01,940
in many ways so reverse engineering is

159
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:04,849
seen as a breach of property to some

160
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:07,250
companies as well so that's another

161
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:10,430
interesting fact last but not least does

162
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:17,450
anyone know when was the first bug

163
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:24,980
bounty ever found or created anyone 1995

164
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:27,260
Netscape so I mean overall we use secure

165
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:29,540
researchers to find vulnerabilities for

166
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:31,280
us but also we use you can also say

167
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:33,470
hackers whatever definition you want to

168
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:35,809
use on that front are always looking for

169
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:38,240
vulnerabilities and yes program managers

170
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:40,370
are very scared sometimes to be like I

171
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:42,560
don't know if I want to do this or not I

172
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:44,570
don't want to put my contact info there

173
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,220
I don't want a policy terms and

174
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:49,070
conditions because that's setting me up

175
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:51,820
to have a situation but to be honest

176
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:54,770
they also know that it's necessary so

177
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:56,630
it's on both sides from the secure

178
00:07:54,770 --> 00:08:00,380
researchers side to program at your side

179
00:07:56,630 --> 00:08:02,659
and one's kind of bit scared and I know

180
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:05,900
this is a scary subject so here are some

181
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:07,580
pictures most of puppies can but you

182
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:09,799
know don't worry I did practice

183
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:12,830
inclusion in the slide for cat lovers

184
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:17,660
can anyone see the cat there's a cat

185
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:20,060
right there so what do we need perhaps

186
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:21,440
better sleep better communication

187
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:22,910
standardized language

188
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:26,870
oh yeah we're getting it to that point

189
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:28,940
another Red Bull but really what do we

190
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:31,700
need we need standardized easily

191
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:33,110
readable language so everyone can be on

192
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:35,840
the same page when it comes to

193
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:37,820
communicating with each other and that's

194
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:39,440
also a good way how to start

195
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:41,240
incorporating secure researchers to be

196
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:44,590
able to do the good work that they do as

197
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:47,240
everyday heroes also reducing ambiguity

198
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:49,940
around potential conflicts between

199
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:52,130
any existing terms and those specific to

200
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:54,380
Siri research and increased visibility

201
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:58,640
for secure research programs I include

202
00:08:54,380 --> 00:09:00,620
an explicit safe harbor status let's

203
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:04,100
dive in to disclose I am so disclose IO

204
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:06,830
is a project that is run by the hacking

205
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:08,420
community and program managers there's

206
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:11,870
two parts of it that I'm going to touch

207
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:14,000
on it shortly but in case if I forget I

208
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:16,550
do have a bunch of these stickers so if

209
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,700
you guys want to help pass it on I have

210
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:21,979
a lot of stickers if you guys want them

211
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:23,839
so a quick summary it just goes IO the

212
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:26,089
realization is that we need standardized

213
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:27,470
disclosure language and the reason for

214
00:09:26,089 --> 00:09:30,110
that is so we're all on the same page

215
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:32,600
especially since many of us around the

216
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:35,209
world don't really use English as their

217
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:37,279
first language so this isn't an issue -

218
00:09:35,209 --> 00:09:39,439
and how many of you guys actually read

219
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:44,779
your terms and conditions if you have an

220
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:46,430
iPhone yeah exactly so we made a make

221
00:09:44,779 --> 00:09:47,990
sure that it's a little bit shorter

222
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:50,120
right then you know hundreds of pages

223
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:52,310
but also that we can understand it we

224
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:54,260
don't need a lawyer to turpis what is

225
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:56,899
going to happen even though it's very

226
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:59,510
ambiguous most of the time so this goes

227
00:09:56,899 --> 00:10:03,529
I came about because companies want to

228
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:06,230
start practicing safe harbor but also we

229
00:10:03,529 --> 00:10:09,439
have a bilateral trust agreement with

230
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:11,120
the hacking community and it's broken

231
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:14,360
down in the two parts like I mentioned

232
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:16,850
earlier there's the list which I call my

233
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:18,940
hacker list of companies that practice

234
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:22,100
safe harbor or partial safe harbor and

235
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:25,010
also basically terms and conditions that

236
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:27,529
companies can adopt and bring it onto

237
00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:30,709
their own terms and conditions page that

238
00:10:27,529 --> 00:10:33,380
is simple and easy to read so everyone's

239
00:10:30,709 --> 00:10:35,300
on the same page and that's the most

240
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:37,670
important thing is that we need to work

241
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:40,219
together as a community so everyone

242
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:41,779
feels protected but not just that but

243
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:44,450
Aaron understands everything

244
00:10:41,779 --> 00:10:47,660
so in this everyone in this room if you

245
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:49,520
want to participate there's the easy way

246
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:51,529
out to do it and I'll go into that a

247
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:53,630
little bit close but also we're looking

248
00:10:51,529 --> 00:10:57,600
for people that are in the legal field

249
00:10:53,630 --> 00:11:01,200
any people in the legal field here yes

250
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:03,750
I like you back there we should chat

251
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,370
afterwards because believe it or not

252
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:09,750
we're going to try to bring discuss IO

253
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:11,340
to the UK as well so I'm gonna quickly

254
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:12,960
go over what is safe harbor versus

255
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:15,450
partial in case some people are aware of

256
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:17,190
partial safe harbor are any companies

257
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:18,650
that pretty much participate in any bug

258
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:22,170
betting of audibility disclosure

259
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:25,439
platforms such as book crowd because

260
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:27,810
they easily define the rewards what how

261
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,400
to communicate with the person how many

262
00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:31,349
guys have found a vulnerability and then

263
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:34,199
you're looking to everywhere to find the

264
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:36,420
contact info I mean it is irritating

265
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:37,710
it's ours and it could be days and then

266
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:40,410
you kind of like you know what I just

267
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:42,600
give up so having that it's going to be

268
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:46,079
really important and explicit permission

269
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:48,540
to complete security researching any

270
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:51,690
type of materials and whatnot so that's

271
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:53,849
really cool partial self safe harbor but

272
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:56,400
safe harbor as it is it's not just those

273
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:58,380
three but also has a disclosure policy

274
00:11:56,400 --> 00:12:01,800
and it could be the ones that we list on

275
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:04,110
disclose io but also it's extending it

276
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:05,670
so then if you need to find these

277
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:07,920
vulnerabilities that you're allowed to

278
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:10,140
do certain things and it's applicable to

279
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:12,329
federal laws but also that knowing that

280
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:13,380
you won't be prosecuted and especially

281
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:15,000
if you find something you have escaped

282
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:16,950
you didn't need to but it's actually

283
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,620
very important to share that you won't

284
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:21,630
be prosecuted of that either but also

285
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:25,020
being specific on what is in scope is

286
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:26,490
very important so the requirements like

287
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:29,730
I mentioned earlier if you want to

288
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:31,860
participate as a company you need make

289
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:33,330
sure to share your scope what is in

290
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:37,830
scope what is a scope and be very

291
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:40,350
specific rewards what kind is it swag is

292
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:42,300
a monetary official communication

293
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:44,340
channel so does that mean a slack does

294
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:46,500
that mean an email does that mean a

295
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:48,240
signal message and what is your

296
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:50,760
disclosure policy so you need to have a

297
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:53,490
link and share it with us and the

298
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:54,780
expectation is that you will extend the

299
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:57,330
vulnerability research that's relate to

300
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:58,920
this policy you'll work in remediate

301
00:12:57,330 --> 00:13:01,320
discover vulnerabilities in a timely

302
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:03,900
manner that means yes someone contacts

303
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:07,200
you please respond they're just trying

304
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:08,579
to do their job I could read the rest of

305
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,910
these but I think you guys can read it

306
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:10,910
for your

307
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:17,579
now for hackers yourself if you want to

308
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:19,720
participate you also have to agree on

309
00:13:17,579 --> 00:13:21,399
these following things these are just

310
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:23,230
some of them but I can't let me just

311
00:13:21,399 --> 00:13:26,529
point out that last one right there

312
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:28,720
please do not engage in extortion you're

313
00:13:26,529 --> 00:13:30,279
not doing us a favor anytime you do that

314
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:35,170
you're making us look bad

315
00:13:30,279 --> 00:13:36,970
so please don't do that be nice and this

316
00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:39,399
is a safe harbor language that we

317
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:41,170
usually share when it comes to the US

318
00:13:39,399 --> 00:13:42,490
but because we are working on the UK

319
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:45,819
it's gonna be different it's gonna

320
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:47,980
incorporate your laws as well we will

321
00:13:45,819 --> 00:13:52,300
have a Canadian one releasing it in two

322
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:54,699
weeks time so that's pretty exciting so

323
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:57,099
who wants to be on the 18 because it

324
00:13:54,699 --> 00:13:59,170
takes all of us to continue this this is

325
00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:02,740
a grassroots effort for all of us to

326
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:03,519
come together so there's two different

327
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:05,410
ways

328
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:07,389
safe harbor language we are looking for

329
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:11,050
people to give legal advice to us while

330
00:14:07,389 --> 00:14:12,730
we build out the UK that's one the other

331
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:15,189
thing is that you can take this language

332
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:16,959
yourselves and try to bring it to your

333
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:19,180
own company to have a better idea of

334
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:23,170
what is the next steps if you want to

335
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:27,069
practice safe harbor also everyone

336
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:28,930
hacking make a there's a list so and

337
00:14:27,069 --> 00:14:31,569
this goes like oh we have actually a

338
00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:35,739
github and this list basically shares

339
00:14:31,569 --> 00:14:38,410
what company was the policy URL and also

340
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:40,839
what kind of rewards to expect what is

341
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:44,439
you know what are you partial are you

342
00:14:40,839 --> 00:14:47,139
full and most importantly how do I reach

343
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:50,860
you so anyone who's ever curious about

344
00:14:47,139 --> 00:14:52,329
like well if I if I find something like

345
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:53,829
how do I get a hold on actually check

346
00:14:52,329 --> 00:14:55,769
out this list because chances are you

347
00:14:53,829 --> 00:14:58,930
can actually find them here too as well

348
00:14:55,769 --> 00:15:01,360
but any newbie hackers in here and you

349
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:03,310
want to dive into what companies can I

350
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:05,139
look for vulnerabilities for I always

351
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:21,880
say go for the safe harbor companies

352
00:15:05,139 --> 00:15:26,560
first any questions yes the US

353
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:31,870
we listened but how does it work if I

354
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:35,589
try to use this a part of our testing US

355
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:38,920
company will pay the price daily which

356
00:15:35,589 --> 00:15:44,079
close my concerns that I present my

357
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:47,229
plans no you can go to any that disposal

358
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:49,120
in both countries to use it yeah

359
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:50,230
so usually wherever the headquarters are

360
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,389
those little loss that they get

361
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:53,610
prosecuted how are there is an exception

362
00:15:52,389 --> 00:15:55,839
to that you can still be prosecuted

363
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:58,839
regardless in your own country that you

364
00:15:55,839 --> 00:16:00,579
are hacking in so you can out didn't

365
00:15:58,839 --> 00:16:03,329
know that it could have applied either

366
00:16:00,579 --> 00:16:03,329
way unfortunately

367
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:11,920
technically yes or just go on make sure

368
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:15,069
they have a vulnerability disclosure I

369
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:16,930
count on one of like a one of the

370
00:16:15,069 --> 00:16:19,180
platforms like background or what not

371
00:16:16,930 --> 00:16:20,649
and if they have that listed then that's

372
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:22,479
really good

373
00:16:20,649 --> 00:16:24,310
and then if anyone in this room if you

374
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,899
are in a situation where you do find a

375
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:28,149
vulnerability that is out of scope and

376
00:16:25,899 --> 00:16:30,370
it's a very bad one and you need help

377
00:16:28,149 --> 00:16:32,439
with that feel free to like DME and we

378
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:36,430
can figure out a way how to approach the

379
00:16:32,439 --> 00:17:08,289
company most likely any other questions

380
00:16:36,430 --> 00:17:11,369
you know with a program can't even hear

381
00:17:08,289 --> 00:17:11,369
you there sorry Russell

382
00:17:12,210 --> 00:17:32,680
you still have a few expiry citizens

383
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:34,240
yeah yeah so there are definitely

384
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:36,310
companies are like I really don't want

385
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:38,380
to put myself out there for doing the

386
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:40,000
vulnerability disclosure or a program or

387
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:41,860
whatnot because I'm kind of scared of

388
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,990
what will happen will I be flooded will

389
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:45,879
I be attacked will they go out of scope

390
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:48,130
to tell me these things and these are

391
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:49,570
all you know these are all fears but to

392
00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:51,520
be honest most evidence has shown that

393
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:54,250
by having one of those you're actually

394
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:56,410
making your company a lot safer so I

395
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:58,090
mean there's plenty of articles and

396
00:17:56,410 --> 00:18:01,090
research out there that you could always

397
00:17:58,090 --> 00:18:04,899
use to share with companies and I have

398
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:08,280
definitely have those in my file so if

399
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:08,280
you ever need anything just let me know
