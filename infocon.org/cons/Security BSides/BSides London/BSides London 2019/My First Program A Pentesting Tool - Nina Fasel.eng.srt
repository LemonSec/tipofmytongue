00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:10,049
hi everyone welcome to my talk my first

2
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:12,480
program a fantastic tool so just in case

3
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:15,179
you're wondering this will not just be a

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:17,430
talk about programming and coding and

5
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:20,310
this will also be a talk about a lot of

6
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:25,560
first times but not what you might think

7
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:27,840
know first about me how I end up here

8
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:30,689
because I come from a very very

9
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:36,510
different subject so back in the days I

10
00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:39,149
studied history of Arts and after they

11
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:42,449
said it a few different things and I

12
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:46,260
ended up working at school and some day

13
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:48,000
a guy turned up at this school and did a

14
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:52,230
pen test there and while he was doing

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:56,789
this he talked to all the employees and

16
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:59,218
he also talked to me and when I was

17
00:00:56,789 --> 00:01:02,129
working there was mainly working on a

18
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:05,010
program called FileMaker Pro I cannot

19
00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:09,090
recommend it it was it was pretty

20
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:12,869
outdated and I used it for purpose that

21
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:15,840
it was not designed for him and the guy

22
00:01:12,869 --> 00:01:18,420
ended up asking me what do you think

23
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:21,960
about becoming a hacker and my answer

24
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:25,650
was like hell yeah so this is why I'm

25
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:27,899
here now in addition to this I should

26
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:30,390
mention that I'm from Germany so in case

27
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:33,829
that my language is not perfect this is

28
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:38,100
because I'm not a native English speaker

29
00:01:33,829 --> 00:01:41,880
so I work in IT security industry now

30
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:45,809
for almost a year so next month it will

31
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:48,630
be a year so I had to learn a lot I'm

32
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:51,210
still learning so also I learned

33
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:53,880
programming but I will tell about this

34
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:56,908
later what else you should know about me

35
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:58,740
I do have a pet her name is Lila she's a

36
00:01:56,909 --> 00:02:00,750
little chipmunk if you want to see more

37
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:07,679
photos of her you can ask me later on I

38
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:10,830
have tons and I love suing and over the

39
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:13,230
last year the things I see you became

40
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:16,500
more sophisticated also in

41
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:19,980
loading electronic parts and I love

42
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:23,180
sports I do jogging and powdering so

43
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:26,879
about programming what I learned about

44
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:29,670
programming was it is very similar to

45
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:31,500
learning any other language so I learned

46
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:36,119
a lot of languages obviously English

47
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:38,459
French Spanish Greek and Latin and then

48
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:41,790
I came to programming and my first

49
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:44,489
programming language with Python and I

50
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:47,099
noticed that I have to do some like

51
00:02:44,489 --> 00:02:50,239
grammar which is basically the syntax

52
00:02:47,099 --> 00:02:53,790
and some vocab so some predefined

53
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:55,739
definitions and variables and would you

54
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:57,959
I also learned what was very different

55
00:02:55,739 --> 00:02:59,220
from other languages just you have to

56
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:03,200
know how to use Google

57
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:08,489
this can help you very low very much and

58
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:10,410
I started learning Python with a book

59
00:03:08,489 --> 00:03:13,440
and when I finished the book I was so

60
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:17,579
happy and I thought I was done and then

61
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:19,380
I realized I was not because there's

62
00:03:17,579 --> 00:03:22,829
always something new and when you get

63
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:25,769
into programming they come a lot of new

64
00:03:22,829 --> 00:03:29,130
libraries a lot of new ways how to code

65
00:03:25,769 --> 00:03:33,150
things so you can always learn something

66
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:36,418
new and what I also learned is errors

67
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:39,299
can be progress so when you code you

68
00:03:36,419 --> 00:03:41,940
can't get around making mistakes but

69
00:03:39,299 --> 00:03:45,090
when you find your mistakes and fix them

70
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:48,750
then your program will grow and it will

71
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:51,060
proceed and the good thing I learned

72
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:54,630
about coding is it can be very very

73
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:57,930
rewarding so when you build something

74
00:03:54,630 --> 00:04:00,840
and you see what you've done after it

75
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:03,030
can be cool and sometimes you wrote code

76
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:05,870
and it works the first time but it does

77
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:09,720
not happen as often as I wish it would

78
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:12,180
so when I started writing my first

79
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:15,840
program I was wondering what should it

80
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:19,108
do and I was lucky because I had a

81
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:21,418
work-related tasks and they should do

82
00:04:19,108 --> 00:04:22,469
reconnaissance and enumeration and I was

83
00:04:21,418 --> 00:04:25,890
wondering

84
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:29,310
how could I achieve this so I used

85
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:33,210
Google again and found out I could use

86
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:35,280
the showed an IP so what I did then was

87
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:37,320
the first time reading a full

88
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,969
documentation and it was the showed and

89
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:42,719
documentation and was great fun I

90
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:45,120
learned a lot and I just tried to do

91
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:48,360
something and turned out with like the

92
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:52,280
beta version of my program which looked

93
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:55,260
like this so he had a little banner and

94
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:57,599
the it was a command line interactive

95
00:04:55,260 --> 00:05:00,390
tool so it asked questions you answer

96
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:04,770
them and in this case asked I just

97
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:07,770
looked up google.com and I said I want

98
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:10,890
three results when you're lucky you get

99
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:16,560
some results and then you can save them

100
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:18,840
and give it a filename and when you've

101
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:21,060
saved it the holds the thing look like

102
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:24,119
this so you had some information about

103
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:28,020
the IP the domain name and the ports and

104
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:30,900
what the ports are doing and what I also

105
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:34,229
learned while doing this how to import

106
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:36,150
another piece of code into my code so

107
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:38,070
for example if I'm going to share this

108
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:41,599
program one time I don't want everyone

109
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:44,760
to have my children IP key so there's a

110
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:50,580
tiny bit of code that I can import to

111
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:53,909
use this and after I did this I thought

112
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:56,490
about how can I make my program easier

113
00:05:53,910 --> 00:06:01,440
to use what other programs do I know and

114
00:05:56,490 --> 00:06:03,030
how do I use them and yeah for the

115
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:06,090
command line tool would be much easier

116
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:09,840
to use than an interactive program and

117
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:13,979
then I googled again and find out that I

118
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:15,710
could use art cars and I didn't read the

119
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:19,500
whole documentation and I understand

120
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:22,229
understood nothing so as you can see I

121
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:24,060
clicked on the art past tutorial and did

122
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:26,669
the whole tutorial and it helped a lot

123
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:30,210
so there were a lot of different options

124
00:06:26,669 --> 00:06:32,609
that I could use and so much stuff to go

125
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:34,590
through and I did it all

126
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:36,449
whenever you're going through the actors

127
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:40,438
documentation you don't understand

128
00:06:36,449 --> 00:06:43,469
anything do the tutorial it's great so I

129
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:46,650
ended up writing my quote so this is

130
00:06:43,469 --> 00:06:51,330
part of my code just to show off a

131
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:53,909
little bit I really did it and yeah no I

132
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:58,500
want you to describe what my program can

133
00:06:53,909 --> 00:06:59,750
do until now so you have some basic

134
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:03,719
search functions

135
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:08,430
- IP four and they can look up an IP

136
00:07:03,719 --> 00:07:10,919
address - be for a banner search - D for

137
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:14,129
domain and you can also give the program

138
00:07:10,919 --> 00:07:19,229
a list it should be a txt file with one

139
00:07:14,129 --> 00:07:23,639
IP per Lane per line and search research

140
00:07:19,229 --> 00:07:25,830
this the domain output still looks like

141
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:29,639
from the beta version so you still have

142
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:33,560
the IP the domain name and the ports

143
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:36,539
with their functions and the other

144
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:38,310
options are a little bit a little bit

145
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:42,740
more sophisticated at the output is a

146
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:45,930
little bit more verbose and you can also

147
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:48,409
specify what you're looking for for

148
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:51,990
example you can limit the output of the

149
00:07:48,409 --> 00:07:54,659
results for example when you search for

150
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:58,080
google.com you will get tons of results

151
00:07:54,659 --> 00:08:00,810
and you can say yeah I'll say - and five

152
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:04,589
and you will just get five results you

153
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:07,710
can also save the output as JSON output

154
00:08:04,589 --> 00:08:11,849
or as takes T file or you can choose

155
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:16,560
both options and with a - we it's not

156
00:08:11,849 --> 00:08:20,550
rebels as in many other programs for me

157
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:24,150
it's vulnerabilities so Sheldon looks

158
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:28,319
for vulnerabilities on the a piece but

159
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:30,419
it's looking for and with - we you can

160
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:35,339
get more information about the

161
00:08:30,419 --> 00:08:37,260
vulnerabilities another function that I

162
00:08:35,339 --> 00:08:42,690
put in there is you can do an on demand

163
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:43,760
scan so you give a search item to the

164
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:47,900
shoulder an IP

165
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:51,350
and it will after some time do the scan

166
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:56,000
and you can check if it's done with - em

167
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:59,510
so you will get a status report and when

168
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:05,990
the scan is finally done with - G you

169
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:07,990
can get the results and you can also in

170
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:12,650
case you find somewhere a list of

171
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:17,000
Sheldon IP keys verify if the keys are

172
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:21,050
valid or not with - K and the list and

173
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:24,140
you can also look for the protocols and

174
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:26,959
reports that children is scanning during

175
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:29,810
the search and for sure like in every

176
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:33,230
program you can use that - H for the

177
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:40,719
help message and now I want to

178
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:44,000
demonstrate how the program works so

179
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:46,910
here I'm called program look for

180
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,920
google.com and say I want a pen a search

181
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:50,630
with four results and I want the

182
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:55,390
information about the vulnerabilities

183
00:09:50,630 --> 00:10:00,290
and I want to save it as txt file and as

184
00:09:55,390 --> 00:10:04,010
JSON file it takes a little bit of time

185
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:06,260
I cut out a few seconds so otherwise

186
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:10,220
movie would have Sidney a little longer

187
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:12,650
so it was saved and here you can see the

188
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:17,020
longer descriptions of the

189
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:21,410
vulnerabilities there were a lot and

190
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:24,740
this is just the list if you don't

191
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:28,699
choose - we you just get the list and

192
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:31,520
this is how the output of the ports

193
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:36,590
might look like depending on what the

194
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:41,120
program finds and this is how the output

195
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:43,640
looks now I added that you can see in

196
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:45,980
the file when you did the the scan just

197
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:48,920
in case you forgot to save it the right

198
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:51,070
way and in case you have to repeatedly

199
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:54,819
do the same scan again

200
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:57,190
again the command that he used to saved

201
00:10:54,820 --> 00:11:00,070
and the file as well so you can do it

202
00:10:57,190 --> 00:11:03,690
again after a few months without no

203
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:07,780
taking a note what you've done there and

204
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:10,510
for the future since I have to

205
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:13,980
repeatedly do scans at work at the

206
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:17,380
moment I'm thinking about implementing

207
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:19,450
that I can compare the old scan worthy

208
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:23,410
of the new scan that I do at the moment

209
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:27,240
and just in case that you have any ideas

210
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:30,280
for me feel free to enlighten me and

211
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:31,900
what's left for me now is saying thank

questions ok remember why did you do an

217
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:10,090
API key yeah all the verification of

218
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:11,650
Alice I don't remember exactly but it

219
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:14,620
might be that I had somehow stumbled

220
00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:15,220
about a list of showed an IP keys on the

221
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:18,309
Internet

222
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:18,309

background in teaching and stuff are you

233
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:01,240
thinking have you thought about maybe

234
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:03,880
how you could like run this kind of

235
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:06,580
thing out to educate other people who

236
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:11,290
are new to this sorry I should make the

237
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:14,830
question clearer could you make this

238
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:17,319
idea use this idea to educate new people

239
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:21,640
to attack so coding do you think have

240
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:24,160
you thought about that so if I could

241

motivate people with what I did

242
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:30,699
um yeah I'm trying to think of how to

243
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:33,220
say it better so yeah so could you take

244
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:35,890
this program and give it out to a school

245
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:39,360
so that you can encourage kids to learn

246
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:42,630
how to program and or get in this area

247
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,630
yeah maybe

248
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:51,240
