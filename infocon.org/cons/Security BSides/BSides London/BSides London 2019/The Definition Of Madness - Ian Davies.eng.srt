1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:11,340
I got afternoon everybody and so as as

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,719
it was introduced my name is Ian I'm

3
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:14,160
probably not what most of you would

4
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:16,139
expect to see on the road track I'm

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:20,670
probably the oldest person from the roof

6
00:00:16,139 --> 00:00:24,630
you trap I am a rookie as far as InfoSec

7
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:26,279
is concerned I started looking intersect

8
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:29,549
last year and I took my first paid

9
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:33,149
position in February so I'm a rookie in

10
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:35,850
perhaps a different way I no matter what

11
00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:39,770
the definition of madness it's a phrase

12
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:42,149
often attributed to Albert Einstein it's

13
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:44,190
there's no direct evidence that he ever

14
00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:46,260
said those words but the sentiment of it

15
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:52,680
in my experience over the last 12 months

16
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:54,839
is quite key for InfoSec before we get

17
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:58,699
started to deeply a little bit about me

18
00:00:54,840 --> 00:01:01,770
I worked on my first computer in 1980 I

19
00:00:58,699 --> 00:01:05,670
worked on my first industrial control

20
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:08,490
system in 1987 and I took my first IT

21
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:11,310
qualifications in 1989 and looking

22
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:14,369
around the room probably some of you

23
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:17,189
weren't even around then so that's the

24
00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:20,750
first computer I ever worked on hands up

25
00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:23,250
if anybody else's there's a few of it

26
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:26,340
that was the first industrial system I

27
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:27,509
ever went I was an Argus 4,500 it was

28
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:29,400
originally built as an industrial

29
00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:32,490
control system but the one that I used

30
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:34,259
was adapted with a choral 66 compiler

31
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:39,899
and we used it for a private military

32
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:42,720
messaging system I've spent 10 years in

33
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:45,930
the RAF I've worked in education both as

34
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:48,420
a lecturer and as an IT technician or

35
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:51,119
network manager I've worked in small

36
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:53,520
business one building 30 users and I

37
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:56,460
currently work for a builders merchant

38
00:01:53,520 --> 00:02:00,390
group with about 700 branches across

39
00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:03,630
four countries in Europe last year we

40
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:05,909
identified maybe earlier than last year

41
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:07,798
but we identified that we've got no

42
00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:09,420
operational security we had a guy that

43
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:12,030
sat in the corner

44
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:14,819
doing policy but we really didn't have

45
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:18,120
anybody doing any operational security

46
00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:20,970
any real kind of proactive security and

47
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:25,560
so they sent me a way to do a course the

48
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:30,750
course they chose was this one it was C

49
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:32,940
eh now there you go you see that's

50
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:35,010
exactly the reaction not quite quite

51
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:36,829
from so many people as I expected it but

52
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:42,600
that was the erection I got everywhere

53
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:45,330
but it's not that bad I had never I was

54
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:47,100
really excited to go I really really

55
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:50,310
enjoyed the course content I came home

56
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:51,840
full of enthusiasm to learn more but

57
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:53,010
what happened when I came back was that

58
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,290
I got exactly that reaction

59
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:58,200
everybody shaped their habits people

60
00:02:55,290 --> 00:03:00,209
ignored me people when I tried to reach

61
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:03,660
out to people I I work in builders

62
00:03:00,209 --> 00:03:05,459
merchants this you know there's no other

63
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:07,350
security people there the only way that

64
00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:08,700
I could communicate with people was

65
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:10,470
through social media whether that was

66
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:12,268
Twitter or LinkedIn or Facebook or

67
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:15,120
wherever it was but when I reached out

68
00:03:12,269 --> 00:03:17,820
to people the many I mentioned see eh I

69
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,290
was cut off some you know he started to

70
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:20,790
put me down or they started to put the

71
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:23,840
qualification down they told me that I

72
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:26,220
had wasted my time on wasted my money

73
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:29,160
pretty much I was offered very little

74
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:33,209
help and guidance at all because of the

75
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:36,299
qualification that I'd done on that

76
00:03:33,209 --> 00:03:40,320
qualification though I learnt what data

77
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:42,269
our systems leak I learn how we can use

78
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:45,420
open source intelligence to go and find

79
00:03:42,269 --> 00:03:49,380
exploits based on that data how we can

80
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:51,390
then exploit those using Metasploit and

81
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:52,890
other tools that are freely available on

82
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:57,540
the web with tutorials

83
00:03:52,890 --> 00:04:01,380
I saw examples of privilege escalation

84
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:03,660
of lateral movement and although it was

85
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:06,030
on an unpatched XP VM I delivered my

86
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:08,160
first payloads had never ever done that

87
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:11,730
now bear in mind that I've worked on my

88
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:14,819
first computer in 1987 nobody had ever

89
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:16,918
shown me that before nobody have ever

90
00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:19,620
explained any of this to me in detail

91
00:04:16,918 --> 00:04:22,889
before

92
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:25,770
I came home as I said really excited for

93
00:04:22,889 --> 00:04:28,470
the first time in 30 or more years I'd

94
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:32,240
found a subject that I really wanted to

95
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:34,620
kind of grasp hold off and work through

96
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:38,490
and when I got home and I started to

97
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:45,360
reach out pretty much that's why I'm not

98
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:47,699
told osep offensive security certified

99
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:52,169
professional I guess it's the pinnacle

100
00:04:47,699 --> 00:05:01,229
of penetration testing or ethical

101
00:04:52,169 --> 00:05:03,180
hacking or offensive security it's it's

102
00:05:01,229 --> 00:05:07,919
as its as far apart as it could possibly

103
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:10,229
be really you know it wasn't helpful ceh

104
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:12,330
was a beginner qualification done by a

105
00:05:10,229 --> 00:05:16,020
beginner who is now reaching out for

106
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:18,659
more help hey can you stand up for a

107
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:20,039
minute sorry I'm making him work I

108
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:23,250
practiced this talk I could move about

109
00:05:20,039 --> 00:05:26,639
and I can't move about so if that's osep

110
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:28,590
and I'm ceh how do I get from here to

111
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:31,650
there don't go all the way around the

112
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:32,070
wing do it just go straight there in a

113
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:33,960
straight line

114
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:36,150
what's the journey that I've got to take

115
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:37,830
to get from here to there don't quit

116
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:39,710
telling me I've got to get there if

117
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:44,210
you're not going to help me get there

118
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:50,130
that was what I found thanks Kai

119
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:51,630
I I struggled for some time after I'd

120
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:55,320
done that qualification I struggled with

121
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:59,460
impostor syndrome I started to question

122
00:05:55,320 --> 00:06:01,370
whether I was a bit of a fraud I mean

123
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:05,010
I've been doing this for 30 years 30

124
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:08,210
plus years how would I got all of that

125
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:12,570
time without knowing any of this stuff

126
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:16,229
and I started to ask friends and

127
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:19,530
colleagues I started to ask members of

128
00:06:16,229 --> 00:06:21,240
my IT team what other developers some of

129
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:24,059
the money service providers that I went

130
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:27,180
to work with in my new role and actually

131
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:30,030
I found that most of them had very very

132
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:31,530
very little understanding of how

133
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:35,359
breaches occurred

134
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:37,830
or how vulnerabilities are exploited and

135
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,840
that everything you need to do it is

136
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:42,890
freely available on the web you don't

137
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:45,719
need to be able to do anything clever

138
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:49,140
that's not entirely true but you can get

139
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:51,360
started really simply and really easily

140
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:54,599
and if you can find something on show

141
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:56,610
Dan you can start firing exploits at RDP

142
00:06:54,600 --> 00:07:04,020
and we're gonna see that and the next

143
00:06:56,610 --> 00:07:07,350
few weeks on me I wasn't alone and that

144
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:10,940
was quite key for me that I I found out

145
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:14,870
wasn't alone this was an interesting

146
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:17,280
tweet that a lady in the state spa where

147
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:19,320
she'd been told she wasn't cut out for

148
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,760
InfoSec because she wanted to study with

149
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:22,880
other people she didn't want to do it on

150
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,880
her own

151
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:29,570
I'm malicious I don't know if she

152
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:32,940
actually made it into the room but

153
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:34,650
malicious put this up and it hit home to

154
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:37,380
me because I used to work in education

155
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:39,960
that I elected an Fe and I worked in

156
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:41,640
education both as a IT technician and a

157
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:47,010
school governor and it was all about

158
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:48,750
learning we we were about professional

159
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:51,479
development as well as about teaching

160
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:53,669
students at every Thursday morning for

161
00:07:51,479 --> 00:07:55,289
48 weeks of the year for five years we

162
00:07:53,669 --> 00:07:57,719
went into a staff room and somebody

163
00:07:55,290 --> 00:08:00,240
within the teaching staff or the support

164
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:01,890
staff did a short presentation on some

165
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:07,169
best practice or something that they'd

166
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:10,380
found that worked well so I got 48 24

167
00:08:07,169 --> 00:08:13,140
hours a year of free training of free

168
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:15,990
professional development because we did

169
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:18,659
that was the culture within education it

170
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:21,660
seemed really strange to me that we

171
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:23,970
don't have that culture here and that's

172
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:27,419
a newcomer that comes along that's just

173
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:29,490
our ting out gets told that he's got to

174
00:08:27,419 --> 00:08:31,650
go and do a qualification that's so far

175
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:35,089
out of its reach because that's the only

176
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:35,088
way you'll ever be taken seriously

177
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:41,429
Melissa's been here we need to move from

178
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:44,640
try harder try harder has its place but

179
00:08:41,429 --> 00:08:45,089
try harder shouldn't be the sole method

180
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,399
we learn

181
00:08:45,089 --> 00:08:49,259
InfoSec we shouldn't be telling

182
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:52,579
everybody who comes in that they've got

183
00:08:49,259 --> 00:08:55,050
to go and do that learning on their own

184
00:08:52,579 --> 00:08:59,160
if we're not sharing this information

185
00:08:55,050 --> 00:09:02,998
with each other how on earth do we

186
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:05,850
expect our our helpdesk operators our

187
00:09:02,999 --> 00:09:08,939
developers our sysadmin to learn about

188
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:10,889
security you know how many of them don't

189
00:09:08,939 --> 00:09:12,899
know about reconnaissance and

190
00:09:10,889 --> 00:09:15,059
enumeration and assessment and exploit

191
00:09:12,899 --> 00:09:17,579
I'll tell you how many a large

192
00:09:15,059 --> 00:09:20,129
proportion of them I now in my new role

193
00:09:17,579 --> 00:09:22,349
go out and meet all of the people that

194
00:09:20,129 --> 00:09:23,970
we acquire we're a business built on

195
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:26,100
acquisition and I go out and I meet all

196
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:28,499
of these small businesses all of their

197
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:30,240
IT is out sourced and I go and meet

198
00:09:28,499 --> 00:09:33,809
their commercial staff and I go and meet

199
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:35,670
their local IT support companies and all

200
00:09:33,809 --> 00:09:38,339
of these managed service providers all

201
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:40,378
every single one I've met so that sounds

202
00:09:38,339 --> 00:09:43,290
like a lot doesn't it I've met four but

203
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:47,639
the four that I've met have absolutely

204
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:50,610
no idea about this stuff now when I say

205
00:09:47,639 --> 00:09:52,910
to them why have you done that their

206
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:55,800
answer is well because they asked us to

207
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:56,999
they never challenged it it's but they

208
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,079
don't challenge it because they don't

209
00:09:56,999 --> 00:10:02,730
understand they're doing something

210
00:09:58,079 --> 00:10:05,370
dangerous we need to change the approach

211
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:06,990
I think we need to change the approach

212
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:09,089
era it's my opinion that we need to

213
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:10,860
change the approach we need to get away

214
00:10:09,089 --> 00:10:13,769
from the gatekeepers we need to get away

215
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:16,079
from this try harder approach I'd like

216
00:10:13,769 --> 00:10:21,300
to do an OS CP then you can try harder

217
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:23,128
and people say it's not possible but it

218
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:24,449
is possible to change attitudes it is

219
00:10:23,129 --> 00:10:27,209
possible to change the way we approach

220
00:10:24,449 --> 00:10:29,670
things in 1980 when I started working in

221
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:31,170
computers drinking the driving was a bit

222
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:32,998
of a macho challenge we'd go down the

223
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:34,529
pub with other load of drink we'd drive

224
00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:35,790
home and then we go down the pub the

225
00:10:34,529 --> 00:10:40,019
next night and brag about how many pints

226
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:41,969
we had before we drove home and wearing

227
00:10:40,019 --> 00:10:45,149
seatbelts there were cars that didn't

228
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:46,470
even have seatbelts in them speeding was

229
00:10:45,149 --> 00:10:48,029
never talked about well it wasn't

230
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:51,029
because it was taboo or anything I was

231
00:10:48,029 --> 00:10:52,529
just never talked about we just speed

232
00:10:51,029 --> 00:10:55,000
wasn't something that was in the

233
00:10:52,529 --> 00:10:59,949
conscious mind now

234
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:01,629
thirty years later we you would I hope

235
00:10:59,949 --> 00:11:05,620
you wouldn't think of drink-driving

236
00:11:01,629 --> 00:11:10,060
it certainly got a different term it

237
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:12,069
certainly got a different attitude to

238
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:14,378
drink driving and it's frowned upon if

239
00:11:12,069 --> 00:11:15,639
you if you do it wearing seatbelts now a

240
00:11:14,379 --> 00:11:17,709
second nature it doesn't matter where

241
00:11:15,639 --> 00:11:19,509
you get into a car you put the seatbelt

242
00:11:17,709 --> 00:11:21,128
on I got into a London cab last week

243
00:11:19,509 --> 00:11:23,670
when I was down here you sit in the back

244
00:11:21,129 --> 00:11:25,990
of the cab and you put a seatbelt on I'm

245
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:29,500
speeding it's quite interesting because

246
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:31,300
it's become the new drink driving not

247
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:34,300
even more than two or three years ago

248
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:35,469
really you might have heard somebody say

249
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:38,109
oh I've got a speeding ticket on that

250
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:39,939
flipping camera down the road and the

251
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:41,589
answer would have been the speed cameras

252
00:11:39,939 --> 00:11:43,269
they're painting the backside the worst

253
00:11:41,589 --> 00:11:47,290
they dangerous they don't do any good

254
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:48,459
now I've heard those conversations but

255
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:51,099
they've been turned on the head because

256
00:11:48,459 --> 00:11:54,040
now people say I've got flipping take it

257
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:55,870
off that speed camera down the road and

258
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:58,870
everybody says well if you went to

259
00:11:55,870 --> 00:12:03,569
feeding you want alot ticket so

260
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:03,569
attitudes do change and can be changed

261
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:21,809
what's going on it's frozen

262
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:38,950
there we go

263
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:41,490
anyway so away from driving back to

264
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:44,320
InfoSec we do need to change attitudes

265
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:46,690
last year's Court fundamentally changed

266
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:50,590
my understanding an approach to security

267
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:52,330
and IT I went from delivery being a team

268
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:54,610
manager delivering infrastructure not

269
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:58,690
really understanding what I was doing to

270
00:12:54,610 --> 00:13:01,620
now being the the operational active

271
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:04,930
security person building a security team

272
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:07,780
building a security culture but InfoSec

273
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:10,120
is a journey all journeys have all

274
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:11,110
journeys have a beginning there are many

275
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:12,850
destinations

276
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:14,830
there are many routes to many different

277
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:17,290
destinations if I'm trying to get to Kai

278
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:18,670
I can go around the room I'll go up the

279
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:20,770
middle of the room around the back I can

280
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:23,459
go directly there I could just climb

281
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:27,220
over all of you just for the fun of it

282
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:30,550
we don't we don't one thing doesn't fit

283
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:33,040
everything one way of learning doesn't

284
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:35,920
fit everything and people don't know

285
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:38,349
what they don't know how can you try

286
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:44,260
harder when you don't know what you're

287
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:47,350
supposed to be trying I presented this

288
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:49,180
talk to my lovely mentor who probably

289
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:52,570
bribed you always sweets to come in out

290
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:53,890
at night and he said it's fine having a

291
00:13:52,570 --> 00:14:00,010
rant but what you're going to do about

292
00:13:53,890 --> 00:14:04,600
it and I didn't really know but it was

293
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:06,430
an interesting challenge so I'm here

294
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:08,920
today because I I listened to a podcast

295
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:11,109
and a lady called Rachel Toback issued a

296
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:12,880
challenge she said don't wait until

297
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:15,700
you're ready you if you wait until you

298
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:17,080
ready you'll never be ready if you want

299
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:19,300
to do something go and do it

300
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:21,010
so indent I submitted my CFP and I'm

301
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:23,079
here today because of that challenge so

302
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:25,480
I'm obviously somebody who can't resist

303
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:27,250
a challenge and when Kai tells me about

304
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:30,370
what I was going to do about it I didn't

305
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:32,230
really know so this is my first step my

306
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:34,530
first attempt to I think we might be

307
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:35,630
able to do and actually

308
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:39,290
[Music]

309
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:42,050
I'd like to build a new a new community

310
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:45,439
for beginners a community where it's

311
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:49,329
safe to ask questions where no question

312
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:51,950
is silly you won't be told to try harder

313
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:55,250
you might be told to try Google but you

314
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:57,980
won't be told to try harder the only

315
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:59,840
thing that I didn't have chance to do is

316
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:01,370
change the Twitter handle because I set

317
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:03,440
this up about two or three weeks ago

318
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:05,780
when we were doing it and Twitter in

319
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:08,000
their lovely way have removed the

320
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:10,250
account won't let me into it so the

321
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:13,160
Twitter handle now is infoset and you

322
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:15,050
come one the RS has disappeared off the

323
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:18,890
end of it and I didn't have chance to

324
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:21,020
change the slide there is a slack

325
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:23,030
channel I'm called

326
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:25,340
learning sharing securing it it's by

327
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:27,560
invite only at the minute because I'm

328
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:30,020
excited to do it any other way but if

329
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:33,229
you joined me on Twitter or you email me

330
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:37,340
at that address or you can contact Kai

331
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:38,840
I'm sure he's also in there and we would

332
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:40,160
love to have you join us and we'd love

333
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:45,560
you to invite other people to come and

334
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:48,079
join us because we can't do it unless we

335
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:50,800
all do it together and although I've

336
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:53,390
ranted about how little help there was

337
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:57,109
I've had an amazing amount of help from

338
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:58,550
the B sides team and from my mentor and

339
00:15:57,110 --> 00:16:01,250
it's been a fantastic day here this is

340
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:04,370
my first ever conference and I'm doing

341
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:06,950
my first CFP I've been my first talk at

342
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:08,720
my first ever conference and I've had an

343
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:10,400
amazing amount of support at that but he

344
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,390
took a long time to get there I could

345
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:15,800
have done well that support twelve

346
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:17,930
months ago and that is it really if we

347
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:20,829
don't change what we're doing are we

348
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:20,829
going to see different results

349
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:33,079
so we really don't have time for

350
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:35,450
questions but I'm going to exert MC

351
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:39,920
privilege how many of you have taken the

352
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:43,820
ceh class okay how many of you actually

353
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:48,650
got the CH certification how many of you

354
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:49,190
got OCP osep sorry does that make it

355
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:51,290
feel better

356
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:53,000
lots of people take the class they learn

357
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:56,329
to learn that use the tools and no one

358
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:58,280
goes for our SCP no the point I think I

359
00:16:56,330 --> 00:16:59,870
was trying to make is that's what the

360
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:02,300
gatekeepers are saying that's the first

361
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:04,940
point that's that's what you hit when

362
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:06,409
you first start but but no one does that

363
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:08,090
has done that absolutely are very few

364
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:09,860
people have done that with that I'd like

365
00:17:08,089 --> 00:17:12,550
to say thank you very much wonderful

366
00:17:09,859 --> 00:17:12,550
presentation
