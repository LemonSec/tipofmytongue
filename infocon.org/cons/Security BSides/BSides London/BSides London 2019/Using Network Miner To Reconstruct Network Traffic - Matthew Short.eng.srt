1
00:00:02,929 --> 00:00:07,080
good morning and thank you everyone for

2
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:09,599
coming and I'm surprised that it says

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:12,960
beer turn out of this and quite blunt my

4
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:15,030
talk concerns and using Network minor

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,500
and to reconstruct narrow traffic to the

6
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:19,080
title but it also in Baz bit of

7
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:20,698
Wireshark and so I was first shown this

8
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:23,549
and by my cousin who works in self

9
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:25,769
security and for me it just kind of

10
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:28,369
demystified a lot of things about kind

11
00:00:25,769 --> 00:00:31,229
of how data sent over the Internet

12
00:00:28,369 --> 00:00:33,930
so I'll start off with a bit about me so

13
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:35,850
um I actually started off and I've

14
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:37,500
always been fairly technical but by the

15
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:40,260
time I reached sort of my university

16
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:42,690
choices I decided to go into and do a

17
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:44,430
degree in management marketing I

18
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:46,199
actually did work in marketing for a bit

19
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:50,460
and realized it wasn't for me and so I

20
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:51,989
now I'm back in kind of technology so I

21
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:53,489
put our usual II work in technical

22
00:00:51,989 --> 00:00:55,709
support and the company I work for

23
00:00:53,489 --> 00:00:58,828
doesn't really like me kind and it all

24
00:00:55,710 --> 00:01:00,480
like anyone putting out that who they

25
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:02,609
kind of work with when they do these

26
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,649
things but it's a it's a fairly

27
00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:06,450
prominent brand who had a big

28
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:08,310
announcement on Monday I'll say just the

29
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:10,860
kind of thing it but I'm a genius as

30
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:13,650
well so I'm and used to kind of diagnose

31
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:15,900
and helping people but to kind of

32
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:17,430
benchmark give myself a benchmark and

33
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:19,409
show you what my level of knowledge I

34
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:21,540
also took the CompTIA a security plus

35
00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:23,040
and although since realized that really

36
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:24,750
she kind of go through all sorts of

37
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,330
steps up to it I just went straight in

38
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:31,140
for security plus and just passed

39
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:32,729
luckily and so I won't go into too much

40
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:35,220
depth because I think is better at the

41
00:01:32,729 --> 00:01:36,689
end to see why this is a good demo but

42
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:38,970
and this is just a small look at how

43
00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:41,758
kind of networking I suppose in terms of

44
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:44,100
the internet networking works and for me

45
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,659
and I'll explain why afterwards it makes

46
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:53,009
it a bit more approachable for people

47
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:56,280
and so I'll go to the demo so first of

48
00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:57,930
all and we'll get a wide shot well I've

49
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:59,909
already got the wireshark capture that

50
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:03,409
one up her and prepare this I made sure

51
00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:06,659
to not need the internet at all and the

52
00:02:03,409 --> 00:02:08,970
in theory you would gone to Wireshark

53
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:12,569
and you know browse to a website and

54
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:13,350
then capture your data so and as well I

55
00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:15,359
do

56
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:17,970
qetsiyah I've used the capital my day

57
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,440
through the University of Oxford so and

58
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:23,070
there's a website out there called why

59
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:25,760
no HTTP which just lists quite prominent

60
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:28,560
websites that still don't have HTTPS

61
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:30,000
enabled on their sites so this makes

62
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,710
this demo really quick and easy because

63
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,300
you don't need to mess around with you

64
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:35,280
know kind of getting into the data

65
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:38,040
encrypting it and one of them is Oxford

66
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:41,520
University but still use just plain old

67
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:44,280
HTTP for their website so when you're in

68
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:46,020
Wireshark and if you if you ever run

69
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:47,940
this before in your hair even on your

70
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:50,760
home network you'll get masses and

71
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:52,410
masses of data and even things like

72
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:53,970
Smart TVs are popping up in there

73
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:57,380
constantly looking and pinging your

74
00:02:53,970 --> 00:03:02,310
network but for this I'm just gonna

75
00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:03,990
restrict it down to HTTP so you'll see a

76
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:06,030
little bit when I did this the only site

77
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:07,950
eyebrows towards Oxford University so it

78
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:10,080
makes it really clear but you'll see

79
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:14,190
things mentioned where it says Oxford

80
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:16,440
sights files so you will in there

81
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:17,609
somewhere see listed JPEG images but I

82
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:20,100
suppose there's a bit of a convoluted

83
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:21,570
way but this is for my demo so when

84
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:26,790
you're in Wireshark if you go to follow

85
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:29,310
and then HTTP stream at first you'll get

86
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:31,170
this kind of the cookie data and things

87
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:32,280
of get requests things like that but

88
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:35,250
we're not actually going to use this

89
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:38,750
form of the data for it and but when

90
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:41,010
you're in here you'll flip into raw and

91
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:42,630
this will give you the kind of the hex

92
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:45,030
values for all the data that's going

93
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:46,380
through so it's not really intelligible

94
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:49,590
it might be to some people but it's

95
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:51,210
certainly not to me once you're in here

96
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:53,460
all we need to do is you need to capture

97
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:56,430
this file this is all one through our

98
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:59,160
HTTP so you can go save us and save it

99
00:03:56,430 --> 00:04:00,720
it's just a plain text file so maybe bit

100
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:04,410
silly if I hadn't already prepared this

101
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:08,609
so I'm gonna just skip on again so once

102
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:12,329
we've got our text capture and this is

103
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:13,920
literally the entire file of or the flow

104
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:18,420
just from oxford university's homepage

105
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:21,000
so there's a lot of data and this is a

106
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:22,229
program called hex fiend on the Mac I'm

107
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,550
sure there's an equivalent on Windows

108
00:04:22,229 --> 00:04:24,900
but this is hex fiend so it will show

109
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:26,220
you some of the data that we saw

110
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:30,330
previously just

111
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:34,530
right there and but if we go this is a

112
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:37,530
site I've used and Gary Kessler that's

113
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:40,739
it and he has a database of like common

114
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:44,940
file signatures so I'm gonna do this

115
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:47,220
with a JPEG so with a JPEG in those hex

116
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:51,420
values a jpg file will always start with

117
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:55,470
FF d8 and always end with FF d9 so

118
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:57,840
knowing that we can go back to our file

119
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:59,130
and don't worry I'm not going to

120
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,750
actually do this because this would be

121
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:04,920
rather boring for you all but we would

122
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:06,390
search F F da and note down the value on

123
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:08,700
the left hand side that says you know

124
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:12,120
two hundred and forty seven thousand

125
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:16,979
then search F 15 9 we should take us to

126
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:19,470
the very next value or that one in that

127
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:21,419
for that image just at the end once

128
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:24,240
you've got that you can highlight it and

129
00:05:21,419 --> 00:05:27,900
extract it through and then you'll end

130
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:29,580
up with a file and 40 spores it with a

131
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:32,760
quick look but if you will end up with a

132
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:35,940
file that looks like this so this starts

133
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:40,440
with our FF d8 and will end with FF d9

134
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:41,580
so that is an entire image file but it

135
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:44,010
doesn't look like it just looks like a

136
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:48,599
text file but all you need to do is

137
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:51,330
whack on dot jpg JPEG at the end jpg and

138
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:52,770
you'll end up with your image file so

139
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:54,599
this isn't actually on the web site

140
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:58,590
anymore but if you really want it I can

141
00:05:54,600 --> 00:06:01,530
send it to you but that's just a kind of

142
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:03,690
a quick demo on how sort of easy is to

143
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:06,059
extract it but that oxygen your

144
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:09,660
University website even when I used it

145
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:13,020
had and probably a good few sort of 10

146
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:15,180
20 images it'd be a bit too laborious to

147
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:18,630
then go through and extract every time

148
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:20,070
so for the second half and there's a

149
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:21,890
tool which is actually a Windows tall

150
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:24,930
but you can run it on Mac OS with mono

151
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:27,810
called network miner so we'll just start

152
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:29,850
that up a second so this makes it a bit

153
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:31,500
easier to extract things it admittedly

154
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:35,340
image files I'm going to be the most

155
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:38,200
sensitive pieces of data you've got but

156
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:39,820
and another

157
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:42,159
to note as well with our packet capture

158
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:45,099
so Wireshark now saves them in a new

159
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:47,230
format most tools that kind of pair in

160
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:50,260
with Wireshark do them in an old style

161
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:53,860
kind of classic packet capture file dear

162
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:56,860
one happy Cap'n G so to be able to

163
00:06:53,860 --> 00:07:00,000
import it you need to search just go

164
00:06:56,860 --> 00:07:03,520
into why shark and save that file as a

165
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:08,890
pcap file and unfortunately it this

166
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:11,799
because it's a Windows file I just need

167
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:15,430
to find this a second desktop network -

168
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:17,140
oh just get my peek out there so this

169
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:21,460
will just kind of load through and I'll

170
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:23,830
expand it a bit so it does quite a bit

171
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:25,210
and you can literally go through and

172
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:27,609
it's got things like messages in there

173
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:29,530
that have come forward I'm going to skip

174
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:33,040
+ and come back to a DNS requests that

175
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:35,919
are in there so loads but for now I'm

176
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:37,900
not really interested in this images tab

177
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:40,690
you can see everything there so there is

178
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:43,299
about 20-25 images in there but they're

179
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:44,440
all quickly and easily you're more like

180
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:47,770
you can DoubleTap and it will actually

181
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:49,660
go into preview on a Mac so if you were

182
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:52,870
looking for sensitive images it's that

183
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:55,390
easy come straight down so that that is

184
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:59,440
really the kind of the demo of the

185
00:07:55,390 --> 00:08:02,050
technology but the reasons why I kind of

186
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:05,500
want to show that as I say so when my

187
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:07,840
cousin first showed me that demo it's

188
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:12,460
kind of for me demystifying on how

189
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:14,440
things work so for an outsider person

190
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:16,270
not in technology so I would have met

191
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:18,670
every day my job involves me talking to

192
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:20,440
people who will usually say things like

193
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:23,650
oh I'm not very good with technologies

194
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:25,180
the usual line for me that shows you the

195
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:27,549
instead of it almost being sort of

196
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:30,160
there's a physical fire though it's just

197
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:32,470
some sort of magic coming through the

198
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:34,120
internet than a phone line it's much

199
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:36,400
easier to see that actually it's just a

200
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:39,250
list of instructions most things with

201
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:40,990
networking with any form of computing is

202
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:43,570
just a list of instructions and it makes

203
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:46,090
it a lot simpler and easier for people

204
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:47,440
to understand I can't count the amount

205
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:51,100
of times I have people that come in with

206
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:52,810
things like snapchat crashing or really

207
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:54,519
basic things like that I even had

208
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:57,008
someone where they taken a screenshot of

209
00:08:54,519 --> 00:08:59,230
their home screen set it as their

210
00:08:57,009 --> 00:09:01,060
wallpaper and then come in and so it

211
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:02,410
looks like there were two times on top

212
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:04,630
of each other and they asked to have

213
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:07,360
their phone replaced for that because

214
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:09,519
you don't know why it's doing it for all

215
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:12,839
you know it's just there's a problem

216
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:15,399
with my phone my computer my whatever

217
00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:17,139
you don't know what's going on so you

218
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:19,089
just think it just needs replace and and

219
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:21,790
I would do that with things like my car

220
00:09:19,089 --> 00:09:22,899
not very kind of I'm not a car person I

221
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:25,569
would rather to get it swapped every

222
00:09:22,899 --> 00:09:27,190
time so it just really makes it simpler

223
00:09:25,569 --> 00:09:29,290
for people to understand so it's just

224
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:30,819
it's a great short little demo I mean

225
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:33,339
it's only taking you sort of 10 minutes

226
00:09:30,819 --> 00:09:37,180
there to show you and hopefully you've

227
00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:38,920
understood anyway and it's just a really

228
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:43,508
quick way to kind of build understanding

229
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:56,560
and show people on that so mmm excuse me

230
00:09:43,509 --> 00:09:58,750
sir any questions well I think I used

231
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:00,459
homebrew oh and if you don't know what

232
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:03,819
home brewers it's like a package manager

233
00:10:00,459 --> 00:10:07,060
on a Mac so instead of if you want to

234
00:10:03,819 --> 00:10:08,740
download something like mono homebrew or

235
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:10,479
fetch everything else it needs as well

236
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:13,060
instead of you having to fetch like ten

237
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:15,130
facets to get one thing working so just

238
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:18,219
literally use got mono with that and

239
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:20,740
then got the executable Network minor

240
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:22,300
file and it worked and the version I'm

241
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:24,279
using just the free version they did

242
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:25,508
like a probably Community Edition I

243
00:10:24,279 --> 00:10:27,279
might record or something and there's a

244
00:10:25,509 --> 00:10:29,620
premium version which does a lot more

245
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:33,100
and that probably the more kind of juicy

246
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:43,810
stuff that for me experiment in the free

247
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:45,540
version is good enough anywhere else now

248
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:48,849
hopefully that entertained enough and

249
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:51,300
got off to a good start and thank you

250
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:51,300
all for coming again

251
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:53,489
you
