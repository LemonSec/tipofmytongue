5
00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:20,009
don't have a keynote today because we

6
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:22,050
had a lot of great content so we decided

7
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:24,869
to focus on having three tracks start

8
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:27,840

9

00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:58,860
breadboard and you can build things with

42
00:01:55,770 --> 00:02:01,020
it with we are probably going to launch

43
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:03,140
a competition with the best build we'll

44
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:07,929

45
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:07,930

46
00:02:08,258 --> 00:02:19,519
what's on so we have three presentation

47
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:21,140

48
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,840
have a rookie track and we have

49
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:26,059
something new this year so up second

50
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:28,820
floor we have a room called the

51
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:30,790
chill-out room and I'd like to introduce

52
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:33,769
Tom who's running the chill-out room

53
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:38,359
from memset and he will explain a little

54
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:41,209
bit what the concept is Heil

55
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:44,510
so conferences are pretty high-intensity

56
00:02:41,209 --> 00:02:48,370
environments if you're not necessarily

57
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:51,649
feeling at your best they can be quite

58
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:53,540
high pressure places quite a couple the

59
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:55,340
chill-out room is upstairs floor to I

60
