1
00:00:00,439 --> 00:00:08,400
all right can everybody hear me in the

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:10,349
back so my<font color="#CCCCCC"> name is George I'm here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:13,019
talk to you about Wi-Fi pissing attacks

4
00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:15,780
and then I'll produce you a tool of mine

5
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:21,359
I wrote some months ago called Wi-Fi

6
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:23,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">Fitzer so some things about me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I work as</font>

11
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:34,379
have also<font color="#E5E5E5"> done some academic research</font>

12
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:36,780
mostly designing privacy enabling and

00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:38,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">anonymity providing protocols and then</font>

14
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:42,660
the lead<font color="#E5E5E5"> author of the tool i'm planning</font>

15
00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:45,360
to present to<font color="#CCCCCC"> you today so okay here's</font>

16
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:48,620
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> agenda we'll start with some boring</font>

17
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:53,820
stuff that we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to cover I triple-a</font>

18
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:56,699
ho2 dot11 specification and will then

19
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:59,550
see the excuse of a specification will

20
00:00:56,699 --> 00:01:01,289
later discuss about issues that exist in

21
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:05,309
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> operating system specifically in</font>

22
00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:07,350
network managers so then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll be able to</font>

23
00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:09,420
explain to you<font color="#E5E5E5"> evil tunic armed attacks</font>

24
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:13,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">two very popular attacks in Wi-Fi</font>

25
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:16,229
networks after that we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about</font>

26
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:18,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">Wi-Fi tree sir how it worked and finally</font>

27
00:01:16,229 --> 00:01:21,479
we'll talk about countermeasures against

28
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:23,369
Wi-Fi feature and of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> evil tunic</font>

29
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:29,009
armed attacks in general and then we'll

30
00:01:23,369 --> 00:01:31,408
<font color="#E5E5E5">have our Q&A so wireless communication</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

31
00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:34,229
guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> most of you may be connected to a</font>

32
00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:36,210
Wi-Fi network right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now there's a rapid</font>

33
00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:38,280
growth<font color="#E5E5E5"> in recent years people can access</font>

34
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:42,020
the internet<font color="#E5E5E5"> anywhere I mean even in</font>

35
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:44,630
planes or trains or almost anywhere<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

36
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:46,740
anytime and here's a funny<font color="#CCCCCC"> fuck</font>

37
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:48,449
seventy-five percent of americans said

38
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:51,949
that a week without y5 would leave them

39
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:55,490
grumpier than a week without coffee and

40
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:58,049
so you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> see there is an addiction to</font>

41
00:01:55,490 --> 00:02:02,759
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet hence there is an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> addiction</font>

42
00:01:58,049 --> 00:02:07,770
to Wi-Fi network to Wi-Fi so yes it's a

43
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:11,280
big deal<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok the boring stuff i triple e</font>

44
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:12,780
h 0 2 dot 11 this is the specification

45
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,710
for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> wireless LAN communication that</font>

46
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:16,440
means that

47
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:18,540
all the rules<font color="#E5E5E5"> that happen between your</font>

48
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:21,690
mobile device whenever you connect to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

49
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:24,450
nexus point all these<font color="#E5E5E5"> rules are defined</font>

50
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:27,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">by the specification there are two basic</font>

51
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:29,100
entities first one is the station<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

52
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:32,790
could be your mobile device for example

53
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:37,609
or whatever has a wireless<font color="#E5E5E5"> card and act</font>

54
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:41,190
as a client your laptop for example and

55
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:43,470
the other entity is the access<font color="#E5E5E5"> point the</font>

56
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:47,750
access point is for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

57
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:50,220
wireless repair back in your home and

58
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:52,680
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> access point is identified by a</font>

59
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:56,100
service set identifier also known as

60
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:58,680
essid<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess that most of you have</font>

61
00:02:56,100 --> 00:03:01,350
already set up a wireless network for

62
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:03,920
your home so you know what an SSID is is

63
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:09,690
the actual<font color="#CCCCCC"> name for the wireless</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> network</font>

64
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:12,299
so that's easy let's talk about the

65
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:15,810
management frames the management frames

66
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:18,290
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> the messages</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that enabled stations</font>

67
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:23,490
to establish and maintain communication

68
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:25,140
with an access point so management

69
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:28,620
frames is all the communication that

70
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:31,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">happens whenever our device wants to</font>

71
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:32,970
connect the nexus point our device will

72
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:34,079
<font color="#CCCCCC">be like hey exponent I want to connect</font>

73
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:37,560
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> you and the exponent will be like</font>

74
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:43,410
oh<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok feel free to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> join my Wi-Fi</font>

75
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:46,680
services so there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are two very common</font>

76
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:48,780
management frames bacon frames and probe

77
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:50,010
request screams the beacon frames are

78
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:52,380
transmitted by the access point to

79
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:53,910
announce presents that means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that if I</font>

80
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:58,230
set up an access point the access point

81
00:03:53,910 --> 00:04:01,170
without to everyone around it and we'll

82
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:04,739
say hello everyone I am access point

83
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:08,970
with essid mumble or whatever feel free

84
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:12,150
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> join me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok the probe request frames</font>

85
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:14,310
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the other</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hand</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are transmitted by the</font>

86
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:17,970
station<font color="#CCCCCC"> for example your mobile device</font>

87
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:20,100
and it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> asking information from a</font>

88
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:21,960
specific access point so it's like<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

89
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:26,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">mobile device shouting in the air</font>

90
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:27,530
because like love is in the air<font color="#E5E5E5"> Wi-Fi is</font>

91
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:31,130
also in VA

92
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:36,409
they're so young well device will shout

93
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:39,290
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the air hey maybe the Wi-Fi with</font>

94
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:40,790
essid mumbles around if so<font color="#CCCCCC"> please give</font>

95
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:43,490
me some information for example

96
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:46,070
transmission rates or encryption and

97
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:50,060
stuff like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we have these two</font>

98
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:51,860
ways to establish communication become

99
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:53,570
frames and publicize frames and the

100
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:55,250
network card would send a probe request

101
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:57,010
to determine which access points are

102
00:04:55,250 --> 00:05:00,340
within<font color="#CCCCCC"> raise it will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ask hey maybe</font>

103
00:04:57,010 --> 00:05:04,580
access point mumble is there for example

104
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:08,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay let's go to the more interesting</font>

105
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:10,310
part the issues that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have here you</font>

106
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:12,979
see we only had a couple of slides about

107
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:16,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">I Tripoli ho2 the 11 specification but</font>

108
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:18,200
we can already see some issues there is

109
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:19,790
no real clarification on the case where

110
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:24,349
multiple available access points are

111
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:27,050
around with the same SSID<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok that means</font>

112
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:29,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now there is a Wi-Fi network</font>

113
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:32,180
called security besides something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

114
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:36,410
that in the air what will happen<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

115
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:39,680
set up a network a wireless network with

116
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:43,070
the exact<font color="#E5E5E5"> same SSID what will happen the</font>

117
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:47,150
specification doesn't tell us what how

118
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:49,190
the station's need to deal with<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

119
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:52,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's up to the software developers to</font>

120
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:54,289
decide and make a solution for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this what</font>

121
00:05:52,039 --> 00:05:56,690
most clients do what most software do it

122
00:05:54,289 --> 00:05:59,300
does is they choose the lattice point

123
00:05:56,690 --> 00:06:02,890
with the best signal that's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> the best</font>

124
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:06,740
solution though because let's say that I

125
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:09,919
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> mess with my network back in</font>

126
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:14,360
Greece<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok so what i can do is i can</font>

127
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:16,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">create a fake access point ok with the</font>

128
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:19,130
same essid and same encryption type as

129
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:21,590
my network and let's say<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

130
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:25,820
stronger antenna have a very strong

131
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:28,489
signal so whenever<font color="#E5E5E5"> my neighbor wants to</font>

132
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:30,110
connect to his Wi-Fi network he will

133
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:31,940
connect to mine instead he will try to

134
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:34,820
connect to mind if he has protection

135
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:37,010
with his Wi-Fi network he will fail<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok</font>

136
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:38,630
of course you will fail but<font color="#E5E5E5"> still he</font>

137
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:40,469
will be annoyed because his device will

138
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:45,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">be trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to connect to mine</font>

139
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:48,810
Wi-Fi network instead so yes that's the

140
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:50,700
first issue another<font color="#E5E5E5"> issue we talked</font>

141
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:52,140
about management frames that are the

142
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:54,060
messages for establishing a

143
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:56,909
communication the thing is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

144
00:06:54,060 --> 00:07:01,590

the air and this is being sent when all

178
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:33,810

179
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:36,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">the way for a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mobile device to say to an</font>

219
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:31,620
the network manager built with that<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

220

essid probing modern operating systems

I mean let's say one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of you here was</font>

inside the rainy island in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Greece and he</font>

235
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:28,770
suddenly two years ago so another

236
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:31,400

248
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:04,140
leak this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a serious information leak</font>

249
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:06,779
if you care about privacy you don't want

your device to broadcasting this stuff

251
00:12:06,779 --> 00:12:10,800
and of course because this is prob

252
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,790
request frame this is an encrypted this

253
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:17,010
is a management flame this is

254
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:19,770
unencrypted another thing so it's not

00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:32,130
encounters a network with that the

258

will connect to<font color="#E5E5E5"> it without any warning</font>

260
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:37,740
for example to the previous example with

00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:41,100
this adoringly if<font color="#E5E5E5"> i set up a wireless</font>

00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:57,930
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the usual message box connected</font>

267
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:59,430
to that Wi-Fi network but he may<font color="#CCCCCC"> not see</font>

268
00:12:57,930 --> 00:13:03,890
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> because she has a Wi-Fi feature on</font>

00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:07,979
but left his his device in<font color="#CCCCCC"> his pocket so</font>

270
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:10,830
he may<font color="#CCCCCC"> not realize it at all and this</font>

271
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:12,900
flag the auto connect flood is enabled

272
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:15,260

so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a typical usability very</font>

275
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:29,120
security case we<font color="#CCCCCC"> all know that usability</font>

276
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:30,380
and security can go good together so you

277
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:36,230
see that network managers prefer

278
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:38,990
usability over security now I can

279
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:41,540
explain the guillotine attack even seen

that's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> German think that we</font>

00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:58,760
explained earlier so we will just kick

288
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:04,089
specific when we are doing eventine

289
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:08,360
attack we are targeting a specific

290
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:11,900
network so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we start by crafting the</font>

291
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:17,180
authenticated packets and kicking people

292
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:21,709
out of the network the<font color="#E5E5E5"> second process</font>

293
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:27,829
will create a fake access point with the

294
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:32,030
same SSID as the one we target what will

295
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:33,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">happen people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> will get the authenticated</font>

296
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:36,380
will we get kicked<font color="#E5E5E5"> out from their</font>

297
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:38,180
network and they will connect to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

298
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:40,060
fake access point it depends we'll see

299
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:44,270
we'll see depends on many things but

300
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:46,339
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the main idea to have our for the</font>

301
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:50,510
attacker to have the victims connected

302
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:53,420
to his<font color="#E5E5E5"> network here is an image of the</font>

303
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:56,390
attack the attacker is bottom left here

304
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:57,920
so you see<font color="#E5E5E5"> he's the authenticating the</font>

305
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:59,960
victim he's telling the access point

306
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:01,430
they authenticate the victim<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok for this</font>

307
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:03,230
to be entirely correct we are also

308
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:05,000
sending as we explained earlier we are

309
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:07,190
also sending and they authenticated

310
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,500
message to the victim by the access

311
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:13,610
point but we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> not showing that here</font>

312
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:19,370
but we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing this and we are</font>

313
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:22,850
creating a fake access point with the

314
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:26,650
same SSID as the targets access point so

315
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:28,780
the victim will connect to us after he

316
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:34,650
it gets hit that for

317
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:38,470
here from the from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> lady network okay</font>

318
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:42,930
how this attack works against<font color="#E5E5E5"> open</font>

319
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:46,180
networks if I perform this attack

320
00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:48,209
against<font color="#E5E5E5"> an open network all clients will</font>

321
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:51,790
just connect to the fake access point

322
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:53,380
simple as that if I perform this attack

323
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:55,660
everyone<font color="#CCCCCC"> gilead will get disconnected</font>

324
00:15:53,380 --> 00:16:01,510
from the legit network and will connect

325
00:15:55,660 --> 00:16:03,520
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> my fav one so someone might say yeah</font>

326
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:05,710
what's the big deal why would I want to

327
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:08,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">target an open network it is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a big deal</font>

328
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:10,810
because there are open networks that

329
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:13,479
work<font color="#E5E5E5"> using captive port port</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Al's</font>

330
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:16,359
captive portal do you know what that

331
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:18,640
portal is open up<font color="#E5E5E5"> the portal is whatever</font>

332
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:21,220
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> are in the airport for example or in</font>

333
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:24,420
a hotel when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you connect to a free Wi-Fi</font>

334
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:28,060
network to an open network<font color="#E5E5E5"> Cherie and</font>

335
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:30,670
then you are you are displaying you are

336
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:33,459
getting displayed by an HTML page a web

337
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:37,780
page that you need to type credentials

338
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:41,950
for example so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a very typical</font>

339
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:44,770
case against Coptic portals what will

340
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:49,300
happen<font color="#CCCCCC"> if we use evil twin against an</font>

341
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:52,390
encrypted<font color="#CCCCCC"> network you see we can the</font>

342
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:55,329
attacker cannot create an encrypted

343
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:56,530
network as well the evil twin cannot be

344
00:16:55,330 --> 00:16:59,350
encrypted as well because the attacker

345
00:16:56,530 --> 00:17:03,790
doesn't know the pre-shared key doesn't

346
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:06,510
know the password so what the attack you

347
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:11,859
can do is create an open network instead

348
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:13,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> he creates a an encrypted</font>

349
00:17:11,859 --> 00:17:16,119
<font color="#CCCCCC">network what will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> happen is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

350
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:17,620
victim will get be authenticated it will

351
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:19,869
try to connect with a fake one<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it</font>

352
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:23,290
will fail<font color="#CCCCCC"> because the pre-shared key</font>

353
00:17:19,869 --> 00:17:24,969
password will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> different so the</font>

354
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:27,550
attacker will create an open network

355
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:28,810
instead the device is most devices

356
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:30,790
though we know the<font color="#E5E5E5"> difference in the</font>

357
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:33,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">Christian and will not connect</font>

358
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:36,730
automatically do it what will<font color="#E5E5E5"> happen</font>

359
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:38,890
ubuntu for example<font color="#CCCCCC"> you will have to</font>

360
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:41,560
manually select it you will get be

361
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:42,430
authenticated this is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> original</font>

362
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:46,389
access point called

363
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:49,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">side you will get the authenticated from</font>

364
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:52,840
this one and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you will see that exists</font>

365
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:54,670
another one called besides and it is

366
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:57,840
open and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> victim will have to</font>

367
00:17:54,670 --> 00:18:00,420
manually connect to<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the open network</font>

368
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:02,889
the victim will do that as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

369
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:04,690
he's getting the authenticated and he

370
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:07,240
will do everything to gear to help this

371
00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:09,700
internet connection back so victims

372
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:13,390
without no leads without ID no let's

373
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:15,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">we'll do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that as well so this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

374
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:17,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">Android behavior it's the same its exact</font>

375
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:18,550
exactly the same it requires a manual

376
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:20,980
connection to the unencrypted network

377
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:24,430
you see this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> original access</font>

378
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:28,450
point<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> David to in here so</font>

379
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:31,410
the victim again<font color="#E5E5E5"> will keep getting the</font>

380
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:34,570
authenticated but<font color="#CCCCCC"> you imagine he's</font>

381
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:36,010
playing<font color="#CCCCCC"> counter-strike or a starcraft</font>

382
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:37,149
game and he's getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> the authenticated</font>

383
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:38,440
all the time he's getting annoyed he

384
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:40,450
really wants to connect to Facebook for

385
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:42,990
example so yes he will connect<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

386
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:48,340
open Wi-Fi and do everything there to

387
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:51,280
get they didn't bug so what windows with

388
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:53,280
you windows will connect after providing

389
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:59,490
a warning that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network has changed</font>

390
00:18:53,280 --> 00:19:03,970
so yes windows behavior is the worst<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

391
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:08,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay that was able to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in attack now we</font>

392
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:09,610
can talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about karma</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talk in karma</font>

393
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:13,120
attack the first step is exactly the

394
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:14,830
same<font color="#CCCCCC"> as they were</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing we are keep</font>

395
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:17,949
crafting the authenticated packets and

396
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:22,480
kicking out everyone from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> target</font>

397
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:25,660
access point but<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> time we also</font>

398
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:28,360
create a fake access point but<font color="#CCCCCC"> this time</font>

399
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:30,820
this fake access point won't be modeled

400
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:32,770
by the target but it will based on the

401
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:34,990
probe request frames reminded probe

402
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:37,990
request frames are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the messages that the</font>

403
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:40,620
device is sending asking about previous

404
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:43,620
networks that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it has been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> connected to</font>

405
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:43,620
so

406
00:19:44,519 --> 00:19:50,369
when an attacker performs a<font color="#CCCCCC"> karma that</font>

407
00:19:47,419 --> 00:19:54,539
he will keep listening for probe request

408
00:19:50,369 --> 00:19:57,629
frames when the attacker found a probe

409
00:19:54,539 --> 00:20:00,570
request frames frame that is intended

410
00:19:57,629 --> 00:20:03,869
<font color="#CCCCCC">for an open network he will create that</font>

411
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:06,269
open network<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then they authenticate</font>

412
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:09,269
the victim so what will happen<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

413
00:20:06,269 --> 00:20:13,229
victim will<font color="#CCCCCC"> auto reconnect to the open</font>

414
00:20:09,269 --> 00:20:15,779
network in for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> what what will</font>

415
00:20:13,229 --> 00:20:18,119
the victim see in his device he will see

416
00:20:15,779 --> 00:20:20,159
a they<font color="#E5E5E5"> authenticate it from besides for</font>

417
00:20:18,119 --> 00:20:21,899
example network and then connected to

418
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:24,269
sand or any wrestler on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Wi-Fi</font>

419
00:20:21,899 --> 00:20:26,339
network but he may not<font color="#E5E5E5"> see anything</font>

420
00:20:24,269 --> 00:20:28,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">because he</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> may have left his device</font>

421
00:20:26,339 --> 00:20:34,079
somewhere else and he's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> taking it at</font>

422
00:20:28,679 --> 00:20:36,989
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> moment so victims were lottery</font>

423
00:20:34,079 --> 00:20:41,219
connect without warning in every device

424
00:20:36,989 --> 00:20:43,229
this happens in every device and but but

425
00:20:41,219 --> 00:20:46,049
this attack is effective only the victim

426
00:20:43,229 --> 00:20:47,579
has stored open networks if the victim

427
00:20:46,049 --> 00:20:56,908
has not connect<font color="#E5E5E5"> to an open network at</font>

428
00:20:47,579 --> 00:21:03,119
all this<font color="#E5E5E5"> attack will fail</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay now we</font>

429
00:20:56,909 --> 00:21:06,989
talked about these two let's see which

430
00:21:03,119 --> 00:21:10,769
one is better it really depends<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the</font>

431
00:21:06,989 --> 00:21:14,099
target if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have to do with open</font>

432
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:18,559
networks with no encryption then the

433
00:21:14,099 --> 00:21:20,779
attacker should use evil<font color="#CCCCCC"> to in attack</font>

434
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:24,629
because the victims will<font color="#E5E5E5"> all reconnect</font>

435
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:28,529
to the evil twin but if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are talking</font>

436
00:21:24,629 --> 00:21:31,978
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> individuals that are connected to</font>

437
00:21:28,529 --> 00:21:35,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">a protected Network karma is probably</font>

438
00:21:31,979 --> 00:21:36,599
better only if<font color="#E5E5E5"> they have stored up a</font>

439
00:21:35,339 --> 00:21:41,369
networks because they might have not

440
00:21:36,599 --> 00:21:43,979
opened stored open networks okay we can

441
00:21:41,369 --> 00:21:47,699
use both<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the same</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time but this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> may</font>

442
00:21:43,979 --> 00:21:50,219
raise suspicion for example it's

443
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:52,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">different to see your device getting the</font>

444
00:21:50,219 --> 00:21:56,279
authenticated and then connected to the

445
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:57,869
same network the victim will probably

446
00:21:56,279 --> 00:21:58,220
say<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay probably the access point we</font>

447
00:21:57,869 --> 00:22:00,889
start

448
00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:03,140
or something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that but it is</font>

449
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:04,490
different if he sees be authenticated

450
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:06,470
from the current network but

451
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:08,750
authenticated to a previous network that

452
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:13,010
he has connected<font color="#CCCCCC"> to in the past this</font>

453
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:15,350
will registration so against open

454
00:22:13,010 --> 00:22:19,190
network it's better for the attack yet

455
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:21,168
produced a built-in attack and another

456
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:23,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">thing is that someone might use</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> karma</font>

457
00:22:21,169 --> 00:22:26,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">for an individual and then if karma</font>

458
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:27,860
fails because the victim<font color="#E5E5E5"> has not</font>

459
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:33,980
connected<font color="#E5E5E5"> to an open network in the past</font>

460
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:36,740
then he can use in between<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay both of</font>

461
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:42,590
these<font color="#CCCCCC"> attacks aimed the attack yet</font>

462
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:44,059
blood-c among the<font color="#E5E5E5"> middle position money</font>

463
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:45,678
the middle position means that the

464
00:22:44,059 --> 00:22:49,820
attacker is in the middle of the

465
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:52,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">communication and there are a lot of</font>

466
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:54,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">things that the attacker can can do from</font>

467
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:56,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">here for example he can do data sniffing</font>

468
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:58,820
he can sniff for sensitive information

469
00:22:56,150 --> 00:23:03,200
like passwords or credit card numbers

470
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:07,010
and stuff like that he can he can also

471
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:08,510
modify this data he's connected the

472
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:11,110
victim is connected to his<font color="#CCCCCC"> network so he</font>

473
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:14,600
can infect the victims with<font color="#CCCCCC"> mal wars and</font>

474
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:17,689
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last one is the facing part he can</font>

475
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:22,039
present fake pages and that's the user

476
00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:25,900
to provide credentials and stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

477
00:23:22,039 --> 00:23:29,480
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the last one so that's why I</font>

478
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:32,630
created<font color="#E5E5E5"> Wi-Fi feature Wi-Fi feature</font>

479
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:36,799
automates the process of<font color="#CCCCCC"> evil queen for</font>

480
00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:42,799
now only between and also perform a

481
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:47,710
phishing attack afterwards so Wi-Fi sir

482
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:52,850
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> released the tool on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> January and it</font>

483
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:56,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">took a lot of attraction I mean exactly</font>

484
00:23:52,850 --> 00:24:00,100
yesterday it it has a daily number of<font color="#E5E5E5"> 60</font>

485
00:23:56,150 --> 00:24:02,510
clones on github if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I remember</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> correctly</font>

486
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:04,449
what I really like about this attack is

487
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:06,830
that it<font color="#CCCCCC"> requires no internet connection</font>

488
00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:08,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">you require no internet connection you</font>

489
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:11,689
don't have to be connected to the

490
00:24:08,419 --> 00:24:13,370
victims network and you can still

491
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:17,480
get money in the middle and get

492
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:19,729
credentials of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course it works on kali</font>

493
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:24,100
linux there are people who have made<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

494
00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:26,269
work on ubuntu and debian based systems

495
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:30,439
it requires<font color="#E5E5E5"> two wireless network</font>

496
00:24:26,269 --> 00:24:32,600
adapters the one network adapter will be

497
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:34,250
responsible for the jamming part for the

498
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:40,158
authenticating the users and the other

499
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:43,759
one will be<font color="#CCCCCC"> for creating wavy twin there</font>

500
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:46,340
are a lot of there are a lot of network

501
00:24:43,759 --> 00:24:49,100
adapters that work better for injection

502
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:51,289
I think alpha cards are better for the

503
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:53,120
authenticating pixels but of course<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

504
00:24:51,289 --> 00:24:56,570
stronger the signal the better the

505
00:24:53,120 --> 00:25:01,459
attack this is how the two looks like

506
00:24:56,570 --> 00:25:03,950
and you see there are three sections the

507
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:06,919
first<font color="#CCCCCC"> one is about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the jamming the first</font>

508
00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:10,129
process<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can see that we are</font>

509
00:25:06,919 --> 00:25:15,320
targeting a network called with essid

510
00:25:10,129 --> 00:25:19,610
air son that is on channel 9 and you see

511
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:20,990
pairs of mac addresses that means this

512
00:25:19,610 --> 00:25:22,459
is the communication<font color="#E5E5E5"> between the access</font>

513
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:25,580
point that is this is the mac address of

514
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:29,570
X point and a<font color="#CCCCCC"> client I can be a mobile</font>

515
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:32,059
device whatever so we're the

516
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:35,120
authenticating the access point<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

517
00:25:32,059 --> 00:25:37,539
these two devices and that means that

518
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:40,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're also trying to get indicated</font>

519
00:25:37,539 --> 00:25:44,509
sending the<font color="#CCCCCC"> f dedicated french to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

520
00:25:40,279 --> 00:25:45,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">broadcast address as well so this is the</font>

521
00:25:44,509 --> 00:25:47,210
first section about the jamming the

522
00:25:45,799 --> 00:25:49,580
second section<font color="#E5E5E5"> is about getting the</font>

523
00:25:47,210 --> 00:25:54,440
leases Wi-Fi feature will employ a dhcp

524
00:25:49,580 --> 00:26:00,080
server this is necessarily the necessary

525
00:25:54,440 --> 00:26:03,799
for the when we have our fake between

526
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:06,289
network up we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to provide IP</font>

527
00:26:03,799 --> 00:26:08,658
addresses so we need a dhcp server so

528
00:26:06,289 --> 00:26:13,309
that row here that enter here means that

529
00:26:08,659 --> 00:26:15,649
someone connected<font color="#CCCCCC"> to our fake network he</font>

530
00:26:13,309 --> 00:26:20,240
got that address that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> host name so</font>

531
00:26:15,649 --> 00:26:23,268
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's probably an Android device and the</font>

532
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:24,070
final section is about the HTTP requests

533
00:26:23,269 --> 00:26:27,400
that are happening

534
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:33,040
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> Wi-Fi visit will also employ an HTTP</font>

535
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:36,040
server so it can present to the victim

536
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:39,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">the fake pages the facing pages so that</font>

537
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:42,820
means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the victim got offered a</font>

538
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:44,860
phishing page a get request and the

539
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:47,980
second one one means that the victim got

540
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:50,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">tricked and provided credentials and</font>

541
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:56,140
send<font color="#CCCCCC"> credentials center post request to</font>

542
00:26:50,170 --> 00:26:58,720
the to us<font color="#E5E5E5"> go to that idea</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay in this</font>

543
00:26:56,140 --> 00:27:01,630
specific example Wi-Fi<font color="#E5E5E5"> Fisher was able</font>

544
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:04,150
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> obtain a wpa password it used that</font>

545
00:27:01,630 --> 00:27:07,150
template for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Rooter configuration</font>

546
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:11,500
that will that will see shortly and go

547
00:27:07,150 --> 00:27:13,000
to the wpa password so Wi-Fi Fisher

548
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:14,830
comes with a set of<font color="#CCCCCC"> community built</font>

549
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,150
templates for various scenarios what

550
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:17,889
made<font color="#E5E5E5"> me happy when I release the tool</font>

551
00:27:16,150 --> 00:27:20,830
was the fact that a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of people came</font>

552
00:27:17,890 --> 00:27:22,990
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> and was like hey I want why don't you</font>

553
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:27,040
use this template of mine I just wrote

554
00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:31,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">you and so we have we have the list of</font>

555
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:34,720
the blades and more to<font color="#CCCCCC"> come and the</font>

556
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:37,330
templates differ for the scenario we

557
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:39,610
want to want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to provide so there are the</font>

558
00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:42,070
rotor configuration pages that actually

559
00:27:39,610 --> 00:27:48,010
fake a few more operate and this is for

560
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:49,540
obtaining<font color="#CCCCCC"> wpa or wpa2 passwords there</font>

561
00:27:48,010 --> 00:27:52,240
are the<font color="#E5E5E5"> third-party login pages for</font>

562
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:55,300
example similar to facebook or twitter

563
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:58,390
linkedin or whatever and they're the

564
00:27:55,300 --> 00:28:01,480
captive portals of course that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm being</font>

565
00:27:58,390 --> 00:28:03,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">used by hotels or airports so whenever</font>

566
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:08,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">you run Wi-Fi feature you can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> select</font>

567
00:28:03,570 --> 00:28:14,050
what scenario you are running and which

568
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:16,540
template you may use so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is an</font>

569
00:28:14,050 --> 00:28:18,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">example of rotor facing page this is the</font>

to provide his wpa password in order to

572
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:28,110
perform a few more operate

573
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:36,759
okay we can't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really use the actual</font>

574
00:28:33,659 --> 00:28:40,149
facing pages for example I could I could

576
00:28:40,149 --> 00:28:45,879
we can do that due<font color="#E5E5E5"> to copyright reasons</font>

577
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:47,919
so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> try</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to provide our own cast on</font>

578
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:52,450
brutal facing pages that look as similar

579
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:56,350
as similar as possible so another nice

580
00:28:52,450 --> 00:28:58,509
feature is the fact that we can be

581
00:28:56,350 --> 00:28:59,860

585
00:29:03,759 --> 00:29:11,620
up here so big on frames because big on

588
00:29:13,090 --> 00:29:19,230

589
00:29:16,649 --> 00:29:21,189
this is a management frame so it's not

590
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:23,860
crippled graphically protective so we

591
00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:25,539
can grab this methods and we can then

Python 2 dot<font color="#E5E5E5"> 7 it makes use of host of</font>

the DNS mask for creating the fake evil

<font color="#CCCCCC">utilities like IP tables for port</font>

custom web server using simple HTTP

630
00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:23,860

lot of cool scripts<font color="#CCCCCC"> Python scripts it's</font>

635
00:31:32,650 --> 00:31:36,370
a very big deal that we have our own

636
00:31:33,730 --> 00:31:38,710
custom German method because the other

637
00:31:36,370 --> 00:31:42,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">option would be to use aircrack ng but</font>

638
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:45,330
aircrack is a big dependency and that

639
00:31:42,430 --> 00:31:49,680
would make a mess for<font color="#CCCCCC"> us to make it work</font>

640
00:31:45,330 --> 00:31:49,679
in operating systems other than panda

641
00:31:49,890 --> 00:31:59,260
future work right now Wi-Fi feature has

642
00:31:56,010 --> 00:32:02,920
Evil Queen attack but we want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:04,690
implement karma<font color="#CCCCCC"> Takas wouldn't another</font>

644
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:05,890
cool<font color="#E5E5E5"> feature would be to check if the</font>

645
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:08,410
captured credentials are valid for

646
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:10,990
example if<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to obtain a wpa</font>

647

correct<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will stop the attack right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now</font>

650
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:18,939
the attack stops whenever the user

00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:22,480
provides credentials and this

652
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:25,200
credentials may be wrong and of course

653
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:28,960
provide more phishing pages for

654
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:32,500
different scenarios so Wi-Fi<font color="#E5E5E5"> feature is</font>

what's the ml or she says you can help

663
00:32:52,090 --> 00:32:55,600
us design facing pages if you do know

670
00:33:10,390 --> 00:33:14,140
I didn't know the existence of this tool

671
00:33:12,039 --> 00:33:16,240
when I<font color="#E5E5E5"> started writing Wi-Fi feature the</font>

672
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:20,110
reason is that this tool is written in

673
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:23,830
Spanish and all they release notes all

674
00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:27,010
the comments are in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Spanish and actually</font>

no one even know no one no one it's not

00:33:27,010 --> 00:33:33,789
promoted enough so it's not well known

686
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:07,629
and there are plugins called infusions

687
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:12,780
that you can customize your attack and

688
00:34:07,630 --> 00:34:12,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">make it more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like evil chain for example</font>

689
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:17,520
now what<font color="#E5E5E5"> can we do to protect ourselves</font>

690
00:34:18,750 --> 00:34:23,429
wireless intrusion detection and

691
00:34:20,739 --> 00:34:23,428
privation systems

692
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:30,379
what what an organization has to do is

693
00:34:27,590 --> 00:34:32,540
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> put sensors everywhere in the area</font>

694
00:34:30,379 --> 00:34:34,730
and this sensors will scan all the

695
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:38,050
spectrum and send the data to the server

696
00:34:34,730 --> 00:34:40,730
for analysis<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the server will then</font>

697
00:34:38,050 --> 00:34:43,280
the server will be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to determine if</font>

698
00:34:40,730 --> 00:34:46,129
an attack is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on or not he will do</font>

699
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:47,570
that by comparing the MAC addresses you

700
00:34:46,129 --> 00:34:50,690
see yes an attacker can spoof the mac

701
00:34:47,570 --> 00:34:53,090
address but this is not this is not a

702
00:34:50,690 --> 00:34:56,750
choice for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the attacker because if the</font>

703
00:34:53,090 --> 00:34:59,050
attacker spoofs his mark address to the

704
00:34:56,750 --> 00:35:01,220
same one as the victims then whenever

705
00:34:59,050 --> 00:35:03,770
the attacker tries to be authenticated

706
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:09,049
users he will get<font color="#E5E5E5"> dedicated himself as</font>

707
00:35:03,770 --> 00:35:10,940
well so yes most common detection

708
00:35:09,050 --> 00:35:15,410
information systems in wireless are

709
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:17,260
doing a mac address comparison and of

710
00:35:15,410 --> 00:35:21,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">course then the system will provide</font>

711
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:27,380
specific information to the edge potion

712
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:31,190
will<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff another thing is the ho2</font>

713
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:35,600
dot1x port access control so this

714
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:37,640
provides mutual authentication for the

715
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:40,670
station<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the access point that means</font>

716
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:42,440
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the station will authenticate the</font>

717
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:49,520

happens there is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the client</font>
