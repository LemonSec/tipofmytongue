1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,480
okay okay I hear me come awake yes but

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:08,519
ok one person in the White House kids so

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,710
my<font color="#E5E5E5"> name is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Joe green as I said</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so the</font>

4
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:11,730
brief intro<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me and then talk more</font>

5
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:14,190
about why you're here which the

6
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:16,109
collision avoidance bit so what do I do

7
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:17,400
I'm an aerospace engineering student or

8
00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:19,470
was an aerospace engineering student

9
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:22,109
until last friday at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> University of</font>

10
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:24,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">Bristol which does aerospace has seen a</font>

11
00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:25,680
helicopter aerospace but I'm also

12
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:27,930
responds undergraduate in the Royal Navy

13
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,789
going as a pilot flying f-35 Joint

14
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:30,750
Strike Fighter and the question that

15
00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:33,989
you've probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> all go on your minds</font>

16
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:35,370
right now is sorry so I won't be<font color="#E5E5E5"> flying</font>

17
00:00:33,989 --> 00:00:36,718
joint strike fighter but the moment I

18
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:39,120
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> run up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and down hills with large</font>

19
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:41,640
weights which isn't exactly great the

20
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:43,110
question you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have is why am I here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

21
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:45,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">why am I here an intersect conference</font>

22
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:47,550
talking to you about infosec things the

23
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:50,460
reason is for the past four<font color="#CCCCCC"> years I've</font>

24
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:51,750
done the cyber security challenge UK and

25
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:54,090
out to that I got a load of quest

26
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:55,110
qualifications or other courses and that

27
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:57,960
allowed me to go away<font color="#E5E5E5"> and do an</font>

28
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:59,250
internship with bae systems detica now

29
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:01,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">apply intelligence as some of you guys</font>

30
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:03,899
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the room at the moment and now at the</font>

31
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:06,270
moment I do consulting with<font color="#E5E5E5"> forearmed so</font>

32
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:07,710
I think marks in here somewhere I do pen

33
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:10,470
testing red teaming and sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> security</font>

34
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:12,210
consultancy on that side so essentially

35
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:14,880
i took the hacking solid because<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

36
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:16,408
my hackers look like right and the Joint

37
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,330
Strike Fighter side and the pilot signed

38
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:20,369
the avionics<font color="#E5E5E5"> eyes and that gave</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me a</font>

39
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:22,740
pretty epic<font color="#CCCCCC"> master's project because</font>

40
00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:24,119
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> for my university course we get</font>

41
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:25,589
to propose their own masters projects y

42
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:27,900
pro something that took infosec and

43
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:29,070
planes which always a good start and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

44
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:30,869
can tell it's a good masters project

45
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:33,298
when your risk assessment includes

46
00:01:30,869 --> 00:01:34,380
accidentally crashing aircraft so that

47
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:37,049
one was<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite interesting to get past</font>

48
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:38,579
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> university risk us with people but</font>

49
00:01:37,049 --> 00:01:40,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">yeah that's quite sailing they didn't</font>

50
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:42,509
notice until i pointed out and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then they</font>

51
00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:44,790
were like probably think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about that but</font>

52
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:48,060
anyway<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so what we're going to look</font>

53
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:49,890
at is what is this magic<font color="#CCCCCC"> adsb thing I'm</font>

54
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:52,140
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about where's that come in</font>

55
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:53,369
what can we do to it<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mentioned</font>

56
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:55,320
collision avoidance so there's a system

57
00:01:53,369 --> 00:01:56,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">called</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> TCAs or the traffic collision</font>

58
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:59,669
avoidance system which does what it says

59
00:01:56,939 --> 00:02:01,529
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the tin and then overview of all of</font>

60
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:04,049
the complex security mechanisms<font color="#E5E5E5"> involved</font>

61
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:06,149
in those two and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to</font>

62
00:02:04,049 --> 00:02:08,310
explain and<font color="#E5E5E5"> demonstrate the attack</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

63
00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:10,020
I proposed for it and I have some live

64
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:12,970
demos if we can offering to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the demo God</font>

65
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:14,800
we'll see how<font color="#CCCCCC"> it goes down and then</font>

66
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:16,270
horror I have some defenses so they're

67
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,040
not great defenses I'm going to caveat

68
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:19,960
that there's not much you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do with</font>

69
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:21,970
legacy protocols in general and but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll</font>

70
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:23,110
sort of explain some of the prototypes

71
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:25,330
and some of the ways you can go<font color="#CCCCCC"> through</font>

72
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:26,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and then the end we should have</font>

73
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:29,860
some time for questions you should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

74
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:32,019
good ok so the ad SB stands for

75
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:34,930
automated dependent surveillance

76
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:36,430
broadcast system automated and the pilot

77
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:39,280
doesn't have to keep clicking transmit

78
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:41,260
so dependent and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's dependent on other</font>

79
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,880
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of system so GPS and altitude</font>

80
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:44,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">you'll have some stuff and then</font>

81
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:46,209
surveillance<font color="#E5E5E5"> because the ground traffic</font>

82
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:48,010
control can you to surveil aircraft and

83
00:02:46,209 --> 00:02:51,040
then the broadcast bit is self-evident

84
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:53,170
because it transmits so essentially you

85
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:55,750
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> your gps satellite up here and your</font>

86
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:57,160
aircraft gets its data its<font color="#CCCCCC"> position its</font>

87
00:02:55,750 --> 00:03:00,190
speed it's lost its state essentially

88
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:01,990
from that<font color="#E5E5E5"> GPS constellation then that</font>

89
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:05,020
aircraft formulates a message and then

90
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:07,270
transmits that over 1090 megahertz with

91
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:08,920
a special<font color="#E5E5E5"> squit or format to ground</font>

92
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:11,230
stations so<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're beaconing out</font>

93
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:13,570
broadly once or twice a second their

94
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:15,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">position in their state and then the</font>

95
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:17,320
ground stations can use all this data to

96
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:19,330
use air traffic control data because

97
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:21,130
it's quicker than radar so radar

98
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:22,900
actually is quite slow to do a complete

99
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:24,400
cycle so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> useful for them to have</font>

100
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:27,070
better situation awareness of where the

101
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:29,230
aircraft are that's that site that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

102
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:31,780
called a dsb out so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the aircraft</font>

103
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:34,000
broadcasting out to its position there's

104
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:35,830
another system called<font color="#CCCCCC"> a dsb in where</font>

105
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,320
other aircraft listen for the ats-v

106
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:40,300
transmissions so they're taking in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

107
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:42,310
ad speed data and using that to work out

108
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:43,299
where other aircraft are around them and

109
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:46,269
that's the bit that we're gonna be

110
00:03:43,299 --> 00:03:48,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">looking at so some interesting facts</font>

111
00:03:46,269 --> 00:03:50,739
about a DSP it's mandatory and Australia

112
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:52,600
at the moment it will be mandatory in

113
00:03:50,739 --> 00:03:55,600
Europe<font color="#E5E5E5"> for 2017 and it will be</font>

114
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:59,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">monitoring the u.s. in 2020 and that's</font>

115
00:03:55,600 --> 00:04:02,500
part of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> u.s. is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> next gen program and</font>

116
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:03,970
hopefully by the end of this talk you'll

117
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,799
realize why I laugh when they<font color="#E5E5E5"> say its</font>

118
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:08,530
next generation so we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> get to that put</font>

119
00:04:05,799 --> 00:04:10,959
and the key aim is it aims<font color="#E5E5E5"> to replace</font>

120
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:13,209
primary surveillance radar entirely so

121
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:15,730
just have this so bear that in mind when

122
00:04:13,209 --> 00:04:16,988
we get to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end at all so the</font>

123
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:18,969
collision avoidance bit Devon was

124
00:04:16,988 --> 00:04:21,880
interested in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the traffic collision</font>

125
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:24,400
avoidance system to<font color="#CCCCCC"> TCAs aims funnily</font>

126
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:26,200
enough to stop aircraft colliding which

127
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:29,770
is always a good thing we'd hoped

128
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:33,310
so this was brought in in 1978 because a

129
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:35,380
an airliner<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think was a 320 impacted</font>

130
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:37,390
with a light aircraft over San Diego and

131
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:39,760
at that<font color="#E5E5E5"> point for some reason it was</font>

132
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:42,010
that collision rum<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the other traffic</font>

133
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:44,140
collisions thus I did you know what we

134
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:46,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">should do something about this so they</font>

135
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:48,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">invented this system where TCAs takes in</font>

136
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,150
data and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> it works out whether</font>

137
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:51,909
there's going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be a collision with</font>

138
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:53,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">another aircraft based on that data if</font>

139
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:56,770
the aircraft so this is our intruder

140
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:58,240
aircraft is within 40 seconds it gives

141
00:04:56,770 --> 00:05:01,479
the pilot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of warnings of a traffic</font>

142
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,890
advisory or a TA and that basically goes

143
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:05,320
off in the cockpit you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get display it</font>

144
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:07,060
goes traffic traffic and that tells<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

145
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:09,790
pilot to begin looking visually see if

146
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:12,310
you can see the aircraft useful then

147
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:13,750
however if the aircraft<font color="#E5E5E5"> comes within 25</font>

148
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:16,720
seconds of collision<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get a</font>

149
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:18,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">resolution advisory or an RA and that's</font>

150
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:21,400
normally given with an order so it would

151
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:23,350
be climb or climb now and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

152
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:24,789
that both aircraft will negotiate which

153
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:26,080
one goes up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and which one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> goes down</font>

154
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:27,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">which is a good thing because if you</font>

155
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:30,909
both pull up you still crash which isn't

156
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:33,090
great and there's some protocols behind

157
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:35,350
how all of this works on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the back end</font>

158
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:37,000
this is the actual display the pilot

159
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:39,040
gets so you can see here these are two

160
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,080
non-threatening aircraft just<font color="#E5E5E5"> display</font>

161
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:43,660
for traffic information the orange

162
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:46,180
circle is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> TCAs ta to the traffic</font>

163
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:49,690
advisory and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Red Square is the</font>

164
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:51,340
resolution advisory<font color="#E5E5E5"> the RA so remember</font>

165
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:55,719
these symbols for later and we have a

166
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:57,130
look at those exact displays the

167
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:58,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">overviews so I like I said there's</font>

168
00:05:57,130 --> 00:06:01,450
multiple data sources so there's active

169
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:03,610
modes and that uses<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Mode S</font>

170
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:04,840
transponders so they talk to<font color="#CCCCCC"> each other</font>

171
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:06,580
and trying to work out<font color="#CCCCCC"> the range in the</font>

172
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:08,650
bearing and that sort of<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff but</font>

173
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:11,349
they're also bringing in using a dsb in

174
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:12,880
to give traffic data and the exact

175
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:15,100
extent to which that<font color="#E5E5E5"> works isn't</font>

176
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,390
entirely certain so my<font color="#E5E5E5"> project was</font>

177
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:18,010
trying to look at whether you could use

178
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:20,080
that to do something interesting so some

179
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:22,840
of you will<font color="#E5E5E5"> have already spotted the</font>

180
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:25,719
problem with a<font color="#CCCCCC"> DSP in and tcas but we'll</font>

181
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:27,369
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> on to that later so again some</font>

182
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:29,620
interesting facts about<font color="#CCCCCC"> tcas just a bear</font>

183
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:31,120
in mind<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the rest</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the talk tcas</font>

184
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:34,120
has a higher priority than air traffic

185
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:36,040
control so if you get a<font color="#CCCCCC"> teak sra you</font>

186
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:37,960
ignore air traffic control while you're

187
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:39,940
responding to that RA that's an

188
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:40,330
interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing to quote pilots on</font>

189
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:41,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">Monday</font>

190
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:43,659
to respond to it within two<font color="#CCCCCC"> and a half</font>

191
00:06:41,889 --> 00:06:45,580
seconds there's not an amazing<font color="#E5E5E5"> amount of</font>

192
00:06:43,659 --> 00:06:46,990
thoughts time in this you see the red

193
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:49,659
blip you do what the red blip says

194
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:52,180
essentially and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last thing on modern</font>

195
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:54,550
Airbus aircraft autopilot is slave to

196
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:57,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">tcas so as soon as that thing goes climb</font>

197
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:59,199
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> aircraft will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be climbing so again</font>

198
00:06:57,340 --> 00:07:02,049
those are<font color="#CCCCCC"> three things to bear in mind</font>

199
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:04,599
for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> rest of this talk so the</font>

200
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:06,460
security this is the part of every

201
00:07:04,599 --> 00:07:08,110
conference presentation where I sit here

202
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:10,419
and I talk through the labyrinth on

203
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:12,849
complexity<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the security how I used</font>

204
00:07:10,419 --> 00:07:15,159
wit and guile to bypass it<font color="#CCCCCC"> all and get</font>

205
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:18,009
an expert<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the end but more fierce has</font>

206
00:07:15,159 --> 00:07:20,800
something to say about this so<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

207
00:07:18,009 --> 00:07:22,659
there is no security on a dsb whatsoever

208
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,639
there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> nothing there's no encryption</font>

209
00:07:22,659 --> 00:07:26,949
there's no authentication there's no

210
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:29,020
integrity checking the<font color="#CCCCCC"> message okay it</font>

211
00:07:26,949 --> 00:07:31,210
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> blindly assumes that anyone who's</font>

212
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:32,560
transmitting is an aircraft and that

213
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:35,138
they don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually have to be wherever</font>

214
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:37,060
they can so obviously is the most

215
00:07:35,139 --> 00:07:39,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting man of the world says if you</font>

216
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:40,479
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> rid rid of radar you</font>

217
00:07:39,189 --> 00:07:42,389
obviously make sure that your protocol

218
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:45,180
has anyone to be wherever they are

219
00:07:42,389 --> 00:07:48,669
wherever<font color="#CCCCCC"> they want to be rather for this</font>

220
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:51,279
so there isn't a security and my project

221
00:07:48,669 --> 00:07:53,770
supervisor initially he's a crypto

222
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:55,000
expert at Bristol he was like no there

223
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:56,529
must be some security there must be

224
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,210
something something on there someone

225
00:07:56,529 --> 00:07:59,440
will have<font color="#E5E5E5"> put something and it was only</font>

226
00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:01,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">when I showed him this this is</font>

227
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:04,810
flightradar24 where you can view all of

228
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:07,448
the aircraft transmitting a DSP so this

229
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:08,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">is essentially an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 80s be in receiver for</font>

230
00:08:07,449 --> 00:08:10,900
all of the a DSP that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the aircraft</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

231
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:12,490
transmitting as you can see<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font>

232
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:15,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">pretty much get all of them so there's</font>

233
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:17,289
already ignoring everything else there's

234
00:08:15,339 --> 00:08:19,150
a surveillance risk with a dsb that

235
00:08:17,289 --> 00:08:21,159
anyone can tell where an aircraft is

236
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:23,460
because it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> required by law will be</font>

237
00:08:21,159 --> 00:08:25,839
required by law to transmit its location

238
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:27,310
so if you for instance wanted to sit at

239
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:28,870
the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a runway and work out exactly</font>

240
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:29,919
where an aircraft was going to be and

241
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:31,990
you happen to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a surface-to-air</font>

242
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:33,159
missile then who knows maybe you could

243
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:34,779
do something<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting with that so</font>

244
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:36,370
there's a whole issue to that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not</font>

245
00:08:34,779 --> 00:08:39,159
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to cover but I'm sure you</font>

246
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:41,049
can see where the issues<font color="#E5E5E5"> going so the</font>

247
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:44,350
exploit pathway for one of a better word

248
00:08:41,049 --> 00:08:46,060
for what my project intended to do which

249
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:47,920
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> have an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> attacker system and we</font>

250
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:50,140
generate these adsb messages to try and

251
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,769
pretend to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be an aircraft in front of</font>

252
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:52,989
another era

253
00:08:50,769 --> 00:08:55,360
and at<font color="#CCCCCC"> that point hopefully</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Takashi go</font>

254
00:08:52,989 --> 00:08:57,339
mental so we generate messages for a

255
00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:00,249
software-defined radio and then we

256
00:08:57,339 --> 00:09:02,619
transmit these over the air the<font color="#CCCCCC"> atsb</font>

257
00:09:00,249 --> 00:09:04,239
receiver then decodes these messages it

258
00:09:02,619 --> 00:09:05,800
doesn't do any checking on them because

259
00:09:04,239 --> 00:09:08,439
it just decode messages that's what it

260
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:10,089
does it then passes them to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> tcas</font>

261
00:09:08,439 --> 00:09:13,059
system and then depending on what<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

262
00:09:10,089 --> 00:09:14,619
<font color="#CCCCCC">TCAs sister will do we'd like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it or what</font>

263
00:09:13,059 --> 00:09:16,509
rather we wouldn't like it to alert the

264
00:09:14,619 --> 00:09:20,350
pilot with a resolution advisory and

265
00:09:16,509 --> 00:09:23,769
tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> him</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to climb so this attack in</font>

266
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:25,749
general so obviously avionics hardware

267
00:09:23,769 --> 00:09:26,769
is quite expensive and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't know if</font>

268
00:09:25,749 --> 00:09:28,379
you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> seen the state of academic</font>

269
00:09:26,769 --> 00:09:30,429
funding at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the moment but it's not great</font>

270
00:09:28,379 --> 00:09:32,769
and it certainly doesn't stretch to

271
00:09:30,429 --> 00:09:35,199
buying an aircraft so<font color="#E5E5E5"> when I went</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to my</font>

272
00:09:32,769 --> 00:09:37,749
supervisor instead can i buy an entire

273
00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:40,118
<font color="#E5E5E5">adsb antique a system he said no quite</font>

274
00:09:37,749 --> 00:09:41,290
flatly he did however have a load of

275
00:09:40,119 --> 00:09:43,839
software-defined radios floating around

276
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:46,509
so we got to use those so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I created</font>

277
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:49,239
where<font color="#E5E5E5"> I put together</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an ad spnt cast</font>

278
00:09:46,509 --> 00:09:51,999
test bed using software-defined radios

279
00:09:49,239 --> 00:09:54,220
and good new radio so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea is we</font>

280
00:09:51,999 --> 00:09:56,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">listen on 1099 hurts or whatever we're</font>

281
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:58,779
listening on and then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have an RTLS dr</font>

282
00:09:56,889 --> 00:10:00,189
dongle which<font color="#CCCCCC"> have really cheap</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ready to</font>

283
00:09:58,779 --> 00:10:02,709
get hold<font color="#E5E5E5"> of well within the academic</font>

284
00:10:00,189 --> 00:10:04,809
budget and then we've put that into a

285
00:10:02,709 --> 00:10:07,868
new radio so there's gr air mode s

286
00:10:04,809 --> 00:10:10,299
something that<font color="#CCCCCC"> nick foster made these</font>

287
00:10:07,869 --> 00:10:11,949
called<font color="#CCCCCC"> mr. Arthur's handle which is a</font>

00:10:10,299 --> 00:10:14,559
modus receiver but done in software

289
00:10:11,949 --> 00:10:16,420
defined radio which is quite handy that

290
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:19,449
then decodes the alias we messages and

291
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:21,189
then sends it to a flight gear simulator

292
00:10:19,449 --> 00:10:23,679
essentially it's a flight<font color="#CCCCCC"> gears an open</font>

293
00:10:21,189 --> 00:10:25,809
<font color="#CCCCCC">source simulator that happens to have a</font>

294
00:10:23,679 --> 00:10:28,619
tea cast receiver in it that is

295
00:10:25,809 --> 00:10:32,110
compliant with<font color="#CCCCCC"> tcas version to version</font>

296
00:10:28,619 --> 00:10:34,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">TCAs to version to 7.1 some 10 sorry</font>

297
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:36,519
which is the last but one version of

298
00:10:34,449 --> 00:10:37,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">tcas and which is quite handy for me</font>

299
00:10:36,519 --> 00:10:40,769
when I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to make it as close to</font>

300
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:43,089
reality as possible so then we have our

301
00:10:40,769 --> 00:10:45,100
decoder packets they go to flight gear

302
00:10:43,089 --> 00:10:47,559
and then they trigger something or they

303
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:48,999
should trigger something so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> did this</font>

304
00:10:47,559 --> 00:10:51,699
with a real aircraft so this is

305
00:10:48,999 --> 00:10:53,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">listening above my house and this is an</font>

306
00:10:51,699 --> 00:10:55,779
easy jet flight that was flying<font color="#E5E5E5"> over me</font>

307
00:10:53,199 --> 00:10:57,729
at the time that caused a<font color="#CCCCCC"> TCAs alert to</font>

308
00:10:55,779 --> 00:10:59,079
come up on white flight<font color="#E5E5E5"> simulator so</font>

309
00:10:57,730 --> 00:11:00,279
from a flight simulator perspective

310
00:10:59,079 --> 00:11:01,359
that's quite cool but that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not really</font>

311
00:11:00,279 --> 00:11:05,529
why we're here we're here for the

312
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:07,390
or the info section bit so we need to

313
00:11:05,529 --> 00:11:08,800
generate this messages somehow so the

314
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:11,800
question you ask is what does an<font color="#E5E5E5"> ad SB</font>

315
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:13,750
message look like you start off with the

316
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:16,029
what's called<font color="#CCCCCC"> the DF bit the downlink</font>

317
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:18,040
field and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's because a DSP is a</font>

318
00:11:16,029 --> 00:11:19,990
subset of Mode S so there's loads of

319
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:21,550
different types of<font color="#E5E5E5"> mole s message of</font>

320
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:24,640
different types and this but it tells it

321
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:28,810
what type it is for a<font color="#CCCCCC"> dsb that's 0 x</font>

322
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:31,600
1700 x 17 and that's a dsb messages so

323
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:33,790
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> adsb messages will have 0 x 17 in</font>

324
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,709
here they<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't worry</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about that and</font>

325
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:38,439
<font color="#CCCCCC">then you have what's called the icarus</font>

326
00:11:35,709 --> 00:11:42,239
so it cow is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the International Civil</font>

that with your<font color="#CCCCCC"> ad sv messages so you can</font>

00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:17,440
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a large amount space 56 bits here</font>

343
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:21,339
we have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> really complex crc32 checksum</font>

00:12:20,019 --> 00:12:23,350
at the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> just to make sure everything</font>

00:12:21,339 --> 00:12:25,360
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I did say there</font>

346
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:27,880
was no integrity I lied slightly because

347
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:29,170
there is a CRC parity check but I

348
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:31,120
wouldn't really call<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> proper</font>

351
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:39,640
there in one piece<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so there's three</font>

352
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:42,250
main types of message so subsets within

353
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:43,600
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> a dsb data that we need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to send we</font>

354
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:46,630
essentially need to send our position

355
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:48,220
pretend to send opposition our velocity

356
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:50,800
and we also send an identification

357
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:52,180
packet and these are all identified by

358
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:55,180
the register that they're stored in a

359
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:58,149
memory in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> a dsb receiver and that's</font>

360
00:12:55,180 --> 00:13:01,719
called<font color="#E5E5E5"> the BDS registers so position</font>

361
00:12:58,149 --> 00:13:04,000
messages are BDS 05 messages so that's

362
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:06,640
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of the way we determine where</font>

363
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,320
those messages go so be dias sara five

364
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:11,860
messages look like this so we have our

365
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:14,020
altitude in those bits and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have</font>

366
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:14,920
our last tune multitude encoded in

367
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:17,730
something called compaq

368
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:19,660
position reporting and that's a way of

369
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:21,339
compressing the last<font color="#E5E5E5"> uddin longitude</font>

370
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:24,490
into a very very small amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of space</font>

371
00:13:21,339 --> 00:13:26,260
and by using long students and you could

372
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:28,450
do a whole hour presentation on just

373
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:29,560
doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> cpr logs in Matthew but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

374
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:32,320
probably want to kill yourself at the

375
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:34,239
end it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> very interesting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the things</font>

376
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,920
take away though is that you do you get

377
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:38,560
very very compressed but you need two

378
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:40,689
messages to narrow it down to which side

379
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:42,969
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the earth you're on essentially so if</font>

380
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:44,050
you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> just one BD s05</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> s as you can</font>

381
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:46,570
tell whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're in one of two places</font>

382
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:48,069
on the earth and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then use the second BDS</font>

383
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:50,829

384
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:52,269
where you are which<font color="#E5E5E5"> is quite handy so we</font>

385
00:13:50,829 --> 00:13:54,069
have two of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> messages that gives us</font>

386
00:13:52,269 --> 00:13:56,320
our positions or our altitude last year

387
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:57,970
in longitude we then have something

388
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:01,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">called an ident pocket or identification</font>

389
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:03,339
which is BDS 08 and so the account

390
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:05,410
address i mentioned before isn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

391
00:14:03,339 --> 00:14:07,540
very human readable<font color="#CCCCCC"> its hexadecimal</font>

392
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:08,829
numbers and letters basically and so for

393
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:10,449
air traffic<font color="#E5E5E5"> control they'd like to have</font>

394
00:14:08,829 --> 00:14:12,250
a good human readable call sign that

395
00:14:10,449 --> 00:14:13,930
they can assign to it and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

396
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:16,720
this packet gives you so the first thing

397
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:18,699
it has is the aircraft category hasn't

398
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,930
come over<font color="#E5E5E5"> a well is it and that tells</font>

399
00:14:18,699 --> 00:14:21,670
air traffic control what type of

400
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:23,319
aircraft you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are so that could be</font>

401
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:25,149
anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> from a light aircraft to a</font>

402
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:27,579
heavy aircraft and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can be a</font>

403
00:14:25,149 --> 00:14:29,230
parachutist in the spec apparently why a

00:14:27,579 --> 00:14:31,149
parachutist would carry an<font color="#E5E5E5"> 80s be</font>

405
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:33,880

406
00:14:31,149 --> 00:14:35,140
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> it in this bed and then the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> next all</font>

407
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:37,000
of the rest of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bits are the</font>

408
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:38,620
characters in the call sign so only one

409
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:42,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">we have that eject flight those echo</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">Zulu Yankee 61 golf Romeo so that's</font>

411
00:14:42,279 --> 00:14:46,120
these eight characters here which<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

412
00:14:43,959 --> 00:14:47,439
<font color="#CCCCCC">will call sign so when you look up look</font>

413
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:49,600
up what your flight tail number will be

414
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:52,300
it'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> be that cool sign they're not the</font>

415
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:54,130
account address so we've got our ident

416
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:56,349
packet we have our position packets and

417
00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:59,140
now how our velocity and this will take

418
00:14:56,350 --> 00:15:01,540
you back to GCSE maths essentially the

419
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:03,819
velocity is<font color="#E5E5E5"> given in east west velocity</font>

420
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:05,410
and north-south velocity so obviously to

421
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:07,779
get your heading in your<font color="#E5E5E5"> speed you just</font>

422
00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:10,899

423
00:15:07,779 --> 00:15:12,790
good old-fashioned<font color="#E5E5E5"> maths so then with</font>

424
00:15:10,899 --> 00:15:14,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">all of that we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have our velocity our</font>

427
00:15:16,389 --> 00:15:20,079
the velocity packets is you get to

428
00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:21,970
specify what your uncertainty is about

429
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:24,069
your velocity so obviously all of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:26,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">fakir after our craft we're creating are</font>

431
00:15:24,069 --> 00:15:27,920
a hundred<font color="#CCCCCC"> percent</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> certain about how far</font>

432
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:31,189
they're going they're not uncertain in

433
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:32,599
any way<font color="#CCCCCC"> shape or form so obviously then</font>

434
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:34,400
the easiest way to make something

435
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:37,070
trivial is to make a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Python</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> library for</font>

436
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:39,260
it so I wrote up a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Python library called</font>

437
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:41,420
lib<font color="#CCCCCC"> adsb</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that you give it some data and</font>

438
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:43,910
it gives you out a nice a DSP message

439
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:45,800
here so for this one the a cow addresses

440
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:48,439
beef 11 because you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> do that with hex</font>

441
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:49,969
why not but it<font color="#E5E5E5"> makes it really really</font>

442
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:51,140
easy to generate lots and lots of

443
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:54,590
different messages which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> need</font>

444
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:56,150
to do later so we have our messages

445
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:59,060
generated<font color="#CCCCCC"> then we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to transmit them</font>

446
00:15:56,150 --> 00:16:00,530
so i used a hack RF because that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

447
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:02,599
the university had lying around as you

448
00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:04,490
do we didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the budget in front of</font>

449
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:07,790
the Metis radios which ideally really

450
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:10,130
used but we had one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those so and then</font>

451
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:13,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">using blu-ray do you create blocks to</font>

452
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:16,280
your diagram so this block diagram is

453
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:18,470
lifted nearly exactly from some research

454
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:20,350
done by the US Air Force over a fit to

455
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:23,660
the air force institute of technology in

456
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:26,120
2008 where they did some work on false

457
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:27,969
traffic injection of a dsb and

458
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:30,440
essentially you have your binary message

459
00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:33,200
encoded in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the form you want to transmit</font>

460
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:35,180
it in you unpack it and then you just

461
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:39,740
transmit it it's very very simple very

462
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:41,719
easy to however it turned out that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

463
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:43,580
didn't actually work and quite why it

464
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:45,410
didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> work</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I I don't actually have any</font>

465
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:47,450
idea why didn't work so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

466
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:49,370
transmitting side so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is the pulses</font>

467
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:50,450
that I'm transmitting and this is what

468
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:51,710
came out on the other end<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the</font>

469
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:54,020
receiver so as<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can notice they're</font>

470
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:55,970
not actually the same at all and this

471
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:58,250
didn't trigger gr air modes to do

472
00:16:55,970 --> 00:16:59,510
anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that didn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> work can I spent</font>

473
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:02,060
a long long time trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get this work</font>

474
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:04,040
but it didn't work<font color="#E5E5E5"> the interesting thing</font>

475
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:05,270
to note is I<font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't transmitting on 1090</font>

476
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:08,210
megahertz because obviously that's

477
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:10,069
illegal I was transmitting on 433

478
00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:12,530
megahertz which is the international

479
00:17:10,069 --> 00:17:14,179
scientific and medical band which is

480
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:15,889
free for anyone's<font color="#E5E5E5"> transmit on so I was</font>

481
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:17,180
doing a lower frequency and one of the

482
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:19,310
possible reasons this didn't work is

483
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:20,930
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a lot more noise on 433</font>

484
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:22,700
megahertz than there is at 1090 because

485
00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:25,550
hopefully hopefully there's only

486
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:27,970
aircraft on 1090 megahertz whereas every

487
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:30,290
man in his dog is transmitting on 433

488
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:33,350
the other potential issues because I

489
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:35,360
wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> at 1090 megahertz my encoding of</font>

490
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:37,429
the actual message would possibly be

491
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:39,240
right so the sample rates might be

492
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:41,550
mismatch between the<font color="#E5E5E5"> RTL SDR and</font>

493
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:43,559
hack RF and then there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just the issue</font>

494
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:45,389
that the RTL<font color="#CCCCCC"> str8 cost five quid off</font>

495
00:17:43,559 --> 00:17:46,740
ebay i think it's not exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> high-end</font>

496
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:48,900
equipment so it might be<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's just</font>

497
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:50,309
not doing the presentation<font color="#CCCCCC"> I need so</font>

498
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:52,320
this could<font color="#CCCCCC"> be fixed if I did</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

499
00:17:50,309 --> 00:17:54,480
transmit a 1019 megahertz but<font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously</font>

500
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:56,700
I need a Faraday cage or something to do

501
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:58,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">that in however there's a good reason</font>

502
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:00,150
why I didn't is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that if you can't do</font>

503
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:01,678
something here there's probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> someone</font>

504
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:04,530
in China has done it in legally dubious

505
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:07,350
circumstances so there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> this gentleman</font>

506
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:10,020
over in China who's done exactly what I

507
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:17,399
was trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do but on 1090 megahertz</font>

508
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:20,250
so that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting that's plenty so</font>

509
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:22,710
it's got his hack RF and wired up with

510
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:24,780
his laptop is transmitting the messages

511
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:28,350
using the identical new radio blocks

512
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:30,540
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had here's this software SDR</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> rtls</font>

513
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:31,770
dr even and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can see the</font>

514
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:35,090
aircraft into the bottom<font color="#CCCCCC"> there going</font>

515
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:36,900
sideways and a square shape and as

516
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:38,070
someone who's done for he's a fluid

517
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:40,890
dynamics that's not normally how

518
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:42,960
aircraft fly<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm sure maybe you pick</font>

519
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:45,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">that up but yeah so here's him moving</font>

520
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,500
his aircraft around quite happily and if

521
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:47,910
there was another aircraft there they

522
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably got quite confused by this</font>

523
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:51,690
aircraft moving around in a square

524
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:52,909
pattern but maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> they don't have laws</font>

525
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:55,890
against that in China or I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

526
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:57,330
but they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> so he's done it so it's not</font>

527
00:18:55,890 --> 00:18:58,590
that that can't be done<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's how that</font>

528
00:18:57,330 --> 00:19:00,000
links<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the rest of it so that wasn't</font>

529
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:01,678
<font color="#CCCCCC">really the important bits the project</font>

530
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,900
because people have been injecting a DSP

531
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:05,760
for quite some time and<font color="#CCCCCC"> if we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> could do</font>

532
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:07,110
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have a youtube video someone</font>

533
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:09,330
doing it so we can we could show that

534
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:11,580
that's an issue so at this<font color="#E5E5E5"> point it was</font>

535
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:13,260
time to simulate it also we just skipped

536
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:15,030
ahead doing the RF bit and just cut that

537
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:16,970
down to software because that's what you

538
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:19,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">do in academia right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you simulate still</font>

539
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:21,780
so at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this point clear area has quite an</font>

540
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:23,010
interesting feature or gr air mode sorry

541
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:26,460
has an interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> feature where you can</font>

542
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:29,129
specify multiple other radios and send

543
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:31,679
messages into a central<font color="#E5E5E5"> server / 0 mq</font>

544
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:33,480
sockets so<font color="#CCCCCC"> essentially you could have a</font>

545
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:35,660
farm of distributed sensors and then

546
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:37,620
bring in all of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> a dsb data into one</font>

547
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:39,000
but that<font color="#E5E5E5"> also means it's quite useful</font>

548
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:41,010
for us because we can write a little

549
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">Python script that injects messages into</font>

550
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:45,750
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> message queue to be decoded so it</font>

551
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:47,669
quite happily bypasses all of the RF

552
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:50,100
injector stuff and we get to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> straight</font>

553
00:19:47,669 --> 00:19:51,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">into here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and that's probably a valid</font>

554
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:52,280
assumption to make because it's exactly

555
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:55,129
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same message</font>

556
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:58,070
just not getting transmitted over RF so

557
00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:58,970
win the simulation that so obviously if

558
00:19:58,070 --> 00:20:00,200
you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be a hacker you have to</font>

559
00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:02,690
write something of green texts because

560
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:04,310
that's how it works so we had a console

561
00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:06,230
program or I wrote console program

562
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:07,790
allows you to specify all the different

563
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:09,590
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> so the call sign you want the</font>

564
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:13,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">last year logs dude speed all this stuff</font>

565
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:15,379
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then obviously have helped and then</font>

566
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:17,179
this generates an all in the background

567
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:19,370
it transmits it into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> gr air modes</font>

568
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:20,840
thing and then it gets decoded so this

569
00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:22,909
gives us a nice<font color="#E5E5E5"> front end interface that</font>

570
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:24,530
we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> then type in change the last year</font>

571
00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:25,670
to this and then we can mess around with

572
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:27,350
putting aircraft in front of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

573
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:31,340
moving them dynamically which is quite

574
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:33,260
useful did it work yeah it worked<font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font>

575
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:35,659
simulator so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the aircraft UOB</font>

576
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:36,830
hack sitting there in<font color="#CCCCCC"> front</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of my</font>

577
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:39,710
aircraft and quite a threatening

578
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:40,850
position injected into it and that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

579
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:43,910
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> tcas display with a resolution</font>

580
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:45,830
advisory shown so at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this point</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tcas was</font>

581
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:48,650
saying climb climb or descend the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Karem</font>

582
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:50,750
which and at<font color="#E5E5E5"> that point in real life if</font>

583
00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:52,370
this all works as expected then the

584
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:57,110
pilot would probably having a small shit

585
00:20:52,370 --> 00:21:02,689
and pulling<font color="#E5E5E5"> up but if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we can do one we</font>

586
00:20:57,110 --> 00:21:04,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">can do loads of aircraft right so like I</font>

587
00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:05,900
said you because you can pretend<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

588
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:07,250
an aircraft there's nothing stopping one

589
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:08,660
aircraft pretended to be hundreds of

590
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:11,120
aircraft and lots of different locations

591
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:13,490
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> so I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is 30 aircraft all</font>

592
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:14,750
clustered around and at this point<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

593
00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:17,150
quite interesting actually mighty cast

594
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:18,800
receiver didn't know what to do at<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

595
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:20,990
point if there's aircraft above and

596
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:22,490
below it so every half a second it would

597
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:25,580
change between challenge to climb and

598
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:27,680
descend so you get climb to send send

599
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:29,780
climb climb to<font color="#E5E5E5"> send now and all this</font>

600
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:31,520
sort of stuff going on<font color="#CCCCCC"> so if you're a</font>

601
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:33,260
pilot in that position you probably know

602
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,430
something wasn't right because you

603
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:36,110
couldn't see all of those aircraft out

604
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:38,300
of the window but by law you'd be

605
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:40,070
mandated to do something what that thing

606
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:41,360
was I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think anyone could probably</font>

607
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:43,700
guess and that be up to the lawyers to

608
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:44,990
decide but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a great position to</font>

609
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:46,340
be in if you imagine you're on the

610
00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:49,730
approach at Heathrow and that's what

611
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:51,050
your display looks like<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so now we</font>

612
00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:52,970
pray to the demo gods and we see if it

613
00:21:51,050 --> 00:21:55,300
actually works on screen so we'll have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

614
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:55,300
go this

615
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:18,320
so while that's starting up we've got

616
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:23,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">our this is our injection program so our</font>

617
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:24,350
console and then over here is our<font color="#E5E5E5"> gr air</font>

618
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,450
modes transmitter so that's going to

619
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:28,010
decode messages and then the multiplayer

620
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:31,010
server for flight gear is running on

621
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:33,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">this kali linux box as well and then our</font>

623
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:38,510
connection that<font color="#E5E5E5"> mods place everything</font>

624
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:40,190
gets on the data<font color="#CCCCCC"> as that but it's</font>

625
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:43,360
loading the scenery apparently it's

626
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:43,360
obviously something we're interested in

627
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:47,139
so that's going well

628
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:05,930
somewhere in the states aren't

629
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:33,400
reference this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not our flight plans a</font>

630
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:33,400
lil assault

631
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:55,780
I think they altered while has an

632
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:55,780
interesting opinion of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our world</font>

633
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,120
okay so eventually it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to turn</font>

634
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:09,040
round<font color="#E5E5E5"> spike to the course I really tall</font>

635
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:11,649
the job we're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna put</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this up</font>

636
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:18,040
here so over here in<font color="#CCCCCC"> all I'm consol</font>

637
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:19,480
program here so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I go help now I'm</font>

638
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:20,830
getting stuck commands<font color="#E5E5E5"> very helpful</font>

639
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:23,200
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the different things we can</font>

640
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:24,850
set and then if I go short options we

641
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,320
got a nice little picture of all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

642
00:24:24,850 --> 00:24:29,409
different things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we can set</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

643
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:31,480
different places sighs<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so we're</font>

644
00:24:29,410 --> 00:24:34,510
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to set the multitude to muster</font>

645
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:35,950
promoted and these are<font color="#E5E5E5"> just some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pretty</font>

646
00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:38,110
words out values that should possibly

647
00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:41,170
put it in vaguely the right place to

648
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:44,760
trigger it advisory but it depends<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

649
00:24:41,170 --> 00:24:44,760
where the aircraft decides to put us off

650
00:25:02,570 --> 00:25:16,280
ok so our facilities they go over here

651
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:18,810
and I'll t cast receiver we have the

652
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:21,330
it's some reason it's not saying climb

653
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:22,590
base<font color="#E5E5E5"> a pretty ugly simulator anyway but</font>

654
00:25:21,330 --> 00:25:25,260
there's our resolution<font color="#E5E5E5"> provides very</font>

655
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:26,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">showing up on the screen so because I</font>

656
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:28,500
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> just arbitrarily do whatever I want</font>

657
00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:32,120
to it<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to move that back so we</font>

658
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:34,130
go set the<font color="#CCCCCC"> long</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> shooter is through one</font>

659
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:37,229
over here you should be able to see the

660
00:25:34,130 --> 00:25:38,760
it magically disappeared and now repeat

661
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:40,830
again because it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just further away in</font>

662
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:42,360
front and<font color="#E5E5E5"> like I said obviously if we</font>

663
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:44,310
could do one we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> do multiple them so</font>

664
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:45,750
we're gonna set the path to swarm which

665
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:52,080
randomly generate something around a

666
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:53,580
point let's put 10 aircraft in so let's

667
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:55,850
see if we do this in<font color="#E5E5E5"> same time maximum</font>

668
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:55,850
effect

669
00:25:58,110 --> 00:26:03,030
so there's our one aircraft and now

670
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:05,760
that's become<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ted</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> aircraft with all the</font>

671
00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:07,740
traffic advisories and then like I said

672
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:09,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">that if it's within 40 seconds to get ta</font>

673
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:11,940
and then those will slowly turn into red

674
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:14,549
dots there<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok so now there's a small</font>

675
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:15,929
swarm of unidentified aircraft coming

676
00:26:14,549 --> 00:26:17,580
straight towards you or causing

677
00:26:15,929 --> 00:26:20,580
resolution advisories which<font color="#E5E5E5"> isn't a</font>

678
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:27,629
great<font color="#E5E5E5"> position for a pilot's beer so</font>

679
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:29,580
amazingly that worked right<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok so that's</font>

680
00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:32,100
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> Darryl outside so obviously as</font>

681
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:33,090
insect professionals we do all the sort

00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:35,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">of attacking surf and we demonstrated</font>

00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:36,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">exploits but ideally we'd like to have</font>

684
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:38,549
some defenses against that particular

685
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:39,900
stuff as well so the second half of<font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font>

686
00:26:38,549 --> 00:26:41,850
project<font color="#CCCCCC"> once got all that done was</font>

687
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:43,470
trying to implement some defenses to

688
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:46,918
stop people<font color="#E5E5E5"> being able to arbitrarily</font>

689
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:48,900
inject like packets into a ESP so trying

00:26:46,919 --> 00:26:50,549
to put<font color="#CCCCCC"> the confidentiality integrity and</font>

691
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:52,080
sort of encryption on it that you'd

692
00:26:50,549 --> 00:26:55,350
expect to see<font color="#E5E5E5"> in most safety-critical</font>

693
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:57,240
systems ideally<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is an interesting</font>

694
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:58,980
trope as an aside that the systems<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:01,500
we rely<font color="#CCCCCC"> on for the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bead the most secure</font>

696
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:03,630
and the most safety critical ironically

697
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:05,370
have the least security if you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">your iphone for instance and the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">this it i don't understand who decided</font>

704
00:27:13,290 --> 00:27:18,928
entirely so the first<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing we try to</font>

705
00:27:16,919 --> 00:27:20,610
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at is symmetric encryption so if</font>

share the secret key and then encrypt

708
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:26,100
their data with that and decrypt it on

where<font color="#CCCCCC"> the aircraft is or make false</font>

00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:37,740
used or<font color="#E5E5E5"> I used a s and Blowfish and</font>

714
00:27:36,570 --> 00:27:41,129
tried all those different combinations

715
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:42,540
out but there's some problems because

716
00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:44,070
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a really really small amount of</font>

717
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:45,840
space it's smaller than the block size

718
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:47,189
from those block ciphers so you end up

719
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:49,699
<font color="#CCCCCC">having to use a stream cipher which</font>

720
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:52,230
isn't ideal but you can use a

721
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:54,049
deterministic Mansour initialization

722
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:58,799
vector so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not really an issue</font>

723
00:27:54,049 --> 00:28:01,500
interestingly about five<font color="#E5E5E5"> years six years</font>

724
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:02,668
ago someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> wrote a military paper about</font>

725
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:05,429
using this sort of symmetric encryption

726
00:28:02,669 --> 00:28:07,110
for a military<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> DSP system where you</font>

727
00:28:05,429 --> 00:28:09,600
have symmetric encryption on it

728
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:10,979
and then you detect whether at the plate

729
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:13,290
the plaintext is meaningful because

730
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:14,910
obviously if you don't have the secret

731
00:28:13,290 --> 00:28:17,340
encryption key you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> still make a</font>

732
00:28:14,910 --> 00:28:19,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">message and it will get decrypted but it</font>

733
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:21,059
will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be garbage so the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> question is can</font>

734
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:22,440
you work out if that's garbage or is

735
00:28:21,059 --> 00:28:24,720
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> adsb receive your just going to go</font>

736
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:26,880
yet there's an aircraft there and just

737
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:28,440
blindly accept it<font color="#CCCCCC"> and so at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this point</font>

738
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:30,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">you have to put some sort of heuristics</font>

739
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:32,340
in to try and work out does that make

740
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:34,130
any sense is that meaningful plain text

741
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:36,299
and then do something based<font color="#E5E5E5"> on that</font>

742
00:28:34,130 --> 00:28:37,290
whether the actual military system works

743
00:28:36,299 --> 00:28:39,299
like that I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know because they</font>

744
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:40,980
don't publish it but that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

745
00:28:39,299 --> 00:28:42,960
interesting idea put forward to sort of

746
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:47,100
provide some authentication via just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

747
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:49,140
single secret key and stream ciphers so

748
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:51,030
interesting question for<font color="#CCCCCC"> us as aviation</font>

749
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:52,350
people is does that slow it down so if

750
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:54,990
you put encryption on it it's going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

751
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:57,570
slow down back<font color="#CCCCCC"> by how much</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so compared</font>

752
00:28:54,990 --> 00:28:59,010
to the solid<font color="#E5E5E5"> lines are just normal adsb</font>

753
00:28:57,570 --> 00:29:03,270
and then the dotted lines on the top are

754
00:28:59,010 --> 00:29:04,590
encrypted with a SCF be there actually

755
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:06,900
wasn't that much an increase in times

756
00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:09,540
it's about 100 some fifty hundred and

757
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:11,730
twenty percent extra time over just

758
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:13,470
normal plain<font color="#CCCCCC"> atsb and the reason that</font>

759
00:29:11,730 --> 00:29:14,669
matters if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I put that in context is if</font>

760
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:16,620
you're an airliner<font color="#E5E5E5"> traveling it sort of</font>

761
00:29:14,669 --> 00:29:18,600
900 kilometers an hour if you have a

762
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:20,428
delay of one second that<font color="#CCCCCC"> equals two</font>

763
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:22,649
hundred<font color="#CCCCCC"> and sixty-five meters that</font>

764
00:29:20,429 --> 00:29:24,780
you've closed between your target so if

765
00:29:22,650 --> 00:29:26,790
your thing takes one second longer to

766
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:28,230
decode something that means that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

767
00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:29,639
a quarter<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit kilometer closer to</font>

768
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:32,669
hitting the other plane which isn't

769
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:35,280
great so obviously there's some issues

770
00:29:32,669 --> 00:29:37,169
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that if one person finds</font>

771
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:39,030
out the key that you don't want to find

772
00:29:37,169 --> 00:29:40,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">out the key you then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have to change</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

773
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:43,470
encryption key on every single aircraft

774
00:29:40,530 --> 00:29:47,520
in the world which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of aircraft</font>

775
00:29:43,470 --> 00:29:50,220
so if airbus has 15,000 372 aircraft on

776
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:51,480
order unload at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the moment so if you</font>

777
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:53,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't have to change all of that</font>

778
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:55,230
aircraft all the keys on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the aircraft</font>

779
00:29:53,370 --> 00:29:57,059
that you haven't built yet because

780
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:58,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">someone found out the key or so probably</font>

781
00:29:57,059 --> 00:30:01,110
someone at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this conference found out</font>

782
00:29:58,919 --> 00:30:02,730
this the one secret key to your device

783
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:04,080
and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to work in the</font>

784
00:30:02,730 --> 00:30:05,370
military it sort of works because you've

785
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:06,899
got a smaller number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of aircraft so you</font>

786
00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:08,520
can just<font color="#E5E5E5"> go on and plug it USB stick</font>

787
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:09,240
into each one and do that but that

788
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:10,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">doesn't really it's not really</font>

789
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:15,570
distributed enough for a civil<font color="#E5E5E5"> aviation</font>

790
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:17,850
solution the rest of the solutions are

791
00:30:15,570 --> 00:30:20,200
used because of the we have

792
00:30:17,850 --> 00:30:22,449
this really<font color="#E5E5E5"> really small amount of data</font>

793
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:24,190
there's no extra room<font color="#CCCCCC"> to put stuff on</font>

794
00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:26,800
it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> like you can suddenly add</font>

795
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:28,180
another 128 bytes on the end there's

796
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:30,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">just nowhere for it to go so you have to</font>

797
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:32,680
have a second channel to put data inside

798
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:35,290
so luckily there's a sort of work around

799
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:38,380
for that in that like I<font color="#E5E5E5"> said</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at a DSPs</font>

800
00:30:35,290 --> 00:30:40,690
type 17 and there are type 24 type<font color="#CCCCCC"> 24</font>

801
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:42,010
messages that had defined where you put

802
00:30:40,690 --> 00:30:44,920
24 at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the beginning and then you can</font>

803
00:30:42,010 --> 00:30:47,620
have 80 bits of arbitrary data and then

804
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:51,610
you can like<font color="#E5E5E5"> smush eight of those</font>

805
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:53,679
together to get 1620 bits I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

806
00:30:51,610 --> 00:30:54,850
data in a block so you transmit eight of

807
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:56,520
these messages<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the block and you get</font>

808
00:30:54,850 --> 00:30:58,899
that large amount of data out at the end

809
00:30:56,520 --> 00:31:00,160
so I defined a sort of custom protocol

810
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:01,900
based on that where you tie it in with

811
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:04,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">the a coward rest of the aircraft you're</font>

812
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:05,830
transmitting you have your data block of

813
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:08,470
generic data whatever it might be and

814
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:10,750
then at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> end rather than doing a</font>

815
00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:12,280
parity check of this data you put the

816
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:14,440
CRC of the message that you're referring

817
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:16,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">to so say you want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sign another</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> adsb</font>

818
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:18,370
message you take the CRC of that message

819
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:19,540
and put at the end and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can</font>

820
00:31:18,370 --> 00:31:21,729
reference all this to<font color="#CCCCCC"> that one</font>

821
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:23,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">particular message so there's two</font>

822
00:31:21,730 --> 00:31:25,390
schemes that I developed users the first

823
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:27,280
of these is an authenticated encryption

824
00:31:25,390 --> 00:31:29,170
and decryption so like I said with a

825
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:30,460
symmetric you don't get authentication

826
00:31:29,170 --> 00:31:33,340
automatically you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of put</font>

827
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:35,920
the heuristics on top of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it to make sure</font>

828
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:37,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">that works but if you use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a out</font>

829
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:39,400
scheme then you get authentication so

830
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:40,959
you can tell using this tag whether the

831
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:43,180
person actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the right key to</font>

832
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:45,460
make the message so<font color="#E5E5E5"> essentially you have</font>

833
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:46,840
your<font color="#CCCCCC"> adsb message at the top and you put</font>

834
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:48,370
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> into the encrypted with your secret</font>

835
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:52,480
key which is symmetric again

836
00:31:48,370 --> 00:31:54,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">unfortunately and a nonce value and out</font>

837
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:55,930
of that you get an encrypted<font color="#CCCCCC"> adsb</font>

838
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:58,179
message so that stream cipher<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

839
00:31:55,930 --> 00:32:00,430
encrypted and an authentication tag

840
00:31:58,180 --> 00:32:02,770
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> essentially an md5 hash that</font>

841
00:32:00,430 --> 00:32:05,590
sort of length and then you can split

842
00:32:02,770 --> 00:32:07,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">that between</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 3 24 messages and then</font>

843
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:09,370
transmit those so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get one of a dsb</font>

844
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:11,530
message and then three other messages

845
00:32:09,370 --> 00:32:13,000
for each one then the other end you

846
00:32:11,530 --> 00:32:14,350
receive<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of those and you put them</font>

847
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">into a message queue and once all four</font>

848
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:18,399
of those<font color="#CCCCCC"> messages are received you can</font>

849
00:32:16,690 --> 00:32:20,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">then put</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them into a decoder with the</font>

850
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:21,700
secret key and the deterministic notes

851
00:32:20,410 --> 00:32:25,020
that you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> work out and then you get a</font>

852
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:28,120
decrypted validated adsb message so win

853
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:29,950
however it's still symmetric so you need

854
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:30,969
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> key on both sides the other</font>

855
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:33,400
disadvantage is

856
00:32:30,970 --> 00:32:35,559
for everyone a dsb message you need

857
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:37,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">three you type 24 messages to make that</font>

858
00:32:35,559 --> 00:32:38,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">work now I remember what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I said the</font>

859
00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:41,919
smallest number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of messages you could</font>

860
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:43,870
have was to BDS 051 ident packet and<font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font>

861
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:45,669
velocity packet that<font color="#E5E5E5"> means you need 12</font>

862
00:32:43,870 --> 00:32:48,370
messages then just to transmit those

863
00:32:45,669 --> 00:32:51,070
four messages so you're reducing the

864
00:32:48,370 --> 00:32:53,770
band width of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ad SB system by 75%</font>

865
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:55,960
pretty much and at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> moment a DSP news</font>

866
00:32:53,770 --> 00:32:58,240
operating a nearly max capacity around

867
00:32:55,960 --> 00:33:00,250
Heathrow and place like Los Angeles so

868
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:01,299
reducing it by<font color="#E5E5E5"> seventy-five percent if</font>

869
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:04,360
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> turn around to heat her and said</font>

870
00:33:01,299 --> 00:33:05,980
sorry you can have security but you'll

871
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:07,330
have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> fly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a quarter of the aircraft</font>

872
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:08,470
that you're flying at the moment they're

873
00:33:07,330 --> 00:33:10,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably not going to take you up on</font>

874
00:33:08,470 --> 00:33:13,840
that so that's a massive downside for

875
00:33:10,809 --> 00:33:15,610
this an alternative to that is if you

876
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:18,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">just use the hash message authentication</font>

877
00:33:15,610 --> 00:33:21,158
code so like an md5<font color="#CCCCCC"> H</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mark you'd get the</font>

878
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:23,230
three type 24 messages but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you wouldn't</font>

879
00:33:21,159 --> 00:33:25,330
get the encryption and that's a plus and

880
00:33:23,230 --> 00:33:27,010
a negative so the plus is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

881
00:33:25,330 --> 00:33:28,990
wouldn't have to change any of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> adsb</font>

882
00:33:27,010 --> 00:33:30,100
hardware so there'll be an enormous cost

883
00:33:28,990 --> 00:33:32,320
reduction because you'll just send the

884
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:33,428
ATSB messages but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the downside is you</font>

885
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:34,990
wouldn't get the encryption so you still

886
00:33:33,429 --> 00:33:36,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">have a surveillance risk even though you</font>

887
00:33:34,990 --> 00:33:38,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">validate</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all of those original messages</font>

888
00:33:36,490 --> 00:33:41,230
and so there's ups and downs from a

889
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:43,000
different stuff the second side of it is

890
00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:44,789
only some research done by some guys on

891
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:47,070
vehicle<font color="#E5E5E5"> automotive so putting</font>

892
00:33:44,789 --> 00:33:50,710
authorization and signing on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the can bus</font>

893
00:33:47,070 --> 00:33:52,389
and they used lipstick curve

894
00:33:50,710 --> 00:33:53,740
cryptography<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do signatures because</font>

895
00:33:52,390 --> 00:33:56,260
they're very very<font color="#E5E5E5"> small signatures</font>

896
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:59,289
essentially get out<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the end so i use</font>

897
00:33:56,260 --> 00:34:01,539
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> nist one on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> p curve and again</font>

898
00:33:59,289 --> 00:34:03,190
to the i do is you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> your set of four</font>

899
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:05,650
messages that you need to send that's

900
00:34:03,190 --> 00:34:06,970
your block of state data basically you

901
00:34:05,650 --> 00:34:08,500
take all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the data from that and then</font>

902
00:34:06,970 --> 00:34:10,359
you then sign it with an aircraft

903
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:12,580
private key that you sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of burn into</font>

904
00:34:10,359 --> 00:34:16,089
the firmware of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> receiver then you</font>

905
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:18,159
get a 384-bit signature now in the grand

906
00:34:16,089 --> 00:34:19,330
scheme of computing that's tiny right so

907
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:21,909
that's nothing you could send that over

908
00:34:19,330 --> 00:34:24,069
things however in this protocol you need

909
00:34:21,909 --> 00:34:27,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">seven type 24 messages to send that</font>

910
00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:28,300
384-bit signature so you can see in the

911
00:34:27,129 --> 00:34:31,000
moment working with these sort of legacy

912
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:32,649
protocols and sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of very tiresome but</font>

913
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,359
how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> i fit all of this into the</font>

914
00:34:32,649 --> 00:34:35,770
smallest amount of space possible

915
00:34:34,359 --> 00:34:38,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">because there's nowhere left for its</font>

916
00:34:35,770 --> 00:34:40,330
grow so the other end you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get your for a</font>

917
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:42,010
DSP messages in your<font color="#CCCCCC"> seven type 24</font>

918
00:34:40,330 --> 00:34:44,230
messages and then you

919
00:34:42,010 --> 00:34:46,540
cup in a public key database what the

920
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:50,168
aircraft public key that it's saying it

921
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:52,210
is by the account address and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

922
00:34:50,168 --> 00:34:53,649
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> the payloads and you reconstruct the</font>

923
00:34:52,210 --> 00:34:55,510
signature by putting all type 24

924
00:34:53,649 --> 00:34:56,859
messages together and then you can put

925
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:59,410
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> into a verifier with the public key</font>

926
00:34:56,860 --> 00:35:01,480
and say yes those five messages or four

927
00:34:59,410 --> 00:35:02,920
message rather were sent by the aircraft

928
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:05,590
with that public key so then you

929
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:07,120
validated that set of messages so that

930
00:35:05,590 --> 00:35:08,620
works in that sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the advantage of</font>

931
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:09,970
that is you have validation and it's

932
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:12,910
scalable so you can have a database

933
00:35:09,970 --> 00:35:13,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">somewhere of program and public keys and</font>

934
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:15,940
then you can validate that all the

935
00:35:13,990 --> 00:35:18,729
aircraft are there however on the

936
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:20,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">downside you need a database of aircraft</font>

937
00:35:18,730 --> 00:35:21,940
public and private keys and you need to

938
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:23,470
protect<font color="#E5E5E5"> that so that becomes a more info</font>

939
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:25,390
SEC problem and then you have all<font color="#E5E5E5"> sorts</font>

940
00:35:23,470 --> 00:35:27,790
of issues amount revocation what happens

941
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:29,710
if someone like pretends or steals and

942
00:35:27,790 --> 00:35:31,360
aircraft private key can you<font color="#E5E5E5"> revoke that</font>

943
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:33,850
across all the databases in the world

944
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:35,710
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that sort of fun stuff but another</font>

945
00:35:33,850 --> 00:35:39,069
upside is you could just<font color="#E5E5E5"> have this whole</font>

946
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:40,390
side as a separate box basically rather

947
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:42,640
than doing anything to the eddies be

948
00:35:40,390 --> 00:35:44,020
receiver so you have a crypto<font color="#CCCCCC"> bolt on</font>

949
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:46,000
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> that signs everything and</font>

950
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:47,470
transmits it so again there's ups and

951
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,660
downs all the different sides<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it but</font>

952
00:35:47,470 --> 00:35:52,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's is managing that risk in doing that</font>

953
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:54,399
an improvement over the symmetrical

954
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:56,709
authentication as well is that what it's

955
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:59,170
only<font color="#E5E5E5"> seven messages for reform messages</font>

956
00:35:56,710 --> 00:36:01,510
so it's not a<font color="#CCCCCC"> 75</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> percent reduction it's</font>

957
00:35:59,170 --> 00:36:04,180
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> fifty-eight percent reduction but</font>

958
00:36:01,510 --> 00:36:05,560
still if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you said to Heathrow sorry you</font>

959
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:06,669
know I know we said a quarter last time

960
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:08,200
you can fly fifty percent of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

961
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:09,490
aircraft that's better<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're still</font>

962
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:10,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">that still we're going to cut it really</font>

963
00:36:09,490 --> 00:36:12,520
so you need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> find some sort of</font>

964
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:16,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">out-of-band channel to send that</font>

965
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:17,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">information down so some other defenses</font>

966
00:36:16,210 --> 00:36:20,020
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I didn't really do but you could do</font>

967
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:22,000
is you could do more sort of what active

968
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:24,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">tcas does but better because that's</font>

969
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,990
still pretty awful you can do distance

970
00:36:24,550 --> 00:36:27,550
pounding protocols where you send a

971
00:36:25,990 --> 00:36:30,100
message<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then see what the delay is</font>

972
00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:31,600
between the two to work out the range

973
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:33,190
and that gives you sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a circle of</font>

974
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:34,750
range within which the aircraft could be

975
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:38,020
and then use that to validate whether

976
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:39,760
the a DSP data is right some University

977
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:42,520
of Cambridge goes to some work on<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

978
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:43,900
for off it so we all do<font color="#E5E5E5"> long range off</font>

979
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:46,210
it attacks that sort of stuff so

980
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:47,980
sniffing badges or replaying it over a

981
00:36:46,210 --> 00:36:49,690
long distance so<font color="#E5E5E5"> using distance pounding</font>

982
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:50,980
you could work out whether that badge is

983
00:36:49,690 --> 00:36:52,359
actually anywhere near the reader

984
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:54,369
and whether<font color="#CCCCCC"> it should talk to it or not</font>

985
00:36:52,359 --> 00:36:55,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">which is quite</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting but it</font>

986
00:36:54,369 --> 00:36:57,310
doesn't need<font color="#E5E5E5"> a completely new radio</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

987
00:36:55,900 --> 00:37:00,060
a completely new transmission system and

988
00:36:57,310 --> 00:37:02,380
all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this inordinate amounts</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of money</font>

989
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:04,270
another small change that you could do

990
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:06,460
is a policy<font color="#E5E5E5"> change so at the moment the</font>

991
00:37:04,270 --> 00:37:09,520
FAA's response to a DSP injection is

992
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:11,170
it's fine we accept<font color="#CCCCCC"> that because the</font>

993
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:13,240
ground station<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have lots of ground</font>

994
00:37:11,170 --> 00:37:14,980
stations so we can triangulate where the

995
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:17,049
transmitter is<font color="#E5E5E5"> and say that it's not</font>

00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:18,430

air<font color="#E5E5E5"> traffic control can tell the</font>

999
00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:23,470
aircraft is but the aircraft in the air

1000
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:25,450
has one antenna so it can't tell whether

1001
00:37:23,470 --> 00:37:27,490
that aircraft is where acidities it just

1002
00:37:25,450 --> 00:37:28,480
knows that<font color="#E5E5E5"> something's talking to it and</font>

1003
00:37:27,490 --> 00:37:29,890
maybe you've had<font color="#E5E5E5"> a directional antenna</font>

1004
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:31,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can tell what the bearing is but</font>

1005
00:37:29,890 --> 00:37:32,470
still<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have the bearing it does</font>

1006

matter where along the wall you could be

1007
00:37:32,470 --> 00:37:37,000
right up in front of it so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's not</font>

1008
00:37:34,690 --> 00:37:38,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">really a great defense so making just a</font>

1009
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:41,140
simple policy change the way<font color="#CCCCCC"> tcas works</font>

1010
00:37:38,770 --> 00:37:43,150
as<font color="#CCCCCC"> you could say air traffic control has</font>

1011
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:44,529
a special code word or something that if

1012
00:37:43,150 --> 00:37:46,000
they say this code word<font color="#E5E5E5"> then the</font>

1013
00:37:44,530 --> 00:37:47,710
resolution advisory doesn't apply

00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,810
anymore it's false we know it's false

and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll tell you that because at the</font>

1016

1018
00:37:52,869 --> 00:37:57,760
malicious because of the way the RA

1019
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:59,950
system is set up however and we have

1020
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:01,510
another downside here as soon as you

1021
00:37:59,950 --> 00:38:04,240
start telling pilots that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they can</font>

1022
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:06,100
ignore resolution advisories more pilots

1023
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:08,259
say they ignore resolution advisor using

1024
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:09,670
crash into other planes and so there is

1025
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:12,130
an enormous<font color="#E5E5E5"> amount at the moment you do</font>

1026
00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:13,030
a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of research about pilots who in</font>

fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you watch air crash</font>

1028
00:38:13,030 --> 00:38:16,780
investigation most of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> time it's the</font>

1029
00:38:15,310 --> 00:38:18,070
pilot has ignored the bleeping bit of

1030
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:19,900
hardware<font color="#E5E5E5"> that says there's an aircraft</font>

1031
00:38:18,070 --> 00:38:23,080
coming and just goes<font color="#E5E5E5"> no it must be wrong</font>

1032
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:24,700
and just plow straight on into it I mean

1033
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:26,619
go away<font color="#E5E5E5"> and look it up go away look away</font>

1034
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:28,089
across pronunciation most of the

1035
00:38:26,619 --> 00:38:29,440
accidents will be the pilot planning it

1036
00:38:28,090 --> 00:38:32,020
into something rather than<font color="#E5E5E5"> the computer</font>

1037
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:33,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">doing something wrong so again when you</font>

1038
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:35,200
tell pilots are it's fine you can just

1039
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:36,609
ignore resolution visor is you open up a

1040
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:38,680
whole new can of worms and pilot

1041
00:38:36,609 --> 00:38:39,910
training which isn't necessarily where

1042
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:41,529
you want to go but if it's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> only</font>

1043
00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:45,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing that stopped people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> jeck ting</font>

1044
00:38:41,530 --> 00:38:46,270
stuff then<font color="#E5E5E5"> you might want to do that so</font>

1045
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:47,680
as with all research there are some

1046
00:38:46,270 --> 00:38:50,170
caveats and there's some places you go

1047
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:52,180
further wet and some future work so the

1048
00:38:50,170 --> 00:38:53,560
first caveat is this isn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually a</font>

1049
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:54,970
real aircraft because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I but it didn't</font>

1050
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:56,920
stretch to getting a real aircraft and

1051
00:38:54,970 --> 00:38:58,270
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a simulator and I've done</font>

1052
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:59,500
what I've done a simulator so any

1053
00:38:58,270 --> 00:39:01,300
extrapolation of that to an actual

1054
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:03,250
aircraft you have to take it<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a</font>

1055
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:04,069
pinch of salt because it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> an actual</font>

1056
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:07,130
aircraft it's

1057
00:39:04,069 --> 00:39:09,619
we're running<font color="#CCCCCC"> on my laptop so the exact</font>

1058
00:39:07,130 --> 00:39:11,239
a DSP in interface with<font color="#CCCCCC"> TKS might not do</font>

1059
00:39:09,619 --> 00:39:13,160
a resolution advisory it might<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

1060
00:39:11,239 --> 00:39:14,449
display it as traffic and without having

1061
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:16,999
an aircraft can't retail it's

1062
00:39:14,449 --> 00:39:19,789
unfortunate<font color="#E5E5E5"> however and I have some</font>

1063
00:39:16,999 --> 00:39:21,288
caveats to my cabbie arts active<font color="#CCCCCC"> tcas</font>

1064
00:39:19,789 --> 00:39:22,910
doesn't have any security either there's

1065
00:39:21,289 --> 00:39:24,319
no encryption authentication on that and

1066
00:39:22,910 --> 00:39:27,170
that's a whole new category that you can

1067
00:39:24,319 --> 00:39:28,519
play around with injecting into if you

1068
00:39:27,170 --> 00:39:30,079
clouded a<font color="#CCCCCC"> tcas display with</font>

1069
00:39:28,519 --> 00:39:31,968
non-threatening traffic you're still

1070
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:33,499
increasing the pilot workload and the

1071
00:39:31,969 --> 00:39:36,019
pilot has to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things on an</font>

1072
00:39:33,499 --> 00:39:37,430
airliner as is normal job so if you

1073
00:39:36,019 --> 00:39:38,808
distract some away from that you raise

1074
00:39:37,430 --> 00:39:41,989
the risk of there being an instant and

1075
00:39:38,809 --> 00:39:43,369
in the aviation is in my industry we're

1076
00:39:41,989 --> 00:39:45,440
not very risk tolerant we don't like

1077
00:39:43,369 --> 00:39:47,749
risks because a risk means that your

1078
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:49,190
multi-million pound aircraft with

1079
00:39:47,749 --> 00:39:50,629
hundreds of people on board could go

1080
00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:53,329
plowing into a mountain and that's more

1081
00:39:50,630 --> 00:39:54,769
a great thing so if even if the

1082
00:39:53,329 --> 00:39:58,160
likelihood of it is small it's still a

1083
00:39:54,769 --> 00:39:59,419
fairly major risk overall and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next</font>

1084
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:00,859
point that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to bring onto is there</font>

1085
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:02,839
are happy people saying all you can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> t casters</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other way but in the future</font>

1087
00:40:02,839 --> 00:40:07,069
they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> bringing something called a Cass</font>

1089

00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:12,949
likely on<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and this is part of that</font>

1092
00:40:12,949 --> 00:40:17,239
improvement on this system where my

1093
00:40:14,930 --> 00:40:19,399
attack might not work is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> my attack</font>

1094

1095
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:24,559
input to the system for this particular

1096
00:40:20,749 --> 00:40:26,689
branch of a gas will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a DSP so this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

1097
00:40:24,559 --> 00:40:28,400
a new system where you take just a DSP

1098
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:31,690
data and you bring<font color="#E5E5E5"> it in and then you do</font>

1099
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:35,359
collision avoidance based purely on that

1100
00:40:31,690 --> 00:40:36,559
that is the reaction I had oh yeah so if

1101
00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:38,029
you want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> go and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> read up on that and</font>

1102
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:40,190
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> call that later or I'll try and</font>

1103
00:40:38,029 --> 00:40:42,319
tweet and put this presentations out but

1104
00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:43,759
they're bringing in this new next-gen

1105
00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:45,739
system and they want all of this stuff

1106
00:40:43,759 --> 00:40:50,239
with no security no authentication

1107
00:40:45,739 --> 00:40:52,729
nothing on it so in conclusion a DSP is

1108
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:54,319
flawed its legacy it was legacy when it

1109
00:40:52,729 --> 00:40:55,669
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> invented in 2008 because I have</font>

1110
00:40:54,319 --> 00:40:58,190
nothing and now its next-generation

1111
00:40:55,670 --> 00:40:59,749
apparently anyone can listen in to

1112
00:40:58,190 --> 00:41:02,119
traffic's as that whole can<font color="#E5E5E5"> of worms</font>

1113
00:40:59,749 --> 00:41:03,769
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we haven't opened ground stations</font>

1114
00:41:02,119 --> 00:41:05,569
can filter out ghost aircraft but the

1115
00:41:03,769 --> 00:41:07,339
aircraft themselves which are remember

1116
00:41:05,569 --> 00:41:09,920
the important bit of this equation can't

1117
00:41:07,339 --> 00:41:11,239
do any<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that anyone could pretend to</font>

00:41:11,239 --> 00:41:15,319

00:41:12,949 --> 00:41:17,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">what air traffic control says so you</font>

1121
00:41:15,319 --> 00:41:17,540
have mitigations but they either reduce

00:41:17,029 --> 00:41:19,220
the bandwidth

1123
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:20,210
all they have other knock-on effects or

1124
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:22,730
there's a whole other<font color="#E5E5E5"> can of worms</font>

1125
00:41:20,210 --> 00:41:25,250
