<font color="#CCCCCC">Thanks so yeah I'm camp cannon I'm from</font>

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:07,859
bae and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about</font>

00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:11,010
intelligence-led<font color="#E5E5E5"> pen testing but in</font>

4
00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:14,190
specific the use of reversed malware in

5
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:18,060
live pen tests so one of the challenges

6
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:20,520
that spawned the cbest program and star

7
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:22,500
was that we were<font color="#E5E5E5"> being asked</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to make</font>

8
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:24,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">things seem more real to to look more</font>

9
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:27,090
like attackers and less like pen testers

10
00:00:24,769 --> 00:00:30,000
fantasies<font color="#E5E5E5"> like you know their own idea</font>

11
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:31,529
of what attacks are like<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we use our</font>

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,030
own tools and our own<font color="#E5E5E5"> techniques each</font>

13
00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:35,460
time and really what we're doing is is

14
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:37,649
attacking as ourselves not as another

15
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:41,100
person so here came the the threat

16
00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:42,930
insurgents requirement of<font color="#E5E5E5"> see best so</font>

17
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:44,820
yeah it is the core messages that you

18
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:47,969
know we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to replicate attacker is</font>

19
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:49,110
not just just do our own attacks and

20
00:00:47,969 --> 00:00:50,370
it's a sort of the reverse of what we

21
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:52,379
been doing the<font color="#CCCCCC"> pentacene team for quite</font>

22
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:53,910
a long time we we've had tools created

23
00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:56,849
for testing purposes getting reused by

24
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:58,739
malicious attackers in the wild but<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

25
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:01,230
we want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do is use the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tools that</font>

27
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:05,399
themselves repurpose them for testing

28
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,509
however being the risk-averse types that

29
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,390
we are we had to consider potential

30
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:10,710
pitfalls etc etc what are the technical

31
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:13,140
issues whether it's actually going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

32
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:14,309
useful<font color="#E5E5E5"> and whether this is a legal</font>

33
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:17,070
issues whether we could be breaking the

34
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:18,450
law I don't want a malware developer

35
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:20,699
knocking on my door saying hey you owe

36
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:23,250
me money for using my kit without my

37
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:24,930

38
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:26,880
issues could be actually compromised our

00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:28,490
client security so I'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go all</font>

40
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:31,560
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> way through</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the issues with that</font>

41
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:33,509

famed threat intelligence master with me

43
00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:36,930
to do the threat intelligence side of

44
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:38,159
things and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm a layman at best at</font>

45
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:39,540
threat intelligence but unfortunately

46
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,189
he's somewhere exotic right now doing

47
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:46,040
something far more interesting as usual

48
00:01:41,189 --> 00:01:48,148
so it's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be me before</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I get into</font>

or red teaming from from yesteryear when

56
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:05,610
we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> done is repackaged it and real</font>

57
00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:07,679
able it and I that is a fair question it

58
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:09,728
was a bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a brutal question from from</font>

59
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,970
cross<font color="#E5E5E5"> corner and it threw me</font>

60
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:14,890
but it's it's legit and what I'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

61
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:16,299
say is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's very similar to red</font>

62
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:17,559
teaming we use very similar techniques

63
00:02:16,299 --> 00:02:19,659
but we refine them we're much more

64
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:21,970
restrained and we try to mimic attacker

65
00:02:19,659 --> 00:02:23,769
behavior rather than saying I'm a pen

66
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:27,099
tester I know how to do red<font color="#CCCCCC"> teams and so</font>

67
00:02:23,769 --> 00:02:28,269
I do the<font color="#CCCCCC"> red</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> team's that way I think</font>

68
00:02:27,099 --> 00:02:31,929
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the big difference so just put</font>

69
00:02:28,269 --> 00:02:34,510
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> in mind cool so threat intelligence</font>

70
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:35,950
side of things Adrian will tell you that

71
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:37,298
over<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> past couple of decades the</font>

72
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:39,548
cyber threat landscape has evolved quite

73
00:02:37,299 --> 00:02:41,890
considerably back in the 1990s when he

74
00:02:39,549 --> 00:02:43,329
was testing and I was not the sort of

75
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:45,309
threats that concern people<font color="#CCCCCC"> with a kind</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">of loan hacker breaking into systems the</font>

78
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:50,950
freaking and earlier they were the

00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:58,899
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it wasn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really a big big</font>

83
00:02:57,069 --> 00:03:01,119
financial gain for them<font color="#E5E5E5"> their attack</font>

84
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:02,920
vectors where what we described now is

85
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,780
the front door so defending against them

86
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:06,339
was reasonably straightforward making

87
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:07,750
passwords more complex moving away from

88
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:09,730
through character passwords that kind of

89
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:13,239
thing putting firewalls in and improving

90
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:15,340
sounded stuff and then over the the turn

91
00:03:13,239 --> 00:03:17,769
of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> millennium we enter what adrian</font>

92
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:19,720
has referred to as the virus era he<font color="#E5E5E5"> got</font>

93
00:03:17,769 --> 00:03:21,400
some very<font color="#E5E5E5"> grand</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Wells terms computer</font>

94
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:22,599
viruses did exist before 2000 but two

95
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,709
things changed around this time there

96
00:03:22,599 --> 00:03:25,869
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a huge increase in connectivity</font>

97
00:03:23,709 --> 00:03:27,489
thanks to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and expansion</font>

98
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:30,370
features in windows pcs and servers to

99
00:03:27,489 --> 00:03:32,620
exploit so yeah you know we start having

100
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:33,730
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> big name viruses coming out it start</font>

101
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:34,959
to become more<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a market to make</font>

102
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:38,410

00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:40,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">world not just for fun the virus era</font>

104
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:41,799
apparently ends around two thousand six

105
00:03:40,329 --> 00:03:42,819
but this isn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> the end</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the story what</font>

106
00:03:41,799 --> 00:03:44,530
happened was a code is found themselves

107
00:03:42,819 --> 00:03:47,200
being recruited into the offensive

108

109
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:51,459
also by nation states and other people

110
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,900
and we started seeing more more well

111
00:03:51,459 --> 00:03:54,160
developed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to malware and this is when we</font>

112
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:56,109
start getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> interested in saying hey</font>

113
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:58,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay this isn't just I exploit a</font>

00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:04,480
interesting and we start going<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay this</font>

00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:05,440
is a proper<font color="#CCCCCC"> zero-days let's start</font>

reversing them and turning them into

120
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:12,250
exploit code for our kit and then what

121
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:15,400
we're in now is more the professional

122
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:16,660
era a nation-state attacks and obviously

123
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,459
they're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> all highly sophisticated</font>

124
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:19,780
we've seen the comment crew and they're

125
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:21,219
very basic attacks and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that kind of</font>

126
00:04:19,779 --> 00:04:22,039
thing and I I don't want to want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use</font>

the term

133
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:36,730
a long<font color="#E5E5E5"> time period so let's let's look</font>

at some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the stuff that we've found so</font>

we're going to use<font color="#E5E5E5"> are going to go</font>

136
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:42,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">through some real examples that we've</font>

137

seen recently and they're kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a line</font>

138
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:46,900
to the basic attack model of star

139
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:49,010
assessment or red team so infiltration

140
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:50,479
evasion after getting a foothold and

141
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:51,800
then establishing a commander control

forwards and send commands so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> look</font>

at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay the first one we're going to</font>

145
00:04:57,230 --> 00:05:01,490
talk about is a watering hole attack

146
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:03,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's most by far the most common</font>

147
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:06,140
technique that we've had now it<font color="#E5E5E5"> used to</font>

148
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:08,390
be email and web compromise but it's now

149
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:10,789
more specifically a watering hole attack

150
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:12,260
whilst email is still very popular<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

151
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:14,210
actors using additional services to

152
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:15,590
trick users we've witnessed a big rise

153
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:18,049
in the watering hole style of attack

154
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:19,820
over<font color="#E5E5E5"> recent years and you can see I mean</font>

155
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:21,320
there's no dates on that because

156
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:24,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">Adrienne doesn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like to make firm</font>

157
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:25,760
statements it's easy for<font color="#E5E5E5"> me if you laugh</font>

158
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:28,040
when<font color="#CCCCCC"> I make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> jokes s this makes it much</font>

159
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:29,120
easier so<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically the tactic behind</font>

160
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:30,830
watering hole attacks this is a much

161
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">more technical crowd than that I've</font>

162
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:33,229
previously presented to so I'm just

163
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:35,119
going to skimp on this bit but it's

164
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:36,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">basically you you compromise the site</font>

165
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,640
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know users going to use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you put</font>

166
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,310
some export<font color="#E5E5E5"> code on that and it</font>

167
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:41,539
redirects you to somewhere that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

168
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:43,520
put some proper export code or you just

169
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:45,050
exploit them on site so in attack you're

170
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,430
interested in compromising a government

171
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:47,990
agency would place their religious code

172
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:49,580
on sites such as embassies think tax

173
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:52,370
researchers and<font color="#CCCCCC"> technology websites</font>

174
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:54,260
think tanks specifically<font color="#E5E5E5"> have been known</font>

175
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:57,860
for being seen by us to be exploited

176
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:59,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">regularly so yeah they do this</font>

177
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:02,540
technically by creating an iframe link

178
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:04,490
on the type the target website this

179
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:05,870
specific example that we've seen often<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

180
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:08,270
single line of code just to force the

181
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:10,070
browser to load external content often

182
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:11,780
as well it does checking at this point

183
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:13,099
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure that the targets going to</font>

184
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:17,059
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> vulnerable otherwise it just leaves</font>

185
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:18,950
you on the normal site yeah so then our

186
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:20,690
attacker on the other hand has some

187
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:22,820
malicious code that they've hosted the

188
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:25,310
iframe redirects you to it and they hack

189
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:27,440
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh I used to be animated it's not</font>

190
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:29,240
animated anymore I'm sorry some

191
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,890
attackers are now adding IP whitelists

192
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:33,020
into their watering holes to ensure that

193
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:34,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">a very narrow set of targets but the</font>

194
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:35,870
high-value ones the government agencies

195
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:36,500
and so on<font color="#CCCCCC"> so forth so they get</font>

196
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:37,970
compromised

197
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,170
us<font color="#E5E5E5"> the hobbyists the people who like to</font>

198
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:41,390
go and<font color="#E5E5E5"> hunt these things and kick them</font>

199
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:42,800
in the teeth I'm actually going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

200
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:47,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">the place where the payload associate so</font>

201
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:50,060
we won't see it this is a bit more

202
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:51,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">sophisticated targeted attack and we see</font>

203
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:53,720
these things<font color="#E5E5E5"> make ok we are we still</font>

204
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:55,640
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at a group of individuals who</font>

205
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:58,280
are just motivated by ideology or by

206
00:06:55,640 --> 00:07:00,620
mainly financial gain or possibly just a

207
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:01,760
bit of fun are we<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually looking at</font>

208
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:03,950
someone now who's saying right you know

209
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:05,180
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going after this government and so</font>

210
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:06,680
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> so forth I'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to void using</font>

211
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:09,710
specific country names because i have a

212
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:12,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">a contract of my head that says I can't</font>

213
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:14,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">use real names so doesn't require any</font>

214
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:15,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">zero days and it's just cleverly crafted</font>

215
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:17,000
social engineering to run something that

216
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:21,850
he didn't realize<font color="#CCCCCC"> this actually malware</font>

217
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:24,169
oh it is animated<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay fair enough so</font>

218
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:25,970
yeah I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to go through</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the pros</font>

219
00:07:24,169 --> 00:07:28,039
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> cons of like doing a watering hole</font>

220
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:29,090
attack but I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's kind of basic</font>

221
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,770
what I really want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about later</font>

222
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:34,270
is the pros and<font color="#E5E5E5"> cons</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of using somebody</font>

223
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:40,210
elses watering hole attack let's move on

224
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:42,530
cool so<font color="#E5E5E5"> DLLs sideloading we saw attack</font>

225
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:46,090
and we were asked to come and respond to

226
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:48,590
attack in<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the energy sector in 2014</font>

227
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:50,799
it was there was three files that were

228
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:54,830
dropped and they were a side loaded by

229
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:57,140
antivirus which was pretty cool that

230
00:07:54,830 --> 00:08:00,380
said I'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> H dot exe is a legitimately</font>

231
00:07:57,140 --> 00:08:02,870
signed binary the dll was the only bit

232
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:04,790
that was different and it loaded the air

233
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:07,490
we go and it loaded the data from<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

234
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:08,720
file so the as far<font color="#E5E5E5"> as the system was</font>

235
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:11,090
concerned that's a legitimate fall

236
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,410
loading<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a legitimate dll but because</font>

237
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:14,169
there's no restriction from<font color="#CCCCCC"> dll's of</font>

238
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:18,020
being run it where<font color="#CCCCCC"> i absolutely fine and</font>

239
00:08:14,169 --> 00:08:22,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">i run our data or the email us users</font>

240
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:25,070
data and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it caused some big problems</font>

241
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:27,500
there we go Xander's Little Helper does

242
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:29,450
that LH i think is what we've called it

243
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:31,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not entirely sure of the country of</font>

244
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:34,490
origin of this product but they are

245
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:36,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">there we go it's a sign binary it isn't</font>

246
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:38,930
malicious and that is encrypted it took

247
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:40,218
us ages to go through it and yeah it

248
00:08:38,929 --> 00:08:41,630
cannot be<font color="#E5E5E5"> addressed directly windows</font>

249
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:43,099
without breaking expected functionality

250
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:45,740
instead it requires developers to ensure

251
00:08:43,099 --> 00:08:50,120
they code secured library loads AK

252
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:53,000
that's not my problem and finally

253
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:56,200
the last thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can talk about is</font>

254
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:59,360
commando control and doing it through

255
00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:01,100
JPEGs now yeah I'll talk about<font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font>

256
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">anecdotes around this later because this</font>

257
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:03,800
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of a basic attack that I've seen</font>

258
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:05,510
quite a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> times and I think most</font>

259
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:07,939
people can see it as being a standard

260
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:10,040
method of doing things but we were going

261
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:11,570
off to a one specific group and they

262
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:12,800
were<font color="#E5E5E5"> using legitimate content on</font>

263
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:15,050
compromised websites to hide what<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

264
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:16,099
were doing but one of the obvious<font color="#E5E5E5"> ones</font>

265
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:21,079
<font color="#CCCCCC">are the one things are doing a lot with</font>

266
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:23,540
JPG files let me go so yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> / espionage</font>

267
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:25,310
actors and they could update this in

268
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:26,420
real time<font color="#CCCCCC"> so we were seeing the website</font>

269
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:28,430
watching over time and seeing these

270
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:32,920
pictures changed nothing else changed so

271
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:38,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">we pulled down the the JPEGs and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> classes</font>

272
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:39,800
Adrian slides so yeah basically it ran

273
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,390
commands and what<font color="#CCCCCC"> exle trade data</font>

274
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:42,859
through the<font color="#CCCCCC"> JPEG and then get its new</font>

275
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:44,960
command from the next jpg and pull it

276
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:46,490
down the malware itself was just like a

277
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:48,589
standard exe it wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> that impressive</font>

278
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:50,360
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was just kind of an entertaining</font>

279
00:09:48,589 --> 00:09:51,620
way like a diversionary way of doing

280
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:54,440
things that was a bit more distracting

281
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:59,930
than what we usually see there we go

282
00:09:54,440 --> 00:10:01,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">Rose cool so yeah this is a redacted URL</font>

283
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:05,140
from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> campaign we saw I was going to</font>

284
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:08,569
take this out but it's a u.s. politician

285
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:10,610
who is runs his campaign from this

286
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:12,740
website we'll just call it<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jim's website</font>

287
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:14,750
but yeah there was a contact button I

288
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:16,160
was really basic it was small in the

289
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:18,589
corner I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> said something</font>

290
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:20,510
like go and inside<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they were</font>

291
00:10:18,589 --> 00:10:24,640
providing the me encrypted data that

292
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:27,890
they'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> actual treated so there we are</font>

293
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:29,480
you look at it<font color="#E5E5E5"> in in hex here the</font>

294
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:32,000
highlighted bites they denote the end of

295
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:34,400
end of file delimited 4.jpg so what's

296
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,660
the rest of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that afterwards I don't hear</font>

297
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:37,699
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask but you would ask if we were</font>

298
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:38,870
having<font color="#E5E5E5"> to want to want the render will</font>

299
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:40,190
read<font color="#E5E5E5"> down the bites until it hits this</font>

300
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:41,540
paradise and then display the image<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

301
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:42,830
then after that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it would it would just</font>

302
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:45,410
do nothing so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is where they were</font>

303
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:47,930
hiding that code so we perform basic

304
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:50,000
flip flip turns into a ski and it looks

305
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:52,670
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> bay 64 but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's also a simple</font>

306
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">vizionare</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> visionnaire our ground</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> SAP</font>

307
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:57,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">cipher on top of it this is a real</font>

308
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:58,969
example and it just returns an ID<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

309
00:10:57,290 --> 00:11:00,949
the command but standard windows come on

310
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:02,329
there we go so that's the the code we

311
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:03,350
had their to reverse it it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty</font>

312
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:06,589
basic

313
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:08,330
and there we are so sent the command and

314
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:10,220
that's the name of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the machine there</font>

315
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:14,240
don't go googling that you won't find

316
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:17,090
anything I'm promise you cool and yeah

317
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:18,320
there's another<font color="#CCCCCC"> example basically that's</font>

318
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:22,490
that's what it looks like once you

319
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:24,080
reverse it in Midway so when we<font color="#E5E5E5"> run the</font>

320
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:26,060
malware executable it now talk so what

321
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:27,380
we did was converted it so we would talk

322
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:29,300
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a server rather than their original</font>

323
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:30,590
one and<font color="#E5E5E5"> since we knew the algorithm it</font>

324
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:31,819
was running<font color="#E5E5E5"> we just started sending</font>

325
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:35,120
commands to it to see what it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font>

326
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:37,760
through and we worked out way of

327
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,780
basically using it for ourselves running

328
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:40,370
on our own service and so on so<font color="#CCCCCC"> forth</font>

329
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:42,290
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> examples from the</font>

330
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:44,150
cases<font color="#CCCCCC"> that our team our intelligence</font>

335
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:51,890
spent effort creating capabilities it

336
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:53,719
will compromise and remain undetected

337
00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:55,460
almost enterprise networks we can

00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:56,810
certainly both tuned penetration testing

also<font color="#E5E5E5"> gain inspiration from their</font>

341
00:11:58,010 --> 00:12:02,810
techniques or potentially repress the

all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the torrent elegent stuff done</font>

344
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:09,500
that's the stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> I know nothing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

345
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:13,130
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> great cool so yeah practical</font>

346
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:15,080
considerations whether we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can actually</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> these tools that we've found</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:20,000
inspiration from the more that we can

<font color="#CCCCCC">actually reverse them change the IP</font>

addresses<font color="#E5E5E5"> to our and once it is what I</font>

352
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:24,740
want to talk about<font color="#CCCCCC"> on us I think that's</font>

353
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:26,300
what the important thing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> there so</font>

354
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:28,340
let's talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about that watering hole</font>

355
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:30,160
attack the most primary that one of the

356
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:31,790
primary compromised methods we've seen

357
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:33,530
delivering a water and<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the time</font>

358
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:34,640
makes sense for<font color="#CCCCCC"> majority of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> curve for</font>

359
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:36,620
companies doing pen testing because it's

360
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:38,689
a broadly applicable tool the issue lies

361
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:40,280
however in delivery so I mean let's look

362
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:41,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">it from a practical consideration if</font>

363
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:44,319
we're doing a pen test on a specific

364
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:46,850
organization unless we comp one of their

365
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:48,920
websites that they're using<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe a web</font>

366
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:51,470
portal or an externally exposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> homepage</font>

367
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:53,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">that users are likely to be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> using it's</font>

368
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:54,830
not going to work right because we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't</font>

369
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:56,569
just compromise arbitrary sites that's

370
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:57,920
out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> scope so we now need to then</font>

371
00:12:56,570 --> 00:12:59,210
contact them all saying oh hey do you

372
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,110
mind if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we contact your third party and</font>

373
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:02,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">then we need to include them in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

374
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:03,290
contract and it becomes more and more

375
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:05,300
complicated so that's a bit of<font color="#CCCCCC"> an issue</font>

376
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:07,430
of using watering hole tax unless you

377
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:09,650
want to come<font color="#E5E5E5"> up with some fancy way of</font>

378
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:10,849
doing things and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so a solution to do</font>

379
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:13,579
this would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be tying it with a phishing</font>

380
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:15,110
attack and domain squatting<font color="#E5E5E5"> typo</font>

381
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:16,360
squatting kind of attack but then<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font>

382
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:18,279
moving away from a pure watering

383
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:21,010
attack which a an attacker would

384
00:13:18,279 --> 00:13:23,170
actually use so we're having to to adapt

385
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:25,029
the attack that that we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

386
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:26,560
replicate because we're incapable of

387
00:13:25,029 --> 00:13:31,660
doing it within contract limitations so

388
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:33,760
it doesn't really<font color="#CCCCCC"> work however it does</font>

389
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:35,350
straddle both a user<font color="#E5E5E5"> and attack and a</font>

390
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,490
browser security attack so<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's social</font>

391
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:37,870
engineering but you can also use<font color="#CCCCCC"> it to</font>

392
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:40,570
attack a browser so we're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> multiple</font>

393
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:42,640
things there yeah it's it's it's not

394
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:44,110
ideal and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then the biggest drawback of</font>

395
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:45,850
this is collateral damage because even

396
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:47,470
though we can whitelist IP addresses we

397
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:49,029
don't know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> those people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we're</font>

398
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:51,100
attacking<font color="#E5E5E5"> within scope and generally</font>

399
00:13:49,029 --> 00:13:54,220
speaking we attempt as pen testers to

400
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:55,899
avoid attacking users directly it's

401
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:57,579
difficult<font color="#CCCCCC"> to to repudiate in those</font>

402
00:13:55,899 --> 00:13:59,440
example in those situations and you can

403
00:13:57,579 --> 00:14:02,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">often end up in as I said collateral</font>

404
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:03,399
damage or attacking third parties or in

405
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:05,500
scope employees when they're on<font color="#E5E5E5"> their</font>

406
00:14:03,399 --> 00:14:11,440
own systems<font color="#E5E5E5"> at home so it it's not a</font>

407
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:13,480
controllable thing however we took one

408
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:16,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the tools to certain point where we</font>

409
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:19,570
could use<font color="#E5E5E5"> it ourselves and that's the</font>

410
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:22,930
this is the the command screen of it

411
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:25,060
it's pretty cool it was PHP so it was

412
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:26,800
like trivial to reverse and it

413
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:29,399
redirected everything back to our code

414
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:31,660
within a very short period of time and

415
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:32,680
you can run it from any web bailable web

416
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:35,380
page it comes with broad<font color="#E5E5E5"> range of</font>

417
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:38,560
functionality unfortunately you know as

418
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:42,910
I said using<font color="#E5E5E5"> this in anger using this in</font>

419
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:44,349
a pen test is quite difficult and the

420
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:46,810
biggest<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem we have here as well as</font>

421
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:48,550
it looks exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a real attacker</font>

422
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:51,430
because it belongs to a real attacker so

423
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:52,449
when we see something<font color="#CCCCCC"> from metasploit or</font>

424
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:54,339
something like that I meterpreter shell

425
00:14:52,449 --> 00:14:56,469
running on a system and they reported to

426
00:14:54,339 --> 00:14:57,850
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ciso and they go oh yeah that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fine</font>

427
00:14:56,470 --> 00:15:00,220
it's likely to be depends esters when

428
00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:03,940
they see something that looks this doll

429
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:05,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">gee if they do and report it back it's</font>

00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:39,730
the great thing about it is that the

<font color="#E5E5E5">using the one that we've got its</font>

518
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:18,280
a recognized binary by antivirus

519
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:20,290
everybody on<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know understands and</font>

520
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:22,240
season it has seen that attack when we

521
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:24,550
go and build our own one<font color="#E5E5E5"> in Python or go</font>

522
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,780
and builder and wanna bash or<font color="#CCCCCC"> PowerShell</font>

523
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:27,010
suddenly we've gone<font color="#CCCCCC"> around that and</font>

524
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:27,940
maybe we're predicting what's going to

525
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:29,350
happen in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the future but we're certainly</font>

526
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:32,250
not replicating the attacks<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there</font>

527
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:35,320
are around now which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the whole point</font>

528
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:36,340
so yeah I mean as i said<font color="#CCCCCC"> before building</font>

529
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:37,300
something like this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty</font>

530
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:38,970
straightforward why would you use<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

531
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:43,270
dodgy sourced one instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> of your own</font>

532
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:48,040
and we're aiming at<font color="#CCCCCC"> sock and mitigation</font>

533
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:49,840
focused pen tests then you know we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font>

534
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:52,360
to we need to make sure that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're</font>

535
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:54,129
replicating the attack in itself not

536
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:55,629
just replicating something that we know

537
00:18:54,130 --> 00:19:00,730
is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go through antivirus because</font>

538
00:18:55,630 --> 00:19:03,400
no one's ever seen it<font color="#CCCCCC"> before yeah so</font>

539
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:05,290
yeah we picked this because it was

540
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:08,020
something we'd seen recently and it was

541
00:19:05,290 --> 00:19:09,879
from one of the infamous apt groups

542
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:11,889
which was attributed publicly to a

543
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:12,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">government in the Far East last year and</font>

544
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:14,050
there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of case history available</font>

545
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:15,310
that can be used<font color="#E5E5E5"> the game buy-in from</font>

546
00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:16,480
customers which is what we're looking

547
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:18,399
for because we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure its</font>

548
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:20,080
real and<font color="#E5E5E5"> other attack vectors other</font>

549
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,670
networks defense teams face you know we

550
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:23,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to replicate all of those and it</font>

551
00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:24,580
has the benefit of being HTTP base which

552
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:27,640
means it's very straightforward and

553
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:30,189
often people or socks are tracking in

554
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:32,050
detail http-based traffic it's hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

555
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:33,520
ids IPS to identify because it just

556
00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:34,960
looks like<font color="#E5E5E5"> normal images and if you</font>

557
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:37,330
don't do<font color="#CCCCCC"> what our intern did which was</font>

558
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:39,940
just make an image which had the hex of

559
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:40,840
party THC in it and tried to just put

560

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> straight through and didn't</font>

561
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:45,699
understand why just putting headers and

562
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:49,660
footers of PNG file and I didn't get it

563
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:50,680
through AV yeah I've on the con side of

564
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:52,060
things even though the binary<font color="#CCCCCC"> hatches</font>

565
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:54,250
may change it could still<font color="#E5E5E5"> get picked up</font>

567

570
00:19:58,570 --> 00:20:02,019
we could attract additional attention if

574
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:11,080
know we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want for letter agencies</font>

career limiting conversation to explain

583
00:20:26,019 --> 00:20:36,340
and why it's turned up here cool so yeah

584
00:20:34,779 --> 00:20:37,960
whilst fully was falling out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of favor</font>

seen a threat actor apt style attacking

588
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:44,799
an organization is pretty bad it's

589
00:20:43,629 --> 00:20:46,719
probably not as bad<font color="#CCCCCC"> as causing a</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">the malware that we're trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to use in</font>

00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:09,879
these tests have we fully reversed it

601
00:21:08,019 --> 00:21:11,350
and if we go and use in a live attack I

602
00:21:09,879 --> 00:21:14,620
mean we're obviously liable for the kit

603
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:16,480
that we use and whilst we have a

604
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:18,489
world-class reverse engineers who can

605
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:20,139
pick apart malicious code like you know

606
00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:21,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">before they have their breakfast there's</font>

00:21:20,139 --> 00:21:23,229
always<font color="#CCCCCC"> the possibility that some</font>

608
00:21:21,279 --> 00:21:25,090
low-level functionality exists which may

609
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:26,139
produce unexpected behavior and we could

610
00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:28,750
actually backdoor a customer's

611
00:21:26,139 --> 00:21:30,580
environment if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think about how we</font>

00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:32,529
were getting malware through bouncer on

00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:33,610
the Google Play Store and that kind of

614
00:21:32,529 --> 00:21:34,960
stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you just leave it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for a</font>

certain<font color="#E5E5E5"> period of time and bounce</font>

616
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,379
wouldn't pick it up because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it lonely</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">it's watched it for a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> short period of</font>

619
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:45,158
only watch malicious code for so long

00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:47,350
before<font color="#CCCCCC"> it becomes a waste of time you</font>

621
00:21:45,159 --> 00:21:48,730
know if we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> using the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> code from six</font>

622
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:50,139
months ago yeah okay that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty</font>

623
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:52,809
reasonable but if it's a year two years

624
00:21:50,139 --> 00:21:55,289
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean is it is reasonably</font>

625
00:21:52,809 --> 00:21:57,399
far-fetched to think that malware has a

626
00:21:55,289 --> 00:21:59,408
command and control channel built into

627
00:21:57,399 --> 00:22:02,018
it will only kick off after two years

628
00:21:59,409 --> 00:22:03,309
but honestly I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I can't say</font>

629
00:22:02,019 --> 00:22:05,559
in earnest that there is no

630
00:22:03,309 --> 00:22:07,269
functionality on here that I<font color="#CCCCCC"> have not</font>

631
00:22:05,559 --> 00:22:09,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">detected and therefore you know I'm</font>

632
00:22:07,269 --> 00:22:12,880
worried about using it

633
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:15,459
another issue worth considering is if we

634
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:18,160
use malicious tools for Penn tests the

635
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:19,750
the malware that we've that we've

636
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:22,600
reversed and we've put<font color="#E5E5E5"> into our own tool</font>

637
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:24,880
kits we probably won't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to release</font>

638
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:25,899
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> out to the community we'd want to</font>

639
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:28,660
keep it to ourselves to give ourselves

640
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:31,180
an edge in doing pen tests and I think

641
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:32,560
one of the best things<font color="#E5E5E5"> about this in at</font>

642
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:34,030
the infosec community is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> openness</font>

643
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:35,260
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> people talking to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> each</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other and the</font>

644
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:36,879
organizations that put out the white

645
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:38,530
papers and say here's the code here's

646
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:40,600
how you exploit it this is the way you

647
00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:43,149
mitigate it and<font color="#CCCCCC"> and use that to improve</font>

648
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:46,510
things I think this could reduce a

649
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:48,610
collaboration by us attempting to use

650
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:50,470
those binaries and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then secure it to the</font>

00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:57,310

657
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:04,930
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite bad yeah and finally out</font>

658
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:06,760
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> anthr about this earlier every</font>

interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> this that to see where if we</font>

660
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:09,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">do start doing this whether a hacker</font>

661
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:10,840
could claim intellectual property rights

00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:12,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">or a piece of code they've created and</font>

664
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:16,510
in prison they could pretty much make

665
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:18,159
any case they want to at that point and

666
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:19,120
it's self incriminating to admit it<font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font>

667
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:20,320
you know if they're working for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

668
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,399
government at<font color="#CCCCCC"> that point or legally</font>

669
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,389
covered to build and deploy them are

670
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,800
where then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> could get into a new</font>

671
00:23:22,390 --> 00:23:30,490
uncharted territory for international

law and be a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lawyers would go nuts yeah</font>

673
00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:34,270
so in<font color="#E5E5E5"> summary we discuss the problems</font>

674
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:38,860
behind intelligence pentesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking</font>

675
00:23:34,270 --> 00:23:40,060
at using malware in pen tests we talked

676
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:42,219
about what is being<font color="#E5E5E5"> targeted how it's</font>

677
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:43,659
being targeted and why and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> latter</font>

678
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:45,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">isn't important for the traditional IT</font>

679
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:46,330
or network defense team but it is

680
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:47,800
important for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the business</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to understand</font>

681
00:23:46,330 --> 00:23:48,580
why people are attacking them and

682
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:50,500
whether they should change their

683
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:53,620
behavior while rather than change their

684
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:55,510
their security there is a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

685
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:56,860
learned from certain telligence and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

686
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:58,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">really happy about the the see vast</font>

687
00:23:56,860 --> 00:24:01,090
scheme coming forward<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the</font>

688
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:02,260
environments in those fields generic

689
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:03,760
techniques attackers using but

690
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:04,990
potentially<font color="#E5E5E5"> also looking at deeper some</font>

691
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:06,300
of the specific cases and tools

692
00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:08,860
recovered and reverse engineered

693
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:11,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">Adrienne's team track over like a</font>

694
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:12,639
hundred threat actors using capabilities

695
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:15,220
subotu what they said it or what I said

696
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:16,900
earlier so you know there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot to be</font>

697
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:19,270
learned from those<font color="#CCCCCC"> people and close to</font>

698
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:20,350
work with them could<font color="#E5E5E5"> be better and yeah</font>

699
00:24:19,270 --> 00:24:21,370
I've spoken about the practical and

700
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:22,149
ethical considerations of using

701
00:24:21,370 --> 00:24:24,159
malicious code

702
00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:25,540
pentesting ultimately we're not going to

703
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:26,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">say whether you should or shouldn't but</font>

704
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:29,139
I think it's something that we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

705
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:31,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more discussion of because you know</font>

706
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:33,580
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are pulling code out of malicious</font>

707
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:36,580
malicious binaries we are replicating

708
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:38,409
them and honestly can you look at the

709
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:40,240
security tools that you use and say that

710
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:42,730
you put<font color="#E5E5E5"> in anywhere near the amount of</font>

711
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:46,060

713
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:50,770
spend ages and ages<font color="#E5E5E5"> and ages going over</font>

714
00:24:47,530 --> 00:24:53,379
a piece of power whilst we do review the

715
00:24:50,770 --> 00:24:54,610
kit that we use I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the the way</font>

716
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:55,780
is definitely in favor of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reverse</font>

717
00:24:54,610 --> 00:24:57,280
engineers for how<font color="#E5E5E5"> much time they spend</font>

718
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:58,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">on one specific binary and I understand</font>

719
00:24:57,280 --> 00:25:00,940
those way better than I understand some

720
00:24:58,690 --> 00:25:02,320
of the kit that we use so yeah there are

721
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:03,730
practical advantages but<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's</font>

722
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,899
significant risk my marriage and my

723
00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:06,190
presentation today<font color="#E5E5E5"> was more about</font>

724
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:07,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">getting discussion going rather than</font>

725
00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:12,130
advocating particular approaches so

726
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:14,919
don't shoot<font color="#CCCCCC"> me yeah and some significant</font>

ethical and legal issues<font color="#E5E5E5"> exist cool</font>

728

729
00:25:17,170 --> 00:25:20,590
any<font color="#E5E5E5"> questions I got some really brutal</font>

730
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:24,389
