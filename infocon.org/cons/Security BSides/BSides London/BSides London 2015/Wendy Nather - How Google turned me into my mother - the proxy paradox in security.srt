9
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:29,670
to work on the security aspects of the

10
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:33,390
merger between swiss bank corporation

11
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:36,570
and SG Warburg if<font color="#E5E5E5"> there any of you who</font>

remember that and you never<font color="#E5E5E5"> really take</font>

13
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:41,790
full advantage in hindsight<font color="#E5E5E5"> of being in</font>

20
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,660
the security community here everybody's

21
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:03,570
really some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the nicest people that</font>

22
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:05,610
I've ever<font color="#E5E5E5"> met and don't tell the people</font>

23
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:14,369
in this wait this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is being</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> recorded by</font>

24
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:17,610
tripwire isn't it oh crap<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so I'm</font>

25
00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:19,229
going to talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about how Google turned me</font>

26
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:21,479
into my mother I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to talk about a</font>

27
00:01:19,229 --> 00:01:24,960
problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> how many of you are caring for</font>

28
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:26,850
older parents or relatives in the

29
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">audience there's everybody too young for</font>

30
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:31,669
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay you'll have to take my word</font>

31
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:33,930
for it then people who have children

32
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:36,689
minor children that they're having to do

33
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:39,329
things online for and<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything there's</font>

34
00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:42,990
a large<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem that I I don't think is</font>

35
00:01:39,329 --> 00:01:45,479
being adequately addressed yet and it

36
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:47,280
has<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do with proxying and delegation</font>

37
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:49,259
and a lot of you who have worked in

38
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">identity and access management know that</font>

39
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:53,640
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is a pretty common issue</font>

40
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:56,850
but the<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing is it's different for the</font>

41
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:59,850
enterprise and I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

42
00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:03,630
have larger<font color="#E5E5E5"> societal implications as we</font>

43
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:06,329
go along so it's sort of a definition of

44
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:08,340
proxying you know as you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know generally</font>

45
00:02:06,329 --> 00:02:10,079
a proxy will say you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know treat me as if</font>

46
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:12,510
I were the thing that you were talking

47
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,770
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I will do all the conversation on</font>

48
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:16,799
their behalf

49
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:18,600
we'll pass<font color="#CCCCCC"> it back to them and so on it</font>

50
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:24,360
has legal implications which<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll talk</font>

51
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:28,019
<font color="#CCCCCC">about any of you who have had to do a</font>

52
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:30,600
health care proxy for somebody else I

53
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:33,450
don't know what the<font color="#CCCCCC"> legal ramifications</font>

54
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:35,940
are here in the UK but in the United

55
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:38,010
States again under certain circumstances

56
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:41,460
if someone's in the hospital<font color="#E5E5E5"> and can't</font>

57
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:44,190
speak for themselves<font color="#E5E5E5"> you would help make</font>

58
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:45,960
the decisions for<font color="#E5E5E5"> them and those are</font>

59
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:49,079
some well obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> they have</font>

60
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:50,790
life-changing ramifications for those

61
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:56,610
sorts of decisions<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

62
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:59,760
them and a durable power<font color="#CCCCCC"> of attorney</font>

63
00:02:56,610 --> 00:03:02,910
again forgive me I don't know what the

64
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:04,980
legal terms here are in the UK but

65
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:07,980
generally you can administer the assets

66
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:11,459
of a person on their behalf whether it's

67
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:13,859
real<font color="#E5E5E5"> estate transactions or managing</font>

68
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:16,560
their bank accounts signing legal

69
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:18,900
documents on their behalf and so on now

70
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,820
in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> United States in general there</font>

71
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:23,220
are two<font color="#CCCCCC"> ways that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this document can take</font>

72
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:26,630
effect either immediately as soon as the

73
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:28,830
person signs it or upon incapacitation

74
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:31,560
now the legal definition of

75
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:35,280
incapacitation is very<font color="#CCCCCC"> difficult</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

76
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:37,620
establish and incapacitation isn't

77
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:40,320
always just being unconscious in a

78
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:43,800
hospital or whatever especially as<font color="#CCCCCC"> their</font>

79
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:46,890
aging seniors in particular tend to have

80
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:49,020
waxing and waning cognitive abilities

81
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:51,299
some days they will be very on top of

82
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:53,459
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> other days especially if they get</font>

83
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:55,709
a fever or<font color="#E5E5E5"> any sort of thing they enter</font>

84
00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:58,709
a state that's the medical profession

85
00:03:55,709 --> 00:04:00,690
calls delirium where it's you know they

86
00:03:58,709 --> 00:04:01,830
may<font color="#E5E5E5"> have trouble communicating having</font>

87
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:03,359
trouble<font color="#CCCCCC"> putting a sentence together</font>

88
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:06,480
they're not sure where they<font color="#CCCCCC"> are they're</font>

89
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:09,989
disoriented it's not dementia which is a

90
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:13,109
much<font color="#CCCCCC"> more long-term gradual thing but it</font>

91
00:04:09,989 --> 00:04:17,480
can look<font color="#E5E5E5"> just like dementia and so in</font>

92
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:20,609
fact one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the classic</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> signs that I</font>

00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:22,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">mt's look for if they're called to a</font>

94
00:04:20,608 --> 00:04:24,180
house and there's a senior citizen

95
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:26,950
especially a woman who is<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know not</font>

96
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:29,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">communicative is very out of it they say</font>

97
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:32,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">backed a urinary tract infection because</font>

98
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:34,900
those are very asymptomatic for older

99
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:37,930
people but it immediately results in

100
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:39,940
them just<font color="#E5E5E5"> being completely out of it my</font>

101
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:42,100
mother for example when she had one

00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:43,840
drove home pulled her<font color="#E5E5E5"> cart into the</font>

00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:52,599
the wheel so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of thing so that</font>

105
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:53,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are some very difficult problems</font>

106
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:56,710
with getting someone declared

107
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:59,050
incapacitated for this reason if you try

108
00:04:56,710 --> 00:05:00,489
<font color="#CCCCCC">to go to an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> elderly relative and say I</font>

109
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:03,100
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to take</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> over everything for you</font>

110
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:04,510
because you can't do it anymore you're

111
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:07,960
going to have words<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that person</font>

112
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:10,180
it's a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> long difficult psychological</font>

113
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:12,070
struggle for them to start losing the

114
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:14,650
agency in their life and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ability to</font>

115
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:16,690
do things and<font color="#E5E5E5"> many of them will not will</font>

116
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:19,599
not accept it or acknowledge and you

117
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:26,490
know all the way to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end so it's a</font>

118
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:28,870
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> difficult conversation to have and</font>

119
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:30,130
it's sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of talking between proxy and</font>

120
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:31,960
delegation it's the you know the

00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:34,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">difference between</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> root and soodhu but</font>

122
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:37,150

clear document<font color="#CCCCCC"> everything that you're</font>

127
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:47,169
doing on their behalf you know

128
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:48,730
withdrawals you're making from their

129
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:50,470
bank account bills that you're paying

130
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:52,450
especially if you're reimbursing

131
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:54,100
yourself you have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a very clear</font>

132
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:57,400
documentation trail as to why you're

133
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:59,380
doing it there is there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are a lot of</font>

134
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:04,109
problems especially with seniors being

135
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:07,210
taken advantage of by<font color="#CCCCCC"> the relatives my</font>

136
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:11,260
my<font color="#CCCCCC"> half-sisters half sister-in-laws</font>

137
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:14,250
father had all of his assets taken by

138
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:18,159
one of her half-siblings when he became

139
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:20,230
to some extent incapacitated and the

140
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,820
bank accounts were emptied and you know

141
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:24,580
that those funds will never be recovered

142
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:26,920
so you have to care a lot about that too

143
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:29,409
when people<font color="#CCCCCC"> are at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that very vulnerable</font>

144
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:33,060
stage of their lives this is a

145
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:33,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">depressing talk isn't it I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sorry</font>

146
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:40,800
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've talked about this before in the</font>

147
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:42,659
past that role based access control that

148
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,389
doesn't deal with this or with anything

149
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:47,850
else will really know our back has its

150
00:06:45,389 --> 00:06:50,210
time in place but generally they're

151
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:53,160
dealing with bundles of entitlements and

152
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:55,409
if you are delegating access to somebody

153
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:57,780
else it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> usually for a very specific</font>

154
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:59,430
reason it might be time limited you

155
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:01,440
don't want them to have all the same

156
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:04,440
bundle of entitlements that come with

157
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:06,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">your role but if it's too confusing to</font>

158
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:09,630
sort out if your system is not granular

159
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:11,520
enough to give just those accesses that

160
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:13,800
you want them<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have you end up just</font>

161
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:17,310
giving<font color="#E5E5E5"> them the whole bundle you know</font>

162
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:21,750
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can't be bothered and again</font>

163
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:23,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm out for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the next week</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

164
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:25,289
raywood is going to take my place but I

165
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:27,330
don't want them getting into the silver

166
00:07:25,289 --> 00:07:29,669
you know I want them<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able to do</font>

167
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:31,680
some other things on my behalf and our

168
00:07:29,669 --> 00:07:36,240
back doesn't doesn't deal with that too

169
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:37,410
well so the old sort of<font color="#CCCCCC"> old-style our</font>

170
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,270
back is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have a group of</font>

171
00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:41,490
entitlements and they map to your

172
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:44,340
position in the organization so if you

173
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:45,750
are a research director here is the role

174
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:47,609
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you are given and it had it comes</font>

175
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:49,020
with a static bundle of entitlements and

176
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:51,810
you know this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you should be</font>

177
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:53,969
doing you add more roles and

178
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:56,400
administrators get all the roles because

179
00:07:53,970 --> 00:08:01,740
it's easier that way and that's it

180
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:03,840
that's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> way it works now first of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

181
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:05,610
even<font color="#E5E5E5"> in an enterprise this assumes that</font>

182
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:09,510
you're either a customer or you're an

183
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:10,860
employee and as you know there are many

184
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:13,530
many different<font color="#CCCCCC"> roles in there for</font>

185
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:15,180
example QA testers QA testers have to

186
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:17,719
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the roles when they're you know</font>

doesn't reflect different axes of

195
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:42,450
another agency this is particularly

196
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:45,300
difficult and complicated in the public

legal requirements or separation of

things are just not and general not

227

nonprofits you know any agency that had

234
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:23,550
to do something with education and so I

235
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:25,829
had to<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to migrate that to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Tivoli and</font>

00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:29,130
i can tell you<font color="#CCCCCC"> i made the IBM engineers</font>

237
00:10:25,829 --> 00:10:31,199
cry because there was just so much

00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:33,959
complexity in the business rules that

239
00:10:31,199 --> 00:10:39,319
had to be built in and it<font color="#CCCCCC"> was a multi</font>

241
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:46,170
context<font color="#E5E5E5"> plus government of plus</font>

242
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:48,029
governance there is usually an identity

243
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:51,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">Authority who says yes you know I've</font>

244
00:10:48,029 --> 00:10:52,529
looked at your your picture ID and I can

245
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:56,670
vouch for<font color="#CCCCCC"> you that you are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> who you say</font>

246
00:10:52,529 --> 00:10:58,410
you are but you also need an access

00:10:56,670 --> 00:11:00,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">authority somebody who</font>

248
00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:03,000
is responsible<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the data that you're</font>

249
00:11:00,899 --> 00:11:06,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to access and has to give their</font>

250
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:09,029
permission for you to access it which is

251
00:11:06,149 --> 00:11:10,860
not the identity authority this is where

252
00:11:09,029 --> 00:11:12,870
you end up<font color="#E5E5E5"> with long forms with multiple</font>

253
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:14,670
signatures on it because everyone has a

00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:16,410
particular area<font color="#E5E5E5"> of governments the</font>

governance that they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> responsible for</font>

on<font color="#E5E5E5"> your accent your access so they have</font>

258
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:27,180
to say both who you are and why you need

259
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:29,729
access to<font color="#E5E5E5"> this so again at the State you</font>

260
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:31,680
might have a superintendent who says yes

261
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:35,250
this staff member at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the district works</font>

262
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:40,109
for me they are in a role of reporting

263
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:43,920
on on the free lunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> program for poor</font>

264
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:45,750
students and you know therefore they

265
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:49,349
should have<font color="#CCCCCC"> access to this system only</font>

266
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:54,389
and then all that ends up in a bundle of

267
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:58,759
what your entitlements would be so again

268
00:11:54,389 --> 00:11:58,759
somebody validates you as an individual

269
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:07,649
somebody says here is you know who who

270
00:12:03,779 --> 00:12:09,029
you are in the context of<font color="#CCCCCC"> whatever it is</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">you're doing I I don't know what this</font>

273
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:16,620
he's he's waving an ID card so he must

274
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:19,979
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right or you know you're a</font>

cows somebody will validate that you are

00:12:46,069 --> 00:12:51,420
so it's very<font color="#E5E5E5"> much</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like a game of Clue</font>

286
00:12:48,569 --> 00:12:54,420
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> it'll be professor plum in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

287
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:57,719
kitchen with<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lead pipe or maybe with a</font>

288
00:12:54,420 --> 00:13:00,449
candlestick or in the library and this

289
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:02,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">is more what a you know enterprise roles</font>

290
00:13:00,449 --> 00:13:07,050
and entitlements look like and in fact

291
00:13:02,939 --> 00:13:08,579
it can get even more you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can get more</font>

292
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:10,380
complicated<font color="#E5E5E5"> because you're really adding</font>

293
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:12,030
different sort of functions you're

294
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:15,689
either killing or you're being killed

295
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:17,579
in the kitchen<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a lead pipe or you</font>

296
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:19,620
know whatever so that it's that

297
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:20,610
combination especially in a dynamic

298
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:22,560
environment that is going to make

299
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:27,180
Identity and Access Management very

300
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:28,859
complex so here<font color="#CCCCCC"> we go you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

301
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:31,500
all the combinations that are possible

302
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:33,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">out here you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is this is what</font>

303
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:37,980
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to deal with in real life I</font>

304
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:42,209
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to tell you this with a no</font>

305
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:49,650
date in the library in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> shared</font>

306
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:51,450
library so again this is this is really

307
00:13:49,650 --> 00:13:54,090
how it should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be working</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and it should</font>

308
00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:55,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">be working this way in the consumer</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

309
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:57,030
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say consumer world but it's like</font>

310
00:13:55,530 --> 00:14:01,410
in the real world the non<font color="#CCCCCC"> enterprise</font>

311
00:13:57,030 --> 00:14:03,449
world somebody vouches for you and if

312
00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:05,610
you own the data you approve the access

313
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:08,310
to it by this organization and by those

314
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:09,540
authorized individuals and by the way

315
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:11,130
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is another reason</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> why full</font>

316
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:13,430
Federation doesn't always take on

317
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:16,560
because a lot of organizations don't

318
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:18,270
won't just accept somebody else's word

319
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:20,790
that they have an employee who needs

320
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:22,740
access to the data for for legal reasons

321
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:26,969
they still have to have the final step

322
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:30,390
of approval and again that this<font color="#E5E5E5"> can lead</font>

323
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:33,660
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of creative solutions</font>

324
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:36,300
especially in applications I once found

325
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:38,219
out that because my organization

326
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:41,189
required so many signatures for legal

327
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:43,920
reasons on forms for every access that

328
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:46,350
somebody had externally and these things

329
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:48,449
had to be processed<font color="#CCCCCC"> on paper and it was</font>

330
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:51,090
very slow i found that developers were

331
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:53,790
just creating these nice little backdoor

332
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:55,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">urls that they were handing out to users</font>

333
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:56,670
to say just just click<font color="#E5E5E5"> on here and</font>

334
00:14:55,410 --> 00:15:01,920
you'll go straight into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> application</font>

335
00:14:56,670 --> 00:15:06,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">and see what you want to see and so that</font>

336
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:08,760
that happens a lot you are a bunch of

337
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:10,859
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things a bunch of these roles a</font>

338
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:14,189
parent and administrator a customer a

339
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:16,230
subscriber and you could be<font color="#CCCCCC"> all of these</font>

340
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:19,100
things at different times and the

341
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:21,600
functions and the scope are different

342
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:23,250
one another really big problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we</font>

343
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,950
have in the enterprise today is

344
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:27,510
it used to be in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the past that</font>

345
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:29,550
enterprises had used a completely

346
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:31,319
different set of software from what you

347
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:35,490
would use personally I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> nobody uses</font>

348
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:37,440
an<font color="#E5E5E5"> ERP system for fun right if you do</font>

349
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:43,050
raise your hand and we'll stage an

350
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:45,270
intervention but nowadays you may be

351
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:48,300
using<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google Docs you may be using</font>

352
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:50,130
Dropbox there's so many<font color="#E5E5E5"> different types</font>

353
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:53,219
of software<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you can be using at any</font>

354
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:55,680
given time either on your<font color="#CCCCCC"> own behalf or</font>

355
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:58,770
behalf of the organization from the same

356
00:15:55,680 --> 00:16:00,959
device during the day and the

357
00:15:58,770 --> 00:16:03,540
implication of this for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> enterprise</font>

358
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:06,750
is that they cannot tell what data is

359
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:08,910
business data anymore they can't tell by

360
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:11,250
which application created it which

361
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:14,130
device it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> created on where it's</font>

362
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:15,990
being stored in which format where the

363
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:18,360
user was when it was created what time

364
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:20,280
of day none<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> matters anymore what</font>

365
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:22,740
matters is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the actual content of the</font>

366
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:24,900
data and you have to look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> it very</font>

367
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:28,620
closely to say does this belong to<font color="#CCCCCC"> us is</font>

368
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:30,120
this part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the e-discovery you know do</font>

369
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:32,190
we have to go look at everything that

370
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:33,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">this user</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> has ever touched because they</font>

371
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:36,450
may have something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's responsive to</font>

372
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:37,980
this request that this is why things

373
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:42,420
have gotten you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the state that</font>

374
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:45,720
they are in now so let's talk about

375
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:50,630
consumers or normal people as we may

376
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:53,520
call<font color="#E5E5E5"> them one example is minor children</font>

377
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:56,550
I don't know what sort of arrangements

378
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:58,800
you have here<font color="#CCCCCC"> again in the UK but for my</font>

379
00:16:56,550 --> 00:17:01,199
met my prescription insurance provider

380
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:03,810
informed me that as<font color="#E5E5E5"> soon as my oldest</font>

his own login into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the online system and</font>

383
00:17:06,089 --> 00:17:10,230
he wouldn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> even need to give me</font>

384
00:17:07,709 --> 00:17:15,839
permission to manage<font color="#CCCCCC"> his prescriptions</font>

385
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:19,490
for him and I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> why it was 13 I</font>

386
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:23,520
don't know if there was<font color="#E5E5E5"> some sort of</font>

387
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:26,849
anyway something very<font color="#CCCCCC"> strange then there</font>

388
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:30,570
are incapacitated adults now you may<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

389
00:17:26,849 --> 00:17:34,919
hit by a bus or it may be a periodic

390
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:35,990
illness you could be on really good pain

391
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:37,490
pills I know

392
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:40,490
that has happened<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me I've actually</font>

393
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:41,690
written reports under the influence if

394
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:45,380
you read some of them you may be able to

395
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:47,150
tell which one's those were but<font color="#E5E5E5"> assuming</font>

396
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:49,100
this role takes a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> time in</font>

397
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:52,220
bureaucracy I know someone gave a talk

398
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:55,250
at i think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was besides atlanta about</font>

399
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:57,230
how somebody a spouse suddenly passed

400
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:59,900
away and they just could not get access

401
00:17:57,230 --> 00:18:02,330
to their accounts even<font color="#CCCCCC"> though it was an</font>

402
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:03,980
emergency so think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this for a</font>

403
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:06,230
minute if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you walked out of here and you</font>

404
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:09,230
were hit by a bus who would pay your

405
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:12,470
bills for you and how would they do it

406
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:14,690
how would<font color="#CCCCCC"> they have access to it so</font>

407
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:16,400
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> up to the official route you have</font>

408
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:18,770
to be able to prove that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this person is</font>

409
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:20,300
incapacitated just saying that they're

410
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:22,700
in hospital well how long will they be

411
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:25,250
in a hospital oh I don't know two weeks

412
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:26,690
four weeks well you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't need to take</font>

413
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:30,260
it over well yes there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are bills that</font>

414
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:32,210
are due tomorrow it's a lot of

415
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:33,710
bureaucracy and then as I mentioned

416
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:35,809
convincing somebody else that they're

417
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:39,400
incapacitated especially as they get

418
00:18:35,809 --> 00:18:42,290
older it can destroy<font color="#CCCCCC"> your relationship</font>

419
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:47,809
it's just horrible nobody wants to do

420
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:49,850
this so as I mentioned they said you

421
00:18:47,809 --> 00:18:52,610
know you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> 13 year old has to have his</font>

422
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:53,840
own account and you he has to give you

423
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:57,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">permission to administer his</font>

424
00:18:53,840 --> 00:19:00,320
prescriptions for him and I said<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so</font>

425
00:18:57,890 --> 00:19:01,850
i created a second account for my 13

426
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:03,139
year old with one of my other email

427
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:05,480
addresses because<font color="#E5E5E5"> i knew they would</font>

428
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:07,460
check to see if they were unique so I

429
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:10,520
used a second email address gave myself

430
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:12,350
permission went back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work obviously</font>

431
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:14,450
this is not in the spirit you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know that</font>

432
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:16,459
they had set this up in but they really

433
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:19,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">did not have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a you know a good answer</font>

434
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:21,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">and the only authentication that was</font>

435
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:23,870
done is demographic data and you know

436
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:26,690
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> the mother of course I know when he</font>

437
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:28,129
was born and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know all these other</font>

438
00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:30,350
things I forget what they were asking

439
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:31,670
for but just that sort that level of

440
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:34,780
knowledge I could do everything online

441
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:34,780
and nobody<font color="#E5E5E5"> was the wiser</font>

442
00:19:38,179 --> 00:19:44,820
another example was when I had to take

443
00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:47,090
over one of my<font color="#E5E5E5"> parents accounts and I</font>

444
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:50,250
could set up the debt or another medical

445
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:53,220
online thing and I could set it up

446
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:54,630
online and nobody<font color="#E5E5E5"> was the wiser I set it</font>

447
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:56,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">up as my mother and they said if you</font>

448
00:19:54,630 --> 00:20:00,179
want to revoke this you have to do it in

449
00:19:56,100 --> 00:20:01,889
writing like what who thought of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

450
00:20:00,179 --> 00:20:03,779
business rule who actually walked

451
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:08,490
through this and figured<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that this</font>

452
00:20:03,779 --> 00:20:11,299
you know made any sort of sense so the

453
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:13,529
authentication<font color="#E5E5E5"> mechanisms for online</font>

454
00:20:11,299 --> 00:20:16,710
registration and delegation and so on

455
00:20:13,529 --> 00:20:19,380
they end first of all you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to know</font>

456
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:22,649
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> your the name of your father's</font>

457
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:25,980
first pet was which you may want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font>

458
00:20:22,649 --> 00:20:28,168
<font color="#E5E5E5">home and ask if you don't know you have</font>

459
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:30,659
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to navigate online which</font>

460
00:20:28,169 --> 00:20:32,370
again is not necessarily given there are

461
00:20:30,659 --> 00:20:35,220
still many non-technical people out

462
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:37,199
there or even if they could at some

463
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:39,539
point you know maybe they can't navigate

464
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:42,240
anymore now so they can't set<font color="#CCCCCC"> up the</font>

465
00:20:39,539 --> 00:20:44,820
delegation for you anymore if they could

466
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:46,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">they wouldn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> need it this is something</font>

467
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:49,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you know people are not talking</font>

468
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:52,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">about it they assume</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you have</font>

469
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:54,629
standard IDs as people age in the United

470
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:56,309
States especially if they can't drive

471
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:58,529
anymore they won't have a driver's

472
00:20:56,309 --> 00:21:00,720
license it's too difficult for them to

473
00:20:58,529 --> 00:21:04,289
get<font color="#CCCCCC"> some place to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> renew that driver's</font>

474
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:07,320
license sometimes they give you a state

475
00:21:04,289 --> 00:21:10,320
ID card instead so that you can go vote

476
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:12,720
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> again going through that if you're</font>

477
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:14,428
mentally not you know really competent

478
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:17,279
enough it seems like<font color="#CCCCCC"> an insurmountable</font>

479
00:21:14,429 --> 00:21:19,289
challenge to find out what you need to

480
00:21:17,279 --> 00:21:22,649
do what you need to sign who you need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

481
00:21:19,289 --> 00:21:23,970
go see they<font color="#E5E5E5"> always assume</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that if you</font>

482
00:21:22,649 --> 00:21:27,168
have a different<font color="#CCCCCC"> email address you're a</font>

483
00:21:23,970 --> 00:21:29,279
different person which is pretty silly

484
00:21:27,169 --> 00:21:31,279
they assume that<font color="#CCCCCC"> a phone number</font>

485
00:21:29,279 --> 00:21:34,020
especially for two factor authentication

486
00:21:31,279 --> 00:21:35,580
belongs only to one person which<font color="#E5E5E5"> again</font>

that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> case and there's no</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">cleverness in the security challenge</font>

as the answer<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you know what's your</font>

495
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:58,930
pet's name they're assuming that when

496
00:21:56,500 --> 00:22:00,790
you are are setting<font color="#E5E5E5"> up those challenge</font>

497
00:21:58,930 --> 00:22:03,520
questions you're not trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be very</font>

00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:05,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">very clever the problem is if somebody</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">else is trying to be clever and you have</font>

to<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out the way in which they were</font>

502
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:15,520
reconstruct their account later you're

503
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:16,870
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be in trouble so this is</font>

504
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:18,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">another thing that really bugs me about</font>

505
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:21,399
security challenge questions there are

506
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:23,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">many many systems out there where they</font>

507
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:25,270
make you change your password regularly

508
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:26,590
because of regulations but they don't

509
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:30,340
make<font color="#CCCCCC"> you change the answers to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

510
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:31,600
security questions so as a result there

511
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:34,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">are some systems where I don't bother</font>

512
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:36,250
remembering my password I just reset it

513
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:38,439
because I will<font color="#CCCCCC"> always answer the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> same</font>

514
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:40,240
security challenge questions and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

515
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:44,110
only have to do this you know once a

516
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:45,670
quarter that's what i'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to do so</font>

517
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:47,590
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> will always fall back to the one</font>

518
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:50,710
factor that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can rely</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on that is</font>

519
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:52,449
static that you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> easily remember the</font>

520
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:56,940
this is another gap that we are not

521
00:22:52,450 --> 00:23:00,970
dealing with too well so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my dad</font>

522
00:22:56,940 --> 00:23:04,210
this was his first email address you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

523
00:23:00,970 --> 00:23:05,800
see this is an old UCP format he was the

524
00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:09,670
one who<font color="#E5E5E5"> was responsible for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> getting me</font>

525
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:11,200
into this whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> computery thing at the</font>

526
00:23:09,670 --> 00:23:13,420
age of 12 I made a mistake of telling

527
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:15,400
him that I was bored never do that never

528
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:17,170
tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> your parents that you're bored he</font>

529
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:18,910
threw a basic manual at me and said go

530
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:21,040
make the bell ring on the teletype over

531
00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:23,230
there anybody know what a teletype is

532
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:27,370
it's like you know yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I'm not</font>

533
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:30,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">alone so he did that he wrote one of the</font>

534
00:23:27,370 --> 00:23:32,139
first Fortran compilers so he started

535
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:33,730
very very<font color="#E5E5E5"> early in this business you</font>

536
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:36,220
know so nobody can say he wasn't

537
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:38,580
technical he was a nuclear physicist

538
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:42,540
without a license he was an astronomer

539
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:45,520
he did a lot of hacking on his own and

540
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:48,100
in fact he<font color="#E5E5E5"> wrote a story about the</font>

541
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:49,960
elegance of programming back in the days

542
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:53,020
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you had to fit it into very very</font>

543
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:55,090
tiny spaces and so you may want to read

544
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:59,530
the story of Mel it's also in the back

545
00:23:55,090 --> 00:24:01,570
of the hackers dictionary out there so

546
00:23:59,530 --> 00:24:01,720
he was<font color="#CCCCCC"> the one who really got me started</font>

547
00:24:01,570 --> 00:24:03,490
on

548
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:06,850
this but the problem is as time went on

549
00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:09,670
he was a total command line guy he hated

550
00:24:06,850 --> 00:24:12,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">windows with a purple passion he would</font>

551
00:24:09,670 --> 00:24:13,330
not use it at all he only agreed to use

552
00:24:12,010 --> 00:24:16,360
linux because he could go back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

553
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:18,730
command line so there got to be a point

554
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:20,830
especially as online things got more

555
00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:22,600
complicated that he just did not want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

556
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:25,000
deal<font color="#CCCCCC"> with them anymore he was you know</font>

557
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:28,060
kind of mentally stuck in the 80s maybe

558
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:30,090
the early 90s so even for somebody like

559
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:32,620
him who had been in on the ground floor

560
00:24:30,090 --> 00:24:34,389
things have moved to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the point where he</font>

561
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:37,659
could not you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> really keep up</font>

562
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:40,660
anymore so it's a really good thing he

563
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:43,750
didn't believe insecurities because when

564
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:45,190
he had his stroke I had to he was the

565
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:48,940
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> who was paying the bills</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I had to</font>

566
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:50,380
break into his banking accounts and by

567
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:52,810
that time he was too out of it to be

568
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:55,930
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to help me luckily he had cashed</font>

569
00:24:52,810 --> 00:24:57,520
his gmail password<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

583
00:25:25,870 --> 00:25:31,239
break into all of his accounts and if I

584
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:32,890
had<font color="#E5E5E5"> tried to do this can you imagine me</font>

585
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:35,740
going to google and saying well you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

my father is had a stroke yes he can

<font color="#E5E5E5">login anymore he can't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> he certainly</font>

589
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:50,139
can't go to his bank and explain

590
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:51,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">everything to them he can't walk and in</font>

591
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:54,580
fact a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot he sleeps a lot of the day</font>

592
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:55,840
and you know trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go to the bank</font>

593
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:57,879
and saying I<font color="#E5E5E5"> really need to take over</font>

594
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:59,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">his</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> accounts for him it was easier just</font>

595
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:04,900
to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this all online and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just not tell</font>

596
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:06,580
anybody now this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a problem</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if you</font>

597
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:10,660
have to take over somebody's accounts

598
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:13,120
and work on their behalf so do<font color="#CCCCCC"> you for</font>

599
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:13,730
example go to the bank and do you log in

600
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:16,399
to their

601
00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:18,620
bank account or do you try to convince

602
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:20,930
them to set up a delegation account with

603
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:24,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">your own login and just delegate all the</font>

604
00:26:20,930 --> 00:26:26,420
functions to them do you change their

605
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:28,820
passwords to something you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> remember</font>

606
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:31,400
so that as a result they don't know what

607
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:33,560
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is and they can't get in or do you</font>

608
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:35,390
try to remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> their passwords yeah I</font>

609
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:37,250
know there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like LastPass and</font>

610
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:39,770
one password and that sort of thing but

611
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:41,210
when it's an emergency and you're trying

612
00:26:39,770 --> 00:26:43,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">to figure out what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you should do these</font>

613
00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:47,300
are questions you ask<font color="#CCCCCC"> yourself do you</font>

614
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:48,889
reset the challenge questions is<font color="#CCCCCC"> it what</font>

615
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:50,540
was the<font color="#E5E5E5"> name of his first pet or what</font>

616
00:26:48,890 --> 00:26:53,330
was the name of my first pet wait a

617
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:55,580
minute which one did I set and again you

618
00:26:53,330 --> 00:26:57,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">know you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in a crisis you're very</font>

619
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:58,790
distressed because your parent is very

620
00:26:57,080 --> 00:27:03,260
ill you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to make these</font>

621
00:26:58,790 --> 00:27:04,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">decisions do you use your phone an email</font>

622
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:06,590
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> two-factor off if they didn't have</font>

623
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:08,480
it set up it's pretty easy but if they

624
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:09,980
had<font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> using it do you want to make</font>

625
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:12,320
them<font color="#CCCCCC"> feel better and feel like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font>

626
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:15,020
still<font color="#E5E5E5"> in control by letting them keep</font>

627
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:16,970
you know the email and<font color="#CCCCCC"> phone and so on</font>

628
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:18,110
if they<font color="#CCCCCC"> ask for a phone number you have</font>

629
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:19,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">to try to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

630
00:27:18,110 --> 00:27:22,070
institution is going to use it for if

631
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:23,929
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to call my mother and say</font>

632
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:25,580
you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got a problem</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with your bank</font>

633
00:27:23,930 --> 00:27:28,070
balance you may<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to leave it with</font>

634
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:31,010
them if it is for password resets and

635
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:32,570
you live five miles away<font color="#E5E5E5"> or a thousand</font>

636
00:27:31,010 --> 00:27:34,610
miles away<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you're trying to do this</font>

637
00:27:32,570 --> 00:27:36,620
for them then maybe it should be your

638
00:27:34,610 --> 00:27:39,320
phone number sometimes they won't let

639
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:41,479
you set<font color="#CCCCCC"> to so there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are these sort of</font>

640
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:47,030
logistical things that have to get

641
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:49,400
sorted now the arguments were using

642
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:51,200
their for using their accounts and just

643
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:52,760
logging in as them is that a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

644
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:56,810
institutions still aren't ready<font color="#CCCCCC"> to deal</font>

645
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:59,960
with this in doing it in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the form in a</font>

646
00:27:56,810 --> 00:28:02,720
formal way requires their cooperation it

647
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:05,780
requires that they are emotionally ready

648
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:08,090
to say yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay you know i'll give you</font>

649
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:09,350
the passwords<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'll let you do this even</font>

650
00:28:08,090 --> 00:28:10,490
assuming they can remember<font color="#CCCCCC"> where they</font>

651
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:14,750
have accounts because a lot of people

652
00:28:10,490 --> 00:28:16,760
don't again it requires mental capacity

653
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:19,610
mobility it requires a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of paperwork</font>

654
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:24,160
for every account most of this has<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

655
00:28:19,610 --> 00:28:24,159
done<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of band notaries public</font>

656
00:28:24,169 --> 00:28:30,169
and it requires a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of time now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

657
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:32,210
another advantage for doing it is that

658
00:28:30,169 --> 00:28:39,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">you have an ostensible separation of</font>

659
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:40,909
duties in in some cases now against

660
00:28:39,169 --> 00:28:43,489
using their accounts if they catch you

661
00:28:40,909 --> 00:28:45,440
they may block you I was administering

662
00:28:43,489 --> 00:28:47,779
my mother's accounts and I actually had

663
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:49,460
a login of my own but there<font color="#CCCCCC"> was one bank</font>

664
00:28:47,779 --> 00:28:50,989
account that for some reason the bank

665
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:54,159
would not let me<font color="#E5E5E5"> see in my own account</font>

666
00:28:50,989 --> 00:28:56,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I just used my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mother's account and</font>

667
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:59,690
depending on where i was at any point in

668
00:28:56,659 --> 00:29:01,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">the day some caregiver needed to check</font>

669
00:28:59,690 --> 00:29:02,989
and I didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have my mother's set of</font>

670
00:29:01,669 --> 00:29:04,820
checks because I didn't want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take</font>

671
00:29:02,989 --> 00:29:06,169
them from her house because then she

672
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:07,999
would get upset and want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know where</font>

673
00:29:06,169 --> 00:29:09,529
they were so I would write a check and

674
00:29:07,999 --> 00:29:12,259
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would transfer the money from her</font>

675
00:29:09,529 --> 00:29:14,090
account to mine and I guess the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first or</font>

676
00:29:12,259 --> 00:29:17,299
second time<font color="#CCCCCC"> I did that from my mother's</font>

677
00:29:14,090 --> 00:29:19,730
account they said<font color="#CCCCCC"> Oh fraud and they</font>

678
00:29:17,299 --> 00:29:21,080
blocked it and I called them<font color="#CCCCCC"> and they</font>

679
00:29:19,730 --> 00:29:23,570
said<font color="#E5E5E5"> well your mother has to go into a</font>

680
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:26,029
bank branch and show ID and explain to

681
00:29:23,570 --> 00:29:28,009
them that no it really was<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and</font>

682
00:29:26,029 --> 00:29:31,070
again my mother's very very limited

683
00:29:28,009 --> 00:29:32,840
mobility this would be taking you know

684
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:34,820
the better part of a day to get her into

685
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:36,619
a bank branch she would be exhausted

686
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:38,960
afterwards that you know this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

687
00:29:36,619 --> 00:29:40,999
going to work so I just went<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

688
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:43,999
logged into my account and finished the

689
00:29:40,999 --> 00:29:51,470
transactions so again this is not<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

690
00:29:43,999 --> 00:29:53,389
great<font color="#E5E5E5"> solution and again especially if</font>

691
00:29:51,470 --> 00:29:55,489
if they're sort of wavering if your

692
00:29:53,389 --> 00:29:56,840
parents are wavering there's maybe some

693
00:29:55,489 --> 00:29:58,220
days where they're perfectly fine with

694
00:29:56,840 --> 00:30:00,168
you helping out and other days when

695
00:29:58,220 --> 00:30:01,159
they're not and all of a sudden they

696
00:30:00,169 --> 00:30:02,960
will say what are you doing you're

697
00:30:01,159 --> 00:30:08,059
messing around you know with my things

698
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:09,619
and the right there absolutely right so

699
00:30:08,059 --> 00:30:11,600
now we're getting to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> good part of</font>

700
00:30:09,619 --> 00:30:16,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">the story this is how google turned me</font>

701
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:19,340
into my mother so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have for gmail</font>

702
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:22,309
accounts on my laptop<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have a work one</font>

703
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:25,178
<font color="#E5E5E5">i have my personal gmail and now i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

704
00:30:22,309 --> 00:30:25,178
my father's<font color="#E5E5E5"> and my mother's</font>

705
00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:31,870
so what<font color="#CCCCCC"> happened was when I was going</font>

706
00:30:30,429 --> 00:30:33,669
through and setting these up and turning

709
00:30:36,429 --> 00:30:42,520
doing all this<font color="#E5E5E5"> I happen to put in my</font>

00:30:38,919 --> 00:30:44,679
personal address and added it to my

mother's gmail account as an alternate

712

email address and then I<font color="#E5E5E5"> forgot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about it</font>

713
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:51,820
because I was doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of different</font>

00:31:03,909 --> 00:31:07,750
their mailing<font color="#CCCCCC"> list and suddenly it was</font>

721
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:09,730
coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> to me under my mother's name but</font>

722
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:13,990
to my personal address and I thought

723
00:31:09,730 --> 00:31:19,870
what is this what's going on here and it

724
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:23,340
was anybody who used gmail at all and I

725
00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:26,168
found<font color="#E5E5E5"> out what actually happens is that</font>

726
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:28,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">Gmail will very happily add very</font>

727
00:31:26,169 --> 00:31:31,090
helpfully add the primary account

728
00:31:28,570 --> 00:31:33,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">holders name to whatever alternate</font>

729
00:31:31,090 --> 00:31:35,620
address you're emailing now why is this

730
00:31:33,370 --> 00:31:37,209
a problem let's say you're Superman and

731
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:40,330
you're setting up gmail com and you're

732
00:31:37,210 --> 00:31:43,650
setting up an alt email anybody now who

733
00:31:40,330 --> 00:31:46,990
uses<font color="#E5E5E5"> Gmail who emails Clark at Kent com</font>

734
00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:51,429
even as their composing it<font color="#CCCCCC"> gmail will</font>

735
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:55,059
say oh you mean Superman so this is yeah

736
00:31:51,429 --> 00:31:57,850
this is kind of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem so I reported</font>

737
00:31:55,059 --> 00:32:02,110
this to google and they said no this is

738
00:31:57,850 --> 00:32:05,949
functioning as intended so I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

739
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:08,428
okay all right you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't mind if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I talk</font>

740
00:32:05,950 --> 00:32:17,070
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> this then oh no that's fine</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

741
00:32:08,429 --> 00:32:20,020
that's good so how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we deal with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

742
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:22,360
the problem is that especially if you

743
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:25,418
add a delegation account to anything

744
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:28,240
that's very important finances or school

745
00:32:25,419 --> 00:32:30,039
logins or<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything if you imagine</font>

746
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:32,890
everything that you are doing in your

747
00:32:30,039 --> 00:32:34,390
digital life and having to delegate

748
00:32:32,890 --> 00:32:36,370
somebody else to help<font color="#E5E5E5"> out with this</font>

749
00:32:34,390 --> 00:32:37,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">first of all adding another set of</font>

750
00:32:36,370 --> 00:32:38,939
credentials doubles the attack surface

751
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:40,800
right there

752
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:42,600
it's bad enough that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're you know</font>

753
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:44,159
<font color="#CCCCCC">your mother's account could get hacked</font>

754
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:46,980
especially if she doesn't choose a great

755
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:50,790
password or he doesn't believe in

756
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:52,830
security as my dad didn't how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

757
00:32:50,790 --> 00:32:54,360
monitor for fraud properly how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

758
00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:56,610
tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> the difference between me</font>

759
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:58,229
reimbursing myself into my bank account

760
00:32:56,610 --> 00:33:01,080
because I was writing checks for my

761
00:32:58,230 --> 00:33:03,720
mother as opposed to I'm draining her

762
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:05,970
account<font color="#CCCCCC"> drying and again a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of banks</font>

763
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:09,000
have not sorted this out yet they are

764
00:33:05,970 --> 00:33:11,130
still thinking about only<font color="#E5E5E5"> about external</font>

765
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:13,380
attackers and they're looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> for those</font>

766
00:33:11,130 --> 00:33:15,660
patterns of fraud they're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at</font>

767
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:18,210
oh you know Wendy Mather has the same

768
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:19,890
last name has a delegation account if we

769
00:33:18,210 --> 00:33:22,380
set up the delegation account maybe this

770
00:33:19,890 --> 00:33:26,880
is okay well you know for<font color="#CCCCCC"> what she's</font>

771
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:29,640
doing how does revocation work if

772
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:32,190
they're no longer in a state where they

773
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:35,400
are able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to manage their own affairs how</font>

774
00:33:32,190 --> 00:33:37,170
can they revoke this we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have a</font>

775
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:39,060
good mechanism for that if it's out of

776
00:33:37,170 --> 00:33:40,980
bandits<font color="#CCCCCC"> to owners for somebody who's</font>

777
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:43,889
disabled especially if they're

778
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:45,660
cognitively impaired so they<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

779
00:33:43,890 --> 00:33:49,710
don't have any protections themselves if

780
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:51,810
they want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do that so that's these are</font>

781
00:33:49,710 --> 00:33:53,670
you know societal problems and this is

782
00:33:51,810 --> 00:33:57,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to get worse as the baby boomer</font>

783
00:33:53,670 --> 00:33:59,520
generation ages because right now

784
00:33:57,510 --> 00:34:00,750
everybody assumes that all these older

785
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:02,580
people they<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have accounts anyway</font>

786
00:34:00,750 --> 00:34:04,770
they don't know what they're doing but

787
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:06,570
everybody in the boomer generation you

788
00:34:04,770 --> 00:34:08,580
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> is living living</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a digital high</font>

789
00:34:06,570 --> 00:34:15,090
life you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are all living the digital high</font>

790
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:16,549
life but we need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk about this so I</font>

791
00:34:15,090 --> 00:34:20,700
hate presenting problems without

792
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:22,170
recommendations so I'm just going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

793
00:34:20,699 --> 00:34:23,699
throw a few out here but I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

794
00:34:22,170 --> 00:34:25,800
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be worth having a great discussion</font>

795
00:34:23,699 --> 00:34:28,730
if you guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> ran out of things to talk</font>

796
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:31,770
about out there<font color="#CCCCCC"> over the club met a</font>

797
00:34:28,730 --> 00:34:34,110
first of all wherever<font color="#E5E5E5"> possible in your</font>

798
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:37,889
life right now go get those pieces<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

799
00:34:34,110 --> 00:34:39,600
paper when I had the discussion with my

800
00:34:37,889 --> 00:34:42,810
attorney I went out you know after<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

801
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:44,969
and i got i gave a durable power of

802
00:34:42,810 --> 00:34:48,299
attorney to my husband and i said i

803
00:34:44,969 --> 00:34:49,589
wanted it with immediate effect and my

804
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:50,880
attorney setting sure you want to do

805
00:34:49,590 --> 00:34:51,360
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I said well if I'm going to</font>

806
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:53,790
trust

807
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:56,670
then when I'm incapacitated I'm going to

808
00:34:53,790 --> 00:35:01,350
trust him now so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I recommend you do that</font>

809
00:34:56,670 --> 00:35:04,170
because it was much easier once I got

810
00:35:01,350 --> 00:35:05,580
this for my father to say do you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font>

811
00:35:04,170 --> 00:35:08,430
to just take care<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this one thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

812
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:10,890
you today and he'd say yes and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> would</font>

813
00:35:08,430 --> 00:35:13,259
go<font color="#E5E5E5"> do that it wasn't a binary thing it</font>

814
00:35:10,890 --> 00:35:15,569
wasn't a you can't do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this anymore I'm</font>

815
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:17,220
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do this for you you know</font>

816
00:35:15,570 --> 00:35:19,220
because that's what they will resist do

817
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:21,779
you want me to just help you<font color="#CCCCCC"> out sure</font>

818
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:24,379
that's great that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> conversation you</font>

819
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:27,600
can be having and then just you know put

820
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:29,490
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> this way if you needed me to pay the</font>

821
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:31,350
bills for you how would I go about doing

822
00:35:29,490 --> 00:35:33,839
that should we just<font color="#E5E5E5"> set this up now just</font>

823
00:35:31,350 --> 00:35:35,610
in case<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this is a much better</font>

824
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:38,580
conversation than saying here's a legal

825
00:35:35,610 --> 00:35:43,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">document saying you're incapacitated you</font>

826
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:45,690
really don't want to do that so do this

827
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:48,540
in your<font color="#E5E5E5"> own life but what we really need</font>

828
00:35:45,690 --> 00:35:50,820
are standardization in online systems

829
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:54,570
around these sorts of rolls these

830
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:57,300
dynamic rolls temporary rolls personal

831
00:35:54,570 --> 00:36:00,360
proxies and delegates both for minors

832
00:35:57,300 --> 00:36:02,550
and for people in their majority who are

833
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:06,570
temporarily incapacitated who are

834
00:36:02,550 --> 00:36:09,950
periodically incapacitated or who are

<font color="#E5E5E5">suddenly and irrevocably incapacitated</font>

836
00:36:09,950 --> 00:36:16,350
we need better integration of digital

00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:19,230
and legal and physical world

838
00:36:16,350 --> 00:36:23,370
authentication we need ones that take

00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:26,160
better that<font color="#E5E5E5"> acknowledge better the very</font>

840
00:36:23,370 --> 00:36:28,759
complex issues around people who are

disadvantaged and have no transport

vouch for these<font color="#E5E5E5"> sorts of roles the same</font>

852
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:57,920
sort of thing that you would have inside

853
00:36:56,130 --> 00:37:00,930
of an enterprise except it has to be

854
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:03,090
something says yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know I know Bob I</font>

855
00:37:00,930 --> 00:37:04,618
know where he lives I know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that he has</font>

856
00:37:03,090 --> 00:37:08,680
these roles in the community

857
00:37:04,619 --> 00:37:11,020
and I know that this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is his son his son</font>

858
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:14,560
you know has<font color="#CCCCCC"> the authority to do these</font>

859
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:17,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">things on behalf of his father the son</font>

860
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:19,150
also has two minor children and has the

861
00:37:17,410 --> 00:37:21,129
right to do these<font color="#CCCCCC"> things online on their</font>

862
00:37:19,150 --> 00:37:25,540
account but it<font color="#E5E5E5"> needs to be better</font>

863
00:37:21,130 --> 00:37:27,070
coordinated and then in general we need

864
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:31,000
better<font color="#E5E5E5"> adaptation for all sorts</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

865
00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:33,490
disabilities not just visual impairment

866
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:37,300
for example but cognitive disabilities

867
00:37:33,490 --> 00:37:40,089
and we really need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to find</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a way to</font>

868
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:42,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">solve this in the digital world because</font>

otherwise<font color="#CCCCCC"> your disenfranchising people</font>

870
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:48,578
for no<font color="#CCCCCC"> reason other than you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

871
00:37:45,070 --> 00:37:50,290
have a high fever or you know they've

872
00:37:48,579 --> 00:37:57,099
been used to running their lives<font color="#E5E5E5"> but now</font>

873
00:37:50,290 --> 00:37:58,990
suddenly they can't and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> ultimately</font>

874
00:37:57,099 --> 00:38:00,849
if I had all the free time in the world

875
00:37:58,990 --> 00:38:02,319
I would be setting<font color="#E5E5E5"> up some sort of</font>

876
00:38:00,849 --> 00:38:06,820
service<font color="#CCCCCC"> that would help mediate these</font>

877
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:10,510
things help choose the right digital and

878
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:12,310
online solutions for people at different

879
00:38:10,510 --> 00:38:15,240
stages<font color="#E5E5E5"> of life different stages of</font>

880
00:38:12,310 --> 00:38:18,369
technical knowledge ability awareness

881
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:22,180
you know circumstances relationships and

882
00:38:18,369 --> 00:38:25,060
so on because<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody needs to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> help you</font>

883
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:27,868
know sort this out at assisted living

884
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:30,970
centers now sometimes they will have a

885
00:38:27,869 --> 00:38:33,250
consultant who comes in and shows these

886
00:38:30,970 --> 00:38:35,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">older folks how to use a computer which</font>

887
00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:38,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">is very nice but again it doesn't deal</font>

888
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:39,879
with a lot of the the complicated

889
00:38:38,470 --> 00:38:41,649
logistical things in their life

890
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:45,069
especially financial and legal

891
00:38:41,650 --> 00:38:47,470
transactions whenever I would have to

892
00:38:45,069 --> 00:38:49,990
check my parents into a rehab center for

893
00:38:47,470 --> 00:38:53,500
example if they had a fall there would

894
00:38:49,990 --> 00:38:55,540
be a stack of papers this high to admit

895
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:58,000
them and I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> end up signing them all</font>

896
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:59,710
because again whichever parent it was

897
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:02,230
was in no shape to sit there<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a chair</font>

898
00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:03,550
and sign so I would you know sign these

899
00:39:02,230 --> 00:39:05,829
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> over and over and over and over</font>

900
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:08,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">again it was the same if they had a fall</font>

901
00:39:05,829 --> 00:39:10,359
every month you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> or every three</font>

902
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:12,700
months it would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be going through that</font>

903
00:39:10,359 --> 00:39:15,190
again at the hospital<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the emergency</font>

904
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:17,169
room for the insurance you know all

905
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:17,750
these sorts of<font color="#CCCCCC"> things being able to</font>

906
00:39:17,170 --> 00:39:20,210
stream

907
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:22,340
Linus<font color="#E5E5E5"> and put this you know in a way</font>

908
00:39:20,210 --> 00:39:25,040
online that can be much<font color="#CCCCCC"> more easily</font>

909
00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:26,450
executed over and over and over and<font color="#E5E5E5"> over</font>

910
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:29,090
again is something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we desperately</font>

911
00:39:26,450 --> 00:39:30,680
need if I had all the time in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> world</font>

912
00:39:29,090 --> 00:39:33,650
I would set that up maybe somebody else

913
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:35,029
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be inspired to do that but I can</font>

914
00:39:33,650 --> 00:39:37,370
tell you that having this sort of

915
00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:45,110
digital concierge would be a really

916
00:39:37,370 --> 00:39:46,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">great thing so that's my speech and I'd</font>

917
00:39:45,110 --> 00:39:49,750
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to know if anybody has any comments</font>

918
00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:49,750
that they'd like to share with me
